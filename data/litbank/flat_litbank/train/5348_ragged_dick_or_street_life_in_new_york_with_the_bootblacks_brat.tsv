While	O
this	O
conversation	O
had	O
been	O
going	O
on	O
,	O
Dick	B-PER
had	O
got	O
up	O
.	O

His	B-FAC
bedchamber	I-FAC
had	O
been	O
a	B-FAC
wooden	I-FAC
box	I-FAC
half	I-FAC
full	I-FAC
of	I-FAC
straw	I-FAC
,	I-FAC
on	I-FAC
which	I-FAC
the	I-FAC
young	I-FAC
boot-black	I-FAC
had	I-FAC
reposed	I-FAC
his	I-FAC
weary	I-FAC
limbs	I-FAC
,	I-FAC
and	I-FAC
slept	I-FAC
as	I-FAC
soundly	I-FAC
as	I-FAC
if	I-FAC
it	I-FAC
had	I-FAC
been	I-FAC
a	I-FAC
bed	I-FAC
of	I-FAC
down	I-FAC
.	O

He	O
dumped	O
down	O
into	O
the	O
straw	O
without	O
taking	O
the	O
trouble	O
of	O
undressing	O
.	O

Getting	O
up	O
too	O
was	O
an	O
equally	O
short	O
process	O
.	O

He	O
jumped	O
out	O
of	O
the	B-FAC
box	I-FAC
,	O
shook	O
himself	O
,	O
picked	O
out	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
straws	O
that	O
had	O
found	O
their	O
way	O
into	O
rents	O
in	O
his	O
clothes	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
drawing	O
a	O
well-worn	O
cap	O
over	O
his	O
uncombed	O
locks	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
all	O
ready	O
for	O
the	O
business	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
.	O

Dick	B-PER
's	O
appearance	O
as	O
he	O
stood	O
beside	O
the	B-FAC
box	I-FAC
was	O
rather	O
peculiar	O
.	O

His	O
pants	O
were	O
torn	O
in	O
several	O
places	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
apparently	O
belonged	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
instance	O
to	O
a	B-PER
boy	I-PER
two	I-PER
sizes	I-PER
larger	I-PER
than	I-PER
himself	I-PER
.	O

He	O
wore	O
a	O
vest	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
buttons	O
of	O
which	O
were	O
gone	O
except	O
two	O
,	O
out	O
of	O
which	O
peeped	O
a	O
shirt	O
which	O
looked	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
worn	O
a	O
month	O
.	O

To	O
complete	O
his	O
costume	O
he	O
wore	O
a	O
coat	O
too	O
long	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
dating	O
back	O
,	O
if	O
one	O
might	O
judge	O
from	O
its	O
general	O
appearance	O
,	O
to	O
a	O
remote	O
antiquity	O
.	O

Washing	O
the	O
face	O
and	O
hands	O
is	O
usually	O
considered	O
proper	O
in	O
commencing	O
the	O
day	O
,	O
but	O
Dick	B-PER
was	O
above	O
such	O
refinement	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
no	O
particular	O
dislike	O
to	O
dirt	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
remove	O
several	O
dark	O
streaks	O
on	O
his	O
face	O
and	O
hands	O
.	O

But	O
in	O
spite	O
of	O
his	O
dirt	O
and	O
rags	O
there	O
was	O
something	O
about	O
Dick	B-PER
that	O
was	O
attractive	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
easy	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
clean	O
and	O
well	O
dressed	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
decidedly	O
good-looking	O
.	O

Some	B-PER
of	I-PER
his	I-PER
companions	I-PER
were	O
sly	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
faces	O
inspired	O
distrust	O
;	O
but	O
Dick	B-PER
had	O
a	O
frank	O
,	O
straight-forward	O
manner	O
that	O
made	O
him	O
a	O
favorite	O
.	O

Dick	B-PER
's	O
business	O
hours	O
had	O
commenced	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
no	O
office	B-FAC
to	O
open	O
.	O

His	B-FAC
little	I-FAC
blacking-box	I-FAC
was	O
ready	O
for	O
use	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
looked	O
sharply	O
in	O
the	O
faces	O
of	O
all	B-PER

Another	O
of	O
Dick	B-PER
's	O
faults	O
was	O
his	O
extravagance	O
.	O

Being	O
always	O
wide-awake	O
and	O
ready	O
for	O
business	O
,	O
he	O
earned	O
enough	O
to	O
have	O
supported	O
him	O
comfortably	O
and	O
respectably	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
not	O
a	B-PER
few	I-PER
young	I-PER
clerks	I-PER
who	O
employed	O
Dick	B-PER
from	O
time	O
to	O
time	O
in	O
his	O
professional	O
capacity	O
,	O
who	O
scarcely	O
earned	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
he	O
,	O
greatly	O
as	O
their	O
style	O
and	O
dress	O
exceeded	O
his	O
.	O

But	O
Dick	B-PER
was	O
careless	O
of	O
his	O
earnings	O
.	O

Where	O
they	O
went	O
he	O
could	O
hardly	O
have	O
told	O
himself	O
.	O

However	O
much	O
he	O
managed	O
to	O
earn	O
during	O
the	O
day	O
,	O
all	O
was	O
generally	O
spent	O
before	O
morning	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
fond	O
of	O
going	O
to	O
the	B-FAC
Old	I-FAC
Bowery	I-FAC
Theatre	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
to	O
Tony	B-FAC
Pastor	I-FAC
's	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
any	O
money	O
left	O
afterwards	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
invite	O
some	B-PER
of	I-PER
his	I-PER
friends	I-PER
in	O
somewhere	O
to	O
have	O
an	O
oyster-stew	O
;	O
so	O
it	O
seldom	O
happened	O
that	O
he	O
commenced	O
the	O
day	O
with	O
a	O
penny	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
am	O
sorry	O
to	O
add	O
that	O
Dick	B-PER
had	O
formed	O
the	O
habit	O
of	O
smoking	O
.	O

This	O
cost	O
him	O
considerable	O
,	O
for	O
Dick	B-PER
was	O
rather	O
fastidious	O
about	O
his	O
cigars	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
n't	O
smoke	O
the	O
cheapest	O
.	O

Besides	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
liberal	O
nature	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
generally	O
ready	O
to	O
treat	O
his	B-PER
companions	I-PER
.	O

But	O
of	O
course	O
the	O
expense	O
was	O
the	O
smallest	O
objection	O
.	O

No	B-PER
boy	I-PER
of	I-PER
fourteen	I-PER
can	O
smoke	O
without	O
being	O
affected	O
injuriously	O
.	O

Men	B-PER
are	O
frequently	O
injured	O
by	O
smoking	O
,	O
and	O
boys	B-PER
always	O
.	O

But	O
large	B-PER
numbers	I-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
newsboys	I-PER
and	I-PER
boot-blacks	I-PER
form	O
the	O
habit	O
.	O

Exposed	O
to	O
the	O
cold	O
and	O
wet	O
they	O
find	O
that	O
it	O
warms	O
them	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
self-indulgence	O
grows	O
upon	O
them	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
uncommon	O
to	O
see	O
a	B-PER
little	I-PER
boy	I-PER
,	O
too	O
young	O
to	O
be	O
out	O
of	O
his	B-PER
mother	I-PER
's	O
sight	O
,	O
smoking	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
apparent	O
satisfaction	O
of	O
a	B-PER
veteran	I-PER
smoker	I-PER
.	O

There	O
was	O
another	O
way	O
in	O
which	O
Dick	B-PER
sometimes	O
lost	O
money	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
a	B-FAC
noted	I-FAC
gambling-house	I-FAC
on	I-FAC
Baxter	I-FAC
Street	I-FAC
,	O
which	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
was	O
sometimes	O
crowded	O
with	O
these	B-PER
juvenile	I-PER
gamesters	I-PER
,	O
who	O
staked	O
their	O
hard	O
earnings	O
,	O
generally	O
losing	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
and	O
refreshing	O
themselves	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time	O
with	O
a	O
vile	O
mixture	O
of	O
liquor	O
at	O
two	O
cents	O
a	O
glass	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
Dick	B-PER
strayed	O
in	O
here	B-FAC
,	O
and	O
played	O
with	O
the	B-PER
rest	I-PER
.	O

I	O
have	O
mentioned	O
Dick	B-PER
's	O
faults	O
and	O
defects	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
want	O
it	O
understood	O
,	O
to	O
begin	O
with	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
consider	O
him	O
a	B-PER
model	I-PER
boy	I-PER
.	O

But	O
there	O
were	O
some	O
good	O
points	O
about	O
him	O
nevertheless	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
above	O
doing	O
anything	O
mean	O
or	O
dishonorable	O
.	O

He	O
would	O
not	O
steal	O
,	O
or	O
cheat	O
,	O
or	O
impose	O
upon	O
younger	B-PER
boys	I-PER
,	O
but	O
was	O
frank	O
and	O
straight-forward	O
,	O
manly	O
and	O
self-reliant	O
.	O

His	O
nature	O
was	O
a	O
noble	O
one	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
saved	O
him	O
from	O
all	O
mean	O
faults	O
.	O

I	O
hope	O
my	B-PER
young	I-PER
readers	I-PER
will	O
like	O
him	O
as	O
I	O
do	O
,	O
without	O
being	O
blind	O
to	O
his	O
faults	O
.	O

Perhaps	O
,	O
although	O
he	O
was	O
only	O
a	B-PER
boot-black	I-PER
,	O
they	O
may	O
find	O
something	O
in	O
him	O
to	O
imitate	O
