that	O
the	B-FAC

I	O

rapture	O
of	O
pure	O
delight	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
breath	O
of	O
spring	O
that	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
as	O
a	B-PER
child	I-PER
,	O
and	O
the	O
five	O
wasted	O
years	O
fell	O
from	O
me	O
like	O
a	O
cloak	O
,	O
and	O
the	B-LOC
world	I-LOC
was	O
full	O
of	O
hope	O

and	O
I	O
vowed	O
myself	O
then	O
and	O
there	O
to	O
nature	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
been	O
happy	O
ever	O
since	O

My	O
other	O
half	O
being	O
indulgent	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
some	O
faint	O
thought	O
perhaps	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
as	O
well	O
to	O
look	O
after	O
the	B-FAC
place	I-FAC
,	O
consented	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
it	O
at	O
any	O
rate	O
for	O
a	O
time	O
;	O
whereupon	O
followed	O
six	O
specially	O
blissful	O
weeks	O
from	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
April	O
into	O
June	O
,	O
during	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
here	B-FAC
alone	O
,	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
superintending	O
the	O
painting	O
and	O
papering	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
fact	O
only	O
going	O
into	O
the	B-FAC
house	I-FAC
when	O
the	B-PER
workmen	I-PER
had	O
gone	O
out	O
of	O
it	O

How	O
happy	O
I	O
was	O
!	O

I	O
do	O
n’t	O
remember	O
any	O
time	O
quite	O
so	O
perfect	O
since	O
the	O
days	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
too	O
little	O
to	O
do	O
lessons	O
and	O
was	O
turned	O
out	O
with	O
sugar	O
on	O
my	O
eleven	O
o’clock	O
bread	O
and	O
butter	O
on	O
to	O
a	B-FAC
lawn	I-FAC
closely	I-FAC
strewn	I-FAC
with	I-FAC
dandelions	I-FAC
and	I-FAC
daisies	I-FAC
.	O

The	O
sugar	O
on	O
the	O
bread	O
and	O
butter	O
has	O
lost	O
its	O
charm	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
love	O
the	O
dandelions	O
and	O
daisies	O
even	O
more	O
passionately	O
now	O
than	O
then	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
would	O
endure	O
to	O
see	O
them	O
all	O
mown	O
away	O
if	O
I	O
were	O
not	O
certain	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
day	O
or	O
two	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
pushing	O
up	O
their	O
little	O
faces	O
again	O
as	O
jauntily	O
as	O
ever	O
.	O

During	O
those	O
six	O
weeks	O
I	O
lived	O
in	O
a	O
world	O
of	O
dandelions	O
and	O
delights	O
.	O

The	O
dandelions	O
carpeted	O
the	O
three	O
lawns	O
,	O
--	O
they	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
lawns	O
,	O
but	O
have	O
long	O
since	O
blossomed	O
out	O
into	O
meadows	O
filled	O
with	O
every	O
sort	O
of	O
pretty	O
weed	O
,	O
--	O
and	O
under	O
and	O
among	O
the	O
groups	O
of	O
leafless	O
oaks	O
and	O
beeches	O
were	O
blue	O
hepaticas	O
,	O
white	O
anemones	O
,	O
violets	O
,	O
and	O
celandines	O
in	O
sheets	O

The	O
celandines	O
in	O
particular	O
delighted	O
me	O
with	O
their	O
clean	O
,	O
happy	O
brightness	O
,	O
so	O
beautifully	O
trim	O
and	O
newly	O
varnished	O
,	O
as	O
though	O
they	O
too	O
had	O
had	O
the	B-PER
painters	I-PER
at	O
work	O
on	O
them	O

Then	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
anemones	O
went	O
,	O
came	O
a	O
few	O
stray	O
periwinkles	O
and	O
Solomon	O
’s	O
Seal	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
birdcherries	O
blossomed	O
in	O
a	O
burst	O
.	O

And	O
then	O
,	O
before	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
got	O
used	O
to	O
the	O
joy	O
of	O
their	O
flowers	O
against	O

came	O
the	O
lilacs	O
--	O
masses	O
and	O
masses	O
of	O
them	O

in	O

with	O

and	O
trees	O
by	O
the	O
side	O
of	O

and	O
one	O
great	O
continuous	O
bank	O
of	O
them	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
long	O
right	O
past	O
the	O
west	O

of	O
the	B-FAC

away	O
down	O

as	O
one	O
could	O
see	O

shining	O

When	O
that	O

when	O

and	O
grateful	O

that	O
