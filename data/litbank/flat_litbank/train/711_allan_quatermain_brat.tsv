CHAPTER	O
I	O
THE	B-PER
CONSUL	I-PER
’S	O
YARN	O
A	O
week	O
had	O
passed	O
since	O
the	O
funeral	O
of	O
my	B-PER
poor	I-PER
boy	I-PER
Harry	B-PER
,	O
and	O
one	O
evening	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
my	B-FAC
room	I-FAC
walking	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
and	O
thinking	O
,	O
when	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
ring	O
at	O
the	O
outer	O
door	O
.	O

Going	O
down	O
the	B-FAC
steps	I-FAC
I	O
opened	O
it	O
myself	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
came	O
my	B-PER
old	I-PER
friends	I-PER
Sir	B-PER
Henry	I-PER
Curtis	I-PER
and	O
Captain	B-PER
John	I-PER
Good	I-PER
,	I-PER
RN	I-PER
.	O

They	O
entered	O
the	B-FAC
vestibule	I-FAC
and	O
sat	O
themselves	O
down	O
before	O
the	O
wide	O
hearth	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
I	O
remember	O
,	O
a	O
particularly	O
good	O
fire	O
of	O
logs	O
was	O
burning	O
.	O

‘	O
It	O
is	O
very	O
kind	O
of	O
you	O
to	O
come	O
round	O
,	O
’	O
I	O
said	O
by	O
way	O
of	O
making	O
a	O
remark	O
;	O
‘	O
it	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
heavy	O
walking	O
in	O
the	O
snow	O
.	O
’	O

They	O
said	O
nothing	O
,	O
but	O
Sir	B-PER
Henry	I-PER
slowly	O
filled	O
his	O
pipe	O
and	O
lit	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
burning	O
ember	O
.	O

As	O
he	O
leant	O
forward	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
the	O
fire	O
got	O
hold	O
of	O
a	O
gassy	O
bit	O
of	O
pine	O
and	O
flared	O
up	O
brightly	O
,	O
throwing	O
the	O
whole	O
scene	O
into	O
strong	O
relief	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
What	O
a	B-PER
splendid-looking	I-PER
man	I-PER
he	O
is	O
!	O

Calm	O
,	O
powerful	O
face	O
,	O
clear-cut	O
features	O
,	O
large	O
grey	O
eyes	O
,	O
yellow	O
beard	O
and	O
hair	O
--	O
altogether	O
a	B-PER
magnificent	I-PER
specimen	I-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
higher	I-PER
type	I-PER
of	I-PER
humanity	I-PER
.	O

Nor	O
did	O
his	O
form	O
belie	O
his	O
face	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
never	O
seen	O
wider	O
shoulders	O
or	O
a	O
deeper	O
chest	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
Sir	B-PER
Henry	I-PER
’s	O
girth	O
is	O
so	O
great	O
that	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
is	O
six	O
feet	O
two	O
high	O
,	O
he	O
does	O
not	O
strike	O
one	O
as	O
a	B-PER
tall	I-PER
man	I-PER
.	O

As	O
I	O
looked	O
at	O
him	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
thinking	O
what	O
a	O
curious	O
contrast	O
my	B-PER
little	I-PER
dried-up	I-PER
self	I-PER
presented	O
to	O
his	O
grand	O
face	O
and	O
form	O
.	O

Imagine	O
to	O
yourself	O
a	B-PER
small	I-PER
,	I-PER
withered	I-PER

yellow-faced	I-PER

brown	I-PER

,	I-PER
a	I-PER
head	I-PER
of	I-PER
grizzled	I-PER
hair	I-PER
cut	I-PER
short	I-PER
and	I-PER
standing	I-PER
up	I-PER
like	I-PER
a	I-PER
half-worn	I-PER

in	O
my	O
clothes	O
,	O
nine	O
stone	O
six	O
--	O
and	O
you	O
will	O
get	O
a	O
very	O
fair	O
idea	O
of	O
Allan	B-PER
Quatermain	I-PER
,	O
commonly	O
called	O
Hunter	B-PER
Quatermain	I-PER
,	O
or	O
by	O
the	B-PER
natives	I-PER
‘	O
Macumazahn	B-PER

fellow	I-PER

Then	O
there	O
was	O
Good	B-PER
,	O
who	O
is	O
not	O
like	O
either	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
being	O
short	O

I	O
say	O
stout	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
mild	O
term	O
;	O
I	O
regret	O
to	O
state	O
that	O
of	O
late	O
years	O
Good	B-PER
has	O
been	O
running	O
to	O
fat	O
in	O
a	O
most	O
disgraceful	O
way	O
.	O

Sir	B-PER
Henry	I-PER
tells	O
him	O
that	O
it	O
comes	O
from	O
idleness	O
and	O
over-feeding	O
,	O
and	O
Good	B-PER
does	O
not	O
like	O
it	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
can	O
not	O
deny	O
it	O
.	O

We	O
sat	O
for	O
a	O
while	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
got	O
a	O
match	O
and	O
lit	O
the	O
lamp	O
that	O
stood	O
ready	O
on	O
the	O
table	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
half-light	O
began	O
to	O
grow	O
dreary	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
apt	O
to	O
do	O
when	O
one	O
has	O
a	O
short	O
week	O
ago	O
buried	O
the	O
hope	O
of	O
one	O
’s	O
life	O
.	O

Next	O
,	O
I	O
opened	O
a	O
cupboard	O
in	O
the	O
wainscoting	O
and	O
got	O
a	O
bottle	O
of	O
whisky	O
and	O
some	O
tumblers	O
and	O
water	O
.	O

I	O
always	O
like	O
to	O
do	O
these	O
things	O
for	O
myself	O
:	O
it	O
is	O
irritating	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
have	O
somebody	B-PER
continually	O
at	O
my	O
elbow	O
,	O
as	O
though	O
I	O
were	O
an	B-PER
eighteen-month-old	I-PER
baby	I-PER
.	O

All	O
this	O
while	O
Curtis	B-PER
and	O
Good	B-PER
had	O
been	O
silent	O
,	O
feeling	O
,	O
I	O
suppose	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
could	O
do	O
me	O
any	O
good	O
,	O
and	O
content	O
to	O
give	O
me	O
the	O
comfort	O
of	O
their	O
presence	O
and	O
unspoken	O
sympathy	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
their	O
second	O
visit	O
since	O
the	O
funeral	O
.	O

And	O
it	O
is	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
_	O
presence	O
_	O
of	O
others	O
that	O
we	O
really	O
derive	O
support	O
in	O
our	O
dark	O
hours	O
of	O
grief	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
from	O
their	O
talk	O
,	O
which	O
often	O
only	O
serves	O
to	O
irritate	O
us	O
.	O

Before	O
a	O
bad	O
storm	O
the	O
game	O
always	O
herd	O
together	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
cease	O
their	O
calling	O

They	O
sat	O
and	O
smoked	O
and	O
drank	O
whisky	O
and	O
water	O

and	O
I	O
stood	O
by	O
the	O
fire	O

smoking	O

Sir	B-PER
