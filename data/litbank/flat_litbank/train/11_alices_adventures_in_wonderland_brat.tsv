CHAPTER	O
I.	O
Down	O
the	B-LOC
Rabbit-Hole	I-LOC
Alice	B-PER
was	O
beginning	O
to	O
get	O
very	O
tired	O
of	O
sitting	O
by	O
her	B-PER
sister	I-PER
on	O
the	B-LOC
bank	I-LOC
,	O
and	O
of	O
having	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
:	O
once	O
or	O
twice	O
she	O
had	O
peeped	O
into	O
the	O
book	O
her	B-PER
sister	I-PER
was	O
reading	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
had	O
no	O
pictures	O
or	O
conversations	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
‘	O
and	O
what	O
is	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
a	O
book	O
,	O
’	O
thought	O
Alice	B-PER
‘	O
without	O
pictures	O
or	O
conversations	O
?	O
’	O

So	O
she	O
was	O
considering	O
in	O
her	O
own	O
mind	O
(	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
she	O
could	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
hot	O
day	O
made	O
her	O
feel	O
very	O
sleepy	O
and	O
stupid	O
)	O
,	O
whether	O
the	O
pleasure	O
of	O
making	O
a	O
daisy-chain	O
would	O
be	O
worth	O
the	O
trouble	O
of	O
getting	O
up	O
and	O
picking	O
the	O
daisies	O
,	O
when	O
suddenly	O
a	B-PER
White	I-PER
Rabbit	I-PER
with	I-PER
pink	I-PER
eyes	I-PER
ran	O
close	O
by	O
her	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
nothing	O
so	O
VERY	O
remarkable	O
in	O
that	O
;	O
nor	O
did	O
Alice	B-PER
think	O
it	O
so	O
VERY	O
much	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
hear	O
the	B-PER
Rabbit	I-PER
say	O
to	O
itself	O
,	O
‘	O
Oh	O
dear	O
!	O

Oh	O
dear	O
!	O

I	O
shall	O
be	O
late	O
!	O
’	O

(	O
when	O
she	O
thought	O
it	O
over	O
afterwards	O
,	O
it	O
occurred	O
to	O
her	O
that	O
she	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
wondered	O
at	O
this	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
it	O
all	O
seemed	O
quite	O
natural	O
)	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
the	B-PER
Rabbit	I-PER
actually	O
TOOK	O
A	O
WATCH	O
OUT	O
OF	O
ITS	O
WAISTCOAT-POCKET	O
,	O
and	O
looked	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
hurried	O
on	O
,	O
Alice	B-PER
started	O
to	O
her	O
feet	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
flashed	O
across	O
her	O
mind	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
never	O
before	O
seen	O
a	B-PER
rabbit	I-PER
with	I-PER
either	I-PER
a	I-PER
waistcoat-pocket	I-PER
,	I-PER
or	I-PER
a	I-PER
watch	I-PER
to	I-PER
take	I-PER
out	I-PER
of	I-PER
it	I-PER
,	O
and	O
burning	O
with	O
curiosity	O
,	O
she	O
ran	O
across	O
the	B-LOC
field	I-LOC
after	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
fortunately	O
was	O
just	O
in	O
time	O
to	O
see	O
it	O
pop	O
down	O
a	B-LOC
large	I-LOC
rabbit-hole	I-LOC
under	I-LOC
the	I-LOC
hedge	I-LOC
.	O

In	O
another	O
moment	O
down	O
went	O
Alice	B-PER
after	O
it	O
,	O
never	O
once	O
considering	O
how	O
in	O
the	B-LOC
world	I-LOC
she	O
was	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
again	O
.	O

The	B-LOC
rabbit-hole	I-LOC
went	O
straight	O
on	O
like	O
a	B-FAC
tunnel	I-FAC
for	O
some	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
dipped	O
suddenly	O
down	O
,	O
so	O
suddenly	O
that	O
Alice	B-PER
had	O
not	O
a	O
moment	O
to	O
think	O
about	O
stopping	O
herself	O
before	O
she	O
found	O
herself	O
falling	O
down	O
a	B-FAC
very	I-FAC
deep	I-FAC
well	I-FAC
.	O

Either	O
the	B-FAC
well	I-FAC
was	O
very	O
deep	O
,	O
or	O
she	O
fell	O
very	O
slowly	O
,	O
for	O
she	O
had	O
plenty	O
of	O
time	O
as	O
she	O
went	O
down	O
to	O
look	O
about	O
her	O
and	O
to	O
wonder	O
what	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
happen	O
next	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
she	O
tried	O
to	O
look	O
down	O
and	O
make	O
out	O
what	O
she	O
was	O
coming	O
to	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
dark	O
to	O
see	O
anything	O
;	O
then	O
she	O
looked	O
at	O
the	O
sides	O
of	O
the	B-FAC
well	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
noticed	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
filled	O
with	O
cupboards	O
and	O
book-shelves	O
;	O
here	O
and	O
there	O
she	O
saw	O
maps	O
and	O
pictures	O
hung	O
upon	O
pegs	O
.	O

She	O
took	O
down	O
a	O
jar	O
from	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
shelves	O
as	O
she	O
passed	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
labelled	O
‘	O
ORANGE	O

’	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
her	O
great	O
disappointment	O
it	O
was	O
empty	O
:	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
like	O
to	O
drop	O
the	O
jar	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
killing	O
somebody	B-PER
,	O
so	O
managed	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
into	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
cupboards	O
as	O
she	O
fell	O
past	O
it	O

in	O
a	B-FAC
long	I-FAC

low	I-FAC

was	I-FAC

up	I-FAC

There	O

down	O

up	O

trying	O
every	O

she	O
walked	O
sadly	O
down	O
the	O

how	O

Suddenly	O
she	O
came	O
upon	O
a	O

Alice	B-PER

first	O

the	O

at	O

on	O
the	O

came	O
upon	O
a	O
low	O
curtain	O

behind	O
it	O
was	O
a	O

about	O
fifteen	O

the	O

in	O
the	O

to	O
her	O
great	O
delight	O
it	O
fitted	O

Alice	B-PER
opened	O
the	O
door	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
it	O
led	O
into	O
a	B-FAC
small	I-FAC
passage	I-FAC

not	I-FAC
much	I-FAC
larger	I-FAC
than	I-FAC
a	I-FAC
rat-hole	I-FAC

she	O
knelt	O
down	O

along	O

For	O
,	O
you	O
see	O
,	O
so	O
many	O
out-of-the-way	O
things	O
had	O
happened	O
lately	O
,	O
that	O
Alice	B-PER
had	O
begun	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
very	O
few	O
things	O
indeed	O
were	O
really	O
impossible	O

There	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
no	O
use	O
in	O
waiting	O
by	O
the	O
little	O
door	O
,	O
so	O
she	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
table	O
,	O
half	O
hoping	O
she	O
might	O
find	O
another	O
key	O
on	O
it	O

at	O
any	O

a	O

this	O

and	O
round	O
the	O
neck	O
of	O
the	O
bottle	O
was	O
a	O
paper	O
label	O

with	O
the	O
words	O
‘	O
DRINK	O
ME	O
’	O
beautifully	O
printed	O
on	O
it	O
in	O
large	O

It	O
was	O
all	O
very	O
well	O
to	O
say	O
‘	O
Drink	O
me	O
,	O
’	O
but	O
the	B-PER
wise	I-PER
little	I-PER
Alice	I-PER
was	O
not	O
going	O
to	O

THAT	O
in	O

‘	O
No	O

I	O

whether	O
it	O
’s	O
marked	O
“	O
poison	O

not	O
’	O
;	O
for	O
she	O
had	O
read	O
several	O
nice	O
little	O
histories	O
about	O
children	B-PER
who	I-PER
had	I-PER
got	I-PER
burnt	I-PER
,	I-PER
and	I-PER
eaten	I-PER
up	I-PER
by	I-PER
wild	I-PER
beasts	I-PER
and	I-PER
other	I-PER
unpleasant	I-PER
things	I-PER
,	O
all	O
because	O
they	O
WOULD	O
not	O
remember	O
the	O
simple	O
rules	O
their	B-PER
friends	I-PER
had	O
taught	O
them	O
:	O
such	O
as	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
red-hot	O
poker	O
will	O
burn	O
you	O
if	O
you	O
hold	O
it	O
too	O
long	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
cut	O
your	O
finger	O
VERY	O
deeply	O
with	O
a	O
knife	O
,	O
it	O
usually	O
bleeds	O
;	O
and	O
she	O
had	O
never	O
forgotten	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
drink	O
much	O
from	O
a	O
bottle	O
marked	O
‘	O
poison	O

’	O
it	O
is	O
almost	O

However	O
,	O
this	O
bottle	O
was	O
NOT	O
marked	O
‘	O
poison	O
,	O
’	O
so	O
Alice	B-PER
ventured	O
to	O
taste	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
finding	O
it	O
very	O
nice	O

(	O

‘	O
I	O

And	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
indeed	O
:	O
she	O
was	O
now	O
only	O
ten	O
inches	O
high	O

and	O
her	O
face	O
brightened	O
up	O
at	O
the	O

that	O

was	O
now	O
the	O
right	O

for	O
going	O
through	O
the	O
little	O
door	O
into	O
that	B-FAC

First	O

to	O
