This	O

several	O
years	O

than	O
Oak	B-PER
's	I-PER
grandfather	I-PER

had	O
the	O
peculiarity	O
of	O
going	O

and	O
he	O
escaped	O
any	O

with	O

It	O
may	O
be	O
mentioned	O
that	O
Oak	B-PER
's	O
fob	O
being	O
difficult	O
of	O
access	O
,	O
by	O
reason	O
of	O
its	O
somewhat	O
high	O
situation	O
in	O
the	O
waistband	O
of	O
his	O
trousers	O
(	O
which	O
also	O
lay	O
at	O
a	O
remote	O
height	O
under	O
his	O
waistcoat	O
)	O
,	O
the	O
watch	O
was	O
as	O
a	O
necessity	O
pulled	O
out	O
by	O
throwing	O
the	O
body	O
to	O
one	O
side	O
,	O
compressing	O
the	O
mouth	O
and	O
face	O
to	O
a	O
mere	O
mass	O
of	O
ruddy	O
flesh	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
exertion	O
,	O
and	O
drawing	O
up	O
the	O
watch	O
by	O
its	O
chain	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
bucket	O
from	O
a	O
well	O

But	O
some	B-PER
thoughtfull	I-PER
persons	I-PER
,	O
who	O
had	O
seen	O
him	O
walking	O
across	O
one	O
of	O
his	B-LOC
fields	I-LOC
on	O
a	O
certain	O
December	O
morning	O
--	O
sunny	O
and	O
exceedingly	O
mild	O
--	O
might	O
have	O
regarded	O
Gabriel	B-PER
Oak	I-PER
in	O
other	O
aspects	O
than	O
these	O
.	O

In	O
his	O
face	O
one	O
might	O
notice	O
that	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
hues	O
and	O
curves	O
of	O
youth	O
had	O
tarried	O
on	O
to	O
manhood	O
:	O
there	O
even	O
remained	O
in	O
his	O
remoter	O
crannies	O
some	O
relics	O
of	O
the	B-PER
boy	I-PER
.	O

His	O
height	O
and	O
breadth	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
sufficient	O
to	O
make	O
his	O
presence	O
imposing	O
,	O
had	O
they	O
been	O
exhibited	O
with	O
due	O
consideration	O
.	O

But	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
way	O
some	B-PER
men	I-PER
have	O
,	O
rural	O
and	O
urban	O
alike	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
the	O
mind	O
is	O
more	O
responsible	O
than	O
flesh	O
and	O
sinew	O
:	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
way	O
of	O
curtail	O
-	O
ing	O
their	O
dimensions	O
by	O
their	O
manner	O
of	O
showing	O
them	O
.	O

And	O
from	O
a	O
quiet	O
modesty	O
that	O
would	O
have	O
become	O
a	O
vestal	O
which	O
seemed	O
continually	O
to	O
impress	O
upon	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
great	O
claim	O
on	O
the	B-LOC
world	I-LOC

Oak	B-PER
walked	O
unassumingly	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
faintly	O
perceptible	O
bend	O

yet	O
distinct	O
from	O
a	O
bowing	O
of	O
the	O
shoulders	O

This	O
may	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
defect	O
in	O
an	B-PER
individual	I-PER
if	O
he	O
depends	O
for	O
his	O

more	O
upon	O
