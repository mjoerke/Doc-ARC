It	O
was	O
a	B-FAC
primitive	I-FAC
cottage	I-FAC
of	I-FAC
the	I-FAC
old	I-FAC
style	I-FAC
,	I-FAC
standing	I-FAC
in	I-FAC
a	I-FAC

The	B-FAC

quite	O
twelve	O

along	O
the	O

of	O
the	B-FAC
cottage	I-FAC
,	O
except	O

the	O
two	O
closed-in	O

one	O
a	B-FAC
bathroom	I-FAC
and	O
the	O

a	O

Being	O
raised	O
a	O
few	O
feet	O
above	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
the	B-FAC
veranda	I-FAC
was	O
enclosed	O
by	O
a	O
wooden	O
railing	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
and	O
the	O
supporting	O
posts	O
were	O
twined	O
with	O
creepers	O
that	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
planted	O
at	O

thirty	O
years	O

One	O
of	O
these	O

a	O
stephanotis	O
,	O
showed	O
masses	O
of	O
white	O
bloom	O
,	O
which	O
Joan	B-PER
Gildea	I-PER
casually	O
reflected	O
would	O
have	O
fetched	O
a	O
pretty	O
sum	O
in	O
Covent	B-FAC
Garden	I-FAC

and	O

joining	O
in	O
with	O
a	O
fine-growing	O
asparagus	O

formed	O
an	O

over	O
the	O

The	O
end	O
of	O
the	B-FAC
veranda	I-FAC
,	O
where	O
Mrs	B-PER
Gildea	I-PER
had	O
established	O
herself	O
with	O
her	O
type-writer	O

work	O
,	O
was	O
screened	O
by	O
a	O
thick-stemmed	O
grape-vine	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
a	O
dapple	O

The	O
roof	O
of	O
the	B-FAC
veranda	I-FAC
was	O
low	O

with	O

a	O

In	O

the	B-FAC

Against	O
the	O

fig	O
and	O
a	O
loquat	O
all	O
in	O
full	O

The	B-FAC
