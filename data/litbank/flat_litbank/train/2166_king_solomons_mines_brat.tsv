CHAPTER	O
I	O
I	O
MEET	O
SIR	B-PER
HENRY	I-PER
CURTIS	I-PER
It	O
is	O
a	O
curious	O
thing	O
that	O
at	O
my	O
age	O
--	O
fifty-five	O
last	O
birthday	O
--	O
I	O
should	O
find	O
myself	O
taking	O
up	O
a	O
pen	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
write	O
a	O
history	O
.	O

I	O
wonder	O
what	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
history	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
when	O
I	O
have	O
finished	O
it	O
,	O
if	O
ever	O
I	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
trip	O
!	O

I	O
have	O
done	O
a	O
good	O
many	O
things	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
,	O
which	O
seems	O
a	O
long	O
one	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
owing	O
to	O
my	O
having	O
begun	O
work	O
so	O
young	O
,	O
perhaps	O
.	O

At	O
an	O
age	O
when	O
other	B-PER
boys	I-PER
are	O
at	O
school	B-ORG
I	O
was	O
earning	O
my	O
living	O
as	O
a	B-PER
trader	I-PER
in	I-PER
the	I-PER
old	I-PER
Colony	I-PER
.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
trading	O
,	O
hunting	O
,	O
fighting	O
,	O
or	O
mining	O
ever	O
since	O
.	O

And	O
yet	O
it	O
is	O
only	O
eight	O
months	O
ago	O
that	O
I	O
made	O
my	O
pile	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
big	O
pile	O
now	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
got	O
it	O
--	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
yet	O
know	O
how	O
big	O
--	O
but	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
think	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
through	O
the	O
last	O
fifteen	O
or	O
sixteen	O
months	O
again	O
for	O
it	O
;	O
no	O
,	O
not	O
if	O
I	O
knew	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
come	O
out	O
safe	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
,	O
pile	O
and	O
all	O
.	O

But	O
then	O
I	O
am	O
a	B-PER
timid	I-PER
man	I-PER
,	O
and	O
dislike	O
violence	O
;	O
moreover	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
almost	O
sick	O
of	O
adventure	O
.	O

I	O
wonder	O
why	O
I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
write	O
this	O
book	O
:	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
in	O
my	O
line	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
a	B-PER
literary	I-PER
man	I-PER
,	O
though	O
very	O
devoted	O
to	O
the	O
Old	O
Testament	O
and	O
also	O
to	O
the	O
"	O
Ingoldsby	O
Legends	O
.	O
"	O

Let	O
me	O
try	O
to	O
set	O
down	O
my	O
reasons	O
,	O
just	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
I	O
have	O
any	O
.	O

First	O
reason	O
:	O
Because	O
Sir	B-PER
Henry	I-PER
Curtis	I-PER
and	O
Captain	B-PER
John	I-PER
Good	I-PER
asked	O
me	O
.	O

Second	O
reason	O
:	O
Because	O
I	O
am	O
laid	O
up	O
here	B-GPE
at	O
Durban	B-GPE
with	O
the	O
pain	O
in	O
my	O
left	O
leg	O
.	O

Ever	O
since	O
that	O
confounded	O
lion	O
got	O
hold	O
of	O
me	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
liable	O
to	O
this	O
trouble	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
rather	O
bad	O
just	O
now	O
,	O
it	O
makes	O
me	O
limp	O
more	O
than	O
ever	O
.	O

There	O
must	O
be	O
some	O
poison	O
in	O
a	O
lion	O
's	O
teeth	O
,	O
otherwise	O
how	O
is	O
it	O
that	O
when	O
your	O
wounds	O
are	O
healed	O
they	O
break	O
out	O
again	O
,	O
generally	O
,	O
mark	O
you	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
of	O
year	O
that	O
you	O
got	O
your	O
mauling	O
?	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
hard	O
thing	O
when	O
one	O
has	O
shot	O
sixty-five	O
lions	O
or	O
more	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
sixty-sixth	O
should	O
chew	O
your	O
leg	O
like	O
a	O
quid	O
of	O
tobacco	O
.	O

It	O
breaks	O
the	O
routine	O
of	O
the	O
thing	O
,	O
and	O
putting	O
other	O
considerations	O
aside	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
an	B-PER
orderly	I-PER
man	I-PER
and	O
do	O
n't	O
like	O
that	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
.	O

Third	O
reason	O
:	O
Because	O
I	O
want	O
my	B-PER
boy	I-PER
Harry	B-PER
,	I-PER
who	I-PER
is	I-PER
over	I-PER
there	I-PER
at	I-PER
the	I-PER
hospital	I-PER
in	I-PER
London	I-PER
studying	I-PER
to	I-PER
become	I-PER
a	I-PER
doctor	I-PER
,	O
to	O
have	O
something	O
to	O
amuse	O
him	O
and	O
keep	O
him	O
out	O
of	O
mischief	O
for	O
a	O
week	O
or	O
so	O
.	O

Hospital	B-ORG
work	O
must	O
sometimes	O
pall	O
and	O
grow	O
rather	O
dull	O
,	O
for	O
even	O
of	O
cutting	O
up	O
dead	O
bodies	O
there	O
may	O
come	O
satiety	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
this	O
history	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
dull	O
,	O
whatever	O
else	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
,	O
it	O
will	O
put	O
a	O
little	O
life	O
into	O
things	O
for	O
a	O
day	O
or	O
two	O
while	O
Harry	B-PER
is	O
reading	O
of	O
our	O
adventures	O
.	O

Fourth	O
reason	O
and	O
last	O
:	O
Because	O
I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
tell	O
the	O
strangest	O
story	O
that	O
I	O
remember	O
.	O

It	O
may	O
seem	O
a	O
queer	O
thing	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
especially	O
considering	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
no	B-PER
woman	I-PER
in	O
it	O
--	O
except	O
Foulata	B-PER
.	O

Stop	O
,	O
though	O
!	O

there	O
is	O
Gagaoola	B-PER
,	O
if	O
she	O
was	O
a	B-PER
woman	I-PER
,	O
and	O
not	O
a	B-PER
fiend	I-PER
.	O

But	O
she	O
was	O
a	O
hundred	O
at	O
least	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
not	O
marriageable	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
count	O
her	O
.	O

At	O
any	O
rate	O
,	O
I	O
can	O
safely	O
say	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
_	O
petticoat	O
_	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O
history	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
better	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
yoke	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
stiff	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
feel	O
as	O
though	O
I	O
were	O
bogged	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
axle	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
"	O
_	O
sutjes	O
,	O
sutjes	O
_	O
,	O
"	O
as	O
the	B-PER
Boers	I-PER
say	O
--	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
they	O
spell	O
it	O
--	O
softly	O
does	O
it	O
.	O

A	O
strong	O
team	O
will	O
come	O
through	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
too	O
poor	O
.	O

You	O
can	O
never	O
do	O
anything	O
with	O
poor	O
oxen	O
.	O

Now	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
start	O

I	O
,	O
Allan	B-PER

Gentleman	B-PER

make	O
oath	O
and	O
say	O
--	O
That	O
's	O
how	O
I	O
headed	O
my	O
deposition	O
before	O
the	B-PER
magistrate	I-PER
about	O
poor	O
Khiva	B-PER
's	O
and	O
Ventv√∂gel	B-PER
's	O
sad	O
deaths	O
;	O
but	O
somehow	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
seem	O
quite	O
the	O
right	O
way	O
to	O
begin	O
a	O
book	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
besides	O
,	O
am	O
I	O
a	B-PER
gentleman	I-PER
?	O

What	O
is	O
a	B-PER
gentleman	I-PER
?	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
quite	O
know	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
niggers	B-PER
--	O
no	O
,	O
I	O
will	O
scratch	O
out	O
that	O
word	O
"	O
niggers	B-PER
,	O
"	O
for	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
like	O
it	O

I	O
've	O
known	O
natives	B-PER
who	O
_	O
are	O
_	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
you	O
will	O
say	O
,	O
Harry	B-PER
,	O
my	B-PER
boy	I-PER
,	O
before	O
you	O
have	O
done	O
with	O
this	O
tale	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
known	O
mean	B-PER
whites	I-PER
with	I-PER
lots	I-PER
of	I-PER
money	I-PER
and	I-PER
fresh	I-PER
out	I-PER
from	I-PER
home	I-PER
,	O
too	O
,	O
who	O
_	O
are	O
not	O
_	O
.	O

At	O
any	O
rate	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
born	O
a	B-PER
gentleman	I-PER
,	O
though	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
nothing	O
but	O
a	B-PER
poor	I-PER
travelling	I-PER
trader	I-PER
and	I-PER
hunter	I-PER
all	O
my	O
life	O
.	O

Whether	O
I	O
have	O
remained	O
so	O
I	O
known	O
not	O
,	O
you	O
must	O
judge	O
of	O
that	O
.	O

Heaven	B-FAC
knows	O
I	O
've	O
tried	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
killed	O
many	B-PER
men	I-PER
in	O
my	O
time	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
slain	O
wantonly	O
or	O
stained	O
my	O
hand	O
in	O
innocent	O
blood	O
,	O
but	O
only	O
in	O
self-defence	O
.	O

The	B-PER
Almighty	I-PER
gave	O
us	O
our	O
lives	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
suppose	O
He	B-PER
meant	O
us	O
to	O
defend	O
them	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
I	O
have	O
always	O
acted	O
on	O
that	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
hope	O
it	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
brought	O
up	O
against	O
me	O
when	O
my	O
clock	O
strikes	O
.	O

There	O
,	O
there	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
a	B-LOC
cruel	I-LOC
and	I-LOC
a	I-LOC
wicked	I-LOC
world	I-LOC
,	O
and	O
for	O
a	B-PER
timid	I-PER
man	I-PER
I	O
have	O
been	O
mixed	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
fighting	O
.	O

I	O
can	O
not	O
tell	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
any	O
rate	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
stolen	O
,	O
though	O
once	O
I	O
cheated	O
a	B-PER
Kafir	I-PER
out	O
of	O
a	O
herd	O
of	O
cattle	O
.	O

But	O
then	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
me	O
a	O
dirty	O
turn	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
has	O
troubled	O
me	O
ever	O
since	O
into	O
the	O
bargain	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
eighteen	O
months	O
or	O
so	O
ago	O
since	O
first	O
I	O
met	O
Sir	B-PER
Henry	I-PER
Curtis	I-PER
and	O
Captain	B-PER
Good	I-PER
.	O

It	O
was	O
in	O
this	O
way	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
been	O
up	O
elephant	O
hunting	O
beyond	O
Bamangwato	B-GPE
,	O
and	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
bad	O
luck	O
.	O

Everything	O
went	O
wrong	O
that	O
trip	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
top	O
up	O
with	O
I	O
got	O
the	O
fever	O
badly	O
.	O

So	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
well	O
enough	O
I	O
trekked	O
down	O
to	O
the	B-FAC
Diamond	I-FAC
Fields	I-FAC
,	O
sold	O
such	O
ivory	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
together	O
with	O
my	O
wagon	O
and	O
oxen	O
,	O
discharged	O
my	B-PER
hunters	I-PER
,	O
and	O
took	O
the	O
post-cart	O
to	O
the	B-LOC
Cape	I-LOC
.	O

After	O
spending	O
a	O
week	O
in	O
Cape	B-GPE
Town	I-GPE
,	O
finding	O
that	O
they	O
overcharged	O
me	O
at	O
the	B-FAC
hotel	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
having	O
seen	O
everything	O
there	O
was	O
to	O
see	O
,	O
including	O
the	O
botanical	O
gardens	O
,	O
which	O
seem	O
to	O
me	O
likely	O
to	O
confer	O
a	O
great	O
benefit	O
on	O
the	B-GPE
country	I-GPE
,	O
and	O
the	B-FAC
new	I-FAC
Houses	I-FAC
of	I-FAC
Parliament	I-FAC
,	O
which	O
I	O
expect	O
will	O
do	O
nothing	O
of	O
the	O
sort	O
,	O
I	O
determined	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
Natal	B-GPE
by	O
the	O
_	O
Dunkeld	B-GPE
_	O
,	O
then	O
lying	O
at	O
the	O
docks	O
waiting	O
for	O
the	B-FAC
_	I-FAC
Edinburgh	I-FAC
Castle	I-FAC
_	I-FAC
due	O
in	O
from	O
England	B-GPE
.	O

I	O
took	O
my	O
berth	O
and	O
went	O
aboard	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
afternoon	O
the	B-PER
Natal	I-PER
passengers	I-PER
from	I-PER
the	I-PER
_	I-PER
Edinburgh	I-PER
Castle	I-PER
_	I-PER
transhipped	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
weighed	O
and	O
put	O
to	O
sea	B-LOC
.	O

Among	O
these	B-PER
passengers	I-PER
who	I-PER
came	I-PER
on	I-PER
board	I-PER
were	O
two	B-PER
who	I-PER
excited	I-PER
my	I-PER
curiosity	I-PER
.	O

One	O
,	O
a	B-PER
gentleman	I-PER
of	I-PER
about	I-PER
thirty	I-PER
,	O
was	O
perhaps	O
the	B-PER
biggest-chested	I-PER
and	I-PER
longest-armed	I-PER
man	I-PER
I	I-PER
ever	I-PER
saw	I-PER
.	O

He	O
had	O
yellow	O
hair	O
,	O
a	O
thick	O
yellow	O
beard	O
,	O
clear-cut	O
features	O
,	O
and	O
large	O
grey	O
eyes	O
set	O
deep	O
in	O
his	O
head	O
.	O

I	O
never	O
saw	O
a	B-PER
finer-looking	I-PER
man	I-PER
,	O
and	O
somehow	O
he	O
reminded	O
me	O
of	O
an	B-PER
ancient	I-PER
Dane	I-PER
.	O

Not	O
that	O
I	O
know	O
much	O
of	O
ancient	B-PER
Danes	I-PER
,	O
though	O
I	O
knew	O
a	B-PER
modern	I-PER
Dane	I-PER
who	I-PER
did	I-PER
me	I-PER
out	I-PER
of	I-PER
ten	I-PER
pounds	I-PER
;	O
but	O
I	O
remember	O
once	O
seeing	O
a	O
picture	O
of	O
some	B-PER
of	I-PER
those	I-PER
gentry	I-PER
,	O
who	O
,	O
I	O
take	O
it	O
,	O
were	O
a	B-PER
kind	I-PER
of	I-PER
white	I-PER
Zulus	I-PER
.	O

They	O
were	O
drinking	O
out	O
of	O
big	O
horns	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
long	O
hair	O
hung	O
down	O
their	O
backs	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
looked	O
at	O
my	B-PER
friend	I-PER
standing	I-PER
there	I-PER
by	I-PER
the	I-PER
companion-ladder	I-PER
,	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
only	O
let	O
his	O
grow	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
put	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
chain	O
shirts	O
on	O
to	O
his	O
great	O
shoulders	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
hold	O
of	O
a	O
battle-axe	O
and	O
a	O
horn	O
mug	O
,	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
sat	O
as	O
a	B-PER
model	I-PER
for	I-PER
that	I-PER
picture	I-PER
.	O

And	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
is	O
a	O

at	O

I	O
could	O

The	B-PER

who	I-PER
stood	I-PER

I	O
suspected	O
at	O
once	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
a	B-PER
naval	I-PER
officer	I-PER
;	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
why	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
difficult	O
to	O
mistake	O
a	B-PER

I	O
have	O
gone	O
shooting	O
trips	O
with	O
several	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
always	O
proved	O
themselves	O
the	B-PER
best	I-PER
and	I-PER
bravest	I-PER
and	I-PER
nicest	I-PER
fellows	I-PER
I	I-PER
ever	I-PER
met	I-PER

though	O
sadly	O

some	O

I	O
asked	O
a	O
page	O
or	O
two	O
back	O
,	O
what	O
is	O
a	B-PER
gentleman	I-PER
?	O

I	O
'll	O
answer	O
the	O
question	O
now	O
:	O
A	B-PER
Royal	I-PER
Naval	I-PER
officer	I-PER
is	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
general	O
sort	O
of	O
way	O

though	O
of	O
course	O
there	O
may	O
be	O
a	O
black	O
sheep	O
among	O
them	O
here	O
and	O
there	O
.	O

I	O
fancy	O
it	O
is	O
just	O
the	B-LOC
wide	I-LOC
seas	I-LOC
and	O
the	O
breath	O
of	O
God	B-PER
's	O
winds	O
that	O
wash	O
their	O
hearts	O
and	O
blow	O
the	O
bitterness	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
minds	O
and	O
make	O
them	O
what	O
men	B-PER
ought	O
to	O
be	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
to	O
return	O
,	O
I	O
proved	O
right	O
again	O
;	O
I	O
ascertained	O
that	O
the	B-PER
dark	I-PER
man	I-PER
_	O
was	O
_	O
a	B-PER
naval	I-PER
officer	I-PER
,	O
a	B-PER
lieutenant	I-PER
of	I-PER
thirty-one	I-PER
,	O
who	O
,	O
after	O
seventeen	O
years	O
'	O
service	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
turned	O
out	O
of	O
her	B-PER
Majesty	I-PER
's	O
employ	O
with	O
the	O
barren	O
honour	O
of	O
a	B-PER
commander	I-PER
's	O
rank	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
promoted	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
what	O
people	B-PER
who	I-PER
serve	I-PER
the	I-PER
Queen	I-PER
have	O
to	O
expect	O
:	O
to	O
be	O
shot	O
out	O
into	O
the	B-LOC
cold	I-LOC
world	I-LOC
to	O
find	O
a	O
living	O
just	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
beginning	O
really	O
to	O
understand	O
their	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
reach	O
the	O
prime	O
of	O
life	O

I	O
suppose	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
mind	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
for	O
my	O
own	O
part	O
I	O
had	O
rather	O
earn	O
my	O
bread	O
as	O
a	B-PER
hunter	I-PER

One	O

halfpence	O

The	B-PER

He	O

broad	O

of	O

and	O
rather	O
a	B-PER
curious	I-PER
man	I-PER
to	I-PER
look	I-PER
at	I-PER

He	O
was	O
so	O
very	O
neat	O
and	O
so	O
very	O
clean-shaved	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
always	O
wore	O
an	O

his	O

It	O
seemed	O
to	O
grow	O

for	O
it	O
had	O
no	O

he	O
never	O

it	O
out	O

At	O

I	O
thought	O
he	O

it	O

afterwards	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
this	O

He	O
