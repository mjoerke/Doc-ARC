The	B-FAC

is	I-FAC
impossible	I-FAC
to	I-FAC

and	O
it	O
was	O
probably	O
for	O
this	O

that	O
Mrs.	B-PER

insisted	O
on	O
her	B-PER

Ogden	B-PER

He	O

and	O
he	O
more	O
than	O

him	O

It	O
was	O

Mr.	B-PER

Silence	O
from	O

him	O

a	O

a	O

Mr.	B-PER

himself	O

but	O
he	O
liked	O
to	O
be	O

it	O
is	O
proof	O
of	O
his	O
pessimism	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
tried	O
the	B-FAC
library	I-FAC
first	O

To	O
his	O
depressed	O

it	O

seemed	O
hardly	O
possible	O

outside	O

He	O
could	O
hear	O
nothing	O

He	O
went	O
in	O

and	O
for	O
an	O
instant	O
experienced	O
that	O
ecstatic	O

which	O
only	O
comes	O

elderly	B-PER
gentlemen	I-PER
