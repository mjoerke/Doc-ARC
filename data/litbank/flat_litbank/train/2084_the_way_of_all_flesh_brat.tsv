CHAPTER	O
I	O
When	O
I	O
was	O
a	B-PER
small	I-PER
boy	I-PER
at	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
the	O
century	O
I	O
remember	O
an	B-PER
old	I-PER
man	I-PER
who	I-PER
wore	I-PER
knee-breeches	I-PER
and	I-PER
worsted	I-PER
stockings	I-PER
,	I-PER
and	I-PER
who	I-PER
used	I-PER
to	I-PER
hobble	I-PER
about	I-PER
the	I-PER
street	I-PER
of	I-PER
our	I-PER
village	I-PER
with	I-PER
the	I-PER
help	I-PER
of	I-PER
a	I-PER
stick	I-PER
.	O

He	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
getting	O
on	O
for	O
eighty	O
in	O
the	O
year	O
1807	O
,	O
earlier	O
than	O
which	O
date	O
I	O
suppose	O
I	O
can	O
hardly	O
remember	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
born	O
in	O
1802	O
.	O

A	O
few	O
white	O
locks	O
hung	O
about	O
his	O
ears	O
,	O
his	O
shoulders	O
were	O
bent	O
and	O
his	O
knees	O
feeble	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
still	O
hale	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
much	O
respected	O
in	O
our	B-GPE
little	I-GPE
world	I-GPE
of	I-GPE
Paleham	I-GPE
.	O

His	O
name	O
was	O
Pontifex	B-PER
.	O

His	B-PER
wife	I-PER
was	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
his	B-PER
master	I-PER
;	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
told	O
she	O
brought	O
him	O
a	O
little	O
money	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
can	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
much	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
a	B-PER
tall	I-PER
,	I-PER
square-shouldered	I-PER
person	I-PER
(	I-PER
I	I-PER
have	I-PER
heard	I-PER
my	I-PER
father	I-PER
call	I-PER
her	I-PER
a	I-PER
Gothic	I-PER
woman	I-PER
)	I-PER
who	I-PER
had	I-PER
insisted	I-PER
on	I-PER
being	I-PER
married	I-PER
to	I-PER
Mr	I-PER
Pontifex	I-PER
when	I-PER
he	I-PER
was	I-PER
young	I-PER
and	I-PER
too	I-PER
good-natured	I-PER
to	I-PER
say	I-PER
nay	I-PER
to	I-PER
any	I-PER
woman	I-PER
who	I-PER
wooed	I-PER
him	I-PER
.	O

The	B-PER
pair	I-PER
had	O
lived	O
not	O
unhappily	O
together	O
,	O
for	O
Mr	B-PER
Pontifex	I-PER
's	O
temper	O
was	O
easy	O
and	O
he	O
soon	O
learned	O
to	O
bow	O
before	O
his	B-PER
wife	I-PER
's	O
more	O
stormy	O
moods	O
.	O

Mr	B-PER
Pontifex	I-PER
was	O
a	B-PER
carpenter	I-PER
by	I-PER
trade	I-PER
;	O
he	O
was	O
also	O
at	O
one	O
time	O
parish	B-PER
clerk	I-PER
;	O
when	O
I	O
remember	O
him	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
so	O
far	O
risen	O
in	O
life	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
no	O
longer	O
compelled	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
his	O
own	O
hands	O
.	O

In	O
his	O
earlier	O
days	O
he	O
had	O
taught	O
himself	O
to	O
draw	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
say	O
he	O
drew	O
well	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
surprising	O
he	O
should	O
draw	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
he	O
did	O
.	O

My	B-PER
father	I-PER
,	I-PER
who	I-PER
took	I-PER
the	I-PER
living	I-PER
of	I-PER
Paleham	I-PER
about	I-PER
the	I-PER
year	I-PER
1797	I-PER
,	O
became	O
possessed	O
of	O
a	O
good	O
many	O
of	O
old	B-PER
Mr	I-PER
Pontifex	I-PER
's	O
drawings	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
always	O
of	O
local	O
subjects	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
unaffectedly	O
painstaking	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
passed	O
for	O
the	O
work	O
of	O
some	B-PER
good	I-PER
early	I-PER
master	I-PER
.	O

I	O
remember	O
them	O
as	O
hanging	O
up	O
framed	O
and	O
glazed	O
in	O
the	O
study	O
at	O
the	B-FAC
Rectory	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
tinted	O
,	O
as	O
all	O
else	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
room	I-FAC
was	O
tinted	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
green	O
reflected	O
from	O
the	O
fringe	O
of	O
ivy	O
leaves	O
that	O
grew	O
around	O
the	O
windows	O
.	O

I	O
wonder	O
how	O
they	O
will	O
actually	O
cease	O
and	O
come	O
to	O
an	O
end	O
as	O
drawings	O
,	O
and	O
into	O
what	O
new	O
phases	O
of	O
being	O
they	O
will	O
then	O
enter	O
.	O

Not	O
content	O
with	O
being	O
an	B-PER
artist	I-PER
,	O
Mr	B-PER
Pontifex	I-PER
must	O
needs	O
also	O
be	O
a	B-PER
musician	I-PER
.	O

He	O
built	O
the	O
organ	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
church	I-FAC
with	O
his	O
own	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
smaller	O
one	O
which	O
he	O
kept	O
in	O
his	B-FAC
own	I-FAC
house	I-FAC
.	O

He	O
could	O
play	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
draw	O
,	O
not	O
very	O
well	O
according	O
to	O
professional	O
standards	O
,	O
but	O
much	O
better	O
than	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
expected	O
.	O

I	O
myself	O
showed	O
a	O
taste	O
for	O
music	O
at	O
an	O
early	O
age	O
,	O
and	O
old	B-PER
Mr	I-PER
Pontifex	I-PER
on	O
finding	O
it	O
out	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
soon	O
did	O
,	O
became	O
partial	O
to	O
me	O
in	O
consequence	O
.	O

It	O
may	O
be	O
thought	O
that	O
with	O
so	O
many	O
irons	O
in	O
the	O
fire	O
he	O
could	O
hardly	O
be	O
a	B-PER
very	I-PER
thriving	I-PER
man	I-PER
,	O
but	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
case	O
.	O

His	B-PER
father	I-PER
had	O
been	O
a	B-PER
day	I-PER
labourer	I-PER
,	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
himself	O
begun	O
life	O
with	O
no	O
other	O
capital	O
than	O
his	O
good	O
sense	O
and	O
good	O
constitution	O
;	O
now	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
goodly	O
show	O
of	O
timber	O
about	O
his	B-FAC
yard	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
a	O
look	O
of	O
solid	O
comfort	O
over	O
his	B-FAC
whole	I-FAC
establishment	I-FAC
.	O

Towards	O
the	O
close	O
of	O
the	O
eighteenth	O
century	O
and	O
not	O
long	O
before	O
my	B-PER
father	I-PER
came	O
to	O
Paleham	B-GPE
,	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
a	B-FAC
farm	I-FAC
of	I-FAC
about	I-FAC
ninety	I-FAC
acres	I-FAC
,	O
thus	O
making	O
a	O
considerable	O
rise	O
in	O
life	O
.	O

Along	O
with	O
the	B-FAC
farm	I-FAC
there	O
went	O
an	B-FAC
old-fashioned	I-FAC
but	I-FAC
comfortable	I-FAC
house	I-FAC
with	I-FAC
a	I-FAC
charming	I-FAC
garden	I-FAC
and	I-FAC
an	I-FAC
orchard	I-FAC
.	O

The	B-PER
carpenter	I-PER
's	O
business	O
was	O
now	O
carried	O
on	O
in	O
one	B-FAC
of	I-FAC
the	I-FAC
outhouses	I-FAC
that	I-FAC
had	I-FAC
once	I-FAC
been	I-FAC
part	I-FAC
of	I-FAC
some	I-FAC
conventual	I-FAC
buildings	I-FAC
,	O
the	O
remains	O
of	O
which	O
could	O
be	O
seen	O
in	O
what	O
was	O
called	O
the	B-FAC
Abbey	I-FAC
Close	I-FAC

The	B-FAC
house	I-FAC
itself	I-FAC
,	I-FAC
embosomed	I-FAC
in	I-FAC
honeysuckles	I-FAC
and	I-FAC
creeping	I-FAC
roses	I-FAC
,	O
was	O
an	B-FAC
ornament	I-FAC
to	I-FAC
the	I-FAC
whole	I-FAC
village	I-FAC
,	O
nor	O
were	O
its	O

its	O

Mrs	B-PER

I	O

whatever	O
Mr	B-PER

up	O

we	O
had	O
no	O
cause	O

and	O
then	O
Mr	B-PER
Pontifex	I-PER
would	O
play	O

us	O
upon	O
the	O

we	O
would	O
stand	O
round	O
him	O

of	I-PER

our	I-PER

Mrs	B-PER
Pontifex	I-PER
had	O
no	O

at	O

I	O
can	O
call	O

no	O

her	B-PER

had	O
plenty	O

in	O
him	O

though	O
few	O
would	O

guessed	O
it	O
from	O

I	O
remember	O
my	B-PER

me	O
down	O

I	O
