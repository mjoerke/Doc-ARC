As	O

Millie	B-PER

Although	O

she	O
was	O
surprised	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
her	B-PER
visitor	I-PER
still	O
wore	O
his	O
hat	O
and	O
coat	O
,	O
standing	O
with	O
his	O
back	O
to	O
her	O

staring	O
out	O
of	O
the	O

at	O
the	O
falling	O
snow	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
yard	I-FAC

His	O
gloved	O

were	O
clasped	O
behind	O
him	O

and	O
he	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
lost	O
in	O

She	O
noticed	O
that	O
the	O
melting	O
snow	O
that	O
still	O
sprinkled	O
his	O
shoulders	O
dripped	O
upon	O
her	O

"	O
Can	O

him	O

was	O
about	O
to	O
repeat	O
her	O

He	O
turned	O
his	O

and	O
had	O
a	O
bush	O

over	O
his	O

that	O
completely	O

his	O

turned	O
his	O

away	O
from	O
her	O
again	O

and	O
Mrs.	B-PER

feeling	O
that	O
her	O

were	O
ill-timed	O

laid	O

in	O
a	O

When	O
she	O

he	O

Millie	B-PER
a	O

She	O

She	O
rapped	O

entered	O
promptly	O

As	O
she	O
did	O
so	O
her	B-PER
visitor	I-PER
moved	O
quickly	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
she	O
got	O
but	O
a	O
glimpse	O
of	O
a	O

behind	O

It	O
would	O

down	O

she	O
noticed	O
the	O

taken	O
off	O

over	O

that	O
brooked	O

"	O
Leave	O

"	O
said	O
her	B-PER
visitor	I-PER
,	O
in	O
a	O
muffled	O
voice	O
,	O
and	O
turning	O
she	O
saw	O
he	O
had	O
raised	O
his	O
head	O
and	O
was	O
sitting	O
and	O
looking	O
at	O
her	O
.	O

For	O
a	O
moment	O
she	O
stood	O
gaping	O
at	O
him	O
,	O
too	O
surprised	O
to	O
speak	O
.	O

He	O
held	O
a	O
white	O
cloth	O
--	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
serviette	O
he	O
had	O
brought	O
with	O
him	O
--	O
over	O
the	O
lower	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
face	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
his	O
mouth	O
and	O
jaws	O
were	O
completely	O
hidden	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
his	O
muffled	O
voice	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
that	O
which	O
startled	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Hall	I-PER
.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
all	O
his	O
forehead	O
above	O
his	O
blue	O
glasses	O
was	O
covered	O
by	O
a	O
white	O
bandage	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
another	O
covered	O
his	O
ears	O
,	O
leaving	O
not	O
a	O
scrap	O
of	O
his	O
face	O
exposed	O
excepting	O
only	O
his	O
pink	O
,	O
peaked	O
nose	O

It	O
was	O
bright	O
,	O
pink	O
,	O
and	O
shiny	O
just	O
as	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
at	O
first	O
.	O

He	O
wore	O
a	O
dark-brown	O
velvet	O
jacket	O
with	O
a	O
high	O
,	O
black	O
,	O
linen-lined	O
collar	O
turned	O
up	O
about	O
his	O
neck	O

The	O
thick	O
black	O
hair	O
,	O
escaping	O
as	O
it	O
could	O
below	O
and	O
between	O
the	O
cross	O
bandages	O
,	O
projected	O
in	O
curious	O
tails	O
and	O
horns	O
,	O
giving	O
him	O
the	O
strangest	O
appearance	O
conceivable	O
.	O

This	O
muffled	O
and	O
bandaged	O
head	O
was	O
so	O
unlike	O
what	O
she	O
had	O
anticipated	O
,	O
that	O
for	O
a	O
moment	O
she	O
was	O
rigid	O

He	O
did	O
not	O
remove	O
the	O
serviette	O

but	O
remained	O
holding	O
it	O

as	O
she	O
saw	O
now	O

with	O
a	O
brown	O
gloved	O

blue	O

said	O

speaking	O
very	O
distinctly	O
through	O
the	O
white	O

Her	O
nerves	O
began	O
to	O
recover	O
from	O
the	O
shock	O

had	O
received	O

She	O
placed	O

his	O

She	O
shivered	O
a	O
little	O
as	O
she	O
closed	O
the	O
door	O
behind	O
her	O

her	O

The	B-PER
visitor	I-PER
sat	O

listened	O
to	O
her	O
retreating	O

He	O
glanced	O
inquiringly	O
at	O

window	O

removed	O
his	O
