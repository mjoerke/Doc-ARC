Night	O
after	O
night	O
I	O
had	O
passed	O
the	B-FAC
house	I-FAC
(	O
it	O
was	O
vacation	O

)	O
and	O
studied	O
the	O
lighted	O
square	O
of	O
window	O

and	O
night	O
after	O
night	O
I	O
had	O
found	O
it	O
lighted	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
way	O
,	O
faintly	O
and	O
evenly	O
.	O

If	O
he	O
was	O
dead	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
see	O
the	O
reflection	O
of	O
candles	O
on	O
the	O
darkened	O
blind	O
for	O
I	O
knew	O
that	O
two	O
candles	O
must	O
be	O
set	O
at	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
a	B-PER
corpse	I-PER

He	O
had	O
often	O
said	O
to	O
me	O
:	O
“	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
long	O
for	O
this	B-LOC
world	I-LOC
,	O
”	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
thought	O
his	O
words	O
idle	O

Now	O
I	O
knew	O
they	O
were	O
true	O
.	O

Every	O
night	O
as	O
I	O
gazed	O
up	O
at	O
the	O
window	O
I	O
said	O
softly	O
to	O
myself	O
the	O
word	O
paralysis	O
.	O

It	O
had	O
always	O
sounded	O
strangely	O
in	O
my	O
ears	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
word	O
gnomon	O
in	O
the	O
Euclid	B-PER
and	O
the	O
word	O
simony	O
in	O
the	O
Catechism	O
.	O

But	O
now	O
it	O
sounded	O
to	O
me	O
like	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
some	B-PER
maleficent	I-PER
and	I-PER
sinful	I-PER
being	I-PER
.	O

It	O
filled	O
me	O
with	O
fear	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
I	O
longed	O
to	O
be	O
nearer	O
to	O
it	O
and	O
to	O
look	O
upon	O
its	O
deadly	O
work	O

Old	B-PER

My	B-PER

I	O
puzzled	O

In	O
the	O
dark	O
of	O
my	B-FAC

again	O
the	O

drew	O

But	O
the	O
grey	O
face	O
still	O
followed	O
me	O

It	O
murmured	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
understood	O
that	O

there	O
again	O
I	O

it	O

It	O
began	O
to	O
confess	O

me	O
in	O
a	O

I	O
wondered	O
why	O
it	O

continually	O

why	O
the	O
lips	O
were	O
so	O
moist	O
with	O

then	O
I	O
remembered	O
that	O
it	O

I	O
felt	O
that	O
I	O

feebly	O
as	O

The	O
next	O

down	O

look	O
at	O
the	B-FAC

the	B-FAC
little	I-FAC

find	O
him	O

his	O
arm-chair	O
by	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
nearly	O
smothered	O
in	O
his	O
great-coat	O

Perhaps	O
my	B-PER
aunt	I-PER
would	O
have	O
given	O
me	O
a	O
packet	O
of	O
High	O
Toast	O
for	O
him	O
and	O
this	O
present	O
would	O
have	O
roused	O
him	O
from	O
his	O
stupefied	O
doze	O

It	O
was	O
always	O
I	O
who	O
emptied	O
the	O
packet	O
into	O
his	O
black	O
snuff-box	O
for	O
his	O
hands	O
trembled	O
too	O
much	O
to	O
allow	O
him	O
to	O
do	O
this	O
without	O
spilling	O
half	O
the	O
snuff	O
about	O
the	O
floor	O

Even	O
as	O
he	O
raised	O
his	O
large	O
trembling	O
hand	O
to	O
his	O
nose	O
little	O
clouds	O

smoke	O
dribbled	O
through	O

over	O

It	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
these	O
constant	O
showers	O
of	O
snuff	O
which	O
gave	O

ancient	O

their	O
green	O

look	O
for	O
the	O
red	O
handkerchief	O

with	O
the	O
snuff-stains	O
of	O
a	O

with	O
which	O
he	O
tried	O
to	O
brush	O
away	O
the	O
fallen	O
grains	O
,	O
was	O
quite	O
inefficacious	O

I	O
wished	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
and	O
look	O
at	O
him	O
but	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
courage	O
to	O
knock	O

I	O
walked	O
away	O
slowly	O
along	O
the	B-FAC
sunny	I-FAC
side	I-FAC
of	I-FAC
the	I-FAC
street	I-FAC
,	O
reading	O
all	O
the	O
theatrical	O
advertisements	O
in	O
the	O
shop-windows	O
as	O
I	O
went	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
it	O
strange	O
that	O
neither	O
I	O
nor	O
the	O
day	O
seemed	O
in	O
a	O
mourning	O
mood	O
and	O
I	O
felt	O
even	O
annoyed	O
at	O
discovering	O
in	O
myself	O
a	O
sensation	O
of	O
freedom	O
as	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
freed	O
from	O
something	O
by	O
his	O
death	O
.	O

I	O
wondered	O
at	O
this	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
my	B-PER
uncle	I-PER
had	O
said	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
taught	O
me	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
studied	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
Irish	I-FAC
college	I-FAC
in	I-FAC
Rome	I-FAC
and	O
he	O
had	O
taught	O
me	O
to	O
pronounce	O
Latin	O
properly	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
told	O
me	O
stories	O
about	O
the	B-FAC
catacombs	I-FAC
and	O
about	O
Napoleon	B-PER
Bonaparte	I-PER
,	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
explained	O
to	O
me	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
the	O
different	O
ceremonies	O
of	O
the	O
Mass	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
different	O
vestments	O
worn	O
by	O
the	B-PER
priest	I-PER
.	O

Sometimes	O
he	O
had	O
amused	O
himself	O
by	O
putting	O
difficult	O
questions	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
asking	O
me	O
what	O
one	O
should	O
do	O
in	O
certain	O
circumstances	O
or	O
whether	O
such	O
and	O
such	O
sins	O
were	O
mortal	O
or	O
venial	O
or	O
only	O
imperfections	O

His	O
questions	O
showed	O
me	O
how	O
complex	O
and	O
mysterious	O
were	O
certain	O
institutions	O
of	O
the	B-ORG
Church	I-ORG
which	O
I	O
had	O
always	O
regarded	O
as	O
the	O
simplest	O
acts	O
.	O

The	O
duties	O
of	O
the	B-PER
priest	I-PER
towards	O
the	O
Eucharist	O
and	O
towards	O
the	O
secrecy	O
of	O
the	O
confessional	O
seemed	O
so	O
grave	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
wondered	O
how	O
anybody	B-PER
had	O
ever	O
found	O
in	O
himself	O
the	O
courage	O
to	O
undertake	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
surprised	O
when	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
the	B-PER
fathers	I-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
Church	I-PER
had	O
written	O
books	O
as	O
thick	O
as	O
the	B-ORG
Post	I-ORG
Office	I-ORG
Directory	O
and	O
as	O
closely	O
printed	O
as	O
the	O
law	O
notices	O
in	O
the	O
newspaper	O
,	O
elucidating	O
all	O
these	O
intricate	O
questions	O
.	O

Often	O
when	O
I	O
thought	O
of	O
this	O
I	O
could	O
make	O
no	O
answer	O
or	O
only	O
a	O
very	O
foolish	O
and	O
halting	O
one	O
upon	O
which	O
he	O
used	O
to	O
smile	O
and	O
nod	O
his	O
head	O
twice	O
or	O
thrice	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
he	O
used	O
to	O
put	O
me	O
through	O
the	O
responses	O
of	O
the	O
Mass	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
made	O
me	O
learn	O
by	O
heart	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
pattered	O
,	O
he	O
used	O
to	O
smile	O
pensively	O
and	O
nod	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
pushing	O
huge	O
pinches	O
of	O
snuff	O
up	O
each	O
nostril	O
alternately	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
smiled	O
he	O
used	O
to	O
uncover	O
his	O
big	O
discoloured	O
teeth	O
and	O
let	O
his	O
tongue	O
lie	O
upon	O
his	O
lower	O
lip	O
—	O
a	O
habit	O
which	O
had	O
made	O
me	O
feel	O
uneasy	O
in	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
our	O
acquaintance	O
before	O
I	O
knew	O
him	O
well	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
walked	O
along	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
I	O
remembered	O
old	B-PER
Cotter	I-PER
’s	O
words	O
and	O
tried	O
to	O
remember	O
what	O
had	O
happened	O
afterwards	O
in	O
the	O
dream	O
.	O

I	O
remembered	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
noticed	O
long	O
velvet	O
curtains	O
and	O
a	O
swinging	O
lamp	O
of	O
antique	O
fashion	O
.	O

I	O
felt	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
very	O
far	O
away	O
,	O
in	O
some	B-GPE
land	I-GPE
where	I-GPE
the	I-GPE
customs	I-GPE
were	I-GPE
strange	I-GPE
—	O
in	O
Persia	B-GPE
,	O
I	O
thought	O
...	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
remember	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
dream	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
my	B-PER
aunt	I-PER
took	O
me	O
with	O
her	O
to	O
visit	O
the	B-FAC
house	I-FAC
of	I-FAC
mourning	I-FAC
.	O

It	O
was	O
after	O
sunset	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
window-panes	O
of	O
the	B-FAC
houses	I-FAC
that	I-FAC
looked	I-FAC
to	I-FAC
the	I-FAC
west	I-FAC
reflected	O
the	O
tawny	O
gold	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
bank	O
of	O
clouds	O
.	O

Nannie	B-PER
received	O
us	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
hall	I-FAC
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
unseemly	O
to	O
have	O
shouted	O
at	O
her	O
,	O
my	B-PER
aunt	I-PER
shook	O
hands	O
with	O
her	O
for	O
all	O
.	O

The	B-PER
old	I-PER
woman	I-PER
pointed	O
upwards	O
interrogatively	O
and	O
,	O
on	O
my	B-PER
aunt	I-PER
’s	O
nodding	O
,	O
proceeded	O
to	O
toil	O
up	O
the	B-FAC
narrow	I-FAC
staircase	I-FAC
before	I-FAC
us	I-FAC
,	O
her	O
bowed	O
head	O
being	O
scarcely	O
above	O
the	O
level	O
of	O
the	O
banister-rail	O
.	O

At	O
the	B-FAC
first	I-FAC
landing	I-FAC
she	O
stopped	O
and	O
beckoned	O
us	O
forward	O
encouragingly	O
towards	O
the	O
open	O
door	O
of	O
the	B-FAC
dead-room	I-FAC
.	O

My	B-PER
aunt	I-PER
went	O
in	O
and	O
the	B-PER
old	I-PER
woman	I-PER
,	O
seeing	O
that	O
I	O
hesitated	O
to	O
enter	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
beckon	O
to	O
me	O
again	O
repeatedly	O
with	O
