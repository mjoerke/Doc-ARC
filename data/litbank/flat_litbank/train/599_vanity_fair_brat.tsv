Miss	B-PER

off	O

Honest	B-PER

But	O
why	O

It	O

But	O
as	O
we	O
are	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
Amelia	B-PER
,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
harm	O
in	O
saying	O

at	O
the	O
outset	O
of	O
our	O
acquaintance	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
a	B-PER
dear	I-PER
little	I-PER

and	O
a	O
great	O
mercy	O
it	O

both	O
in	O

in	O
novels	O

which	O
(	O

the	O

villains	B-PER

the	I-PER
most	I-PER
sombre	I-PER
sort	I-PER

that	O
we	O

a	I-PER

As	O

there	O
is	O
no	O
need	O
to	O
describe	O
her	B-PER

indeed	O
I	O
am	O
afraid	O
that	O
her	O

otherwise	O

and	O
her	O
cheeks	O
a	O
great	O

too	O
round	O

red	O
for	O
a	B-PER
heroine	I-PER
;	O
but	O
her	O
face	O
blushed	O
with	O
rosy	O
health	O

and	O
her	O
lips	O
with	O
the	O
freshest	O
of	O
smiles	O

she	O
had	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O

with	O
the	O

good-humour	O

except	O
indeed	O
when	O
they	O
filled	O
with	O

that	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
too	O
often	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
silly	O
thing	O
would	O
cry	O
