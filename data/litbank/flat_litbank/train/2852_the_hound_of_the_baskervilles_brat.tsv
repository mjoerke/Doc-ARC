“	O

said	O
Holmes	B-PER

pushing	O
back	O

lighting	O

“	O

that	O

very	O

He	O
had	O
never	O
said	O
as	O
much	O
before	O

and	O
I	O
must	O
admit	O
that	O
his	O
words	O
gave	O
me	O
keen	O
pleasure	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
often	O
been	O
piqued	O
by	O
his	O
indifference	O
to	O
my	O
admiration	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
attempts	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
to	O
give	O
publicity	O
to	O
his	O
methods	O

I	O
was	O
proud	O
,	O
too	O

to	O
think	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
so	O
far	O
mastered	O
his	O
system	O
as	O
to	O
apply	O
it	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
which	O
earned	O
his	O
approval	O

He	O
now	O
took	O
the	O
stick	O
from	O
my	O
hands	O

examined	O
it	O
for	O
a	O

minutes	O
with	O
his	O
naked	O

Then	O
with	O
an	O
expression	O
of	O

he	O
laid	O
down	O
his	O
cigarette	O

“	O

“	O

I	O

some	O
self-importance	O
