CHAPTER	O
I	O
Mr	B-PER
Verloc	I-PER
,	O
going	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
left	O
his	B-FAC
shop	I-FAC
nominally	O
in	O
charge	O
of	O
his	B-PER
brother-in-law	I-PER
.	O

It	O
could	O
be	O
done	O
,	O
because	O
there	O
was	O
very	O
little	O
business	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
practically	O
none	O
at	O
all	O
before	O
the	O
evening	O
.	O

Mr	B-PER
Verloc	I-PER
cared	O
but	O
little	O
about	O
his	O
ostensible	O
business	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
moreover	O
,	O
his	B-PER
wife	I-PER
was	O
in	O
charge	O
of	O
his	B-PER
brother-in-law	I-PER
.	O

The	B-FAC
shop	I-FAC
was	O
small	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
was	O
the	B-FAC
house	I-FAC
.	O

It	O
was	O
one	B-FAC
of	I-FAC
those	I-FAC
grimy	I-FAC
brick	I-FAC
houses	I-FAC
which	O
existed	O
in	O
large	O
quantities	O
before	O
the	O
era	O
of	O
reconstruction	O
dawned	O
upon	O
London	B-GPE
.	O

The	B-FAC
shop	I-FAC
was	O
a	B-FAC
square	I-FAC
box	I-FAC
of	I-FAC
a	I-FAC
place	I-FAC
,	O
with	O
the	O
front	O
glazed	O
in	O
small	O
panes	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
daytime	O
the	O
door	O
remained	O
closed	O
;	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
it	O
stood	O
discreetly	O
but	O
suspiciously	O
ajar	O
.	O

The	O
window	O
contained	O
photographs	O
of	O
more	B-PER
or	I-PER
less	I-PER
undressed	I-PER
dancing	I-PER
girls	I-PER
;	O
nondescript	O
packages	O
in	O

like	O
patent	O
medicines	O
;	O
closed	O
yellow	O
paper	O
envelopes	O
,	O
very	O
flimsy	O
,	O
and	O
marked	O
two-and-six	O
in	O
heavy	O
black	O
figures	O
;	O
a	O
few	O
numbers	O
of	O
ancient	O
French	O
comic	O
publications	O
hung	O
across	O
a	O
string	O
as	O
if	O

a	O
dingy	O

bottles	O
of	O

and	O
rubber	O
stamps	O
;	O
a	O
few	O
books	O
,	O
with	O
titles	O
hinting	O
at	O
impropriety	O
;	O
a	O
few	O
apparently	O
old	O
copies	O
of	O
obscure	O
newspapers	O
,	O
badly	O
printed	O

with	O
titles	O

The	O

titles	O

And	O
the	O
two	O
gas	O
jets	O
inside	O
the	O
panes	O
were	O
always	O
turned	O
low	O
,	O
either	O
for	O
economy	O
’s	O
sake	O
or	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
the	B-PER
customers	I-PER
.	O

These	B-PER
customers	I-PER
were	O
either	O
very	B-PER
young	I-PER
men	I-PER
,	I-PER
who	I-PER
hung	I-PER
about	I-PER
the	I-PER
window	I-PER
for	I-PER
a	I-PER
time	I-PER
before	I-PER
slipping	I-PER
in	I-PER
suddenly	I-PER
;	O
or	O
men	B-PER
of	I-PER
a	I-PER
more	I-PER
mature	I-PER
age	I-PER
,	O
but	O
looking	O
generally	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
in	O
funds	O
.	O

Some	B-PER
of	I-PER
that	I-PER
last	I-PER
kind	I-PER
had	O
the	O
collars	O
of	O
their	O
overcoats	O
turned	O
right	O
up	O
to	O
their	O
moustaches	O
,	O
and	O
traces	O
of	O
mud	O
on	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
their	O
nether	O
garments	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
being	O
much	O
worn	O
and	O
not	O
very	O
valuable	O
.	O

And	O
the	O
legs	O
inside	O
them	O
did	O
not	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
general	O
rule	O
,	O
seem	O
of	O
much	O
account	O
either	O
.	O

With	O
their	O
hands	O
plunged	O
deep	O
in	O
the	O
side	O
pockets	O
of	O
their	O
coats	O
,	O
they	O
dodged	O
in	O
sideways	O
,	O
one	O
shoulder	O
first	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
afraid	O
to	O
start	O
the	O
bell	O
going	O
.	O

The	O
bell	O
,	O
hung	O
on	O
the	O
door	O
by	O
means	O
of	O
a	O
curved	O
ribbon	O
of	O
steel	O
,	O
was	O
difficult	O
to	O
circumvent	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
hopelessly	O
cracked	O
;	O
but	O
of	O
an	O
evening	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
slightest	O
provocation	O
,	O
it	O
clattered	O
behind	O
the	B-PER
customer	I-PER
with	O
impudent	O
virulence	O
.	O

It	O
clattered	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
that	O
signal	O
,	O
through	O
the	O
dusty	O
glass	O
door	O
behind	O
the	O
painted	O
deal	O
counter	O
,	O
Mr	B-PER
Verloc	I-PER
would	O
issue	O
hastily	O
from	O
the	B-FAC
parlour	I-FAC
at	O
the	O
back	O
.	O

His	O
eyes	O
were	O
naturally	O
heavy	O
;	O
he	O
had	O
an	O
air	O
of	O
having	O
wallowed	O
,	O
fully	O
dressed	O
,	O
all	O
day	O
on	O
an	O
unmade	O
bed	O
.	O

Another	B-PER
man	I-PER
would	O
have	O
felt	O
such	O
an	O
appearance	O
a	O
distinct	O
disadvantage	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
commercial	O
transaction	O
of	O
the	O
retail	O
order	O
much	O
depends	O
on	O
the	B-PER
seller	I-PER
’s	O
engaging	O
and	O
amiable	O
aspect	O
.	O

But	O
Mr	B-PER
Verloc	I-PER
knew	O
his	O
business	O
,	O
and	O
remained	O
undisturbed	O
by	O
any	O
sort	O
of	O
æsthetic	O
doubt	O
about	O
his	O
appearance	O
.	O

With	O
a	O
firm	O
,	O
steady-eyed	O
impudence	O
,	O
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
hold	O
back	O
the	O
threat	O
of	O
some	O
abominable	O
menace	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
proceed	O
to	O
sell	O
over	O
the	O
counter	O
some	O
object	O
looking	O
obviously	O
and	O
scandalously	O
not	O
worth	O
the	O
money	O
which	O
passed	O
in	O
the	O
transaction	O
:	O
a	O
small	O
cardboard	O
box	O
with	O
apparently	O
nothing	O
inside	O
,	O
for	O
instance	O
,	O
or	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
carefully	O
closed	O
yellow	O
flimsy	O
envelopes	O
,	O
or	O
a	O
soiled	O
volume	O
in	O
paper	O
covers	O
with	O
a	O
promising	O
title	O
.	O

Now	O
and	O
then	O
it	O
happened	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
faded	O
,	O
yellow	B-PER
dancing	I-PER
girls	I-PER
would	O
get	O
sold	O
to	O
an	B-PER
amateur	I-PER
,	O
as	O
though	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
alive	O
and	O
young	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
it	O
was	O
Mrs	B-PER
Verloc	I-PER
who	O
would	O
appear	O
at	O
the	O
call	O
of	O
the	O
cracked	O
bell	O
.	O

Winnie	B-PER
Verloc	I-PER
was	O
a	B-PER
young	I-PER
woman	I-PER
with	I-PER
a	I-PER
full	I-PER

,	I-PER
in	I-PER
a	I-PER
tight	I-PER

and	I-PER
with	I-PER
broad	I-PER
hips	I-PER
.	O

Her	O
hair	O
was	O
very	O
tidy	O
.	O

Steady-eyed	O
like	O
her	B-PER
husband	I-PER
,	O
she	O
preserved	O
an	O
air	O
of	O
unfathomable	O
indifference	O
behind	O
the	O
rampart	O
of	O
the	O
counter	O
.	O

Then	O
the	B-PER
customer	I-PER
of	I-PER
comparatively	I-PER
tender	I-PER
years	I-PER
would	O
get	O
suddenly	O
disconcerted	O
at	O
having	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
a	B-PER
woman	I-PER
,	O
and	O
with	O
rage	O
in	O
his	O
heart	O
would	O
proffer	O
a	O
request	O
for	O
a	O
bottle	O
of	O
marking	O
ink	O
,	O
retail	O
value	O
sixpence	O
(	O

one-and-sixpence	O
)	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
once	O
outside	O

he	O
would	O
drop	O
stealthily	O
into	O
the	O

Mrs	B-PER

Mr	B-PER

Mr	B-PER

Mr	B-PER

It	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
convenient	O
for	O
his	O
other	O
business	O
.	O

What	O
his	O
business	O
was	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
say	O
;	O
but	O
after	O
his	O
engagement	O
to	O
Winnie	B-PER
he	O
took	O
the	O
trouble	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
before	O
noon	O
,	O
and	O
descending	O
the	B-FAC
basement	I-FAC
stairs	I-FAC
,	O
make	O
himself	O
pleasant	O
to	O
Winnie	B-PER
’s	I-PER
mother	I-PER
in	O
the	B-FAC
breakfast-room	I-FAC
downstairs	B-FAC
where	O
she	O
had	O
her	O
motionless	O
being	O
.	O

He	O
stroked	O
the	O
cat	O
,	O
poked	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
had	O
his	O
lunch	O
served	O
to	O
him	O
there	B-FAC
.	O

He	O
left	O
its	O
slightly	O
stuffy	O
cosiness	O
with	O
evident	O
reluctance	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
same	O
,	O
remained	O
out	O
till	O
the	O
night	O
was	O
far	O
advanced	O
.	O

He	O
never	O
offered	O
to	O
take	O
Winnie	B-PER
to	O
theatres	B-FAC
,	O
as	O
such	B-PER
a	I-PER
nice	I-PER
gentleman	I-PER
ought	O
to	O
have	O
done	O
.	O

His	O
evenings	O
were	O
occupied	O
.	O

His	O
work	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
political	O
,	O
he	O
told	O
Winnie	B-PER
once	O
.	O

She	O
would	O
have	O
,	O
he	O
warned	O
her	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
nice	O
to	O
his	B-PER
political	I-PER
friends	I-PER
.	O

And	O
with	O
her	O
straight	O
,	O
unfathomable	O
glance	O
she	O
answered	O
that	O
she	O
would	O
be	O
so	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
.	O

How	O
much	O
more	O
he	O
told	O
her	O
as	O
to	O
his	O
occupation	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
Winnie	B-PER
’s	I-PER
mother	I-PER
to	O
discover	O
.	O

The	B-PER
married	I-PER
couple	I-PER
took	O
her	O
over	O
with	O
the	O
furniture	O
.	O

The	O
mean	O
aspect	O
of	O
the	B-FAC
shop	I-FAC
surprised	O
her	O
.	O

The	O
change	O
from	O
the	B-FAC
Belgravian	I-FAC
square	I-FAC
to	O
the	B-FAC
narrow	I-FAC
street	I-FAC
in	I-FAC
Soho	I-FAC
affected	O
her	O
legs	O
adversely	O
.	O

They	O
became	O
of	O
an	O
enormous	O
size	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
she	O
experienced	O
a	O
complete	O
relief	O
from	O
material	O
cares	O
.	O

Her	B-PER
son-in-law	I-PER
’s	O
heavy	O
good	O
nature	O
inspired	O
her	O
with	O
a	O
sense	O
of	O
absolute	O
safety	O
.	O

Her	B-PER
daughter	I-PER
’s	O
future	O
was	O
obviously	O
assured	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
as	O
to	O
her	B-PER
son	I-PER
Stevie	B-PER
she	O
need	O
have	O
no	O
anxiety	O
.	O

She	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
conceal	O
from	O
herself	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
terrible	O
encumbrance	O
,	O
that	B-PER
poor	I-PER
Stevie	I-PER
.	O

But	O
in	O
view	O
of	O
Winnie	B-PER
’s	O
fondness	O
for	O
her	B-PER
delicate	I-PER
brother	I-PER
,	O
and	O
of	O
Mr	B-PER
Verloc	I-PER
’s	O
kind	O
and	O
generous	O
disposition	O
,	O
she	O
felt	O
that	O
the	B-PER
poor	I-PER
boy	I-PER
was	O
pretty	O
safe	O
in	O
this	B-LOC
rough	I-LOC
world	I-LOC
.	O

And	O
in	O
her	O
heart	O
of	O
hearts	O
she	O
was	O
not	O
perhaps	O
displeased	O
that	O
the	B-PER
Verlocs	I-PER
had	O
no	B-PER
children	I-PER
.	O

As	O
that	O
circumstance	O
seemed	O
perfectly	O
indifferent	O
to	O
Mr	B-PER
Verloc	I-PER
,	O
and	O
as	O
Winnie	B-PER
found	O
an	O
object	O
of	O
quasi-maternal	O
affection	O
in	O
her	B-PER
brother	I-PER
,	O
perhaps	O
this	O
was	O
just	O
as	O
well	O
for	O
poor	O
Stevie	B-PER
.	O

For	O
he	O
was	O
difficult	O
to	O
dispose	O
of	O
,	O
that	B-PER
boy	I-PER
.	O

He	O
was	O
delicate	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
frail	O
way	O
,	O
good-looking	O
too	O
,	O
except	O
for	O
the	O
vacant	O
droop	O
of	O
his	O
lower	O
lip	O
.	O

Under	O
our	O
excellent	O
system	O
of	O
compulsory	O
education	O
he	O
had	O
learned	O
to	O
read	O
and	O
write	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
the	O
unfavourable	O
aspect	O
of	O
the	O
lower	O
lip	O
.	O

But	O
as	O
errand-boy	B-PER
he	O
did	O
not	O
turn	O
out	O
a	O
great	O
success	O
.	O

He	O
forgot	O
his	O
messages	O
;	O
he	O
was	O
easily	O
diverted	O
from	O
the	O
straight	O
path	O
of	O
duty	O
by	O
the	O
attractions	O
of	O
stray	O
cats	O
and	O
dogs	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
followed	O
down	O
narrow	B-FAC
alleys	I-FAC
into	O
unsavoury	B-FAC
courts	I-FAC
;	O
by	O
the	O
comedies	O
of	O
the	B-FAC
streets	I-FAC
,	O
which	O
he	O
contemplated	O
open-mouthed	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
detriment	O
of	O
his	B-PER
employer	I-PER
’s	O
interests	O
;	O
or	O
by	O
the	O
dramas	O
of	O
fallen	O
horses	O
,	O
whose	O
pathos	O
and	O
violence	O
induced	O
him	O
sometimes	O
to	O
shriek	O
pierceingly	O
in	O
a	O
crowd	O
,	O
which	O
disliked	O
to	O
be	O
disturbed	O
by	O
sounds	O
of	O
distress	O
in	O
its	O
quiet	O
enjoyment	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
spectacle	O
.	O

When	O
led	O
away	O
by	O
a	B-PER
grave	I-PER
and	I-PER
protecting	I-PER
policeman	I-PER
,	O
it	O
would	O
often	O
become	O
apparent	O
that	O
poor	O
Stevie	B-PER
had	O
forgotten	O
his	O
address	O
—	O
at	O
least	O
for	O
a	O
time	O
.	O

A	O
brusque	O
question	O
caused	O
him	O
to	O
stutter	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
suffocation	O
.	O

When	O
startled	O
by	O
anything	O
perplexing	O
he	O
used	O
to	O
squint	O
horribly	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
he	O
never	O
had	O
any	O
fits	O
(	O
which	O
was	O
encouraging	O
)	O
;	O
and	O
before	O
the	O
natural	O
outbursts	O
of	O
impatience	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
his	B-PER
father	I-PER
he	O
could	O
always	O
,	O
in	O
his	O
childhood	O
’s	O
days	O
,	O
run	O
for	O
protection	O
behind	O
the	O
short	O
skirts	O
of	O
his	B-PER
sister	I-PER
Winnie	B-PER
.	O

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
suspected	O
of	O
hiding	O
a	O
fund	O
of	O
reckless	O
naughtiness	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
had	O
reached	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
fourteen	O
a	B-PER
friend	I-PER
of	I-PER
his	I-PER
late	I-PER
father	I-PER
,	O
an	B-PER
agent	I-PER
for	I-PER
a	I-PER
foreign	I-PER
preserved	I-PER
milk	I-PER
firm	I-PER
,	O
having	O
given	O
him	O
an	O
opening	O
as	O
office-boy	B-PER
,	O
he	O
was	O
discovered	O
one	O
foggy	O
afternoon	O
,	O
in	O
his	B-PER
chief	I-PER
’s	O
absence	O
,	O
busy	O
letting	O
off	O
fireworks	O
on	O
the	B-FAC
staircase	I-FAC

He	O
touched	O
off	O
in	O
quick	O
succession	O
a	O
set	O
of	O
fierce	O
rockets	O
,	O
angry	O
catherine	O
wheels	O
,	O
loudly	O
exploding	O
squibs	O
—	O
and	O
the	O
matter	O
might	O
have	O
turned	O
out	O
very	O
serious	O
.	O

An	O
awful	O
panic	O
spread	O
through	O
the	B-FAC
whole	I-FAC
building	I-FAC
.	O

Wild-eyed	B-PER
,	I-PER
choking	I-PER
clerks	I-PER
stampeded	O
through	O
the	B-FAC
passages	I-FAC
full	O
of	O
smoke	O

silk	O
hats	O
and	O
elderly	B-PER
business	I-PER
men	I-PER
could	O
be	O
seen	O
rolling	O
independently	O
down	O
the	B-FAC
stairs	I-FAC
.	O

Stevie	B-PER
did	O
not	O
seem	O
to	O
derive	O
any	O
personal	O
gratification	O
from	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
.	O

His	O
motives	O
for	O
this	O
stroke	O
of	O
originality	O
were	O
difficult	O
to	O
discover	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
only	O
later	O
on	O
that	O
Winnie	B-PER
obtained	O
from	O
him	O
a	O
misty	O
and	O
confused	O
confession	O
.	O

It	O
seems	O
that	O
two	B-PER
other	I-PER
office-boys	I-PER
in	I-PER
the	I-PER
building	I-PER
had	O
worked	O
upon	O
his	O
feelings	O
by	O
tales	O
of	O
injustice	O
and	O
oppression	O
till	O
they	O
had	O
wrought	O
his	O
compassion	O
to	O
the	O
pitch	O
of	O
that	O
frenzy	O
.	O

But	O
his	B-PER
father	I-PER
’s	I-PER
friend	I-PER
,	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
dismissed	O
him	O
summarily	O
as	O
likely	O
to	O
ruin	O
his	B-ORG
business	I-ORG
.	O

After	O
that	O
altruistic	O
exploit	O
Stevie	B-PER
was	O
put	O
to	O
help	O
wash	O
the	O
dishes	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
basement	I-FAC
kitchen	I-FAC

and	O
to	O
black	O
the	O
boots	O
of	O
the	B-PER
gentlemen	I-PER
patronising	I-PER
the	I-PER
Belgravian	I-PER
mansion	I-PER

There	O
was	O
obviously	O
no	O
future	O
in	O
such	O
work	O

The	B-PER
gentlemen	I-PER
tipped	O
him	O
a	O
shilling	O
now	O

then	O
.	O

Mr	B-PER
Verloc	I-PER
showed	O
himself	O
the	O
most	O
generous	O
of	O
lodgers	B-PER

But	O
altogether	O
all	O
that	O

amount	O
to	O
much	O
either	O
in	O
the	O
way	O

so	O
that	O
when	O
