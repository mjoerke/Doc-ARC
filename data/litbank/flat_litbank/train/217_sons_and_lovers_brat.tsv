that	O

Mrs.	B-PER
Morel	I-PER
was	O
not	O
anxious	O
to	O
move	O
into	O
the	B-FAC
Bottoms	I-FAC
,	I-FAC
which	I-FAC
was	I-FAC
already	I-FAC
twelve	I-FAC
years	I-FAC
old	I-FAC

on	O
the	O
downward	O
path	O

when	O
she	O
descended	O
to	O
it	O
from	O
Bestwood	B-GPE

But	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
best	O
she	O
could	O
do	O
.	O

Moreover	O
,	O
she	O
had	O
an	B-FAC
end	I-FAC
house	I-FAC
in	I-FAC
one	I-FAC
of	I-FAC
the	I-FAC
top	I-FAC
blocks	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
thus	O
had	O
only	B-PER
one	I-PER
neighbour	I-PER
;	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
an	O
extra	O
strip	O
of	O
garden	B-FAC
.	O

And	O
,	O
having	O
an	B-FAC
end	I-FAC
house	I-FAC
,	O
she	O
enjoyed	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
aristocracy	O
among	O
the	B-PER
other	I-PER
women	I-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
“	I-PER
between	I-PER

houses	I-PER

because	O
her	O

was	O
five	O
shillings	O
and	O
sixpence	O
instead	O
of	O
five	O
shillings	O
a	O
week	O

But	O
this	O
superiority	O
in	O
station	O
was	O
not	O
much	O
consolation	O
to	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Morel	I-PER

She	O
was	O
thirty-one	O

she	O

a	O

She	O
came	O

her	B-PER

Her	B-PER

They	O

in	O
their	B-FAC
new	I-FAC
home	I-FAC
three	O
weeks	O
when	O
the	O

Morel	B-PER
,	O
she	O

The	B-PER

William	B-PER

a	B-PER

Mrs.	B-PER

her	O

She	O
scarcely	O
