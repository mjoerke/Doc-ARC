I	O
THIS	O
is	O
the	O
saddest	O
story	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
heard	O

We	O
had	O
known	O
the	B-PER
Ashburnhams	I-PER
for	O
nine	O
seasons	O
of	O
the	B-GPE
town	I-GPE
of	I-GPE
Nauheim	I-GPE
with	O
an	O
extreme	O
intimacy	O
--	O
or	O

rather	O
with	O
an	O

My	B-PER

I	O
knew	O
Captain	B-PER
and	O
Mrs	B-PER
Ashburnham	I-PER
as	O
well	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
to	O
know	O
anybody	B-PER

and	O
yet	O
,	O
in	O
another	O
sense	O
,	O
we	O
knew	O
nothing	O
at	O
all	O
about	O
them	O

This	O
is	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
things	O
only	O
possible	O
with	O
English	B-PER
people	I-PER
of	O
whom	O
,	O
till	O
today	O

when	O
I	O
sit	O
down	O
to	O
puzzle	O
out	O
what	O
I	O
know	O
of	O
this	O
sad	O
affair	O
,	O
I	O
knew	O
nothing	O
whatever	O

Six	O
months	O

I	O
had	O
never	O
been	O
to	O
England	B-GPE

,	O
certainly	O

I	O
had	O

I	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
mean	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
acquainted	O
with	O
many	O
English	B-PER
people	I-PER

Living	O

in	O

which	O
is	O

to	O

that	O
we	O

we	O
were	O

You	O
will	O
gather	O
from	O
this	O
statement	O
that	O
one	O
of	O

as	O
the	O
saying	O
is	O

a	O

from	O
the	O
statement	O
that	O
my	B-PER

that	O
she	O
was	O
the	B-PER

Captain	B-PER
Ashburnham	I-PER
also	O

a	O

But	O
,	O
whereas	O
a	O
yearly	O

at	O
Nauheim	B-GPE
tuned	O
him	O
up	O

the	O

of	O
the	O
twelvemonth	O

the	O
two	O

or	O
so	O
were	O
only	O
just	O
enough	O
to	O
keep	O
poor	O
Florence	B-PER
alive	O
from	O
year	O

year	O

The	O
reason	O
for	O
his	O
heart	O
was	O

approximately	O
,	O
polo	O
,	O
or	O
too	O
much	O
hard	O
sportsmanship	O
in	O
his	O

The	O
reason	O
for	O
poor	O
Florence	B-PER
's	O
broken	O
years	O
was	O
a	O
storm	O
at	O
sea	B-LOC
upon	O
our	O
first	O
crossing	O
to	O
Europe	B-GPE
,	O
and	O
the	O
immediate	O
reasons	O
for	O
our	O
imprisonment	O
in	O
that	B-GPE
continent	I-GPE
were	O
doctor	B-PER
's	O
orders	O
.	O

They	O
said	O
that	O
even	O
the	O
short	O
Channel	B-LOC
crossing	O
might	O
well	O
kill	O
the	B-PER
poor	I-PER
thing	I-PER
.	O

When	O
we	O
all	O
first	O
met	O
,	O
Captain	B-PER
Ashburnham	I-PER
,	O
home	O
on	O
sick	O
leave	O
from	O
an	B-GPE
India	I-GPE
to	I-GPE
which	I-GPE
he	I-GPE
was	I-GPE
never	I-GPE

was	O
thirty-three	O

Mrs	B-PER

Leonora	I-PER

was	O
thirty-one	O

I	O
was	O
thirty-six	O
and	O
poor	O
Florence	B-PER

Thus	O
today	O
Florence	B-PER
would	O
have	O

thirty-nine	O

forty-two	O

whereas	O
I	O

forty-five	O

You	O

therefore	O

that	O
our	O

And	O
is	O
it	O
possible	O

that	O
during	O
our	O
prescribed	O
walks	O
in	O
Nauheim	B-GPE
and	O
the	O
neighbourhood	B-FAC
she	O

Edward	B-PER

And	O
is	O
n't	O
it	O
incredible	O
that	O
during	O
all	O
that	O
time	O
Edward	B-PER
and	O
Leonora	B-PER
never	O
spoke	O
a	O
word	O

What	O
is	O
one	O
to	O

you	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
the	B-PER

Yes	O

Leonora	B-PER

extraordinarily	O
fair	O

the	O

that	O
