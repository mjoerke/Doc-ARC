It	O

going	O

when	O
Paul	B-PER

arrives	O
tomorrow	O

From	O
hall	B-FAC
you	O
go	O
right	O
or	O

into	O
dining-room	B-FAC
or	O
drawing-room	B-FAC

Hall	B-PER
itself	O
is	O
practically	O
a	B-FAC

You	O
open	O
another	O

in	O
it	O

and	O
there	O
are	O
the	B-FAC
stairs	I-FAC
going	O
up	O
in	O
a	B-FAC
sort	I-FAC
of	I-FAC

the	I-FAC
first-floor	I-FAC

That	O

it	O

my	B-PER

I	O
only	O
wanted	O
to	O
show	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
n't	O
the	O
least	O
what	O
we	O
expected	O
.	O

Why	O
did	O
we	O
settle	O
that	O
their	B-FAC
house	I-FAC
would	O
be	O
all	B-FAC
gables	I-FAC
and	I-FAC
wiggles	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
their	B-FAC
garden	I-FAC
all	O
gamboge-coloured	B-FAC
paths	I-FAC
?	O

I	O
believe	O
simply	O
because	O
we	O
associate	O
them	O
with	O
expensive	B-FAC
hotels	I-FAC
--	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Wilcox	I-PER
trailing	O
in	O
beautiful	O
dresses	O
down	O
long	B-FAC
corridors	I-FAC
,	O
Mr.	B-PER
Wilcox	I-PER
bullying	O
porters	B-PER
,	O
etc	O
.	O

We	O
females	B-PER
are	O
that	O
unjust	O
.	O

I	O
shall	O
be	O
back	O
Saturday	O
;	O
will	O
let	O
you	O
know	O
train	O
later	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
as	O
angry	O
as	O
I	O
am	O
that	O
you	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
too	O
;	O
really	O
Tibby	B-PER
is	O
too	O
tiresome	O
,	O
he	O
starts	O
a	O
new	O
mortal	O
disease	O
every	O
month	O
.	O

How	O
could	O
he	O
have	O
got	O
hay	O
fever	O
in	O
London	B-GPE
?	O

and	O
even	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
hard	O
that	O
you	O
should	O
give	O
up	O
a	O
visit	O
to	O
hear	O
a	B-PER
schoolboy	I-PER
sneeze	O
.	O

Tell	O
him	O
that	O
Charles	B-PER
Wilcox	I-PER
(	O
the	B-PER
son	I-PER
who	I-PER
is	I-PER
here	I-PER
)	O
has	O
hay	O
fever	O
too	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
's	O
brave	O
,	O
and	O
gets	O
quite	O
cross	O
when	O
we	O
inquire	O
after	O
it	O
.	O

Men	B-PER
like	I-PER
the	I-PER
Wilcoxes	I-PER
would	O
do	O
Tibby	B-PER
a	O
power	O
of	O
good	O
.	O

But	O
you	O
wo	O
n't	O
agree	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
'd	O
better	O
change	O
the	O
subject	O

This	O
long	O
letter	O
is	O
because	O
I	O
'm	O
writing	O
before	O
breakfast	O
.	O

Oh	O
,	O
the	O
beautiful	O
vine	O
leaves	O
!	O

The	B-FAC
house	I-FAC
is	O
covered	O
with	O
a	O
vine	O
.	O

I	O
looked	O
out	O
earlier	O
,	O
and	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Wilcox	I-PER
was	O
already	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
garden	I-FAC
.	O

She	O
evidently	O
loves	O
it	O
.	O

No	O
wonder	O
she	O
sometimes	O
looks	O
tired	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
watching	O
the	O
large	O
red	O
poppies	O
come	O
out	O
.	O

Then	O
she	O
walked	O
off	O
the	B-FAC
lawn	I-FAC
to	O
the	B-LOC
meadow	I-LOC
,	I-LOC
whose	I-LOC
corner	I-LOC
to	I-LOC
the	I-LOC
right	I-LOC
I	I-LOC
can	I-LOC
just	I-LOC
see	I-LOC
.	O

Trail	O
,	O
trail	O
,	O
went	O
her	O
long	O
dress	O
over	O
the	O
sopping	O
grass	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
came	O
back	O
with	O
her	O
hands	O
full	O
of	O
the	O
hay	O
that	O
was	O
cut	O
yesterday	O
--	O
I	O
suppose	O
for	O
rabbits	O
or	O
something	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
kept	O
on	O
smelling	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
air	O
here	O
is	O
delicious	O
.	O

Later	O
on	O
I	O
heard	O
the	O
noise	O
of	O
croquet	O
balls	O
,	O
and	O
looked	O
out	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
Charles	B-PER
Wilcox	I-PER
practising	O
;	O
they	O
are	O
keen	O
on	O
all	O
games	O
.	O

Presently	O
he	O
started	O
sneezing	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
stop	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
hear	O
more	O
clicketing	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
Mr.	B-PER
Wilcox	I-PER
practising	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
'	O
a-tissue	O
,	O
a-tissue	O
'	O
:	O
he	O
has	O
to	O
stop	O
too	O
.	O

Then	O
Evie	B-PER
comes	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
does	O
some	O
calisthenic	O
exercises	O
on	O
a	O
machine	O
that	O
is	O
tacked	O
on	O
to	O
a	O
greengage-tree	O
--	O
they	O
put	O
everything	O
to	O
use	O
--	O
and	O
then	O
she	O
says	O
'	O
a-tissue	O
,	O
'	O
and	O
in	O
she	O
goes	O
.	O

And	O
finally	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Wilcox	I-PER
reappears	O
,	O
trail	O
,	O
trail	O
,	O
still	O
smelling	O
hay	O
and	O
looking	O
at	O
the	O
flowers	O
.	O

I	O
inflict	O
all	O
this	O
on	O
you	O
because	O
once	O
you	O
said	O
that	O
life	O
is	O
sometimes	O
life	O
and	O
sometimes	O
only	O
a	O
drama	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
must	O
learn	O
to	O
distinguish	O
t	O
'	O
other	O
from	O
which	O
,	O
and	O
up	O
to	O
now	O
I	O
have	O
always	O
put	O
that	O
down	O
as	O
'	O
Meg	B-PER
's	O
clever	O
nonsense	O
.	O
'	O

But	O
this	O
morning	O
,	O
it	O
really	O
does	O
seem	O
not	O
life	O
but	O
a	O
play	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
did	O
amuse	O
me	O
enormously	O
to	O
watch	O
the	B-PER
W	I-PER
's	I-PER
.	O

Now	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Wilcox	I-PER
has	O
come	O
in	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
wear	O
[	O

Last	O

wore	O
an	O
[	O

,	O
and	O
Evie	B-PER
[	O

So	O
it	O
is	O
n't	O
exactly	O
a	B-FAC
go-as-you-please	I-FAC
place	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
if	O
you	O
shut	O
your	O
eyes	O
it	O
still	O
seems	O
the	B-FAC
wiggly	I-FAC
hotel	I-FAC
that	I-FAC
we	I-FAC
expected	I-FAC
.	O

Not	O
if	O
you	O
open	O
them	O

The	O
dog-roses	O
are	O
too	O
sweet	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
hedge	O
of	O
them	O
over	O
the	B-FAC
lawn	I-FAC
--	O
magnificently	O
tall	O

so	O
that	O
they	O
fall	O
down	O
in	O
garlands	O
,	O
and	O
nice	O
and	O
thin	O
at	O
the	O
bottom	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
ducks	O
through	O
it	O
and	O
a	O
cow	O

These	O
belong	O

the	O
