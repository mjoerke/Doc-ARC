man	I-PER
of	I-PER

I	O
always	O
deemed	O
him	O
the	O
victim	O
of	O
two	O
evil	O
powers	O
--	O
ambition	O
and	O
indigestion	O

The	O
ambition	O
was	O
evinced	O
by	O
a	O
certain	O
impatience	O
of	O
the	O
duties	O
of	O
a	B-PER
mere	I-PER
copyist	I-PER

as	O
the	O
original	O

The	O
indigestion	O
seemed	O
betokened	O
in	O
an	O
occasional	O
nervous	O
testiness	O

especially	O
by	O
a	O
continual	O
discontent	O
with	O
the	O
height	O
of	O
the	O

various	O

at	O

If	O

for	O
the	O

of	O

his	O

he	O
brought	O
the	O

at	O
a	O
sharp	O
angle	O
well	O
up	O

I	O
have	O
good	O

to	O
believe	O

that	O
one	B-PER

so	O

Whereas	O
with	O

I	O
had	O
much	O
ado	O
to	O
keep	O
him	O
from	O
being	O
a	O
reproach	O
to	O
me	O

His	O
clothes	O
were	O
apt	O
to	O
look	O
oily	O
and	O
smell	O
of	O

He	O
wore	O
his	O
pantaloons	O
very	O
loose	O
and	O
baggy	O
in	O

His	O
coats	O
were	O
execrable	O
;	O
his	O

not	O
to	O

But	O
while	O
the	O
hat	O
was	O
a	O
thing	O
of	O
indifference	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
inasmuch	O
as	O
his	O
natural	O
civility	O

deference	O

as	O
a	B-PER

yet	O
his	O

another	O

Concerning	O
his	O
coats	O

I	O
reasoned	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
with	O
no	O
effect	O

The	O
truth	O
was	O
,	O
I	O
suppose	O
,	O
that	O
a	B-PER
man	I-PER
of	I-PER
so	I-PER
small	I-PER
an	I-PER
income	I-PER
,	O
could	O
not	O
afford	O

such	O
a	O
lustrous	O

and	O
a	O
lustrous	O
coat	O
at	O
one	O

the	O

time	O

As	O
Nippers	B-PER
once	O
observed	O
,	O
Turkey	B-PER
's	O
money	O
went	O
chiefly	O
for	O
red	O
ink	O

One	O
winter	O
day	O
I	O
presented	O
Turkey	B-PER
with	O
a	O
highly-respectable	O
looking	O
coat	O
of	O
my	O
own	O

a	O
padded	O
gray	O
coat	O

of	O
a	O
most	O
comfortable	O
warmth	O

and	O
which	O
buttoned	O
straight	O
up	O
from	O
the	O
knee	O
to	O
the	O
neck	O

I	O
thought	O
Turkey	B-PER
would	O
appreciate	O
the	O
favor	O

and	O
abate	O
his	O
rashness	O
and	O
obstreperousness	O
of	O
afternoons	O

But	O
no	O
.	O

I	O
verily	O
believe	O
that	O
buttoning	O
himself	O
up	O
in	O
so	O
downy	O
and	O
blanket-like	O
a	O
coat	O
had	O
a	O
pernicious	O
effect	O
upon	O
him	O

upon	O
the	O

that	O
too	O

In	O
