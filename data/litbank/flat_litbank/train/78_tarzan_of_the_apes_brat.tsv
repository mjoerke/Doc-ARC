I	O
Out	O

this	O

one	B-PER

I	O
may	O
credit	O
the	O
seductive	O
influence	O
of	O
an	O
old	O
vintage	O
upon	O
the	B-PER
narrator	I-PER
for	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
own	O
skeptical	O
incredulity	O
during	O
the	O
days	O
that	O
followed	O
for	O
the	O
balance	O
of	O
the	O
strange	O
tale	O
.	O

When	O
my	B-PER
convivial	I-PER
host	I-PER
discovered	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
told	O
me	O
so	O
much	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
prone	O
to	O
doubtfulness	O
,	O
his	O
foolish	O
pride	O
assumed	O
the	O
task	O
the	O
old	O
vintage	O
had	O
commenced	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
he	O
unearthed	O
written	O
evidence	O
in	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
musty	O
manuscript	O
,	O
and	O
dry	O

to	O

many	O

the	O

I	O

for	O
I	O
did	O
not	O

the	O
fact	O
that	O
in	O
the	O

that	O
a	B-PER
certain	I-PER

English	I-PER

whom	O
we	O
shall	O
call	O
John	B-PER
Clayton	I-PER
,	O
Lord	B-PER
Greystoke	I-PER
,	O
was	O
commissioned	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
peculiarly	O
delicate	O
investigation	O
of	O
conditions	O
in	O
a	B-GPE
British	I-GPE
West	I-GPE
Coast	I-GPE
African	I-GPE
Colony	I-GPE
from	O
whose	O
simple	B-PER
native	I-PER
inhabitants	I-PER
another	O
European	B-GPE
power	I-GPE
was	O
known	O
to	O
be	O
recruiting	O
soldiers	B-PER
for	O
its	B-ORG
native	I-ORG
army	I-ORG
,	O
which	O
it	O
used	O
solely	O
for	O
the	O
forcible	O
collection	O
of	O

ivory	O
from	O
the	B-PER
savage	I-PER
tribes	I-PER
along	I-PER
the	I-PER
Congo	I-PER

the	I-PER
Aruwimi	I-PER
.	O

The	B-PER
natives	I-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
British	I-PER
Colony	I-PER
complained	O
that	O
many	O
of	O
their	B-PER
young	I-PER
men	I-PER
were	O
enticed	O
away	O
through	O
the	O
medium	O
of	O
fair	O

,	O
but	O
that	O
few	O
if	O
any	O
ever	O
returned	O
to	O
their	B-PER
families	I-PER
.	O

The	B-PER
Englishmen	I-PER
in	I-PER
Africa	I-PER
went	O
even	O
further	O
,	O
saying	O
that	O
these	B-PER
poor	I-PER
blacks	I-PER
were	O
held	O
in	O
virtual	O
slavery	O
,	O
since	O
after	O
their	O

by	O
their	B-PER
white	I-PER

and	O
they	O
were	O
told	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
yet	O
several	O
years	O
to	O
serve	O
.	O

And	O
so	O
the	B-ORG
Colonial	I-ORG
Office	I-ORG
appointed	O
John	B-PER
Clayton	I-PER
to	O
a	B-FAC
new	I-FAC
post	I-FAC
in	I-FAC
British	I-FAC
West	I-FAC
Africa	I-FAC
,	O
but	O
his	O
confidential	O
instructions	O
centered	O
on	O
a	O
thorough	O
investigation	O
of	O
the	O
unfair	O
treatment	O
of	O
black	B-PER
British	I-PER
subjects	I-PER
by	O
the	B-PER
officers	I-PER
of	I-PER
a	I-PER

Why	O
he	O
was	O
sent	O

is	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
of	O
little	O
moment	O
to	O
this	O
story	O

for	O
he	O
never	O
made	O
an	O

in	O
fact	O
,	O
did	O
he	O
ever	O
reach	O
his	B-FAC

Clayton	B-PER
was	O
the	B-PER
type	I-PER
of	I-PER
Englishman	I-PER
that	I-PER
one	I-PER
likes	I-PER
best	I-PER
to	I-PER
associate	I-PER
with	I-PER
the	I-PER
noblest	I-PER
monuments	I-PER
of	I-PER
historic	I-PER
achievement	I-PER
upon	I-PER
a	I-PER
thousand	I-PER
victorious	I-PER

--	O
a	B-PER
strong	I-PER
,	I-PER
virile	I-PER
man	I-PER
--	O
mentally	O
,	O
morally	O
,	O
and	O
physically	O
.	O

In	O
stature	O
he	O
was	O
above	O
the	O
average	O
height	O
;	O
his	O
eyes	O
were	O
gray	O

his	O
features	O
regular	O

strong	O

his	O
carriage	O
that	O
of	O
perfect	O

robust	O
health	O
influenced	O
by	O
his	O
years	O
of	O
army	O
training	O

Political	O
ambition	O
had	O
caused	O
him	O
to	O
seek	O
transference	O
from	O
the	B-ORG
army	I-ORG
to	O
the	B-ORG
Colonial	I-ORG
Office	I-ORG
and	O
so	O
we	O
find	O
him	O
,	O
still	O
young	O
,	O
entrusted	O
with	O
a	O
delicate	O
and	O
important	O
commission	O
in	O
the	O
service	O
of	O
the	B-PER
Queen	I-PER
.	O

When	O
he	O
received	O
this	O
appointment	O
he	O
was	O
both	O
elated	O
and	O
appalled	O
.	O

The	O
preferment	O
seemed	O
to	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
a	O
well-merited	O
reward	O
for	O
painstaking	O
and	O
intelligent	O
service	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
a	O
stepping	O
stone	O
to	O
posts	O
of	O
greater	O
importance	O
and	O
responsibility	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
married	O
to	O
the	B-PER
Hon.	I-PER
Alice	I-PER
Rutherford	I-PER
for	O
scarce	O
a	O
three	O
months	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
thought	O
of	O
taking	O
this	B-PER
fair	I-PER
young	I-PER
girl	I-PER
into	O
the	O
dangers	O
and	O
isolation	O
of	O
tropical	B-LOC
Africa	I-LOC
that	O
appalled	O
him	O
.	O

For	O
her	O
sake	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
refused	O
the	O
appointment	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
it	O
so	O
.	O

Instead	O
she	O
insisted	O
that	O
he	O
accept	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
take	O
her	O
with	O
him	O

There	O
were	O
mothers	B-PER

brothers	B-PER

sisters	B-PER

aunts	B-PER

cousins	B-PER
to	O
express	O

on	O
the	O
subject	O

but	O
as	O
to	O
what	O
they	O
severally	O
advised	O
history	O

silent	O

We	O

that	O

a	O

1888	O

John	B-PER

Lord	B-PER

Dover	B-GPE
on	O
their	O

to	O
Africa	B-GPE
.	O

A	O
month	O
later	O
they	O
arrived	O
at	O
Freetown	B-GPE
where	O

chartered	O
a	B-VEH

John	B-PER

Lord	B-PER
Greystoke	I-PER

Lady	B-PER

from	O

Two	O
months	O

they	O
weighed	O

cleared	O
from	O
the	B-FAC

of	I-FAC
Freetown	I-FAC
a	B-VEH
half	I-VEH

their	B-VEH

it	O
was	O
almost	O

was	O
found	O
upon	O
the	B-LOC
shores	I-LOC
of	I-LOC
St.	I-LOC

which	O
convinced	O
the	B-PER

Fuwalda	I-VEH

gone	O
down	O
with	O
all	B-PER

and	O
hence	O
the	O

The	B-VEH

a	B-VEH
barkentine	I-VEH
of	I-VEH
about	I-VEH
one	I-VEH

a	B-VEH

The	B-VEH
Fuwalda	I-VEH
was	O
no	O
exception	O
to	O
the	O
rule	O

Her	B-PER

The	B-PER

while	O
a	B-PER

a	B-PER
brute	I-PER
in	I-PER
his	I-PER

He	O
knew	O

or	O
at	O

he	O
used	O

two	O

a	O

So	O
it	O
was	O
that	O
from	O
the	O

out	O
from	O
Freetown	B-GPE
John	B-PER
Clayton	I-PER
and	O
his	B-PER

scenes	O

It	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
morning	O
of	O
the	O
second	O
day	O
that	O
the	O
first	O

was	O
forged	O
in	O
what	O

form	O
a	O
chain	O
of	O

in	O
a	O

for	O
one	O

such	O
as	O
has	O
never	O
been	O
paralleled	O
in	O
the	O
history	O
of	O
man	B-PER

Two	B-PER
sailors	I-PER
were	O
washing	O
down	O
the	B-FAC
decks	I-FAC
of	I-FAC
the	I-FAC
Fuwalda	I-FAC
,	O
the	B-PER
first	I-PER
mate	I-PER
was	O
on	O
duty	O
,	O
and	O
the	B-PER
captain	I-PER
had	O
stopped	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
John	B-PER
Clayton	I-PER
and	O
Lady	B-PER
Alice	I-PER
.	O

The	B-PER
men	I-PER
were	O
working	O
backwards	O
toward	O
the	B-PER
little	I-PER
party	I-PER
who	I-PER
were	I-PER
facing	I-PER
away	I-PER
from	I-PER
the	I-PER
sailors	I-PER
.	O

Closer	O
and	O
closer	O
they	O
came	O
,	O
until	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
directly	O
behind	O
the	B-PER
captain	I-PER
.	O

In	O
another	O
moment	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
passed	O
by	O
and	O
this	O
strange	O
narrative	O
would	O
never	O
have	O
been	O
recorded	O

But	O
just	O
that	O
instant	O
the	B-PER
officer	I-PER
turned	O
to	O
leave	O
Lord	B-PER
and	O
Lady	B-PER
Greystoke	I-PER
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
did	O
so	O
,	O
tripped	O
against	O
the	B-PER
sailor	I-PER
and	O
sprawled	O
headlong	O
upon	O
the	B-FAC
deck	I-FAC
,	O
overturning	O
the	O
water-pail	O
so	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
drenched	O
in	O
its	O
dirty	O
contents	O

For	O
an	O
instant	O
the	O
scene	O
was	O
ludicrous	O
;	O
but	O
only	O
for	O
an	O
instant	O

With	O
a	O
volley	O
of	O
awful	O
oaths	O

his	O

suffused	O
with	O
the	O
scarlet	O
of	O
mortification	O

rage	O
,	O
the	B-PER
captain	I-PER
regained	O
his	O
feet	O

and	O
with	O
a	O
terrific	O
blow	O
felled	O
the	B-PER
sailor	I-PER
to	O
the	B-FAC
deck	I-FAC

The	B-PER
man	I-PER
was	O
small	O
and	O
rather	O
old	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
brutality	O
of	O
the	O
act	O
was	O
thus	O
accentuated	O

The	B-PER
other	I-PER

was	O
neither	O

As	O
he	O
saw	O
his	B-PER

down	O
he	O
crouched	O

with	O
a	O

upon	O
the	B-PER

him	O
