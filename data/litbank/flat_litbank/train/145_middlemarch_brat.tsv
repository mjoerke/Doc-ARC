Miss	B-PER
Brooke	I-PER
had	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
beauty	O
which	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
thrown	O
into	O
relief	O
by	O
poor	O
dress	O

Her	O
hand	O
and	O
wrist	O
were	O
so	O
finely	O
formed	O
that	O
she	O
could	O
wear	O
sleeves	O
not	O
less	O
bare	O
of	O
style	O
than	O
those	O
in	O
which	O
the	B-PER

Virgin	I-PER
appeared	O
to	O
Italian	B-PER
painters	I-PER
;	O
and	O
her	O
profile	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
her	O
stature	O
and	O
bearing	O
seemed	O
to	O
gain	O
the	O
more	O
dignity	O
from	O
her	O
plain	O
garments	O
,	O
which	O
by	O
the	B-FAC
side	I-FAC
of	I-FAC

her	O

She	O
was	O
usually	O
spoken	O

with	O
the	O
addition	O
that	O
her	B-PER

more	O

Nevertheless	O

Celia	B-PER

scarcely	O

it	O
was	O
only	O
to	O

Miss	B-PER

Dorothea	B-PER

Her	O
mind	O
was	O
theoretic	O

yearned	O
by	O
its	O

after	O
some	O
lofty	O
conception	O
of	O
the	B-LOC

which	O
might	O

was	O

such	O
elements	O
in	O
the	O

a	B-PER

Mr.	B-PER
Brooke	I-PER

conclusions	O
were	O

it	O

safe	O
to	O
say	O
that	O

In	O
Mr.	B-PER

the	O
hereditary	O
strain	O
of	O

clearly	O
in	O

in	O
his	B-PER

Dorothea	B-PER
it	O
glowed	O
alike	O
through	O
faults	O

turning	O

The	O

These	O
peculiarities	O
of	O
Dorothea	B-PER
's	I-PER
character	I-PER
caused	O
Mr.	B-PER
Brooke	I-PER
to	O
be	O
all	O
the	O

blamed	O
in	O

families	O
for	O

guide	B-PER
and	I-PER
companion	I-PER
to	I-PER
his	I-PER
nieces	I-PER

But	O
he	O
himself	O
dreaded	O
so	O
much	O
the	O
sort	O
of	O
superior	B-PER
woman	I-PER
likely	O
to	O
be	O
available	O
for	O
such	O
a	O
position	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
allowed	O
himself	O
to	O
be	O
dissuaded	O
by	O
Dorothea	B-PER
's	O
objections	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
in	O
this	O
case	O
brave	O
enough	O
to	O
defy	O
the	B-PER
world	I-PER

that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O

Mrs.	B-PER
Cadwallader	I-PER

the	O
