An	B-PER

a	B-PER

that	O
the	B-PER

what	O

he	O

Men	B-PER

an	B-PER
author	I-PER
will	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
exhaust	O
so	O
extensive	O
a	O
subject	O

An	O
objection	O
may	O
perhaps	O
be	O
apprehended	O
from	O
the	O
more	O
delicate	O
,	O
that	O
this	O

is	O
too	O
common	O

;	O
for	O
what	O

the	O

of	O
all	O
the	O

with	O
which	O
the	O

Many	O
exquisite	O
viands	O
might	O
be	O
rejected	O
by	O
the	B-PER
epicure	I-PER
,	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
sufficient	O
cause	O
for	O
his	O
contemning	O
of	O
them	O
as	O
common	O
and	O
vulgar	O
,	O
that	O
something	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
most	I-FAC
paltry	I-FAC
alleys	I-FAC
under	I-FAC
the	I-FAC
same	I-FAC

In	O
reality	O
,	O
true	O
nature	O
is	O
as	O
difficult	O
to	O

met	O

in	O
authors	B-PER

the	O

But	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
to	O
continue	O
the	O
same	O
metaphor	O

consists	O
in	O
the	O
cookery	O
of	O
the	B-PER
author	I-PER
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
Mr	B-PER
Pope	I-PER
tells	O
us	O

“	O
True	O

The	O

the	O

a	B-PER

may	O
perhaps	O
be	O

another	O

and	O
some	O
of	O
his	O

gibbeted	O

as	O
it	O
were	O

in	O
the	O
vilest	O

Where	O

then	O

lies	O
the	O
difference	O
between	O
the	O
food	O
of	O
the	B-PER
nobleman	I-PER
and	O
the	B-PER
porter	I-PER
,	O
if	O

in	O

the	O
dressing	O

the	O
garnishing	O

the	O

Hence	O
the	O
one	O
provokes	O

incites	O
the	O
most	O
languid	O
appetite	O

the	O

that	O

In	O

the	O
excellence	O
of	O
the	O

consists	O
less	O
