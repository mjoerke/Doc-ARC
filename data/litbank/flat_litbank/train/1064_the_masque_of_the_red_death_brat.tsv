But	O
first	O
let	O
me	O
tell	O
of	O
the	B-FAC

was	I-FAC

These	O

such	B-FAC

the	O

so	O
that	O
the	O
view	O

Here	O
the	O
case	O
was	O
very	O
different	O

as	O
might	O

expected	O
from	O
the	B-PER

The	B-FAC

so	O

that	O
the	O

There	O
was	O
a	O

twenty	O

the	O

each	O

a	O

These	O

varied	O

with	O
the	O

the	O

of	O
the	B-FAC

The	B-FAC

The	B-FAC

The	B-FAC

The	B-FAC

was	O
closely	O

all	O
over	O
the	O

down	O

But	O
in	O
this	B-FAC

the	O

The	O

Now	O
in	O

in	O
the	B-FAC

there	O
stood	O

the	B-FAC

And	O
thus	O

a	O

the	B-PER

these	B-FAC

in	O

beat	O

the	O

many	B-PER

of	I-PER
the	I-PER

a	I-PER

it	O

that	O

In	O

the	O

the	B-PER

The	B-PER

the	B-PER

The	B-PER

The	O
