while	O
I	O
hesitated	O
not	O
to	O
acknowledge	O
how	O
familiar	O
was	O
all	O
this	O
--	O
I	O
still	O
wondered	O
to	O
find	O
how	O
unfamiliar	O
were	O
the	O
fancies	O
which	O
ordinary	O
images	O
were	O
stirring	O
up	O
.	O

On	O
one	B-FAC
of	I-FAC
the	I-FAC
staircases	I-FAC
,	O
I	O
met	O
the	B-PER
physician	I-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
family	I-PER
.	O

His	O
countenance	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
wore	O
a	O
mingled	O
expression	O
of	O
low	O
cunning	O
and	O
perplexity	O
.	O

He	O
accosted	O
me	O
with	O
trepidation	O
and	O
passed	O
on	O
.	O

The	B-PER
valet	I-PER
now	O
threw	O
open	O
a	O
door	O
and	O
ushered	O
me	O
into	O
the	O
presence	O
of	O
his	B-PER
master	I-PER
.	O

The	B-FAC
room	I-FAC
in	I-FAC
which	I-FAC
I	I-FAC
found	I-FAC
myself	I-FAC
was	O
very	O
large	O
and	O
lofty	O
.	O

The	O
windows	O
were	O
long	O
,	O
narrow	O
,	O
and	O
pointed	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
so	O
vast	O
a	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
black	O
oaken	O
floor	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
altogether	O
inaccessible	O
from	O
within	O

Feeble	O
gleams	O
of	O
encrimsoned	O
light	O
made	O
their	O
way	O
through	O
the	O
trellised	O
panes	O
,	O
and	O
served	O
to	O
render	O
sufficiently	O
distinct	O
the	O
more	O
prominent	O
objects	O
around	O
;	O
the	O
eye	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
struggled	O
in	O
vain	O
to	O
reach	O
the	O
remoter	O
angles	O
of	O
the	B-FAC
chamber	I-FAC
,	O
or	O
the	O
recesses	O
of	O
the	O
vaulted	O
and	O
fretted	O
ceiling	O

Dark	O
draperies	O
hung	O
upon	O
the	O
walls	O

The	O
general	O
furniture	O
was	O
profuse	O
,	O
comfortless	O
,	O
antique	O
,	O
and	O
tattered	O
.	O

Many	O
books	O
and	O
musical	O
instruments	O
lay	O
scattered	O
about	O
,	O
but	O
failed	O
to	O
give	O
any	O
vitality	O
to	O
the	O
scene	O
.	O

I	O
felt	O
that	O
I	O
breathed	O
an	O
atmosphere	O
of	O
sorrow	O
.	O

An	O
air	O
of	O
stern	O
,	O
deep	O
,	O
and	O
irredeemable	O
gloom	O
hung	O
over	O
and	O
pervaded	O
all	O

Upon	O
my	O
entrance	O
,	O
Usher	B-PER
rose	O
from	O
a	O
sofa	O
on	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
lying	O
at	O
full	O
length	O
,	O
and	O
greeted	O
me	O
with	O
a	O
vivacious	O
warmth	O
which	O
had	O
much	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
at	O
first	O
thought	O
,	O
of	O
an	O
overdone	O
cordiality	O
--	O
of	O
the	O
constrained	O
effort	O
of	O
the	B-PER
ennuye	I-PER
man	I-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
world	I-PER
.	O

A	O
glance	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
at	O
his	O
countenance	O
,	O
convinced	O
me	O
of	O
his	O
perfect	O
sincerity	O

We	O
sat	O
down	O
;	O
and	O
for	O
some	O
moments	O
,	O
while	O
he	O
spoke	O
not	O
,	O
I	O
gazed	O
upon	O
him	O
with	O
a	O
feeling	O
half	O
of	O
pity	O
,	O
half	O
of	O
awe	O

Surely	O
,	O
man	B-PER
had	O
never	O
before	O
so	O
terribly	O
altered	O
,	O
in	O
so	O
brief	O
a	O
period	O
,	O
as	O
had	O
Roderick	B-PER
Usher	I-PER
!	O

It	O
was	O
with	O
difficulty	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
bring	O
myself	O
to	O
admit	O
the	O
identity	O
of	O
the	B-PER
wan	I-PER
being	I-PER
before	I-PER
me	I-PER
with	O
the	B-PER
companion	I-PER
of	I-PER
my	I-PER
early	I-PER
boyhood	I-PER

Yet	O
the	O
character	O
of	O
his	O

had	O
been	O
at	O
all	O
times	O
remarkable	O

A	O
cadaverousness	O

an	O
eye	O

luminous	O

lips	O
somewhat	O
thin	O

very	O
pallid	O

a	O

with	O
a	O

in	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

of	O
these	O

so	O
