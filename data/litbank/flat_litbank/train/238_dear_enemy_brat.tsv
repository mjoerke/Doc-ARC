My	B-PER

n't	O
amounted	O

Dear	B-PER
Judy	I-PER
:	O
We	O
arrived	O
in	O
a	O
snowstorm	O
at	O
eleven	O
last	O
night	O
,	O
Singapore	O
and	O
Jane	B-PER
and	O
I	O
.	O

It	O
does	O
not	O
appear	O
to	O
be	O
customary	O
for	O
superintendents	B-PER
of	I-PER
orphan	I-PER
asylums	I-PER
to	O
bring	O
with	O
them	O
personal	B-PER
maids	I-PER
and	O
Chinese	O
chows	O
.	O

The	B-PER
night	I-PER
watchman	I-PER
and	O
housekeeper	B-PER
,	O
who	O
had	O
waited	O
up	O
to	O
receive	O
me	O
,	O
were	O
thrown	O
into	O
an	O
awful	O
flutter	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
the	O
like	O
of	O
Sing	O
,	O
and	O
thought	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
introducing	O
a	O
wolf	O
into	O
the	O
fold	O
.	O

I	O
reassured	O
them	O
as	O
to	O
his	O
dogginess	O
,	O
and	O
the	B-PER
watchman	I-PER
,	O
after	O
studying	O
his	O
black	O
tongue	O
,	O
ventured	O
a	O
witticism	O
.	O

He	O
wanted	O
to	O
know	O
if	O
I	O
fed	O
him	O
on	O
huckleberry	O
pie	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
difficult	O
to	O
find	O
accommodations	O
for	O
my	B-PER
family	I-PER
.	O

Poor	O
Sing	O
was	O
dragged	O
off	O
whimpering	O
to	O
a	B-FAC
strange	I-FAC
woodshed	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
given	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
burlap	O

Jane	B-PER
did	O
not	O
fare	O
much	O
better	O

There	O
was	O
not	O
an	O
extra	O
bed	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
building	I-FAC
,	O
barring	O
a	O
five-foot	O

She	O
,	O
as	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
approaches	O
six	O
.	O

We	O
tucked	O
her	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
spent	O
the	O
night	O
folded	O
up	O
like	O
a	O
jackknife	O
.	O

She	O
has	O
limped	O
about	O
today	O
,	O
looking	O
like	O
a	O
decrepit	O
letter	O
S	O
,	O
openly	O
deploring	O
this	O
latest	O
escapade	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
her	B-PER
flighty	I-PER
mistress	I-PER
,	O
and	O
longing	O
for	O
the	O
time	O
when	O
we	O
shall	O
come	O
to	O
our	O
senses	O
,	O
and	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
parental	O
fireside	O
in	O
Worcester	B-GPE
.	O

I	O
know	O
that	O
she	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
spoil	O
all	O
my	O
chances	O
of	O
being	O
popular	O
with	O
the	B-PER
rest	I-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
staff	I-PER
.	O

Having	O
her	O
here	B-FAC
is	O
the	O
silliest	O
idea	O
that	O
was	O
ever	O
conceived	O
,	O
but	O
you	O
know	O
my	B-PER
family	I-PER
.	O

I	O
fought	O
their	O
objections	O
step	O
by	O
step	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
made	O
their	O
last	O
stand	O
on	O
Jane	O

If	O
I	O
brought	O
her	O
along	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
I	O
ate	O
nourishing	O
food	O
and	O
did	O
n't	O
stay	O
up	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
come	O
--	O
temporarily	O

if	O
I	O
refused	O
to	O
bring	O
her	O
--	O
oh	O

dear	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
not	O

I	O
was	O
ever	O
again	O

and	O
neither	O

I	O

I	O
woke	O
by	O
a	O

at	O
six	O
this	O
morning	O

and	O
lay	O
for	O
a	O

that	O
twenty-five	B-PER

made	O
in	O
the	B-FAC

that	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
get	O

--	O
just	O

they	O
make	O
as	O
much	O

as	O
twenty-five	O

in	O
a	B-FAC

I	O
rose	O
and	O
dressed	O

explored	O
a	O

You	O

me	O

While	O

it	O
seemed	O
a	O

I	O
plunged	O
into	O
this	O
thing	O
lightly	O
enough	O

partly	O
because	O
you	O
were	O
too	O

object	O
to	O
my	O
featuring	O
the	B-PER

family	I-PER
so	O

I	O

As	O

fact	O
that	O

straight	O
from	O

are	O
evidently	O
new	O
attributes	O
in	O

showed	O
plainly	O
that	O

consider	O
me	O
