that	O

all	O
we	O

our	B-PER

He	O
was	O
a	B-PER
very	I-PER
silent	I-PER
man	I-PER
by	O
custom	O

All	O
day	O
he	O
hung	O
round	O

upon	O
the	B-LOC

with	O
a	O
brass	O

all	O

he	O
sat	O
in	O
a	B-FAC
corner	I-FAC

next	I-FAC
the	I-FAC
fire	I-FAC

Mostly	O
he	O
would	O

the	B-PER

came	I-PER
about	I-PER

Every	O
day	O
when	O

would	O

if	O
any	O

men	I-PER
had	O
gone	O
by	O
along	O
the	B-FAC
road	I-FAC

At	O
first	O
we	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
company	O
of	O
his	O
own	O

that	O
made	O
him	O
ask	O
this	O

at	O

we	O

How	O
that	B-PER

haunted	O
my	O

I	O
need	O
scarcely	O
tell	O

On	O
stormy	O
nights	O

the	O

shook	O

four	O
corners	O
of	O
the	B-FAC

along	O
the	B-LOC

up	O

in	O

with	O

the	O

altogether	O

There	O
were	O

In	O

indeed	O

he	O

at	O

my	B-PER

If	O

the	B-PER

through	O

my	B-PER

out	O

I	O
have	O

I	O

sure	O
the	O

have	O
greatly	O

All	O
the	O

with	O
us	O
the	B-PER

made	O
no	O

to	O

though	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
annoyance	O
when	O
it	O

I	O
remember	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
his	O
coat	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
patched	O
himself	O
upstairs	B-FAC

his	B-FAC

and	O
which	O
,	O
before	O

nothing	O

He	O
never	O
wrote	O

he	O
never	O

that	O
was	O
towards	O
the	O

,	O
when	O
my	B-PER

far	O

a	O

that	O

him	O
off	O

Dr.	B-PER
Livesey	I-PER
came	O
late	O
one	O
afternoon	O
to	O
see	O
the	B-PER
patient	I-PER
,	O
took	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
dinner	O
from	O
my	B-PER
mother	I-PER
,	O
and	O
went	O
into	O
the	B-FAC
parlour	I-FAC
to	O
smoke	O
a	O
pipe	O
until	O
his	O
horse	O
should	O
come	O
down	O
from	O
the	B-GPE
hamlet	I-GPE
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
stabling	O
at	O
the	B-FAC
old	I-FAC
Benbow	I-FAC
.	O

I	O
followed	O
him	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
remember	O
observing	O
the	O
contrast	O
the	B-PER
neat	I-PER
,	I-PER
bright	I-PER
doctor	I-PER
,	O
with	O
his	O
powder	O
as	O
white	O
as	O
snow	O
and	O
his	O
bright	O
,	O
black	O
eyes	O
and	O
pleasant	O
manners	O
,	O
made	O
with	O
the	B-PER
coltish	I-PER
country	I-PER
folk	I-PER
,	O
and	O
above	O
all	O
,	O
with	O
that	B-PER
filthy	I-PER
,	I-PER
heavy	I-PER
,	I-PER
bleared	I-PER
scarecrow	I-PER
of	I-PER
a	I-PER

sitting	O
,	O
far	O
gone	O
in	O
rum	O
,	O
with	O
his	O
arms	O
on	O
the	O
table	O

Suddenly	O
he	O
--	O
the	B-PER
captain	I-PER
,	O
that	O
is	O
--	O
began	O
to	O
pipe	O
up	O
his	O
eternal	O
song	O
:	O
"	O

At	O
first	O
I	O
had	O
supposed	O
"	O
the	B-PER

upstairs	B-FAC

and	O
the	O
thought	O
had	O
been	O
mingled	O
in	O
my	O
nightmares	O
with	O
that	O
of	O
the	B-PER
one-legged	I-PER
seafaring	I-PER
man	I-PER

But	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
we	O
had	O
all	O
long	O
ceased	O
to	O
pay	O
any	O
particular	O
notice	O
to	O
the	O
song	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
new	O
,	O
that	O
night	O
,	O
to	O
nobody	B-PER
but	I-PER
Dr.	I-PER
Livesey	I-PER
,	O
and	O
on	O
him	O
I	O
observed	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
produce	O
an	O
agreeable	O
effect	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
looked	O
up	O
for	O
a	O
moment	O
quite	O
angrily	O
before	O
he	O
went	O
on	O
with	O
his	O
talk	O
to	O
old	O
Taylor	B-PER
,	O
the	B-PER
gardener	I-PER
,	O
on	O
a	O
new	O
cure	O
for	O
the	O
rheumatics	O

In	O
the	O
meantime	O
,	O
the	B-PER
captain	I-PER
gradually	O
brightened	O
up	O
at	O
his	O
own	O
music	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
flapped	O
his	O
hand	O
upon	O
the	O
table	O

him	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
we	O
all	O
knew	O
to	O

Dr.	B-PER
