Such	O
an	B-PER

naturally	O
attracted	O
the	B-PER

they	O
stopped	O

A	B-PER
tall	I-PER
,	I-PER
elegant	I-PER
girl	I-PER
looked	O
at	O
Montraville	B-PER

blushed	O
:	O
he	O
instantly	O
recollected	O
the	O

of	O
Charlotte	B-PER

At	O
that	O

a	B-PER
very	I-PER
lovely	I-PER
child	I-PER

she	O
being	O

she	O
passed	O
,	O
awakened	O
in	O
his	O
bosom	O
new	O
and	O
pleasing	O
ideas	O

Vanity	O
led	O
him	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
pleasure	O
at	O
again	O
beholding	O
him	O
might	O
have	O
occasioned	O
the	O
emotion	O
he	O
had	O

and	O
the	O

vanity	O
led	O
him	O
to	O
wish	O
to	O
see	O
her	O
again	O

“	O
She	O

the	B-PER

“	O
Did	O
you	O
not	O
notice	O
her	O

continued	O
Montraville	B-PER
:	O
“	O
she	O

with	O
a	O

of	O
the	O

“	O

“	O

Montraville	B-PER

Charlotte	B-GPE

too	O
great	O
an	O
impression	O
on	O
his	O

to	O

Montraville	B-PER

on	O
