CHAPTER	O
I	O
THERE	O
IS	O
NO	B-PER
ONE	I-PER
LEFT	O
When	O
Mary	B-PER
Lennox	I-PER
was	O
sent	O
to	O
Misselthwaite	B-FAC
Manor	I-FAC
to	O
live	O
with	O
her	B-PER
uncle	I-PER
everybody	B-PER
said	O
she	O
was	O
the	B-PER
most	I-PER
disagreeable-looking	I-PER
child	I-PER
ever	I-PER
seen	I-PER
.	O

It	O
was	O
true	O
,	O
too	O
.	O

She	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
thin	O
face	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
thin	O
body	O
,	O
thin	O
light	O
hair	O
and	O
a	O
sour	O
expression	O
.	O

Her	O
hair	O
was	O
yellow	O
,	O
and	O
her	O
face	O
was	O
yellow	O
because	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
born	O
in	O
India	B-GPE
and	O
had	O
always	O
been	O
ill	O
in	O
one	O
way	O
or	O
another	O
.	O

Her	B-PER
father	I-PER
had	O
held	O
a	O
position	O
under	O
the	B-ORG
English	I-ORG
Government	I-ORG
and	O
had	O
always	O
been	O
busy	O
and	O
ill	O
himself	O
,	O
and	O
her	B-PER
mother	I-PER
had	O
been	O
a	O
great	O
beauty	O
who	O
cared	O
only	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
parties	O
and	O
amuse	O
herself	O
with	O
gay	B-PER
people	I-PER
.	O

She	O
had	O
not	O
wanted	O
a	B-PER
little	I-PER
girl	I-PER
at	O
all	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
Mary	B-PER
was	O
born	O
she	O
handed	O
her	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
care	O
of	O
an	B-PER
Ayah	I-PER
,	I-PER
who	I-PER
was	I-PER
made	I-PER
to	I-PER
understand	I-PER
that	I-PER
if	I-PER
she	I-PER
wished	I-PER
to	I-PER
please	I-PER
the	I-PER
Mem	I-PER
Sahib	I-PER
she	I-PER
must	I-PER
keep	I-PER
the	I-PER
child	I-PER
out	I-PER
of	I-PER
sight	I-PER
as	I-PER
much	I-PER
as	I-PER
possible	I-PER
.	O

So	O
when	O
she	O
was	O
a	B-PER
sickly	I-PER
,	I-PER
fretful	I-PER
,	I-PER
ugly	I-PER
little	I-PER
baby	I-PER
she	O
was	O
kept	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
she	O
became	O
a	B-PER
sickly	I-PER
,	I-PER
fretful	I-PER
,	I-PER
toddling	I-PER
thing	I-PER
she	O
was	O
kept	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
also	O
.	O

She	O
never	O
remembered	O
seeing	O
familiarly	O
anything	O
but	O
the	O
dark	O
faces	O
of	O
her	B-PER
Ayah	I-PER
and	O
the	B-PER
other	I-PER
native	I-PER
servants	I-PER
,	O
and	O
as	O
they	O
always	O
obeyed	O
her	O
and	O
gave	O
her	O
her	O
own	O
way	O
in	O
everything	O
,	O
because	O
the	B-PER
Mem	I-PER
Sahib	I-PER
would	O
be	O
angry	O
if	O
she	O
was	O
disturbed	O
by	O
her	O
crying	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
time	O
she	O
was	O
six	O
years	O
old	O
she	O
was	O
as	B-PER
tyrannical	I-PER
and	I-PER
selfish	I-PER
a	I-PER
little	I-PER
pig	I-PER
as	I-PER
ever	I-PER
lived	I-PER
.	O

The	B-PER
young	I-PER
English	I-PER
governess	I-PER
who	I-PER
came	I-PER
to	I-PER
teach	I-PER
her	I-PER
to	I-PER
read	I-PER
and	I-PER
write	I-PER
disliked	O
her	O
so	O
much	O
that	O
she	O
gave	O
up	O
her	O
place	O
in	O
three	O
months	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
other	B-PER
governesses	I-PER
came	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
fill	O
it	O
they	O
always	O
went	O
away	O
in	O
a	O
shorter	O
time	O
than	O
the	B-PER
first	I-PER
one	I-PER
.	O

So	O
if	O
Mary	B-PER
had	O
not	O
chosen	O
to	O
really	O
want	O
to	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
read	O
books	O
she	O
would	O
never	O
have	O
learned	O
her	O
letters	O
at	O
all	O
.	O

One	O
frightfully	O
hot	O
morning	O
,	O
when	O
she	O
was	O
about	O
nine	O
years	O
old	O
,	O
she	O
awakened	O
feeling	O
very	O
cross	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
became	O
crosser	O
still	O
when	O
she	O
saw	O
that	O
the	B-PER
servant	I-PER
who	I-PER
stood	I-PER
by	I-PER
her	I-PER
bedside	I-PER
was	O
not	O
her	B-PER
Ayah	I-PER
.	O

"	O
Why	O
did	O
you	O
come	O
?	O
"	O
she	O
said	O
to	O
the	B-PER
strange	I-PER
woman	I-PER
.	O

"	O
I	O
will	O
not	O
let	O
you	O
stay	O
.	O

Send	O
my	B-PER
Ayah	I-PER
to	O
me	O
.	O
"	O

The	B-PER
woman	I-PER
looked	O
frightened	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
only	O
stammered	O
that	O
the	B-PER
Ayah	I-PER
could	O
not	O
come	O
and	O
when	O
Mary	B-PER
threw	O
herself	O
into	O
a	O
passion	O
and	O
beat	O
and	O
kicked	O
her	O
,	O
she	O
looked	O
only	O
more	O
frightened	O
and	O
repeated	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
possible	O
for	O
the	B-PER
Ayah	I-PER
to	O
come	O
to	O
Missie	B-PER
Sahib	I-PER
.	O

There	O
was	O
something	O
mysterious	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
that	O
morning	O
.	O

Nothing	O
was	O
done	O
in	O
its	O
regular	O
order	O
and	O
several	B-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
native	I-PER
servants	I-PER
seemed	O
missing	O
,	O
while	O
those	O
whom	O
Mary	B-PER
saw	O
slunk	O
or	O
hurried	O
about	O
with	O
ashy	O
and	O
scared	O
faces	O
.	O

But	O
no	B-PER
one	I-PER
would	O
tell	O
her	O
anything	O
and	O
her	B-PER
Ayah	I-PER
did	O
not	O
come	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
actually	O
left	O
alone	O
as	O
the	O
morning	O
went	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
she	O
wandered	O
out	O
into	O
the	B-FAC
garden	I-FAC
and	O
began	O
to	O
play	O
by	O
herself	O
under	O
a	O
tree	O
near	O
the	B-FAC
veranda	I-FAC
.	O

She	O
pretended	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
making	O
a	O
flower-bed	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
stuck	O
big	O
scarlet	O
hibiscus	O
blossoms	O
into	O
little	O
heaps	O
of	O
earth	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
growing	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
angry	O
and	O
muttering	O
to	O
herself	O
the	O
things	O
she	O
would	O
say	O
and	O
the	O
names	O
she	O
would	O
call	O
Saidie	B-PER
when	O
she	O
returned	O

"	O

Daughter	B-PER
of	I-PER
Pigs	I-PER

"	O
she	O
said	O
,	O
because	O
to	O
call	O
a	B-PER
native	I-PER
a	O
pig	O
is	O
the	O
worst	O
insult	O
of	O
all	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
grinding	O
her	O
teeth	O
and	O
saying	O
this	O
over	O
and	O
over	O
again	O
when	O
she	O
heard	O
her	B-PER
mother	I-PER
come	O
out	O
on	O
the	B-FAC
veranda	I-FAC
with	O
some	B-PER
one	I-PER
.	O

She	O
was	O
with	O
a	B-PER
fair	I-PER
young	I-PER
man	I-PER
and	O
they	O
stood	O
talking	O
together	O
in	O
low	O
strange	O
voices	O

Mary	O
knew	O
the	B-PER
fair	I-PER
young	I-PER
man	I-PER
who	I-PER
looked	I-PER
like	I-PER
a	I-PER
boy	I-PER

She	O
had	O
heard	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
a	B-PER
very	I-PER
young	I-PER
officer	I-PER
who	I-PER
had	I-PER
just	I-PER
come	I-PER
from	I-PER
England	I-PER
.	O

The	B-PER
child	I-PER
stared	O
at	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
stared	O
most	O
at	O
her	B-PER
mother	I-PER
.	O

She	O
always	O
did	O
this	O
when	O
she	O
had	O
a	O
chance	O
to	O
see	O
her	O
,	O
because	O
the	B-PER
Mem	I-PER

Mary	B-PER
used	O
to	O
call	O
her	O
that	O
oftener	O

wore	O
such	O

Her	O
hair	O
was	O

she	O
had	O
a	O
delicate	O

which	O

to	O

and	O
she	O
had	O
large	O

All	O
her	O

Mary	B-PER

her	O

At	O

and	O
she	O

the	B-FAC

After	O
that	O

appalling	O
things	O
happened	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
mysteriousness	O
of	O
the	O
morning	O
was	O
explained	O
to	O
Mary	B-PER
.	O

The	O
cholera	O
had	O
broken	O
out	O
in	O
its	O
most	O
fatal	O
form	O
and	O
people	B-PER
were	O
dying	O
like	O
flies	O

The	B-PER
Ayah	I-PER
had	O
been	O
taken	O
ill	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
because	O
she	O
had	O
just	O
died	O
that	O
the	B-PER
servants	I-PER
had	O
wailed	O
in	O
the	B-FAC

Before	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
three	B-PER
other	I-PER
servants	I-PER
were	O
dead	O

others	O
had	O
run	O
away	O
in	O
terror	O

There	O
was	O
panic	O
on	O
every	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
dying	B-PER
people	I-PER
in	O
all	O
the	B-FAC

During	O
the	O
confusion	O
and	O
bewilderment	O
of	O
the	O
second	O
day	O
Mary	B-PER
hid	O
herself	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
nursery	I-FAC
and	O
was	O
forgotten	O
by	O
everyone	B-PER
.	O

Nobody	B-PER
thought	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
nobody	B-PER
wanted	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
strange	O
things	O
happened	O
of	O
which	O
she	O
knew	O
nothing	O
.	O

Mary	O
alternately	O
cried	O
and	O
slept	O
through	O
the	O
hours	O
.	O

She	O
only	O
knew	O
that	O
people	B-PER
were	O
ill	O
and	O
that	O
she	O
heard	O
mysterious	O
and	O
frightening	O
sounds	O
.	O

Once	O
she	O
crept	O
into	O
the	B-FAC
dining-room	I-FAC
and	O
found	O
it	O
empty	O
,	O
though	O
a	O
partly	O
finished	O
meal	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
table	O
and	O
chairs	O
and	O
plates	O
looked	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
hastily	O
pushed	O
back	O
when	O
the	B-PER
diners	I-PER
rose	O
suddenly	O
for	O
some	O
reason	O
.	O

The	B-PER
child	I-PER
ate	O
some	O
fruit	O
and	O
biscuits	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
thirsty	O
she	O
drank	O
a	O
glass	O
of	O
wine	O
which	O
stood	O
nearly	O
filled	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
sweet	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
how	O
strong	O
it	O
was	O
.	O

Very	O
soon	O
it	O
made	O
her	O
intensely	O
drowsy	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
her	B-FAC
nursery	I-FAC
and	O
shut	O
herself	O
in	O
again	O
,	O
frightened	O
by	O
cries	O
she	O
heard	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
huts	I-FAC
and	O
by	O
the	O
hurrying	O
sound	O
of	O
feet	O
.	O

The	O
wine	O
made	O
her	O
so	O
sleepy	O
that	O
she	O
could	O
scarcely	O
keep	O
her	O
eyes	O
open	O
and	O
she	O
lay	O
down	O
on	O
her	O
bed	O
and	O
knew	O
nothing	O
more	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
.	O

Many	O
things	O
happened	O
during	O
the	O
hours	O
in	O
which	O
she	O
slept	O
so	O
heavily	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
was	O
not	O
disturbed	O
by	O
the	O
wails	O
and	O
the	O
sound	O
of	O
things	O
being	O
carried	O
in	O
and	O
out	O
of	O
the	B-FAC
bungalow	I-FAC
.	O

When	O
she	O
awakened	O
she	O
lay	O
and	O
stared	O
at	O
the	O
wall	O
.	O

The	B-FAC
house	I-FAC
was	O
perfectly	O
still	O
.	O

She	O
had	O
never	O
known	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
silent	O
before	O
.	O

She	O
heard	O
neither	O
voices	O
nor	O
footsteps	O
,	O
and	O
wondered	O
if	O
everybody	B-PER
had	O
got	O
well	O
of	O
the	O
cholera	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
trouble	O
was	O
over	O
.	O

She	O
wondered	O
also	O
who	O
would	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
her	O
now	O
her	B-PER
Ayah	I-PER
was	O
dead	O
.	O

There	O
would	O
be	O
a	B-PER
new	I-PER
Ayah	I-PER
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
she	O
would	O
know	O
some	O
new	O
stories	O
.	O

Mary	B-PER
had	O
been	O
rather	O
tired	O
of	O
the	O
old	O
ones	O
.	O

She	O
did	O
not	O
cry	O
because	O
her	B-PER
nurse	I-PER
had	O
died	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
not	O
an	B-PER
affectionate	I-PER
child	I-PER
and	O
had	O
never	O
cared	O
much	O

The	O
noise	O
and	O
hurrying	O
about	O
and	O
wailing	O
over	O
the	O
cholera	O
had	O
frightened	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
angry	O
because	O
no	B-PER
one	I-PER
seemed	O
to	O
remember	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
alive	O

Everyone	B-PER
was	O
too	O
panic-stricken	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
a	B-PER
little	I-PER
girl	I-PER
no	I-PER
one	I-PER
was	I-PER
fond	I-PER
of	I-PER

When	O
people	B-PER
had	O
the	O
cholera	O
it	O
seemed	O
that	O
they	O
remembered	O
nothing	O
but	O
themselves	O

But	O
if	O
everyone	B-PER
had	O
got	O
well	O
again	O
,	O
surely	O
some	O
one	O
would	O
remember	O
and	O
come	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
her	O
.	O

But	O
no	B-PER
one	I-PER
came	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
she	O
lay	O
waiting	O
the	B-FAC
house	I-FAC
seemed	O
to	O
grow	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
silent	O
.	O

She	O
heard	O
something	O
rustling	O
on	O
the	O
matting	O
and	O
when	O
she	O
looked	O
down	O
she	O
saw	O
a	O
little	O
snake	O
gliding	O
along	O
and	O
watching	O
her	O
with	O
eyes	O
like	O
jewels	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
not	O
frightened	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
harmless	O
little	O
thing	O
who	O
would	O
not	O
hurt	O
her	O
and	O
he	O
seemed	O
in	O
a	O
hurry	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
the	B-FAC
room	I-FAC

He	O
slipped	O
under	O
the	O
door	O

him	O

Almost	O
the	O

she	O

footsteps	O
