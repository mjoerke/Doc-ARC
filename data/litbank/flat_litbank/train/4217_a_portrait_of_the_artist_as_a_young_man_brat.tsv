Then	O
Jack	B-PER

It	O

After	O

to	O
Simon	B-PER
Moonan	I-PER
and	O
said	O
:	O
--	O
We	O
all	O
know	O
why	O
you	O
speak	O
.	O

You	O
are	O
McGlade	B-PER
's	O
suck	O
.	O

Suck	O
was	O
a	O
queer	O
word	O
.	O

The	B-PER
fellow	I-PER
called	O
Simon	B-PER
Moonan	I-PER
that	O
name	O
because	O
Simon	B-PER
Moonan	I-PER
used	O
to	O
tie	O
the	B-PER
prefect	I-PER
's	O
false	O
sleeves	O
behind	O
his	O
back	O
and	O
the	B-PER
prefect	I-PER
used	O
to	O
let	O
on	O
to	O
be	O
angry	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
sound	O
was	O
ugly	O
.	O

Once	O
he	O
had	O
washed	O
his	O
hands	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
lavatory	I-FAC
of	I-FAC
the	I-FAC
Wicklow	I-FAC
Hotel	I-FAC
and	O
his	B-PER
father	I-PER
pulled	O
the	O
stopper	O
up	O
by	O
the	O
chain	O
after	O
and	O
the	O
dirty	O
water	O
went	O
down	O
through	O
the	O
hole	O
in	O
the	O
basin	O
.	O

And	O
when	O
it	O
had	O
all	O
gone	O
down	O
slowly	O
the	O
hole	O
in	O
the	O
basin	O
had	O
made	O
a	O
sound	O
like	O
that	O
:	O
suck	O
.	O

Only	O
louder	O
.	O

To	O
remember	O
that	O
and	O
the	O
white	O
look	O
of	O
the	O
lavatory	O
made	O
him	O
feel	O
cold	O
and	O
then	O
hot	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
two	O
cocks	O
that	O
you	O
turned	O
and	O
water	O
came	O
out	O
:	O
cold	O
and	O
hot	O
.	O

He	O
felt	O
cold	O
and	O
then	O
a	O
little	O
hot	O
:	O
and	O
he	O
could	O
see	O
the	O
names	O
printed	O
on	O
the	O
cocks	O
.	O

That	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
queer	O
thing	O
.	O

And	O
the	O
air	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
corridor	I-FAC
chilled	O
him	O
too	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
queer	O
and	O
wettish	O
.	O

But	O
soon	O
the	O
gas	O
would	O
be	O
lit	O
and	O
in	O
burning	O
it	O
made	O
a	O
light	O
noise	O
like	O
a	O
little	O
song	O
.	O

Always	O
the	O
same	O
:	O
and	O
when	O
the	B-PER
fellows	I-PER
stopped	O
talking	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
playroom	I-FAC
you	O
could	O
hear	O
it	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
hour	O
for	O
sums	O
.	O

Father	B-PER
Arnall	I-PER
wrote	O
a	O
hard	O
sum	O
on	O
the	O
board	O
and	O
then	O
said	O
:	O
--	O
Now	O
then	O
,	O
who	O
will	O
win	O
?	O

Go	O
ahead	O
,	O
York	O
!	O

Go	O
ahead	O
,	O
Lancaster	O

Stephen	B-PER
tried	O
his	O
best	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
sum	O
was	O
too	O
hard	O
and	O
he	O
felt	O
confused	O
.	O

The	O
little	O
silk	O
badge	O
with	O
the	O
white	O
rose	O
on	O
it	O
that	O
was	O
pinned	O
on	O
the	O
breast	O
of	O
his	O
jacket	O
began	O
to	O
flutter	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
no	O
good	O
at	O
sums	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
tried	O
his	O
best	O
so	O
that	O
York	B-GPE
might	O
not	O
lose	O
.	O

Father	B-PER
Arnall	I-PER
's	O
face	O
looked	O
very	O
black	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
wax	O
:	O
he	O
was	O
laughing	O
.	O

Then	O
Jack	B-PER
Lawton	I-PER
cracked	O
his	O
fingers	O
and	O
Father	B-PER
Arnall	I-PER
looked	O
at	O
his	O
copybook	O
and	O
said	O
:	O
--	O
Right	O

Bravo	O

Come	O

Jack	B-PER
Lawton	I-PER
looked	O
over	O
from	O
his	O
side	O
.	O

The	O
little	O
silk	O
badge	O
with	O
the	O
red	O
rose	O
on	O
it	O
looked	O
very	O
rich	O
because	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
blue	O
sailor	O
top	O
on	O
.	O

Stephen	B-PER
felt	O
his	O
own	O
face	O
red	O
too	O
,	O
thinking	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
bets	O
about	O
who	O
would	O
get	O
first	O
place	O
in	O
elements	O
,	O
Jack	B-PER
Lawton	I-PER
or	O
he	O
.	O

Some	O
weeks	O
Jack	B-PER
Lawton	I-PER
got	O
the	O
card	O
for	O
first	O
and	O
some	O
weeks	O
he	O
got	O
the	O
card	O
for	O
first	O
.	O

His	O
white	O
silk	O
badge	O
fluttered	O
and	O
fluttered	O
as	O
he	O
worked	O
at	O
the	O
next	O
sum	O
and	O
heard	O
Father	B-PER
Arnall	I-PER
's	O
voice	O
.	O

Then	O
all	O
his	O
eagerness	O
passed	O
away	O
and	O
he	O
felt	O
his	O
face	O
quite	O
cool	O
.	O

He	O
thought	O
his	O
face	O
must	O
be	O
white	O
because	O
it	O
felt	O
so	O
cool	O
.	O

He	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
out	O
the	O
answer	O
for	O
the	O
sum	O
but	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
matter	O
.	O

White	O
roses	O
and	O
red	O
roses	O
:	O
those	O
were	O
beautiful	O
colours	O
to	O
think	O
of	O

And	O
the	O
cards	O
for	O
first	O
place	O
and	O
second	O
place	O
and	O
third	O
place	O
were	O
beautiful	O
colours	O
too	O
:	O
pink	O
and	O
cream	O
and	O
lavender	O

Lavender	O
and	O
cream	O
and	O
pink	O
roses	O
were	O
beautiful	O
to	O
think	O
of	O

Perhaps	O
a	O
wild	O
rose	O
might	O
be	O
like	O
those	O
colours	O
and	O
he	O
remembered	O
the	O
song	O
about	O
the	O
wild	O
rose	O
blossoms	O
on	O
the	O
little	O
green	O
place	O

But	O
you	O

a	O
