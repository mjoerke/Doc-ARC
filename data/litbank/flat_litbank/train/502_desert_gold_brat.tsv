Cameron	B-PER
came	O
forth	O
out	O

greeted	O
his	B-PER

whom	I-PER
he	I-PER

for	I-PER

Cameron	B-PER
resented	O
the	O
breaking	O
of	O
his	O

campfire	O
vigil	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
respected	O
the	O
law	O
of	O
the	B-LOC
desert	I-LOC

The	B-PER
stranger	I-PER
thanked	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
slipped	O
the	O
pack	O
from	O
his	O
burro	O

Then	O
he	O
rolled	O
out	O
his	O
pack	O
and	O
began	O
preparations	O
for	O
a	O
meal	O

His	O
movements	O
were	O
slow	O
and	O
methodical	O

Cameron	B-PER
watched	O
him	O
,	O
still	O
with	O
resentment	O
,	O
yet	O
with	O
a	O
curious	O
and	O
growing	O
interest	O

The	O
campfire	O
burst	O
into	O
a	O
bright	O

and	O
by	O
its	O
light	O
Cameron	B-PER
saw	O
a	B-PER
man	I-PER
whose	I-PER
gray	I-PER
hair	I-PER
somehow	I-PER
did	I-PER
not	I-PER
seem	I-PER
to	I-PER
make	I-PER
him	I-PER
old	I-PER
,	I-PER
and	I-PER
whose	I-PER
stooped	I-PER
shoulders	I-PER
did	I-PER
not	I-PER
detract	I-PER
from	I-PER
an	I-PER
impression	I-PER
of	I-PER
rugged	I-PER
strength	I-PER
.	O

"	O
Find	O
any	O

"	O
asked	O
Cameron	B-PER
,	O
presently	O
.	O

His	B-PER
visitor	I-PER
looked	O
up	O
quickly	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
startled	O
by	O
the	O
sound	O
of	O
a	O
human	O
voice	O
.	O

He	O
replied	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	B-PER
two	I-PER
men	I-PER
talked	O
a	O
little	O
.	O

But	O
the	B-PER
stranger	I-PER
evidently	O
preferred	O
silence	O
.	O

Cameron	B-PER
understood	O
that	O
.	O

He	O
laughed	O
grimly	O
and	O
bent	O
a	O
keener	O
gaze	O
upon	O
the	O
furrowed	O
,	O
shadowy	O
face	O

Another	O
of	O
those	B-PER
strange	I-PER
desert	I-PER
prospectors	I-PER
in	I-PER
whom	I-PER
there	I-PER
was	I-PER
some	I-PER
relentless	I-PER
driving	I-PER
power	I-PER
besides	I-PER
the	I-PER
lust	I-PER
for	I-PER
gold	I-PER
!	O

Cameron	B-PER
felt	O
that	O
between	O
this	B-PER
man	I-PER
and	O
himself	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
subtle	O
affinity	O
,	O
vague	O
and	O
undefined	O
,	O
perhaps	O
born	O
of	O
the	O
divination	O
that	O
here	O
was	O
a	B-PER
desert	I-PER
wanderer	I-PER
like	O
himself	O
,	O
perhaps	O
born	O
of	O
a	O
deeper	O
,	O
an	O
unintelligible	O
relation	O
having	O
its	O
roots	O
back	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
.	O

A	O
long-forgotten	O
sensation	O
stirred	O
in	O
Cameron	B-PER
's	O
breast	O
,	O
one	O
so	O
long	O
forgotten	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
recognize	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
was	O
akin	O
to	O
pain	O
.	O

II	O
When	O
he	O
awakened	O
he	O
found	O
,	O
to	O
his	O
surprise	O
,	O
that	O
his	B-PER
companion	I-PER
had	O
departed	O

A	O
trail	O
in	O
the	O
sand	O

off	O
to	O
the	O
north	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
water	O
in	O
that	O
direction	O

Cameron	B-PER
shrugged	O
his	O
shoulders	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
his	O
affair	O
;	O
he	O
had	O
his	O
own	O
problems	O
.	O

And	O
straightway	O
he	O
forgot	O
his	B-PER
strange	I-PER
visitor	I-PER
.	O

Cameron	B-PER
began	O
his	O
day	O
,	O
grateful	O
for	O
the	O
solitude	O
that	O
was	O
now	O
unbroken	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
canyon-furrowed	B-LOC
and	O
cactus-spired	O
scene	O
that	O
now	O
showed	O
no	O
sign	O
of	O
life	O

He	O
traveled	O
southwest	O
,	O
never	O
straying	O
far	O
from	O
the	B-LOC
dry	I-LOC
stream	I-LOC
bed	I-LOC
;	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
desultory	O
way	O
,	O
without	O
eagerness	O
,	O
he	O
hunted	O
for	O
signs	O
of	O
gold	O

The	O
work	O
was	O
toilsome	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
periods	O
of	O
rest	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
indulged	O
were	O
not	O

He	O
rested	O
to	O
look	O

What	O
the	B-LOC
vast	I-LOC

meant	O
to	O
him	O

always	O
been	O
a	O

That	O

There	O
down	O

Cameron	B-PER

the	O

In	O

the	O

the	B-LOC

his	B-PER

Cameron	B-PER

The	O

Cameron	B-PER
