CHAPTER	O
I	O
It	O
was	O
a	O
Sunday	O
evening	O
in	O
October	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
common	O
with	O
many	B-PER
other	I-PER
young	I-PER
ladies	I-PER
of	I-PER
her	I-PER
class	I-PER
,	O
Katharine	B-PER
Hilbery	I-PER
was	O
pouring	O
out	O
tea	O
.	O

Perhaps	O
a	O
fifth	O
part	O
of	O
her	O
mind	O
was	O
thus	O
occupied	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
remaining	O
parts	O
leapt	O
over	O
the	O
little	O
barrier	O
of	O
day	O
which	O
interposed	O
between	O
Monday	O
morning	O
and	O
this	O
rather	O
subdued	O
moment	O
,	O
and	O
played	O
with	O
the	O
things	O
one	O
does	O
voluntarily	O
and	O
normally	O
in	O
the	O
daylight	O
.	O

But	O
although	O
she	O
was	O
silent	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
evidently	O
mistress	B-PER
of	O
a	O
situation	O
which	O
was	O
familiar	O
enough	O
to	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
inclined	O
to	O
let	O
it	O
take	O
its	O
way	O
for	O
the	O
six	O
hundredth	O
time	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
without	O
bringing	O
into	O
play	O
any	O
of	O
her	O
unoccupied	O
faculties	O
.	O

A	O
single	O
glance	O
was	O
enough	O
to	O
show	O
that	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Hilbery	I-PER
was	O
so	O
rich	O
in	O
the	O
gifts	O
which	O
make	O
tea-parties	O
of	O
elderly	B-PER
distinguished	I-PER
people	I-PER
successful	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
scarcely	O
needed	O
any	O
help	O
from	O
her	B-PER
daughter	I-PER
,	O
provided	O
that	O
the	O
tiresome	O
business	O
of	O
teacups	O
and	O
bread	O
and	O
butter	O
was	O
discharged	O
for	O
her	O
.	O

Considering	O
that	O
the	B-PER
little	I-PER
party	I-PER
had	O
been	O
seated	O
round	O
the	O
tea-table	O
for	O
less	O
than	O
twenty	O
minutes	O
,	O
the	O
animation	O
observable	O
on	O
their	O
faces	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
sound	O
they	O
were	O
producing	O
collectively	O
,	O
were	O
very	O
creditable	O
to	O
the	B-PER
hostess	I-PER
.	O

It	O
suddenly	O
came	O
into	O
Katharine	B-PER
’s	O
mind	O
that	O
if	O
some	B-PER
one	I-PER
opened	O
the	O
door	O
at	O
this	O
moment	O
he	O
would	O
think	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
enjoying	O
themselves	O
;	O
he	O
would	O
think	O
,	O
“	O
What	O
an	B-FAC
extremely	I-FAC
nice	I-FAC
house	I-FAC
to	O
come	O
into	O
!	O
”	O

and	O
instinctively	O
she	O
laughed	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
something	O
to	O
increase	O
the	O
noise	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
credit	O
of	O
the	B-FAC
house	I-FAC
presumably	O
,	O
since	O
she	O
herself	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
feeling	O
exhilarated	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
very	O
same	O
moment	O
,	O
rather	O
to	O
her	O
amusement	O
,	O
the	O
door	O
was	O
flung	O
open	O
,	O
and	O
a	B-PER
young	I-PER
man	I-PER
entered	O
the	B-FAC
room	I-FAC
.	O

Katharine	B-PER
,	O
as	O
she	O
shook	O
hands	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
asked	O
him	O
,	O
in	O
her	O
own	O
mind	O
,	O
“	O
Now	O
,	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
we	O
’re	O
enjoying	O
ourselves	O
enormously	O
?	O
”	O

...	O
“	O
Mr.	B-PER
Denham	I-PER
,	O
mother	B-PER
,	O
”	O
she	O
said	O
aloud	O
,	O
for	O
she	O
saw	O
that	O
her	B-PER
mother	I-PER
had	O
forgotten	O
his	O
name	O
.	O

That	O
fact	O
was	O
perceptible	O
to	O
Mr.	B-PER
Denham	I-PER
also	O
,	O
and	O
increased	O
the	O
awkwardness	O
which	O
inevitably	O
attends	O
the	O
entrance	O
of	O
a	B-PER
stranger	I-PER
into	O
a	B-FAC
room	I-FAC
full	I-FAC
of	I-FAC
people	I-FAC
much	I-FAC
at	I-FAC
their	I-FAC
ease	I-FAC
,	I-FAC
and	I-FAC
all	I-FAC
launched	I-FAC
upon	I-FAC
sentences	I-FAC
.	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
Mr.	B-PER
Denham	I-PER
as	O
if	O
a	O
thousand	O
softly	O
padded	O
doors	O
had	O
closed	O
between	O
him	O
and	O
the	B-FAC
street	I-FAC
outside	I-FAC

A	O
fine	O
mist	O
,	O
the	O
etherealized	O
essence	O
of	O
the	O
fog	O
,	O
hung	O
visibly	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
wide	I-FAC
and	I-FAC
rather	I-FAC
empty	I-FAC
space	I-FAC
of	I-FAC
the	I-FAC
drawing-room	I-FAC
,	O
all	O
silver	O
where	O
the	O
candles	O
were	O
grouped	O
on	O
the	B-FAC
tea-table	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
ruddy	O
again	O
in	O
the	O
firelight	O

With	O
the	O
omnibuses	O
and	O
cabs	O
still	O
running	O
in	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
body	O
still	O
tingling	O
with	O
his	O
quick	O
walk	O
along	O
the	B-FAC
streets	I-FAC

in	O
and	O
out	O
of	O
traffic	O
and	O
foot-passengers	B-PER
,	O
this	B-FAC
drawing-room	I-FAC
seemed	O
very	O
remote	O
and	O
still	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
faces	O
of	O
the	B-PER
elderly	I-PER
people	I-PER
were	O
mellowed	O
,	O
at	O
some	O
distance	O
from	O
each	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
bloom	O
on	O
them	O
owing	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
air	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
drawing-room	I-FAC
was	O
thickened	O
by	O
blue	O
grains	O
of	O

Mr.	B-PER
Denham	I-PER
had	O
come	O
in	O
as	O
Mr.	B-PER
Fortescue	I-PER
,	O
the	B-PER
eminent	I-PER
novelist	I-PER
,	O
reached	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
long	O
sentence	O
.	O

He	O
kept	O
this	O
suspended	O
while	O
the	B-PER
newcomer	I-PER
sat	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Hilbery	I-PER
deftly	O
joined	O
the	O
severed	O
parts	O
by	O
leaning	O
towards	O
him	O
and	O
remarking	O
:	O
“	O
Now	O
,	O
what	O
would	O
you	O
do	O
if	O
you	O
were	O
married	O
to	O
an	B-PER
engineer	I-PER
,	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
Manchester	B-GPE

Mr.	B-PER
Denham	I-PER
?	O
”	O

“	O
Surely	O
she	O
could	O
learn	O
Persian	O
,	O
”	O
broke	O
in	O
a	B-PER
thin	I-PER
,	I-PER
elderly	I-PER
gentleman	I-PER
.	O

“	O
Is	O
there	O
no	O
retired	B-PER
schoolmaster	I-PER

man	B-PER
of	I-PER
letters	I-PER

“	O
A	B-PER
cousin	I-PER

married	O
and	O
gone	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
Manchester	B-GPE
,	O
”	O
Katharine	B-PER
explained	O
.	O

Mr.	B-PER
Denham	I-PER
muttered	O
something	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
indeed	O
all	O
that	O
was	O
required	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
the	B-PER
novelist	I-PER
went	O
on	O
where	O
he	O
had	O
left	O
off	O
.	O

Privately	O
,	O
Mr.	B-PER
Denham	I-PER
cursed	O
himself	O
very	O
sharply	O
for	O
having	O
exchanged	O
the	O
freedom	O
of	O
the	B-FAC
street	I-FAC
for	O
this	B-FAC
sophisticated	I-FAC
drawing-room	I-FAC
,	O
where	O
,	O
among	O
other	B-PER
disagreeables	I-PER
,	O
he	O
certainly	O
would	O
not	O
appear	O
at	O
his	O
best	O
.	O

He	O
glanced	O
round	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
that	O
,	O
save	O
for	O
Katharine	B-PER
,	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
over	O
forty	O
,	O
the	O
only	O
consolation	O
being	O
that	O
Mr.	B-PER
Fortescue	I-PER
was	O
a	B-PER
considerable	I-PER
celebrity	I-PER
,	O
so	O
that	O
to-morrow	O
one	O
might	O
be	O
glad	O
to	O
have	O
met	O
him	O
.	O

“	O
Have	O
you	O
ever	O
been	O
to	O
Manchester	B-GPE
?	O
”	O

he	O
asked	O
Katharine	B-PER
.	O

“	O
Never	O
,	O
”	O
she	O
replied	O
.	O

“	O
Why	O
do	O
you	O
object	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
then	O
?	O
”	O

Katharine	B-PER
stirred	O
her	O
tea	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
speculate	O
,	O
so	O
Denham	B-PER
thought	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
duty	O
of	O
filling	O
somebody	B-PER
else	I-PER
’s	O
cup	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
was	O
really	O
wondering	O
how	O
she	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
keep	O
this	B-PER
strange	I-PER
young	I-PER
man	I-PER
in	O
harmony	O
with	O
the	B-PER
rest	I-PER
.	O

She	O
observed	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
compressing	O
his	O
teacup	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
danger	O
lest	O
the	O
thin	O
china	O
might	O
cave	O
inwards	O
.	O

She	O
could	O
see	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
nervous	O
;	O
one	O
would	O
expect	O
a	B-PER
bony	I-PER
young	I-PER
man	I-PER
with	O
his	O
face	O
slightly	O
reddened	O
by	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
hair	O
not	O
altogether	O
smooth	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
nervous	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
party	O
.	O

Further	O
,	O
he	O
probably	O
disliked	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
come	O
out	O
of	O
curiosity	O
,	O
or	O
because	O
her	B-PER
father	I-PER
had	O
invited	O
him	O
--	O
anyhow	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
easily	O
combined	O
with	O
the	B-PER
rest	I-PER

“	O
I	O
should	O
think	O
there	O

be	O
no	B-PER
one	I-PER
to	O

she	O
replied	O
at	O
random	O
.	O

Mr.	B-PER
Fortescue	I-PER
had	O
been	O
observing	O
her	O
for	O
a	O
moment	O
or	O
two	O
,	O
as	O
novelists	B-PER
are	O
inclined	O
to	O
observe	O

and	O
at	O
this	O
remark	O
he	O
smiled	O

and	O
made	O
it	O
the	O
text	O
for	O
a	O
little	O
further	O
speculation	O

the	O
tips	O

Mr.	B-PER
Hilbery	I-PER
here	O
interposed	O
so	O
far	O
as	O
Denham	B-PER
was	O
concerned	O

and	O
talked	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
sense	O
about	O
the	B-PER

profession	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
changes	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
seen	O
in	O
his	O
lifetime	O

Indeed	O
,	O
Denham	B-PER
properly	O
fell	O
to	O
his	O
lot	O
,	O
owing	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
an	O
article	O

Denham	B-PER
upon	O
some	O
legal	O
matter	O
,	O
published	O

Mr.	B-PER

when	O
a	O
moment	O
later	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Sutton	I-PER

announced	O

he	O
turned	O
to	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
Mr.	B-PER
Denham	I-PER
found	O
himself	O
sitting	O
silent	O
,	O
rejecting	O
possible	O
things	O
to	O
say	O

beside	O
Katharine	B-PER

who	O
was	O
silent	O
too	O

Being	O
much	O
about	O
the	O

both	O
under	O

they	O
were	O
prohibited	O
from	O

of	O

They	O
were	O
further	O
silenced	O
by	O
Katharine	B-PER

rather	O
malicious	O
determination	O
not	O
to	O
help	O
this	B-PER
young	I-PER
man	I-PER

in	O
whose	O
upright	O

bearing	O
she	O
detected	O
something	O
hostile	O
to	O
her	O

by	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
usual	O
feminine	O

They	O
therefore	O
sat	O
silent	O

Denham	B-PER
controlling	O
his	O
desire	O
