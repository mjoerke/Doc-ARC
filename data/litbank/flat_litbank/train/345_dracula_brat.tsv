Buda-Pesth	B-GPE
seems	O
a	B-GPE
wonderful	I-GPE
place	I-GPE

from	O
the	O

I	O
got	O

the	O
little	O
I	O
could	O

I	O
feared	O
to	O
go	O
very	O
far	O
from	O
the	B-FAC

as	O
we	O

arrived	O

would	O

as	O
near	O
the	O

The	O
impression	O
I	O
had	O
was	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
leaving	O
the	B-LOC
West	I-LOC

entering	O
the	B-LOC

us	O

left	O
in	O
pretty	O
good	O
time	O

and	O
came	O
after	O
nightfall	O
to	O
Klausenburgh	B-GPE

Here	B-FAC
I	O
stopped	O
for	O
the	O
night	O
at	O

I	O
had	O

a	O

I	O

he	O
said	O
it	O
was	O

that	O

that	O

a	B-PER

enter	O

some	O

a	O

the	B-VEH

started	O
a	O
little	O
before	O

the	B-FAC

7:30	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
sit	O
in	O
the	B-VEH
carriage	I-VEH
for	O
more	O
than	O
an	O
hour	O
before	O
we	O
began	O
to	O

It	O
seems	O
to	O

that	O
the	O

more	O

All	O
day	O
long	O
we	O
seemed	O
to	O
dawdle	O
through	O
a	B-GPE
country	I-GPE
which	I-GPE
was	I-GPE
full	I-GPE
of	I-GPE
beauty	I-GPE
of	I-GPE
every	I-GPE
kind	I-GPE
.	O

Sometimes	O
we	O
saw	O
little	B-GPE
towns	I-GPE
or	O
castles	B-FAC
on	I-FAC
the	I-FAC
top	I-FAC
of	I-FAC
steep	I-FAC
hills	I-FAC
such	I-FAC
as	I-FAC
we	I-FAC
see	I-FAC
in	I-FAC
old	I-FAC
missals	I-FAC
;	O
sometimes	O
we	O
ran	O
by	O
rivers	B-LOC
and	I-LOC
streams	I-LOC
which	O
seemed	O
from	O
the	O
wide	O
stony	O
margin	O
on	O
each	O
side	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
subject	O
to	O
great	O

It	O
takes	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
water	O

and	O
running	O
strong	O
,	O
to	O
sweep	O
the	O
outside	O

of	O
a	O

At	O
every	B-FAC
station	I-FAC
there	O
were	O
groups	B-PER
of	I-PER
people	I-PER
,	O
sometimes	O
crowds	B-PER
,	O
and	O
in	O
all	O
sorts	O
of	O
attire	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
just	O
like	O
the	B-PER
peasants	I-PER
at	I-PER
home	I-PER
or	O
those	B-PER
I	I-PER
saw	I-PER
coming	I-PER
through	I-PER
France	I-PER
and	I-PER
Germany	I-PER
,	O
with	O
short	O
jackets	O
and	O
round	O
hats	O
and	O
home-made	O
trousers	O
;	O
but	O
others	O
were	O
very	O
picturesque	O
.	O

The	B-PER
women	I-PER
looked	O
pretty	O
,	O
except	O
when	O
you	O
got	O
near	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
clumsy	O
about	O
the	O
waist	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
all	O
full	O
white	O
sleeves	O
of	O
some	O
kind	O
or	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
big	O
belts	O
with	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
strips	O
of	O
something	O
fluttering	O
from	O
them	O
like	O
the	O
dresses	O
in	O
a	O
ballet	O
,	O
but	O
of	O
course	O
there	O
were	O
petticoats	O
under	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
strangest	O
figures	O
we	O
saw	O
were	O
the	B-PER
Slovaks	I-PER
,	O
who	O
were	O
more	O
barbarian	O
than	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
big	O
cow-boy	O
hats	O
,	O
great	O
baggy	O
dirty-white	O

white	O
linen	O

and	O
enormous	O

nearly	O
a	O
foot	O
wide	O
,	O
all	O
studded	O
over	O

They	O
wore	O
high	O
boots	O

with	O
their	O

tucked	O

them	O

and	O
had	O
long	O
black	O
hair	O

heavy	O
black	O

They	O
are	O
very	O
picturesque	O
,	O
but	O
do	O
not	O
look	O
prepossessing	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
stage	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
set	O
down	O
at	O
once	O
as	O
some	O
old	B-PER
Oriental	I-PER
band	I-PER

They	O
are	O

I	O
found	O
that	O
my	B-PER
landlord	I-PER
had	O
got	O
a	O
letter	O
from	O
the	B-LOC
Count	I-LOC
,	O
directing	O
him	O
to	O
secure	O
the	O
best	O
place	O
on	O
the	B-VEH
coach	I-VEH
for	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
on	O
making	O
inquiries	O
as	O
to	O
details	O
he	O
seemed	O
somewhat	O
reticent	O
,	O
and	O
pretended	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
understand	O
my	O
German	O
.	O

This	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
true	O
,	O
because	O
up	O
to	O
then	O
he	O
had	O
understood	O
it	O
perfectly	O
;	O
at	O
least	O
,	O
he	O
answered	O
my	O
questions	O
exactly	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
.	O

He	O
and	O
his	B-PER
wife	I-PER
,	O
the	B-PER
old	I-PER
lady	I-PER
who	I-PER
had	I-PER
received	I-PER
me	I-PER
,	O
looked	O
at	O
each	O
other	O
in	O
a	O
frightened	O
sort	O
of	O
way	O
.	O

He	O
mumbled	O
out	O
that	O
the	O
money	O
had	O
been	O
sent	O
in	O
a	O
letter	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
all	O
he	O
knew	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
he	O
knew	O
Count	B-PER
Dracula	I-PER
,	O
and	O
could	O
tell	O
me	O
anything	O
of	O
his	B-FAC
castle	I-FAC
,	O
both	O
he	O
and	O
his	B-PER
wife	I-PER
crossed	O
themselves	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
saying	O
that	O
they	O
knew	O
nothing	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
simply	O
refused	O
to	O
speak	O
further	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
so	O
near	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
starting	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
time	O
to	O
ask	O
any	B-PER
one	I-PER
else	I-PER
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
very	O
mysterious	O
and	O
not	O
by	O
any	O
means	O
comforting	O
.	O

Just	O
before	O
I	O
was	O
leaving	O
,	O
the	B-PER
old	I-PER
lady	I-PER
came	O
up	O
to	O
my	B-FAC
room	I-FAC
and	O
said	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
hysterical	O
way	O
:	O
"	O
Must	O
you	O
go	O
?	O

Oh	O

young	B-PER
Herr	I-PER

must	O
you	O

She	O
was	O
in	O
such	O
an	O
excited	O
state	O
that	O
she	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
lost	O
her	O
grip	O
of	O
what	O
German	O
she	O
knew	O
,	O
and	O
mixed	O
it	O
all	O
up	O
with	O
some	O
other	O
language	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
at	O
all	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
just	O
able	O
to	O
follow	O
her	O
by	O
asking	O
many	O
questions	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
told	O
her	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
go	O
at	O
once	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
engaged	O
on	O
important	O
business	O
,	O
she	O
asked	O
again	O
:	O
"	O
Do	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
day	O
it	O
is	O
?	O
"	O

I	O
answered	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
fourth	O
of	O
May	O
.	O

She	O
shook	O
her	O
head	O
as	O
she	O
said	O
again	O
:	O
"	O
Oh	O
,	O
yes	O
!	O

I	O
know	O
that	O

I	O
know	O
that	O

"	O

On	O
my	O
saying	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
,	O
she	O
went	O
on	O
:	O
"	O

She	O
was	O
in	O
such	O
evident	O
distress	O
that	O
I	O
tried	O
to	O
comfort	O
her	O
,	O
but	O
without	O
effect	O
.	O

Finally	O
she	O
went	O
down	O
on	O
her	O
knees	O
and	O
implored	O
me	O
not	O
to	O
go	O
;	O
at	O
least	O
to	O
wait	O
a	O
day	O
or	O
two	O
before	O
starting	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
all	O
very	O
ridiculous	O
but	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
feel	O
comfortable	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
business	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
allow	O
nothing	O
to	O
interfere	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
therefore	O
tried	O
to	O
raise	O
her	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
,	O
as	O
gravely	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
thanked	O
her	O
,	O
but	O
my	O
duty	O
was	O
imperative	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
go	O
.	O

She	O
then	O
rose	O
and	O
dried	O
her	O
eyes	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
a	O
crucifix	O
from	O
her	O
neck	O
offered	O
it	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
an	B-PER
English	I-PER
Churchman	I-PER
,	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
taught	O
to	O
regard	O
such	O
things	O
as	O
in	O
some	O
measure	O
idolatrous	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
it	O
seemed	O
so	O
ungracious	O
to	O
refuse	O
an	B-PER
old	I-PER
lady	I-PER
meaning	I-PER
so	I-PER
well	I-PER

in	I-PER
such	I-PER
a	I-PER

She	O
saw	O

I	O
suppose	O

the	O
doubt	O
in	O
my	O
face	O
,	O
for	O
she	O
put	O
the	O
rosary	O
round	O
my	O

said	O
,	O
"	O

your	B-PER

sake	O

went	O
out	O
