My	B-PER
father	I-PER
had	O
a	B-FAC
small	I-FAC
estate	I-FAC
in	I-FAC
Nottinghamshire	I-FAC
:	O
I	O
was	O
the	B-PER
third	I-PER

five	I-PER

He	O

Emanuel	B-FAC
College	I-FAC
in	O
Cambridge	B-GPE
at	O
fourteen	O
years	O
old	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
resided	O
three	O

and	O
applied	O
myself	O
close	O

of	O
maintaining	O
me	O
,	O
although	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
scanty	O
allowance	O
,	O
being	O
too	O
great	O
for	O
a	O
narrow	O

I	O
was	O
bound	O

Mr.	B-PER
James	I-PER
Bates	I-PER

an	B-PER

surgeon	I-PER

with	O
whom	O
I	O
continued	O
four	O
years	O

My	B-PER
father	I-PER
now	O
and	O
then	O
sending	O
me	O
small	O
sums	O
of	O

I	O
laid	O

out	O
in	O
learning	O
navigation	O

useful	O
to	O
those	O
who	O
intend	O
to	O
travel	O

as	O
I	O

would	O
be	O
,	O
some	O
time	O
or	O

my	O

When	O
I	O
left	O
Mr.	B-PER
Bates	I-PER

I	O
went	O
down	O
to	O
my	B-PER
father	I-PER
:	O
where	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
assistance	O
of	O
him	O
and	O
my	B-PER
uncle	I-PER
John	B-PER
,	O
and	O
some	B-PER
other	I-PER
relations	I-PER

I	O
got	O
forty	O

and	O
a	O
promise	O
of	O
thirty	O

a	O
year	O
to	O
maintain	O
me	O
at	O
Leyden	B-GPE
:	O
there	B-GPE
I	O
studied	O
physic	O
two	O

and	O
seven	O
months	O
,	O
knowing	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
useful	O
in	O
long	O
voyages	O

Soon	O
after	O
my	O
return	O
from	O
Leyden	B-GPE
,	O
I	O
was	O
recommended	O
by	O
my	B-PER
good	I-PER
master	I-PER
,	O
Mr.	B-PER
Bates	I-PER
,	O
to	O
be	O

the	I-PER
Swallow	I-PER

Captain	B-PER
Abraham	I-PER
Pannel	I-PER

commander	B-PER
;	O
with	O
whom	O
I	O
continued	O
three	O
years	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
,	O
making	O
a	O
voyage	O
or	O
two	O
into	O
the	B-LOC
Levant	I-LOC
,	O
and	O
some	B-LOC
other	I-LOC
parts	I-LOC
.	O

When	O
I	O
came	O
back	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
settle	O
in	O
London	B-GPE
;	O
to	O
which	O
Mr.	B-PER
Bates	I-PER
,	O
my	B-PER
master	I-PER
,	O
encouraged	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
him	O
I	O
was	O
recommended	O
to	O
several	B-PER
patients	I-PER
.	O

I	O
took	O
part	O
of	O
a	B-FAC
small	I-FAC
house	I-FAC
in	I-FAC
the	I-FAC
Old	I-FAC
Jewry	I-FAC
;	O
and	O
being	O
advised	O
to	O
alter	O
my	O
condition	O

I	O
married	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Mary	I-PER

Newgate-street	B-FAC

with	O
whom	O
I	O
received	O
four	O
hundred	O
pounds	O
for	O
a	O

But	O
my	B-PER
good	I-PER
master	I-PER
Bates	B-PER
dying	O
in	O
two	O
years	O
after	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
having	O
few	B-PER
friends	I-PER
,	O
my	B-ORG
business	I-ORG
began	O
to	O
fail	O
;	O
for	O
my	O
conscience	O
would	O
not	O
suffer	O
me	O
to	O
imitate	O
the	O
bad	O
practice	O
of	O
too	O
many	O
among	O
my	B-PER
brethren	I-PER
.	O

Having	O
therefore	O
consulted	O
with	O
my	B-PER
wife	I-PER
,	O
and	O
some	B-PER
of	I-PER
my	I-PER
acquaintance	I-PER
,	O
I	O
determined	O
to	O
go	O
again	O
to	O
sea	B-LOC
.	O

I	O
was	O
surgeon	B-PER
successively	O
in	O
two	B-VEH
ships	I-VEH
,	O
and	O
made	O
several	O
voyages	O
,	O
for	O
six	O
years	O
,	O
to	O
the	B-LOC
East	I-LOC
and	I-LOC
West	I-LOC
Indies	I-LOC
,	O
by	O
which	O
I	O
got	O
some	O
addition	O
to	O
my	O
fortune	O
.	O

My	O
hours	O
of	O
leisure	O
I	O
spent	O
in	O
reading	O
the	B-PER
best	I-PER
authors	I-PER
,	I-PER
ancient	I-PER
and	I-PER
modern	I-PER
,	O
being	O
always	O
provided	O
with	O
a	O
good	O
number	O
of	O
books	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
ashore	O
,	O
in	O
observing	O
the	O
manners	O
and	O
dispositions	O
of	O
the	B-PER
people	I-PER
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
learning	O
their	O
language	O
;	O
wherein	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
facility	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
my	O
memory	O
.	O

The	O
last	O
of	O
these	O
voyages	O
not	O
proving	O
very	O
fortunate	O
,	O
I	O
grew	O
weary	O
of	O
the	B-LOC
sea	I-LOC
,	O
and	O
intended	O
to	O
stay	O
at	O
home	B-FAC
with	O
my	B-PER
wife	I-PER
and	O
family	B-PER
.	O

I	O
removed	O
from	O
the	B-FAC
Old	I-FAC
Jewry	I-FAC
to	O
Fetter	B-FAC
Lane	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
Wapping	B-FAC
,	O
hoping	O
to	O
get	O
business	O
among	O
the	B-PER
sailors	I-PER
;	O
but	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
turn	O
to	O
account	O
.	O

After	O
three	O
years	O
expectation	O
that	O
things	O
would	O
mend	O
,	O
I	O
accepted	O
an	O
advantageous	O
offer	O
from	O
Captain	B-PER
William	I-PER
Prichard	I-PER
,	O
master	B-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
Antelope	I-PER
,	O
who	O
was	O
making	O
a	O
voyage	O
to	O
the	B-LOC
South	I-LOC
Sea	I-LOC
.	O

We	O
set	O
sail	O
from	O
Bristol	B-GPE
,	O
May	O

,	O
1699	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
voyage	O
was	O
at	O
first	O
very	O
prosperous	O
.	O

It	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
proper	O
,	O
for	O
some	O
reasons	O
,	O
to	O
trouble	O
the	B-PER
reader	I-PER
with	O
the	O
particulars	O
of	O
our	O
adventures	O
in	O
those	B-LOC
seas	I-LOC
;	O
let	O
it	O
suffice	O
to	O
inform	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
our	O
passage	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
the	B-LOC
East	I-LOC
Indies	I-LOC
,	O
we	O
were	O
driven	O
by	O
a	O
violent	O
storm	O
to	O
the	O
north-west	O
of	O
Van	B-GPE
Diemen	I-GPE
’s	I-GPE
Land	I-GPE
.	O

By	O
an	O
observation	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
ourselves	O
in	O
the	B-LOC
latitude	I-LOC
of	I-LOC
30	I-LOC
degrees	I-LOC
2	I-LOC
minutes	I-LOC
south	I-LOC
.	O

Twelve	B-PER
of	I-PER
our	I-PER
crew	I-PER
were	O
dead	O
by	O
immoderate	O
labour	O
and	O
ill	O
food	O
;	O
the	B-PER

were	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
weak	O
condition	O

On	O
the	O
5th	O
of	O
November	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
summer	O
in	O
those	B-LOC
parts	I-LOC
,	O
the	O
weather	O
being	O
very	O
hazy	O
,	O
the	B-PER
seamen	I-PER
spied	O
a	O
rock	O
within	O
half	O
a	O
cable	O
’s	O
length	O
of	O
the	B-VEH
ship	I-VEH
;	O
but	O
the	O
wind	O
was	O
so	O
strong	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
driven	O
directly	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
split	O

Six	B-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
crew	I-PER

of	O
whom	O
I	O
was	O
one	O
,	O
having	O
let	O
down	O
the	B-VEH
boat	I-VEH
into	O
the	B-LOC
sea	I-LOC
,	O
made	O
a	O
shift	O
to	O
get	O
clear	O
of	O
the	B-VEH
ship	I-VEH
and	O
the	O
rock	O
.	O

We	O
rowed	O
,	O
by	O
my	O
computation	O
,	O
about	O
three	O
leagues	O
,	O
till	O
we	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
work	O
no	O

already	O
spent	O
with	O
labour	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	B-VEH
ship	I-VEH

We	O
therefore	O
trusted	O
ourselves	O
to	O
the	O
mercy	O
of	O
the	O
waves	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
about	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
the	B-VEH
boat	I-VEH
was	O
overset	O
by	O
a	O
sudden	O

What	O
became	O
of	O
my	B-PER
companions	I-PER
in	I-PER
the	I-PER
boat	I-PER
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
of	O
those	B-PER

escaped	I-PER
on	I-PER
the	I-PER
rock	I-PER

or	I-PER

I	O
can	O

For	O
my	O
own	O
part	O

I	O
swam	O
as	O
fortune	O
directed	O
me	O

and	O
was	O
pushed	O
forward	O
by	O
wind	O

I	O
often	O
let	O
my	O

could	O

when	O
I	O
was	O
almost	O
gone	O

able	O
to	O

no	O

I	O
found	O
myself	O
within	O
my	O
depth	O
;	O
and	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
the	O
storm	O
was	O
much	O
abated	O

The	B-LOC
declivity	I-LOC
was	O
so	O
small	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
walked	O
near	O
a	O
mile	O
before	O
I	O
got	O
to	O
the	B-LOC
shore	I-LOC
,	O
which	O
I	O
conjectured	O
was	O
about	O
eight	O
o’clock	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O

I	O
then	O
advanced	O
forward	O
near	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O

but	O
could	O
not	O
discover	O
any	O
sign	O
of	O
houses	B-FAC

inhabitants	B-PER
;	O
at	O

I	O
was	O
in	O
so	O
weak	O
a	O
condition	O

that	O
I	O
did	O
not	O

I	O
was	O
extremely	O

about	O
half	O

that	O
I	O
drank	O
as	O
I	O
left	O
the	B-VEH
ship	I-VEH

I	O
found	O
myself	O
much	O
inclined	O
to	O
sleep	O

I	O
lay	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
grass	O

which	O
was	O
very	O
short	O

soft	O

where	O
I	O

sounder	O

I	O

as	O
I	O
reckoned	O

about	O
nine	O

I	O

I	O
found	O
my	O

tied	O
down	O
in	O
the	O

I	O

from	O
my	O

the	O

offended	O

I	O
heard	O

in	O

In	O
a	O

I	O
felt	O
something	O
alive	O

In	O

At	O
length	O

struggling	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
fortune	O
to	O
break	O
the	O

wrench	O
out	O
the	O

;	O
for	O

by	O
lifting	O
it	O
up	O
to	O
my	O

I	O
discovered	O
the	O
methods	O
they	O
had	O
taken	O
to	O
bind	O
me	O

and	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
with	O
a	O
violent	O
pull	O
,	O
which	O
gave	O
me	O
excessive	O
pain	O

I	O
a	O
little	O
loosened	O
the	O
strings	O
that	O
tied	O
down	O
my	O
hair	O
on	O
the	O

so	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
just	O
able	O
to	O
turn	O
my	O

about	O
two	O

But	O
the	O

ran	O
off	O
a	O

before	O
I	O
could	O
seize	O
them	O

whereupon	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
shout	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
shrill	O
accent	O

and	O
after	O
it	O
ceased	O
I	O
heard	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
cry	O
aloud	O
_	O
Tolgo	O
phonac	O

;	O
when	O
in	O
an	O
instant	O
I	O
felt	O
above	O
a	O
hundred	O
arrows	O
discharged	O
on	O
my	O
left	O
hand	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
pricked	O
me	O
like	O
so	O
many	O
needles	O
;	O
and	O
besides	O
,	O
they	O
shot	O
another	O
flight	O
into	O
the	O
air	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
do	O
bombs	O
in	O
Europe	B-GPE

whereof	O
many	O
,	O
I	O
suppose	O

fell	O
on	O
my	O

I	O

some	O
on	O
my	O

which	O
I	O
immediately	O
covered	O
with	O
my	O

When	O
this	O

was	O
over	O

fell	O
a	O

then	O

discharged	O
another	O

larger	O

the	O

some	O
of	O
them	O
attempted	O
with	O

to	O
stick	O
me	O

by	O
good	O

had	O
on	O
a	O
buff	O
jerkin	O

which	O
they	O
could	O

I	O
thought	O
it	O
the	O
most	O
prudent	O
method	O
to	O
lie	O
still	O

and	O
my	O
design	O
was	O
to	O
continue	O

my	O
left	O

myself	O

as	O
for	O
the	B-PER

I	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
a	O
match	O
for	O
the	O
greatest	O
army	O
they	O
could	O
bring	O
against	O
me	O

all	O

him	O

When	O
the	B-PER

was	O
quiet	O

they	O
discharged	O
no	O

by	O
the	O
noise	O
I	O
heard	O

about	O
four	O

cut	O
the	O

the	O

He	O
acted	O
every	O

an	B-PER

I	O
could	O

others	O
of	O

I	O
answered	O

a	O

in	O
the	O

He	O
descended	O
from	O

commanded	O
that	O
several	O

on	O
which	O
above	O
a	B-PER
hundred	I-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
inhabitants	I-PER
mounted	O

walked	O
towards	O
my	O
mouth	O

laden	O
with	O

full	O
of	O
meat	O

which	O
had	O
been	O

sent	O
thither	O
by	O
the	B-PER
king	I-PER

orders	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
first	O
intelligence	O
he	O
received	O
of	O
me	O

I	O
observed	O
there	O
was	O
the	O
flesh	O
of	O
several	O
animals	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
not	O
distinguish	O
them	O
by	O
the	O
taste	O

There	O
were	O
shoulders	O
,	O
legs	O
,	O
and	O
loins	O
,	O
shaped	O
like	O
those	O
of	O
mutton	O

very	O
well	O
dressed	O
,	O
but	O
smaller	O
than	O
the	O
wings	O
of	O
a	O

I	O
ate	O
them	O
by	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
at	O
a	O
mouthful	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
three	O
loaves	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
,	O
about	O
the	O
bigness	O
of	O
musket	O

They	O
supplied	O
me	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
showing	O
a	O
thousand	O
marks	O
of	O
wonder	O
and	O
astonishment	O
at	O
my	O
bulk	O

appetite	O

I	O
then	O
made	O
another	O
sign	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
wanted	O
drink	O

They	O
found	O
by	O
my	O
eating	O
that	O
a	O
small	O
quantity	O
would	O
not	O
suffice	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
being	O
a	B-PER
most	I-PER
ingenious	I-PER
people	I-PER
,	O
they	O
slung	O
up	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
dexterity	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
largest	O
hogsheads	O

then	O
rolled	O
it	O
towards	O
my	O
hand	O

and	O
beat	O
out	O
the	O
top	O
;	O
I	O
drank	O
it	O
off	O
at	O
a	O
draught	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
might	O
well	O
do	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
hold	O
half	O
a	O
pint	O
,	O
and	O
tasted	O
like	O
a	O
small	O
wine	O
of	O
Burgundy	B-LOC
,	O
but	O
much	O
more	O
delicious	O
.	O

They	O
brought	O
me	O
a	O
second	O
hogshead	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
drank	O
in	O
the	O

made	O

they	O
had	O
none	O
to	O
give	O
me	O

When	O
I	O
had	O
performed	O
these	O
wonders	O
,	O
they	O
shouted	O
for	O
joy	O
,	O
and	O
danced	O
upon	O
my	O

at	O

They	O
made	O
me	O
a	O
sign	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
throw	O
down	O
the	O
two	O
hogsheads	O
,	O

first	O
warning	O
the	B-PER

when	O
they	O

was	O
a	O

I	O
confess	O
I	O
was	O
often	O
tempted	O
,	O
while	O
they	O
were	O
passing	O
backwards	O
and	O
forwards	O
on	O
my	O
body	O
,	O
to	O
seize	O
forty	O

fifty	O

that	O
came	O
in	O
my	O
reach	O
,	O
and	O

them	O
against	O
the	O

But	O
the	O
remembrance	O
of	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
felt	O
,	O
which	O
probably	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
the	O
worst	O
they	O
could	O
do	O

and	O
the	O

I	O
made	O
them	O
—	O
for	O
so	O
I	O
interpreted	O
my	O
submissive	O
behaviour	O
—	O
soon	O
drove	O
out	O
these	O
imaginations	O

Besides	O
,	O
I	O
now	O
considered	O
myself	O
as	O
bound	O
by	O
the	O

of	O

However	O

in	O
my	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
sufficiently	O
wonder	O

the	O
intrepidity	O

I	O
once	O
more	O
thought	O
of	O
attempting	O
to	O
break	O
my	O
bonds	O
;	O
but	O
again	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
felt	O
the	O
smart	O
of	O
their	O
arrows	O
upon	O
my	O
face	O
and	O
hands	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
all	O
in	O
blisters	O
,	O
and	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
darts	O
still	O
sticking	O
in	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
observing	O
likewise	O
that	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
my	B-PER
enemies	I-PER
increased	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
tokens	O
to	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
do	O
with	O
me	O
what	O
they	O
pleased	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
the	O
_	O
hurgo	O
_	O
and	O
his	O
train	O
withdrew	O
,	O
with	O
much	O
civility	O
and	O
cheerful	O
countenances	O
.	O

Soon	O
after	O
I	O
heard	O
a	B-PER
general	I-PER
shout	O
,	O
with	O
frequent	O
repetitions	O
of	O
the	O
words	O
_	O
Peplom	O
selan	O
_	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
felt	O
great	B-PER
numbers	I-PER
of	I-PER
people	I-PER
on	I-PER
my	I-PER
left	I-PER
side	I-PER
relaxing	O
the	O
cords	O
to	O
such	O
a	O
degree	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
turn	O
upon	O
my	O
right	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
ease	O
myself	O
with	O
making	O
water	O
;	O
which	O
I	O
very	O
plentifully	O
did	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
great	O
astonishment	O
of	O
the	B-PER
people	I-PER
;	O
who	O
,	O
conjecturing	O
by	O
my	O
motion	O
what	O
I	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
immediately	O
opened	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
and	O
left	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
,	O
to	O
avoid	O
the	O
torrent	O
,	O
which	O
fell	O
with	O
such	O
noise	O
and	O
violence	O
from	O
me	O
.	O

But	O
before	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
daubed	O
my	O
face	O
and	O
both	O
my	O
hands	O
with	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
ointment	O
,	O
very	O
pleasant	O
to	O
the	O
smell	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
,	O
removed	O
all	O
the	O
smart	O
of	O
their	O
arrows	O
.	O

These	O
circumstances	O
,	O
added	O
to	O
the	O
refreshment	O
I	O
had	O
received	O
by	O
their	O
victuals	O
and	O
drink	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
very	O
nourishing	O
,	O
disposed	O
me	O
to	O
sleep	O

I	O
slept	O
about	O
eight	O
hours	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
afterwards	O
assured	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
no	O
wonder	O

for	O
the	B-PER
physicians	I-PER

by	O
