The	B-VEH

been	O
struck	O
by	O
two	O
torpedoes	O
in	O

was	O

while	O
the	B-VEH

were	O
being	O

with	O
all	O

The	B-PER
women	I-PER
and	O
children	B-PER
were	O
being	O
lined	O
up	O
awaiting	O
their	O
turn	O

Some	O
still	O
clung	O

to	O

fathers	B-PER
;	O
others	O
clutched	O
their	B-PER

closely	O

One	B-PER

stood	O
alone	O
,	O
slightly	O

She	O
was	O
quite	O

not	O

eighteen	O

She	O
did	O
not	O
seem	O
afraid	O

and	O
her	O
grave	O

steadfast	O
eyes	O
looked	O

A	B-PER

her	O
start	O

She	O
had	O
noticed	O
the	B-PER
speaker	I-PER
more	O
than	O
once	O
amongst	O
the	B-PER
first-class	I-PER
passengers	I-PER

There	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
hint	O
of	O
mystery	O
about	O
him	O
which	O
had	O
appealed	O
to	O
her	O
imagination	O

He	O
spoke	O
to	O
no	B-PER
one	I-PER

If	O
anyone	B-PER
spoke	O
to	O
him	O
he	O
was	O
quick	O
to	O
rebuff	O
the	O
overture	O

Also	O
he	O
had	O
a	O

way	O
of	O

over	O
his	O

with	O
a	O
swift	O
,	O
suspicious	O
glance	O

She	O
noticed	O
now	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
greatly	O
agitated	O

There	O
were	O
beads	O
of	O
perspiration	O
on	O
his	O
brow	O

He	O
was	O
evidently	O
in	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
overmastering	O
fear	O

And	O
yet	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
strike	O
her	O
as	O
the	B-PER
kind	I-PER
of	I-PER
