Again	O

I	O

go	O
to	O
sea	B-LOC

because	O

the	O

The	O
act	O

is	O
perhaps	O
the	O

that	O
the	B-PER

what	O

it	O

The	O
urbane	O

with	O
which	O
a	B-PER

receives	O

is	O
really	O
marvellous	O

that	O

the	O

Finally	O

I	O
always	O
go	O
to	O
sea	B-LOC
as	O
a	B-PER

repeatedly	O
smelt	O
the	B-LOC
sea	I-LOC
as	O

I	O
