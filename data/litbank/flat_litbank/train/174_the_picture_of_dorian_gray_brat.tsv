CHAPTER	O
1	O
The	B-FAC
studio	I-FAC
was	O
filled	O
with	O
the	O
rich	O
odour	O
of	O
roses	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
the	O
light	O
summer	O
wind	O
stirred	O
amidst	O
the	O
trees	O
of	O
the	B-FAC
garden	I-FAC
,	O
there	O
came	O
through	O
the	O
open	O
door	O
the	O
heavy	O
scent	O
of	O
the	O
lilac	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
more	O
delicate	O
perfume	O
of	O
the	O
pink-flowering	O
thorn	O

From	O
the	O
corner	O
of	O
the	O
divan	O
of	O
Persian	O
saddle-bags	O
on	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
lying	O
,	O
smoking	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
his	O
custom	O
,	O
innumerable	O
cigarettes	O
,	O
Lord	B-PER
Henry	I-PER
Wotton	I-PER
could	O
just	O
catch	O
the	O
gleam	O
of	O
the	O
honey-sweet	O
and	O
honey-coloured	O
blossoms	O
of	O
a	O
laburnum	O
,	O
whose	O
tremulous	O
branches	O
seemed	O
hardly	O
able	O
to	O
bear	O
the	O
burden	O
of	O
a	O
beauty	O
so	O
flamelike	O
as	O
theirs	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
fantastic	O
shadows	O
of	O
birds	O
in	O
flight	O
flitted	O
across	O
the	O
long	O
tussore-silk	O
curtains	O
that	O
were	O
stretched	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
huge	O
window	O
,	O
producing	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
momentary	O
Japanese	O
effect	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
him	O
think	O
of	O
those	O
pallid	O
,	O
jade-faced	O
painters	O
of	O
Tokyo	B-GPE
who	O
,	O
through	O
the	O
medium	O
of	O
an	O
art	O
that	O
is	O
necessarily	O
immobile	O
,	O
seek	O
to	O
convey	O
the	O
sense	O
of	O
swiftness	O
and	O
motion	O
.	O

The	O
sullen	O
murmur	O
of	O
the	O
bees	O
shouldering	O
their	O
way	O
through	O
the	O
long	O
unmown	O
grass	O
,	O
or	O
circling	O
with	O
monotonous	O
insistence	O
round	O
the	O
dusty	O
gilt	O
horns	O
of	O
the	O
straggling	O
woodbine	O
,	O
seemed	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
stillness	O
more	O
oppressive	O
.	O

The	O
dim	O
roar	O
of	O
London	B-GPE
was	O
like	O
the	O
bourdon	O
note	O
of	O
a	O
distant	O

In	O
the	O
centre	O
of	O
the	B-FAC

,	O
clamped	O
to	O
an	O
upright	O
easel	O

stood	O
the	O
full-length	O
portrait	O
of	O
a	B-PER

of	I-PER
extraordinary	I-PER

,	O
and	O
in	O

it	O

some	O

was	O
sitting	O
the	B-PER

himself	I-PER
,	O
Basil	B-PER
Hallward	I-PER
,	O
whose	O
sudden	O

some	O
years	O
ago	O
caused	O

at	O
the	O
time	O

such	O
public	O
excitement	O
and	O
gave	O
rise	O
to	O
so	O
many	O
strange	O
conjectures	O
.	O

As	O
the	B-PER
painter	I-PER
looked	O
at	O
the	O
gracious	O
and	O
comely	O
form	O
he	O
had	O
so	O
skilfully	O
mirrored	O
in	O
his	O
art	O
,	O
a	O
smile	O
of	O
pleasure	O
passed	O
across	O
his	O
face	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
about	O
to	O
linger	O
there	O
.	O

But	O
he	O
suddenly	O
started	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
closing	O
his	O
eyes	O
,	O
placed	O
his	O
fingers	O
upon	O
the	O
lids	O
,	O
as	O
though	O
he	O
sought	O
to	O
imprison	O
within	O
his	O
brain	O
some	O
curious	O
dream	O
from	O
which	O
he	O
feared	O
he	O
might	O
awake	O
