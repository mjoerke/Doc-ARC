CAN	O
any	O
thing	O
,	O
my	B-PER
good	I-PER
Sir	I-PER
,	O
be	O
more	O
painful	O
to	O
a	O
friendly	O
mind	O
,	O
than	O
a	O
necessity	O
of	O
communicating	O
disagreeable	O
intelligence	O
?	O

Indeed	O
it	O
is	O
sometimes	O
difficult	O
to	O
determine	O
,	O
whether	O
the	B-PER
relator	I-PER
or	O
the	B-PER
receiver	I-PER
of	I-PER
evil	I-PER
tidings	I-PER
is	O
most	O
to	O
be	O
pitied	O

I	O
have	O
just	O
had	O
a	O
letter	O
from	O
Madame	B-PER
Duval	I-PER
;	O
she	O
is	O
totally	O
at	O
a	O
loss	O
in	O
what	O
manner	O
to	O
behave	O
;	O
she	O
seems	O
desirous	O
to	O
repair	O
the	O
wrongs	O
she	O
has	O
done	O
,	O
yet	O
wishes	O
the	B-LOC
world	I-LOC
to	O
believe	O
her	O
blameless	O
.	O

She	O
would	O
fain	O
cast	O
upon	O
another	O
the	O
odium	O
of	O
those	O
misfortunes	O
for	O
which	O
she	O
alone	O
is	O
answerable	O
.	O

Her	O
letter	O
is	O
violent	O
,	O
sometimes	O
abusive	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
of	O
you	O
!	O

-	O
you	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
she	O
is	O
under	O
obligations	O
which	O
are	O
greater	O
even	O
than	O
her	O
faults	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
whose	O
advice	O
she	O
wickedly	O
imputes	O
all	O
the	O
sufferings	O
of	O
her	B-PER
much	I-PER
injured	I-PER
daughter	I-PER
,	O
the	B-PER
late	I-PER
Lady	I-PER
Belmont	I-PER
.	O

The	O
chief	O
purport	O
of	O
her	O
writing	O
I	O
will	O
acquaint	O
you	O
with	O
;	O
the	O
letter	O
itself	O
is	O
not	O
worthy	O
your	O
notice	O
.	O

She	O
tells	O
me	O
that	O
she	O
has	O
,	O
for	O
many	O
years	O
past	O
,	O
been	O
in	O
continual	O
expectation	O
of	O
making	O
a	O
journey	O
to	O
England	B-GPE
,	O
which	O
prevented	O
her	O
writing	O
for	O
information	O
concerning	O
this	O
melancholy	O
subject	O
,	O
by	O
giving	O
her	O
hopes	O
of	O
making	O
personal	O
inquiries	O
;	O
but	O
family	O
occurrences	O
have	O
still	O
detained	O
her	O
in	O
France	B-GPE
,	O
which	B-GPE
country	I-GPE
she	I-GPE
now	I-GPE
sees	I-GPE
no	I-GPE
prospect	I-GPE
of	I-GPE
quitting	I-GPE
.	O

She	O
has	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
lately	O
used	O
her	O
utmost	O
endeavors	O
to	O
obtain	O
a	O
faithful	O
account	O
of	O
whatever	O
related	O
to	O
her	B-PER
ill-advised	I-PER
daughter	I-PER
;	O
the	O
result	O
of	O
which	O
giving	O
her	O
some	O
reason	O
to	O
apprehend	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
upon	O
her	O
death-bed	O
,	O
she	O
bequeathed	O
an	B-PER
infant	I-PER
orphan	I-PER
to	O
the	B-LOC
world	I-LOC
,	O
she	O
most	O
graciously	O
says	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
,	O
with	O
whom	O
she	O
understands	O
the	B-PER
child	I-PER
is	O
placed	O
,	O
will	O
procure	O
authentic	O
proofs	O
of	O
its	O
relationship	O
to	O
her	O
,	O
you	O
may	O
sent	O
it	O
to	O
Paris	B-GPE
,	I-GPE
where	I-GPE
she	I-GPE
will	I-GPE
properly	I-GPE
provide	I-GPE
for	I-GPE
it	I-GPE

This	B-PER
woman	I-PER
is	O
,	O
undoubtedly	O
,	O
at	O
length	O
,	O
self-convicted	O
of	O
her	O
most	O
unnatural	O
behaviour	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
evident	O
,	O
from	O
her	O
writing	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
is	O
still	O
as	O
vulgar	O
and	O
illiterate	O
as	O
when	O
her	B-PER
first	I-PER
husband	I-PER
,	O
Mr.	B-PER
Evelyn	I-PER
,	O
had	O
the	O
weakness	O
to	O
marry	O
her	O
;	O
nor	O
does	O
she	O
at	O
all	O
apologize	O
for	O
addressing	O
herself	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
was	O
only	O
once	O
in	O
her	O
company	O
.	O

Her	O
letter	O
has	O
excited	O
in	O
my	B-PER
daughter	I-PER
Mirvan	B-PER
,	O
a	O
strong	O
desire	O
to	O
be	O
informed	O
of	O
the	O
motives	O

induced	O
Madame	B-PER
Duval	I-PER
to	O
abandon	O
the	B-PER
unfortunate	I-PER
Lady	I-PER

at	O
a	O
time	O
when	O
a	B-PER

YOUR	B-PER

the	O
perplexity	O

uneasiness	O

which	O
Madame	B-PER

letter	O
has	O
been	O
productive	O

However	O

I	O

that	O

many	O
years	O
remained	O
unmolested	O

at	O
my	O

that	O
this	B-PER
wretched	I-PER

upon	O
any	O

that	O

the	O

of	O
