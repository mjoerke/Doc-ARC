THE	B-PER

I	O
have	O
seldom	O
heard	O
him	O
mention	O
her	O
under	O
any	O
other	O
name	O

In	O
his	O
eyes	O
she	O
eclipses	O
and	O
predominates	O
the	O
whole	O
of	O
her	O
sex	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
that	O
he	O
felt	O
any	O
emotion	O
akin	O
to	O
love	O
for	O
Irene	B-PER
Adler	I-PER
.	O

All	O
emotions	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
one	O

were	O
abhorrent	O
to	O
his	O
cold	O

precise	O

admirably	O
balanced	O
mind	O

He	O
was	O

I	O
take	O
it	O
,	O
the	B-PER
most	I-PER
perfect	I-PER
reasoning	I-PER
and	I-PER
observing	I-PER

the	I-PER
world	I-PER
has	I-PER
seen	I-PER

but	O
as	O
a	B-PER
lover	I-PER
he	O
would	O
have	O
placed	O
himself	O
in	O
a	O
false	O
position	O
.	O

He	O
never	O
spoke	O
of	O
the	O
softer	O
passions	O
,	O
save	O
with	O
a	O
gibe	O
and	O
a	O
sneer	O

They	O
were	O
admirable	O
things	O
for	O
the	B-PER
observer	I-PER

excellent	O
for	O
drawing	O
the	O
veil	O
from	O

motives	O

But	O
for	O
the	B-PER
trained	I-PER
reasoner	I-PER
to	O
admit	O
such	O
intrusions	O
into	O
his	O
own	O
delicate	O
and	O
finely	O
adjusted	O
temperament	O
was	O
to	O
introduce	O
a	O
distracting	O
factor	O
which	O
might	O
throw	O
a	O
doubt	O
upon	O
all	O

or	O
a	O
crack	O
in	O
one	O

would	O
not	O

more	O
disturbing	O
than	O
a	O

And	O
yet	O
there	O
was	O

one	B-PER

who	O
loathed	O

was	O

as	O
ever	O
,	O
deeply	O
attracted	O
by	O
the	O
study	O
of	O

From	O
time	O
to	O

I	O
heard	O
some	O

account	O
of	O
his	O

on	O

1888	O

I	O

through	O
Baker	B-FAC

As	O
I	O
passed	O
the	O
well-remembered	O
door	O

which	O
must	O
always	O
be	O
associated	O
in	O

and	O
with	O
the	O
dark	O
incidents	O
of	O
the	O
Study	O
in	O
Scarlet	O

I	O
was	O
seized	O
with	O
a	O
keen	O
desire	O
to	O
see	O
Holmes	B-PER
again	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
know	O
how	O
he	O
was	O
employing	O
his	O
extraordinary	O
powers	O

His	B-FAC
rooms	I-FAC
were	O
brilliantly	O
lit	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
even	O
as	O
I	O
looked	O
up	O

I	O
saw	O
his	B-PER
tall	I-PER

spare	I-PER
figure	I-PER
pass	O
twice	O
in	O
a	O
dark	O
silhouette	O
against	O
the	O

He	O
was	O
pacing	O
the	B-FAC
room	I-FAC
swiftly	O
,	O
eagerly	O
,	O
with	O
his	O
head	O
sunk	O
upon	O
his	O

who	O
knew	O
his	O
every	O

his	O

their	O

He	O
was	O
at	O

again	O

He	O
had	O
risen	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
drug-created	O
dreams	O
and	O
was	O
hot	O
upon	O
the	O
scent	O
of	O
some	O
new	O
problem	O
.	O

I	O
rang	O
the	O
bell	O
and	O
was	O
shown	O
up	O
to	O
the	B-FAC
chamber	I-FAC
which	I-FAC
had	I-FAC
formerly	I-FAC
been	I-FAC
in	I-FAC
part	I-FAC
my	I-FAC
own	I-FAC
.	O

His	O
manner	O
was	O
not	O
effusive	O
.	O

It	O
seldom	O
was	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
glad	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
me	O

With	O
hardly	O
a	O
word	O
spoken	O
,	O
but	O
with	O
a	O
kindly	O
eye	O
,	O
he	O
waved	O
me	O
to	O
an	O
armchair	O

threw	O
across	O
his	O
case	O
of	O
cigars	O

and	O
indicated	O
a	O
spirit	O
case	O
and	O
a	O
gasogene	O
in	O
the	O
corner	O

Then	O
he	O
stood	O
before	O
the	O
fire	O
and	O
looked	O
me	O
over	O
in	O
his	O
singular	O
introspective	O
fashion	O
