To	O
begin	O
my	O
life	O
with	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
,	O
I	O
record	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
born	O
(	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
informed	O
and	O
believe	O
)	O
on	O
a	O
Friday	O
,	O
at	O
twelve	O
o’clock	O
at	O
night	O

It	O
was	O
remarked	O
that	O
the	O
clock	O
began	O
to	O
strike	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
cry	O
,	O
simultaneously	O

In	O
consideration	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
and	O
hour	O
of	O
my	O
birth	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
declared	O
by	O
the	B-PER
nurse	I-PER
,	O
and	O
by	O
some	B-PER
sage	I-PER
women	I-PER
in	I-PER
the	I-PER
neighbourhood	I-PER
who	I-PER
had	I-PER
taken	I-PER
a	I-PER
lively	I-PER
interest	I-PER
in	I-PER
me	I-PER
several	I-PER
months	I-PER
before	I-PER
there	I-PER
was	I-PER
any	I-PER
possibility	I-PER
of	I-PER
our	I-PER
becoming	I-PER
personally	I-PER
acquainted	I-PER
,	O
first	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
destined	O
to	O
be	O
unlucky	O
in	O
life	O
;	O
and	O
secondly	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
privileged	O
to	O
see	O
ghosts	O
and	O
spirits	O
;	O
both	O
these	O
gifts	O
inevitably	O
attaching	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
believed	O

to	O
all	B-PER
unlucky	I-PER
infants	I-PER
of	I-PER
either	I-PER

born	I-PER
towards	I-PER
the	I-PER
small	I-PER
hours	I-PER
on	I-PER
a	I-PER
Friday	I-PER

.	O

I	O
need	O
say	O
nothing	O
here	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
first	O
head	O
,	O
because	O
nothing	O
can	O
show	O
better	O
than	O
my	O
history	O
whether	O
that	O
prediction	O
was	O
verified	O
or	O
falsified	O
by	O
the	O
result	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
second	O
branch	O
of	O
the	O
question	O
,	O
I	O
will	O
only	O
remark	O
,	O
that	O
unless	O
I	O
ran	O
through	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
inheritance	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
still	O
a	B-PER
baby	I-PER
,	O
I	O
have	O
not	O
come	O
into	O
it	O
yet	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
complain	O
of	O
having	O
been	O
kept	O
out	O
of	O
this	B-FAC
property	I-FAC
;	O
and	O
if	O
anybody	B-PER

should	O
be	O
in	O
the	O

it	O

he	O
is	O
heartily	O
welcome	O
to	O

it	O

I	O
was	O
born	O
with	O
a	O
caul	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
advertised	O
for	O
sale	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
newspapers	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
low	O
price	O
of	O
fifteen	O

Whether	O
sea-going	B-PER
people	I-PER
were	O
short	O
of	O
money	O
about	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
or	O
were	O
short	O
of	O
faith	O
and	O
preferred	O
cork	O

,	O
I	O
do	O
n’t	O
know	O
;	O
all	O
I	O
know	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
but	O
one	O
solitary	O
bidding	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
from	O
an	B-PER
attorney	I-PER
connected	I-PER
with	I-PER
the	I-PER
bill-broking	I-PER
business	I-PER
,	O
who	O
offered	O
two	O
pounds	O
in	O
cash	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
balance	O
in	O
sherry	O
,	O
but	O
declined	O
to	O
be	O
guaranteed	O
from	O
drowning	O
on	O
any	O
higher	O
bargain	O
.	O

Consequently	O
the	O
advertisement	O
was	O
withdrawn	O
at	O
a	O
dead	O
loss	O
--	O
for	O
as	O
to	O
sherry	O
,	O
my	B-PER
poor	I-PER
dear	I-PER
mother	I-PER

sherry	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
market	O
then	O
--	O
and	O
ten	O
years	O
afterwards	O
,	O
the	O
caul	O
was	O
put	O
up	O
in	O
a	O

down	O
in	O
our	B-LOC

of	I-LOC

half-a-crown	O

the	B-PER
winner	I-PER
to	O
spend	O
five	O
shillings	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
present	O
myself	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
remember	O
to	O
have	O
felt	O
quite	O
uncomfortable	O
and	O
confused	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
myself	O
being	O
disposed	O
of	O
in	O
that	O
way	O
.	O

The	O
caul	O
was	O
won	O
,	O
I	O
recollect	O
,	O
by	O
an	B-PER
old	I-PER
lady	I-PER
with	I-PER
a	I-PER
hand-basket	I-PER
,	O
who	O
,	O
very	O
reluctantly	O
,	O
produced	O
from	O
it	O
the	O
stipulated	O
five	O
shillings	O
,	O
all	O
in	O
halfpence	O
,	O
and	O
twopence	O
halfpenny	O
short	O
--	O
as	O
it	O
took	O
an	O
immense	O
time	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
waste	O
of	O
arithmetic	O
,	O
to	O
endeavour	O
without	O
any	O
effect	O
to	O
prove	O
to	O
her	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
fact	O
which	O
will	O
be	O
long	O
remembered	O
as	O
remarkable	O
down	O
there	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
never	O
drowned	O
,	O
but	O
died	O
triumphantly	O
in	O
bed	O
,	O
at	O
ninety-two	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
understood	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
,	O
her	O
proudest	O
boast	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
never	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
the	B-LOC
water	I-LOC
in	O
her	O
life	O
,	O
except	O
upon	O
a	B-FAC
bridge	I-FAC
;	O
and	O
that	O
over	O
her	O
tea	O
(	O
to	O
which	O
she	O
was	O
extremely	O
partial	O
)	O
she	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
last	O

expressed	O
her	O
indignation	O
at	O
the	O
impiety	O
of	O
mariners	B-PER

others	B-PER

who	I-PER
had	I-PER
the	I-PER
presumption	I-PER
to	I-PER
go	I-PER
‘	I-PER
meandering	I-PER
’	I-PER
about	I-PER
the	I-PER
world	I-PER
.	O

It	O
was	O
in	O
vain	O
to	O
represent	O
to	O
her	O
that	O
some	O
conveniences	O
,	O
tea	O
perhaps	O
included	O
,	O
resulted	O
from	O
this	O
objectionable	O
practice	O
.	O

She	O
always	O
returned	O
,	O
with	O
greater	O
emphasis	O
and	O
with	O
an	O
instinctive	O
knowledge	O
of	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
her	O
objection	O

‘	O

the	O

something	O

in	O

‘	O

gave	O
another	O
proof	O
of	O
her	O
identity	O
.	O

My	B-PER
father	I-PER
had	O
often	O
hinted	O
that	O
she	O
seldom	O
conducted	O
herself	O
like	O
any	B-PER
ordinary	I-PER
Christian	I-PER
;	O
and	O
now	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
ringing	O
the	O
bell	O
,	O
she	O
came	O
and	O
looked	O
in	O
at	O
that	O
identical	O
window	O
,	O
pressing	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
her	O
nose	O
against	O
the	O
glass	O
to	O
that	O
extent	O
,	O
that	O
my	B-PER
poor	I-PER
dear	I-PER
mother	I-PER
used	O
to	O
say	O
it	O
became	O
perfectly	O
flat	O
and	O
white	O
in	O
a	O
moment	O
.	O

She	O
gave	O
my	B-PER
mother	I-PER
such	O
a	O
turn	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
always	O
been	O
convinced	O
I	O
am	O
indebted	O
to	O
Miss	B-PER
Betsey	I-PER
for	O
having	O
been	O
born	O
on	O
a	O
Friday	O
.	O

My	B-PER
mother	I-PER
had	O
left	O
her	O
chair	O
in	O
her	O
agitation	O
,	O
and	O
gone	O
behind	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
corner	O
.	O

Miss	B-PER
Betsey	I-PER
,	O
looking	O
round	O
the	B-FAC
room	I-FAC
,	O
slowly	O
and	O
inquiringly	O
,	O
began	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
her	O
eyes	O
on	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
Saracen	O
’s	O
Head	O
in	O
a	O
Dutch	O
clock	O
,	O
until	O
they	O
reached	O
my	B-PER
mother	I-PER
.	O

Then	O
she	O
made	O
a	O
frown	O
and	O
a	O
gesture	O
to	O
my	B-PER
mother	I-PER
,	O
like	O
one	O
who	O
was	O
accustomed	O
to	O
be	O
obeyed	O
,	O
to	O
come	O
and	O
open	O
the	O
door	O

My	B-PER
mother	I-PER
went	O

‘	O
Mrs.	B-PER
David	I-PER
Copperfield	I-PER

I	O
think	O

said	O
Miss	B-PER
Betsey	I-PER
;	O
the	O
emphasis	O
referring	O

perhaps	O

to	O
my	B-PER

’s	O
mourning	O
weeds	O
,	O
and	O
her	O
condition	O

‘	O
Yes	O

’	O
said	O
my	B-PER
mother	I-PER
,	O
faintly	O
.	O

‘	O
Miss	B-PER
Trotwood	I-PER

’	O
said	O
the	O
visitor	O

‘	O
You	O
have	O
heard	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
I	O
dare	O
say	O
?	O
’	O

My	B-PER
mother	I-PER
answered	O
she	O
had	O
had	O
that	O
pleasure	O
.	O

And	O
she	O
had	O
a	O
disagreeable	O
consciousness	O
of	O
not	O
appearing	O
to	O
imply	O
that	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
an	O
overpowering	O
pleasure	O
.	O

‘	O
Now	O
you	O
see	O
her	O
,	O
’	O
said	O
Miss	B-PER
Betsey	I-PER
.	O

My	B-PER
mother	I-PER
bent	O
her	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
begged	O
her	O
to	O
walk	O
in	O
.	O

They	O
went	O
into	O
the	B-FAC
parlour	I-FAC
my	I-FAC
mother	I-FAC
had	I-FAC
come	I-FAC
from	I-FAC

the	O

the	B-FAC

the	I-FAC

the	I-FAC
passage	I-FAC
not	O

lighted	O
--	O
not	O
having	O
been	O
lighted	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
since	O
my	B-PER
father	I-PER
’s	O
funeral	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
both	O
seated	O
,	O
and	O
Miss	B-PER
Betsey	I-PER
said	O
nothing	O
,	O
my	B-PER
mother	I-PER
,	O
after	O
vainly	O
trying	O
to	O
restrain	O
herself	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
cry	O
.	O

‘	O
Oh	O
tut	O
,	O
tut	O
,	O
tut	O
!	O
’	O

said	O
Miss	B-PER
Betsey	I-PER
,	O
in	O
a	O
hurry	O

‘	O
Do	O
n’t	O
do	O

Come	O
,	O
come	O

My	B-PER
mother	I-PER
could	O
n’t	O
help	O
it	O
notwithstanding	O
,	O
so	O
she	O
cried	O
until	O
she	O
had	O
had	O
her	O

out	O

‘	O
Take	O

said	O
Miss	B-PER
Betsey	I-PER
,	O
‘	O
and	O
let	O
me	O
see	O
you	O

’	O

My	B-PER
mother	I-PER
was	O
too	O
much	O
afraid	O
of	O
her	O
to	O
refuse	O
compliance	O
with	O
this	O
odd	O
request	O
,	O
if	O
she	O
had	O
any	O
disposition	O
to	O

Therefore	O
she	O
did	O
as	O
she	O
was	O
told	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
it	O
with	O
such	O
nervous	O
hands	O
that	O
her	O
hair	O
(	O
which	O
was	O
luxuriant	O
