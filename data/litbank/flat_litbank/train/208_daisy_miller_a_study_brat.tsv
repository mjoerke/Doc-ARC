that	O

that	O

the	O

“	O
She	O

”	O

Winterbourne	B-PER
looked	O
along	O
the	O
path	O
and	O
saw	O
a	B-PER
beautiful	I-PER
young	I-PER
lady	I-PER
advancing	O
.	O

“	O
American	B-PER
girls	I-PER

the	B-PER
best	I-PER
girls	I-PER
,	O
”	O
he	O
said	O
cheerfully	O
to	O
his	B-PER
young	I-PER
companion	I-PER
.	O

“	O
My	B-PER
sister	I-PER
ai	O
n’t	O
the	O
best	O

”	O

the	B-PER
child	I-PER
declared	O
.	O

“	O
She	O
’s	O
always	O
blowing	O
at	O
me	O
.	O
”	O

“	O
I	O
imagine	O
that	O

your	O
fault	O
,	O
not	O
hers	O

”	O
said	O
Winterbourne	B-PER
.	O

The	B-PER
young	I-PER
lady	I-PER
meanwhile	O
had	O
drawn	O
near	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
dressed	O
in	O
white	O
muslin	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
hundred	O
frills	O
and	O
flounces	O
,	O
and	O
knots	O
of	O
pale-colored	O
ribbon	O

She	O
was	O
bareheaded	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
balanced	O
in	O
her	O
hand	O
a	O
large	O
parasol	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
deep	O
border	O
of	O
embroidery	O
;	O
and	O
she	O
was	O
strikingly	O
,	O
admirably	O
pretty	O
.	O

“	O
How	O
pretty	O
they	O
are	O
!	O
”	O

thought	O
Winterbourne	B-PER
,	O
straightening	O
himself	O
in	O
his	O
seat	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
were	O
prepared	O
to	O
rise	O
.	O

The	B-PER
young	I-PER
lady	I-PER
paused	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
his	O
bench	O
,	O
near	O
the	B-FAC
parapet	I-FAC
of	I-FAC
the	I-FAC
garden	I-FAC
,	I-FAC
which	I-FAC
overlooked	I-FAC
the	I-FAC
lake	I-FAC
.	O

The	B-PER
little	I-PER
boy	I-PER
had	O
now	O
converted	O
his	O
alpenstock	O
into	O
a	O
vaulting	O
pole	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
aid	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
springing	O
about	O
in	O
the	O
gravel	O
and	O
kicking	O
it	O
up	O
not	O
a	O
little	O
.	O

“	O
Randolph	B-PER
,	O
”	O
said	O
the	B-PER
young	I-PER
lady	I-PER
,	O
“	O
what	O
ARE	O
you	O
doing	O
?	O
”	O

“	O
I	O
’m	O
going	O
up	O
the	B-LOC
Alps	I-LOC
,	O
”	O
replied	O
Randolph	B-PER
.	O

“	O
This	O
is	O
the	O
way	O
!	O
”	O

And	O
he	O
gave	O
another	O
little	O
jump	O
,	O
scattering	O
the	O
pebbles	O
about	O
Winterbourne	B-PER
’s	O
ears	O
.	O

“	O
That	O
’s	O
the	O
way	O

down	O

”	O
said	O
Winterbourne	B-PER

“	O
He	O
’s	O
an	B-PER
American	I-PER
man	I-PER

”	O

cried	O
Randolph	B-PER
,	O
in	O
his	O
little	O
hard	O
voice	O
.	O

The	B-PER
young	I-PER
lady	I-PER
gave	O
no	O
heed	O
to	O
this	O
announcement	O
,	O
but	O
looked	O
straight	O
at	O
her	B-PER
brother	I-PER
.	O

“	O
Well	O
,	O
I	O
guess	O
you	O
had	O
better	O
be	O
quiet	O
,	O
”	O
she	O
simply	O
observed	O
.	O

It	O
seemed	O
to	O
Winterbourne	B-PER
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
presented	O
.	O

He	O
got	O
up	O
and	O
stepped	O
slowly	O
toward	O
the	B-PER
young	I-PER
girl	I-PER
,	O
throwing	O
away	O
his	O
cigarette	O

“	O
This	B-PER
little	I-PER
boy	I-PER
and	O
I	O
have	O
made	O
acquaintance	O

he	O
said	O

with	O
great	O
civility	O

In	O

as	O

been	O
perfectly	O

a	B-PER
young	I-PER
man	I-PER
was	O
not	O
at	O

to	O

to	O
a	B-PER
young	I-PER
unmarried	I-PER
lady	I-PER
except	O
under	O

these	O

--	O
a	B-PER
pretty	I-PER
American	I-PER

coming	O
and	O

This	B-PER

however	O
,	O
on	O

Winterbourne	B-PER

simply	O
glanced	O
at	O
him	O
;	O
she	O
then	O
turned	O
her	O
head	O
and	O
looked	O
over	O
the	B-FAC
parapet	I-FAC
,	O
at	O
the	B-LOC
lake	I-LOC
and	O
the	B-LOC
opposite	I-LOC

He	O
wondered	O
whether	O
he	O
had	O
gone	O
too	O
far	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
decided	O
that	O
he	O
must	O
advance	O

rather	O
than	O

the	B-PER
