for	O
one	O

who	I-PER
could	I-PER
sympathize	I-PER
with	I-PER
me	I-PER

whose	O
eyes	O
would	O
reply	O
to	O
mine	O

You	O
may	O
deem	O
me	O
romantic	O
,	O
my	B-PER
dear	I-PER
sister	I-PER
,	O
but	O
I	O
bitterly	O
feel	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
a	B-PER
friend	I-PER
.	O

I	O
have	O
no	B-PER
one	I-PER
near	O
me	O
,	O
gentle	O

courageous	O

possessed	O

tastes	O
are	O
like	O
my	O
own	O
,	O
to	O
approve	O
or	O

my	O

How	O
would	O
such	O
a	B-PER
friend	I-PER
repair	O
the	O
faults	O
of	O
your	B-PER
poor	I-PER
brother	I-PER
!	O

I	O
am	O
too	O
ardent	O
in	O
execution	O
and	O
too	O
impatient	O
of	O
difficulties	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
still	O
greater	O
evil	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
self-educated	O
:	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
fourteen	O
years	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
I	O
ran	O
wild	O
on	O
a	O
common	O
and	O
read	O
nothing	O
but	O
our	B-PER
Uncle	I-PER
Thomas	B-PER
'	O
books	O
of	O
voyages	O
.	O

At	O
that	O
age	O
I	O
became	O
acquainted	O
with	O
the	B-PER
celebrated	I-PER
poets	I-PER
of	I-PER
our	I-PER
own	I-PER
country	I-PER
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
when	O
it	O
had	O
ceased	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
my	O
power	O
to	O
derive	O
its	O
most	O
important	O
benefits	O
from	O
such	O
a	O
conviction	O
that	O
I	O
perceived	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
becoming	O
acquainted	O
with	O
more	O
languages	O
than	O
that	O
of	O
my	B-GPE
native	I-GPE
country	I-GPE
.	O

Now	O
I	O
am	O
twenty-eight	O
and	O
am	O
in	O
reality	O
more	O
illiterate	O
than	O
many	B-PER
schoolboys	I-PER
of	I-PER
fifteen	I-PER

It	O
is	O
true	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
thought	O
more	O
and	O
that	O
my	O
daydreams	O
are	O
more	O
extended	O

magnificent	O

but	O
they	O
want	O

as	O
the	B-PER

call	O
it	O
)	O
KEEPING	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
greatly	O
need	O
a	B-PER
friend	I-PER
who	I-PER
would	I-PER
have	I-PER
sense	I-PER
enough	I-PER
not	I-PER
to	I-PER
despise	I-PER
me	I-PER
as	I-PER
romantic	I-PER

affection	I-PER

for	I-PER
me	I-PER

my	I-PER
mind	I-PER

Well	O

these	O
are	O

complaints	O

I	O
shall	O
certainly	O
find	O
no	B-PER

A	O

when	O
I	O

of	O
a	B-PER

I	O

him	O
first	O

a	O

from	O
a	B-PER

This	O

his	O
story	O

Some	O
years	O
ago	O
he	O
loved	O
a	B-PER
young	I-PER
Russian	I-PER
lady	I-PER
of	I-PER
moderate	I-PER
fortune	I-PER
,	O
and	O
having	O
amassed	O
a	O
considerable	O
sum	O
in	O
prize-money	O
,	O
the	B-PER
father	I-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
girl	I-PER
consented	O
to	O
the	O
match	O
.	O

He	O
saw	O
his	B-PER
mistress	I-PER
once	O
before	O
the	O
destined	O
ceremony	O
;	O
but	O
she	O
was	O
bathed	O
in	O
tears	O
,	O
and	O
throwing	O
herself	O
at	O
his	O
feet	O
,	O
entreated	O
him	O
to	O
spare	O
her	O
,	O
confessing	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
that	O
she	O
loved	O
another	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
poor	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
her	B-PER
father	I-PER
would	O
never	O
consent	O
to	O
the	O
union	O
.	O

My	B-PER
generous	I-PER
friend	I-PER
reassured	O
the	O
suppliant	O

on	O
being	O
informed	O
of	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
her	B-PER
lover	I-PER
,	O
instantly	O
abandoned	O
his	O
pursuit	O

He	O
had	O
already	O
bought	O
a	B-FAC
farm	I-FAC
with	O
his	O
money	O

on	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
designed	O
to	O
pass	O
the	O
remainder	O
of	O
his	O
life	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
bestowed	O
the	O
whole	O
on	O
his	B-PER
rival	I-PER
,	O
together	O
with	O
the	O
remains	O
of	O
his	O
prize-money	O
to	O
purchase	O
stock	O

then	O
himself	O
solicited	O
the	B-PER
young	I-PER
woman	I-PER
's	I-PER
father	I-PER
to	O
consent	O
to	O
her	O
marriage	O
with	O
her	B-PER
lover	I-PER

But	O
the	B-PER
old	I-PER
man	I-PER
decidedly	O
refused	O

thinking	O
himself	O
bound	O
in	O
honour	O
to	O
my	B-PER
friend	I-PER
,	I-PER
who	I-PER
,	I-PER
when	I-PER
he	I-PER
found	I-PER
the	I-PER
father	I-PER
inexorable	I-PER

quitted	I-PER
his	I-PER
country	I-PER
