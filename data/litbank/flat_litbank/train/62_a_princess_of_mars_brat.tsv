I	O
am	O
a	B-PER
very	I-PER
old	I-PER
man	I-PER
;	O
how	O
old	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
.	O

Possibly	O
I	O
am	O
a	O
hundred	O
,	O
possibly	O
more	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
tell	O
because	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
aged	O
as	O
other	B-PER
men	I-PER
,	O
nor	O
do	O
I	O
remember	O
any	O
childhood	O
.	O

So	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
can	O
recollect	O
I	O
have	O
always	O
been	O
a	B-PER
man	I-PER
,	O
a	B-PER
man	I-PER
of	I-PER
about	I-PER
thirty	I-PER

I	O
appear	O
today	O
as	O
I	O
did	O
forty	O
years	O
and	O
more	O
ago	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
I	O
feel	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
go	O
on	O
living	O
forever	O
;	O
that	O
some	O
day	O
I	O
shall	O
die	O
the	O
real	O
death	O
from	O
which	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
resurrection	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
why	O
I	O
should	O
fear	O
death	O
,	O
I	O
who	O
have	O
died	O
twice	O
and	O
am	O
still	O
alive	O
;	O
but	O
yet	O
I	O
have	O
the	O
same	O
horror	O
of	O
it	O
as	O
you	O
who	O
have	O
never	O
died	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
because	O
of	O
this	O
terror	O
of	O
death	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
so	O
convinced	O
of	O
my	O
mortality	O
.	O

And	O
because	O
of	O
this	O
conviction	O
I	O
have	O
determined	O
to	O
write	O
down	O
the	O
story	O
of	O
the	O
interesting	O
periods	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
and	O
of	O
my	O
death	O

I	O
can	O
not	O
explain	O
the	O
phenomena	O
;	O
I	O
can	O
only	O
set	O
down	O
here	O
in	O
the	O
words	O
of	O
an	B-PER
ordinary	I-PER
soldier	I-PER
of	I-PER
fortune	I-PER
a	O
chronicle	O
of	O
the	O
strange	O

that	O
befell	O
me	O
during	O
the	O
ten	O
years	O
that	O
my	B-PER
dead	I-PER
body	I-PER
lay	O
undiscovered	O
in	O
an	B-LOC
Arizona	I-LOC

I	O
have	O
never	O

this	O

nor	O
shall	O

see	O
this	O
manuscript	O
until	O
after	O
I	O
have	O
passed	O
over	O
for	O
eternity	O
.	O

I	O
know	O
that	O
the	B-PER
average	I-PER
human	I-PER
mind	O
will	O
not	O
believe	O
what	O
it	O
can	O
not	O

I	O

the	O

At	O
the	O
close	O
of	O
the	O

I	O
found	O

to	O

my	O
fallen	O

in	O
a	O

for	O
gold	O
.	O

I	O
spent	O
nearly	O
a	O
year	O
prospecting	O
in	O
company	O
with	O
another	B-PER
Confederate	I-PER
officer	I-PER
,	O
Captain	B-PER
James	I-PER
K.	I-PER
Powell	I-PER
of	I-PER

We	O
were	O
extremely	O
fortunate	O
,	O
for	O
late	O
in	O
the	O
winter	O
of	O
1865	O
,	O
after	O
many	O
hardships	O
and	O
privations	O
,	O
we	O
located	O
the	B-LOC
most	I-LOC
remarkable	I-LOC
gold-bearing	I-LOC
quartz	I-LOC
vein	I-LOC
that	O
our	O
wildest	O
dreams	O
had	O
ever	O
pictured	O
.	O

Powell	B-PER
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	B-PER
mining	I-PER
engineer	I-PER
by	I-PER
education	I-PER
,	O
stated	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
uncovered	O
over	O
a	O
million	O
dollars	O
worth	O
of	O
ore	O
in	O
a	O
trifle	O
over	O
three	O
months	O
.	O

As	O
our	O
equipment	O
was	O
crude	O
in	O
the	O
extreme	O
we	O
decided	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
us	O
must	O
return	O
to	O
civilization	B-GPE
,	O
purchase	O
the	O
necessary	O
machinery	O
and	O
return	O
with	O
a	B-PER
sufficient	I-PER
force	I-PER
of	I-PER
men	I-PER
properly	O
to	O
work	O
the	B-FAC
mine	I-FAC
.	O

As	O
Powell	B-PER
was	O
familiar	O
with	O
the	B-LOC
country	I-LOC
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
with	O
the	O
mechanical	O
requirements	O
of	O
mining	O
we	O
determined	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
best	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
trip	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
agreed	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
to	O
hold	O
down	O
our	O
claim	O
against	O
the	O
remote	O
possibility	O
of	O
its	O
being	O
jumped	O
by	O
some	B-PER
wandering	I-PER
prospector	I-PER
.	O

On	O
March	O
3	O
,	O
1866	O
,	O
Powell	B-PER
and	O
I	O
packed	O
his	O
provisions	O
on	O
two	O
of	O
our	O
burros	O
,	O
and	O
bidding	O
me	O
good-bye	O
he	O
mounted	O
his	O
horse	O
,	O
and	O
started	O
down	O
the	B-LOC
mountainside	I-LOC
toward	O
the	B-LOC
valley	I-LOC
,	O
across	O
which	O
led	O
the	O
first	O
stage	O
of	O
his	O
journey	O
.	O

The	O
morning	O
of	O
Powell	B-PER
's	O
departure	O
was	O
,	O
like	O
nearly	O
all	O
Arizona	B-GPE
mornings	O
,	O
clear	O
and	O
beautiful	O
;	O
I	O
could	O
see	O
him	O
and	O
his	O
little	O
pack	O
animals	O
picking	O
their	O
way	O
down	O
the	B-LOC
mountainside	I-LOC
toward	O
the	B-LOC
valley	I-LOC
,	O
and	O
all	O
during	O
the	O
morning	O
I	O
would	O
catch	O
occasional	O
glimpses	O
of	O
them	O
as	O
they	O
topped	O
a	O
hog	O
back	O
or	O
came	O
out	O
upon	O
a	B-LOC
level	I-LOC
plateau	I-LOC
.	O

My	O
last	O
sight	O
of	O
Powell	B-PER
was	O
about	O
three	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
as	O
he	O
entered	O
the	O
shadows	O
of	O
the	B-LOC
range	I-LOC
on	I-LOC
the	I-LOC
opposite	I-LOC
side	I-LOC
of	I-LOC
the	I-LOC
valley	I-LOC
.	O

Some	O
half	O
hour	O
later	O
I	O
happened	O
to	O
glance	O
casually	O
across	O
the	B-LOC
valley	I-LOC
and	O
was	O
much	O
surprised	O
to	O
note	O
three	O
little	O
dots	O
in	O
about	O
the	O
same	O
place	O
I	O
had	O
last	O
seen	O
my	B-PER
friend	I-PER
and	O
his	O
two	O
pack	O
animals	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
given	O
to	O
needless	O
worrying	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
more	O
I	O
tried	O
to	O
convince	O
myself	O
that	O
all	O
was	O
well	O
with	O
Powell	B-PER
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
dots	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
on	O
his	O
trail	O
were	O
antelope	O
or	O
wild	O
horses	O
,	O
the	O
less	O
I	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
assure	O
myself	O
.	O

Since	O
we	O
had	O
entered	O
the	B-PER
territory	I-PER
we	O
had	O
not	O
seen	O
a	B-PER
hostile	I-PER
Indian	I-PER
,	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
become	O
careless	O
in	O
the	O
extreme	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
wont	O
to	O
ridicule	O
the	O
stories	O
we	O
had	O
heard	O
of	O
the	B-PER
great	I-PER
numbers	I-PER
of	I-PER
these	I-PER
vicious	I-PER
marauders	I-PER
that	I-PER
were	I-PER
supposed	I-PER
to	I-PER
haunt	I-PER
the	I-PER
trails	I-PER
,	I-PER
taking	I-PER
their	I-PER
toll	I-PER
in	I-PER
lives	I-PER
and	I-PER
torture	I-PER
of	I-PER
every	I-PER
white	I-PER
party	I-PER
which	I-PER
fell	I-PER
into	I-PER
their	I-PER
merciless	I-PER
clutches	I-PER
.	O

Powell	B-PER
,	O
I	O
knew	O
,	O
was	O
well	O
armed	O
and	O
,	O
further	O
,	O
an	B-PER
experienced	I-PER
Indian	I-PER
fighter	I-PER
;	O
but	O
I	O
too	O
had	O
lived	O
and	O
fought	O
for	O
years	O
among	O
the	B-PER
Sioux	I-PER
in	I-PER
the	I-PER
North	I-PER
,	O
and	O
I	O
knew	O
that	O
his	O
chances	O
were	O
small	O
against	O
a	B-PER
party	I-PER
of	I-PER
cunning	I-PER
trailing	I-PER
Apaches	I-PER
.	O

Finally	O
I	O
could	O
endure	O
the	O
suspense	O
no	O
longer	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
arming	O
myself	O
with	O
my	O
two	O
Colt	O
revolvers	O
and	O
a	O
carbine	O
,	O
I	O
strapped	O
two	O
belts	O
of	O
cartridges	O
about	O
me	O
and	O
catching	O
my	O
saddle	O
horse	O
,	O
started	O
down	O
the	B-FAC
trail	I-FAC
taken	I-FAC
by	I-FAC
Powell	I-FAC
in	O
the	O
morning	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
reached	O
comparatively	O
level	O
ground	O
I	O
urged	O
my	O
mount	O
into	O
a	O
canter	O
and	O
continued	O
this	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
going	O
permitted	O
,	O
until	O
,	O
close	O
upon	O
dusk	O
,	O
I	O
discovered	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
other	O
tracks	O
joined	O
those	O
of	O
Powell	B-PER
.	O

They	O
were	O
the	O
tracks	O
of	O
unshod	O
ponies	O
,	O
three	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
ponies	O
had	O
been	O
galloping	O
.	O

I	O
followed	O
rapidly	O
until	O
,	O
darkness	O
shutting	O
down	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
await	O
the	O
rising	O
of	O
the	O
moon	O
,	O
and	O
given	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
speculate	O
on	O
the	O
question	O
of	O
the	O
wisdom	O
of	O
my	O
chase	O
.	O

Possibly	O
I	O
had	O
conjured	O
up	O
impossible	O
dangers	O
,	O
like	O
some	B-PER
nervous	I-PER
old	I-PER
housewife	I-PER
,	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
should	O
catch	O
up	O
with	O
Powell	B-PER
would	O
get	O
a	O
good	O
laugh	O
for	O
my	O
pains	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
prone	O
to	O
sensitiveness	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
following	O
of	O
a	O
sense	O
of	O
duty	O
,	O
wherever	O
it	O
may	O
lead	O
,	O
has	O
always	O
been	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
fetich	O
with	O
me	O
throughout	O
my	O
life	O
;	O
which	O
may	O
account	O
for	O
the	O
honors	O
bestowed	O
upon	O
me	O
by	O
three	O
republics	O
and	O
the	O
decorations	O
and	O
friendships	O
of	O
an	B-PER
old	I-PER
and	I-PER
powerful	I-PER
emperor	I-PER
and	O
several	B-PER
lesser	I-PER
kings	I-PER
,	I-PER
in	I-PER
whose	I-PER
service	I-PER
my	I-PER
sword	I-PER
has	I-PER
been	I-PER
red	I-PER
many	I-PER
a	I-PER
time	I-PER
.	O

About	O
nine	O
o'clock	O
the	O
moon	O
was	O
sufficiently	O
bright	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
proceed	O
on	O
my	O
way	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
difficulty	O
in	O
following	O
the	B-FAC
trail	I-FAC
at	O
a	O
fast	O
walk	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
some	O
places	O
at	O
a	O
brisk	O
trot	O
until	O
,	O
about	O
midnight	O
,	O
I	O
reached	O
the	B-LOC
water	I-LOC
hole	I-LOC
where	I-LOC
Powell	I-LOC
had	I-LOC
expected	I-LOC
to	I-LOC
camp	I-LOC
.	O

I	O
came	O
upon	O
the	B-LOC
spot	I-LOC
unexpectedly	O
,	O
finding	O
it	O
entirely	O
deserted	O
,	O
with	O
no	O
signs	O
of	O
having	O
been	O
recently	O
occupied	O
as	O
a	B-FAC
camp	I-FAC
.	O

I	O
was	O
interested	O
to	O
note	O
that	O
the	O
tracks	O
of	O
the	B-PER
pursuing	I-PER
horsemen	I-PER
,	I-PER
for	I-PER
such	I-PER
I	I-PER
was	I-PER
now	I-PER
convinced	I-PER
they	I-PER
must	I-PER
be	I-PER
,	O
continued	O
after	O
Powell	B-PER
with	O
only	O
a	O
brief	O
stop	O
at	O
the	B-LOC
hole	I-LOC
for	I-LOC
water	I-LOC
;	O
and	O
always	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
rate	O
of	O
speed	O
as	O
his	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
positive	O
now	O
that	O
the	B-PER
trailers	I-PER
were	O
Apaches	B-PER
and	O
that	O
they	O
wished	O
to	O
capture	O
Powell	B-PER
alive	O
for	O
the	O
fiendish	O
pleasure	O
of	O
the	O
torture	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
urged	O
my	O
horse	O
onward	O
at	O
a	O
most	O
dangerous	O
pace	O
,	O
hoping	O
against	O
hope	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
catch	O
up	O
with	O
the	B-PER
red	I-PER
rascals	I-PER
before	O
they	O
attacked	O
him	O
.	O

Further	O
speculation	O
was	O
suddenly	O
cut	O
short	O
by	O
the	O
faint	O
report	O
of	O
two	O
shots	O
far	O
ahead	O
of	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
knew	O
that	O
Powell	B-PER
would	O
need	O
me	O
now	O
if	O
ever	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
instantly	O
urged	O
my	O
horse	O
to	O
his	O
topmost	O
speed	O
up	O
the	B-FAC
narrow	I-FAC
and	I-FAC
difficult	I-FAC
mountain	I-FAC
trail	I-FAC
.	O

I	O
had	O
forged	O
ahead	O
for	O
perhaps	O
a	O
mile	O
or	O
more	O
without	O
hearing	O
further	O
sounds	O
,	O
when	O
the	B-FAC
trail	I-FAC
suddenly	O
debouched	O
onto	O
a	B-LOC
small	I-LOC

open	I-LOC
plateau	I-LOC
near	I-LOC
the	I-LOC
summit	I-LOC
of	I-LOC
the	I-LOC

I	O
had	O
passed	O
through	O
a	B-LOC
narrow	I-LOC

overhanging	I-LOC
gorge	I-LOC
just	O
before	O
