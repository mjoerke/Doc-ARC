he	O

Alexandra	B-PER

him	O
anxiously	O
;	O
the	O
cold	O

bitter	O
enough	O
on	O
the	B-LOC

The	O

Carl	B-PER
had	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
very	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
pole	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
had	O
some	O
difficulty	O
in	O
tearing	O
her	O
from	O
her	O

When	O
he	O
reached	O
the	B-LOC

he	O
handed	O
the	O

her	B-PER

“	O

He	O
opened	O
the	O

the	B-PER

“	O

The	B-PER
girl	I-PER
's	O
lip	O
trembled	O

She	O
looked	O
fixedly	O
up	O
the	B-FAC
bleak	I-FAC
street	I-FAC
as	O
if	O
she	O
were	O
gathering	O
her	O
strength	O
to	O

something	O

a	O
situation	O

no	O

The	O
wind	O
flapped	O
the	O
skirts	O
of	O
her	O
heavy	O

about	O
her	O

Carl	B-PER
did	O
not	O
say	O
anything	O

but	O
she	O
felt	O
his	O
sympathy	O

He	O

He	O

There	O
was	O
a	O

pallor	O
in	O
his	O
thin	O
face	O

and	O
his	O
mouth	O
was	O
too	O

for	O
a	B-PER

The	O
lips	O
had	O
already	O
a	O
little	O

The	B-PER
two	I-PER

on	O
the	B-FAC

not	O

When	O
Carl	B-PER
