round	O

I	O

our	B-PER

Her	O
name	O

Duchess	B-PER

he	O

Our	B-PER
master	I-PER
was	O
a	B-PER
good	I-PER

kind	I-PER
man	I-PER

He	O
gave	O

kind	O

he	O

he	O
did	O
to	O
his	B-PER

We	O
were	O
all	O
fond	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
my	B-PER
mother	I-PER
loved	O
him	O
very	O
much	O

When	O
she	O
saw	O
him	O
at	O
the	O

she	O
would	O
neigh	O
with	O
joy	O

trot	O
up	O
to	O
him	O

He	O
would	O
pat	O

“	O

I	O
was	O
a	O

so	O
he	O
called	O

then	O
he	O

a	O
piece	O

which	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
he	O
brought	O
a	O

for	O
my	B-PER
mother	I-PER

All	B-PER
the	I-PER
horses	I-PER
would	O
come	O
to	O
him	O

but	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
were	O
his	B-PER
favorites	I-PER

My	B-PER
mother	I-PER
always	O
took	O
him	O
to	O
the	B-GPE
town	I-GPE
on	O
a	O
market	O
day	O
in	O
a	O
light	O

There	O
was	O
a	B-PER
plowboy	I-PER
,	O
Dick	B-PER
,	O
who	O
sometimes	O
came	O
into	O
our	O
field	O
to	O
pluck	O
blackberries	O
from	O
the	O
hedge	O

When	O
he	O

all	O
he	O

he	O

what	O
he	O
called	O
fun	O
with	O
the	B-PER
colts	I-PER
,	O
throwing	O
stones	O
and	O
sticks	O
at	O
them	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
gallop	O

We	O
did	O
not	O
much	O
mind	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
could	O
gallop	O
off	O
;	O
but	O
sometimes	O
a	O
stone	O
would	O
hit	O
and	O
hurt	O
us	O
.	O

One	O
day	O
he	O
was	O
at	O
this	O
game	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
the	B-PER
master	I-PER
was	O
in	O
the	B-LOC
next	I-LOC
field	I-LOC
;	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
there	B-LOC
,	O
watching	O
what	O
was	O
going	O
on	O
;	O
over	O
the	O
hedge	O
he	O
jumped	O
in	O
a	O
snap	O
,	O
and	O
catching	O
Dick	B-PER
by	O
the	O
arm	O
,	O
he	O
gave	O
him	O
such	O
a	O
box	O
on	O
the	O
ear	O
as	O
made	O
him	O
roar	O
with	O
the	O
pain	O
and	O
surprise	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
saw	O
the	B-PER
master	I-PER
we	O
trotted	O
up	O
nearer	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
went	O
on	O
.	O

“	O
Bad	B-PER
boy	I-PER

”	O
he	O
said	O

“	O

The	O
Hunt	O
Before	O

two	O

It	O
was	O
early	O
in	O

a	O
little	O

in	O
the	O

a	O

the	B-LOC

I	O
and	O
the	B-PER
other	I-PER
colts	I-PER
were	O
feeding	O
at	O
the	O
lower	O
part	O
of	O
the	B-LOC
field	I-LOC
when	O
we	O
heard	O
,	O
quite	O
in	O
the	O
distance	O
,	O
what	O
sounded	O
like	O
the	O
cry	O
of	O
dogs	O

The	B-PER
oldest	I-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
colts	I-PER
raised	O
his	O
head	O

pricked	O
his	O

and	O
said	O
,	O
“	O
There	O

”	O
and	O
immediately	O
cantered	O
off	O

the	O

us	O
to	O
the	O

the	O

where	O
we	O
could	O
look	O
over	O
the	O

and	O
see	O
several	B-LOC
fields	I-LOC
beyond	I-LOC

My	B-PER

and	O
an	B-PER
old	I-PER
riding	I-PER

of	I-PER
our	I-PER

“	O

The	B-PER

we	B-PER

what	O
was	O
going	O
on	O
by	O
the	B-LOC
brook	I-LOC
;	O
but	O
when	O
I	O
did	O
look	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
sad	O
sight	O
;	O
two	B-PER
fine	I-PER
horses	I-PER
were	O
down	O
,	O
one	O
was	O
struggling	O
in	O
the	B-LOC
stream	I-LOC
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
groaning	O
on	O
the	B-LOC
grass	I-LOC
.	O

One	B-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
riders	I-PER
was	O
getting	O
out	O
of	O
the	B-LOC
water	I-LOC
covered	O
with	O
mud	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
lay	O
quite	O
still	O
.	O

“	O
His	O
neck	O
is	O
broke	O
,	O
”	O
said	O
my	B-PER
mother	I-PER
.	O

“	O
And	O
serve	O
him	O
right	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
”	O
said	O
one	B-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
colts	I-PER
.	O

I	O
thought	O
the	O
same	O
,	O
but	O
my	B-PER
mother	I-PER
did	O
not	O
join	O
with	O
us	O
.	O

“	O
Well	O
,	O
no	O
,	O
”	O
she	O
said	O
,	O
“	O
you	O
must	O
not	O
say	O
that	O
;	O
but	O
though	O
I	O
am	O
an	B-PER
old	I-PER
horse	I-PER
,	O
and	O
have	O
seen	O
and	O
heard	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
,	O
I	O
never	O
yet	O
could	O
make	O
out	O
why	O
men	B-PER
are	O
so	O
fond	O
of	O
this	O
sport	O
;	O
they	O
often	O
hurt	O
themselves	O
,	O
often	O
spoil	O
good	B-PER
horses	I-PER

and	O
tear	O
up	O
the	B-LOC
fields	I-LOC

and	O
all	O
for	O
a	O
hare	O
or	O
a	O
fox	O

or	O
a	O
stag	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
get	O
more	O
easily	O
some	O
other	O
way	O

but	O
we	O
are	O
only	O
horses	B-PER

and	O
do	O
n’t	O
know	O

”	O

While	O
my	B-PER
mother	I-PER
was	O
saying	O
this	O
we	O
stood	O
and	O
looked	O
on	O
.	O

Many	O
of	O
the	B-PER
riders	I-PER
had	O
gone	O
to	O
the	B-PER
young	I-PER
man	I-PER
;	O
but	O
my	B-PER
master	I-PER
,	I-PER
who	I-PER
had	I-PER
been	I-PER
watching	I-PER
what	I-PER
was	I-PER
going	I-PER
on	I-PER
,	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
to	O
raise	O
him	O
.	O

His	O
head	O
fell	O
back	O
and	O
his	O
arms	O
hung	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
every	B-PER
one	I-PER
looked	O
very	O
serious	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
noise	O
now	O
;	O
even	O
the	O
dogs	O
were	O
quiet	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
know	O
that	O
something	O
was	O
wrong	O
.	O

They	O
carried	O
him	O
to	O
our	B-FAC
master	I-FAC
’s	I-FAC
house	I-FAC
.	O

I	O
heard	O
afterward	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
young	B-PER
George	I-PER
Gordon	I-PER
,	O
the	B-PER
squire	I-PER
’s	I-PER
only	I-PER
son	I-PER

a	B-PER

young	I-PER
man	I-PER

and	O
the	B-PER
pride	I-PER
of	I-PER
his	I-PER
family	I-PER
.	O

There	O
was	O
now	O
riding	O
off	O
in	O
all	O
directions	O
to	O
the	B-FAC
doctor	I-FAC
’s	I-FAC
,	O
to	O
the	B-FAC

and	O
no	O

Squire	B-FAC
Gordon	I-FAC
’s	I-FAC
,	O
to	O
let	O
him	O
know	O
about	O
his	B-PER
son	I-PER

When	O
Mr.	B-PER
Bond	I-PER
,	O
the	B-PER
farrier	I-PER
,	O
came	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
the	B-PER
black	I-PER
horse	I-PER
that	I-PER
lay	I-PER
groaning	I-PER
on	I-PER
the	I-PER
grass	I-PER
,	O
he	O
felt	O
him	O
all	O
over	O

and	O
shook	O
his	O
head	O
;	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
legs	O
was	O
broken	O

Then	O
some	O
one	O
ran	O
to	O
our	B-FAC
master	I-FAC
’s	I-FAC
house	I-FAC

came	O
back	O
with	O
a	O
gun	O
;	O
presently	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
loud	O
bang	O

a	O
dreadful	O
shriek	O

and	O
then	O
all	O
was	O
still	O
;	O
the	B-PER
black	I-PER
horse	I-PER
moved	O
no	O
more	O

My	B-PER
mother	I-PER
seemed	O
much	O
troubled	O
;	O
she	O
said	O
she	O
had	O
known	O
that	B-PER
horse	I-PER
for	O
years	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
his	O
name	O

he	O
was	O
a	B-PER
