MRS.	B-PER

Lynde	I-PER
lived	O
just	O
where	O
the	B-FAC
Avonlea	I-FAC

dipped	O
down	O
into	O
a	O
little	O

fringed	O
with	O

traversed	O
by	O
a	B-LOC
brook	I-LOC
that	I-LOC
had	I-LOC
its	I-LOC

away	I-LOC
back	I-LOC
in	I-LOC
the	I-LOC
woods	I-LOC
of	I-LOC
the	I-LOC

Cuthbert	I-LOC
place	I-LOC

it	O
was	O
reputed	O
to	O
be	O
an	B-LOC
intricate	I-LOC

headlong	I-LOC
brook	I-LOC

its	O
earlier	O

with	O

door	O
without	O
due	O
regard	O
for	O
decency	O
and	O
decorum	O
;	O
it	O
probably	O
was	O
conscious	O
that	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Rachel	I-PER
was	O
sitting	O
at	O
her	O
window	O

keeping	O
a	O

everything	O
that	O

from	O
brooks	B-LOC

children	B-PER
up	O

and	O
that	O
if	O
she	O
noticed	O
anything	O
odd	O
or	O
out	O
of	O

she	O
would	O
never	O
rest	O

who	O
can	O
attend	O
closely	O
to	O
their	B-PER

by	O

of	O
neglecting	O
their	O

Mrs.	B-PER
Rachel	I-PER
Lynde	I-PER
was	O
one	B-PER

Mrs.	B-PER
Rachel	I-PER
knew	O
that	O
he	O
ought	O
because	O
she	O
had	O
heard	O
him	O
tell	O
Peter	B-PER
Morrison	I-PER
the	O
evening	O
before	O
in	O
William	B-FAC
J.	I-FAC
Blair	I-FAC

that	O
he	O

Peter	B-PER

asked	O
him	O

of	O

for	O
Matthew	B-PER
Cuthbert	I-PER
had	O
never	O
been	O
known	O
to	O
volunteer	O
information	O
about	O
anything	O
in	O
his	O
whole	O
life	O

And	O
yet	O
here	O
was	O
Matthew	B-PER
Cuthbert	I-PER
,	O
at	O
half-past	O
three	O
on	O
the	O
afternoon	O
of	O
a	O
busy	O

placidly	O
driving	O
over	O
the	B-LOC
hollow	I-LOC
and	O
up	O
the	B-LOC
hill	I-LOC
;	O
moreover	O
,	O
he	O
wore	O
a	O
white	O
collar	O
and	O
his	O
best	O
suit	O
of	O
clothes	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
plain	O
proof	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
going	O
out	O
of	O
Avonlea	B-GPE
;	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
the	B-VEH
buggy	I-VEH
and	O
the	O
sorrel	O
mare	O

which	O
betokened	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
going	O
a	O
considerable	O
distance	O

Now	O
,	O
where	O
was	O
Matthew	B-PER
Cuthbert	I-PER
going	O
and	O
why	O
was	O
he	O
going	O
there	O

Mrs.	B-PER
Rachel	I-PER

deftly	O
putting	O
this	O

that	O
together	O

might	O

given	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
guess	O
as	O
to	O
both	O
questions	O

But	O
Matthew	B-PER
so	O
rarely	O
went	O
from	O
home	B-FAC
that	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
something	O
pressing	O
and	O
unusual	O
which	O
was	O
taking	O
him	O
;	O
he	O
was	O
the	B-PER
shyest	I-PER
man	I-PER
alive	I-PER
and	O
hated	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
among	O
strangers	B-PER

to	O
any	O

where	O
he	O

Matthew	B-PER

up	O
with	O
a	O
white	O
collar	O

driving	O
in	O
a	B-VEH

something	O
that	O

Mrs.	B-PER

nothing	O

her	O
afternoon	O
