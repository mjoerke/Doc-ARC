Warwick	B-PER

the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	B-PER
young	I-PER
woman	I-PER

strikingly	O
handsome	O

with	O
a	O

along	O

he	O

up	O
this	O

for	O

alive	O

The	B-PER
girl	I-PER
's	O
figure	O
,	O
he	O
perceived	O
,	O
was	O
admirably	O
proportioned	O
;	O
she	O
was	O
evidently	O
at	O
the	O
period	O
when	O
the	O
angles	O
of	O
childhood	O
were	O
rounding	O
into	O
the	O

hair	O

dark	O
