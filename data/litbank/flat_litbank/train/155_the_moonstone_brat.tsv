My	O
object	O
is	O
to	O
explain	O
the	O
motive	O
which	O
has	O
induced	O
me	O
to	O
refuse	O
the	O
right	O

my	B-PER

The	O
reserve	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
hitherto	O
maintained	O

I	O
request	O
them	O
to	O
suspend	O
their	O
decision	O
until	O
they	O

And	O
I	O
declare	O

on	O
my	O
word	O
of	O

that	O
what	O
I	O

about	O

strictly	O

the	O

The	O

difference	O
between	O
my	B-PER

me	O
took	O
its	O
rise	O
in	O
a	O
great	O

we	O

was	O
the	O
rallying	O

the	O
plundering	O

as	O

it	O

While	O
I	O
was	O
still	O
vainly	O
trying	O
to	O
establish	O
order	O
,	O
I	O
heard	O
a	O
frightful	O
yelling	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	B-FAC
courtyard	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
at	O

the	O

of	O
finding	O
some	O

of	O
the	O

I	O
got	O
to	O
an	O
open	O
door	O

saw	O
the	O
bodies	O
of	O
two	B-PER
Indians	I-PER
(	O
by	O
their	O

as	O
I	O

officers	B-PER

lying	O
across	O
the	O

dead	O

A	O
cry	O

hurried	O
me	O
into	O
a	B-FAC
room	I-FAC

which	I-FAC
appeared	I-FAC
to	I-FAC
serve	I-FAC

an	I-FAC

A	B-PER
third	I-PER
Indian	I-PER
,	I-PER
mortally	I-PER
wounded	I-PER

was	O
sinking	O
at	O
the	O
feet	O
of	O
a	B-PER
man	I-PER
whose	I-PER
back	I-PER
was	I-PER
towards	I-PER
me	I-PER

The	B-PER
man	I-PER
turned	O
at	O
the	O

when	O
I	O
came	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
saw	O
John	B-PER
Herncastle	I-PER

with	O
a	O
torch	O
in	O
one	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
a	O

A	O
stone	O

a	O
pommel	O

in	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
dagger	O

handle	O
,	O
flashed	O
in	O
the	O
torchlight	O

as	O
he	O
turned	O
on	O
me	O

a	O

The	B-PER
dying	I-PER
Indian	I-PER
sank	O
to	O
his	O
knees	O
,	O
pointed	O
to	O
the	O
dagger	O
in	O
Herncastle	B-PER
’s	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
said	O

in	O
his	O

“	O

He	O

the	O
men	O

My	B-PER

rushed	O
to	O

like	O
a	B-PER
madman	I-PER

“	O
Clear	O

The	B-PER

himself	O
on	O
them	O
with	O
his	O

his	O

I	O
put	O
two	B-PER

my	I-PER
