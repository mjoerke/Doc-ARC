Mark	I-PER
Twain	I-PER
,	O
and	O
he	O
told	O
the	O
truth	O
,	O

There	O
was	O
things	O
which	O
he	O
stretched	O
,	O
but	O
mainly	O
he	O
told	O
the	O
truth	O

That	O
is	O
nothing	O

I	O
never	O

with	O
some	O

as	O
I	O

Now	O
the	O
way	O
that	O
the	O
book	O
winds	O
up	O
is	O
this	O
:	O
Tom	B-PER
and	O
me	O
found	O
the	O
money	O
that	O
the	B-PER
robbers	I-PER
hid	O
in	O
the	B-LOC
cave	I-LOC
,	O
and	O
it	O
made	O
us	O
rich	O
.	O

We	O
got	O
six	O
thousand	O
dollars	O
apiece	O
--	O
all	O
gold	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
an	O
awful	O
sight	O
of	O
money	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
piled	O
up	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
Judge	B-PER
Thatcher	I-PER
he	O
took	O
it	O
and	O
put	O
it	O
out	O
at	O
interest	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
fetched	O
us	O
a	O
dollar	O
a	O
day	O
apiece	O
all	O
the	O
year	O
round	O
--	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
body	O
could	O
tell	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
.	O

The	B-PER
Widow	I-PER
Douglas	B-PER
she	O
took	O
me	O
for	O
her	B-PER
son	I-PER
,	O
and	O
allowed	O
she	O
would	O
sivilize	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
rough	O
living	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
house	I-FAC
all	O
the	O
time	O
,	O
considering	O
how	O
dismal	O
regular	O
and	O
decent	O
the	B-PER
widow	I-PER
was	O
in	O
all	O
her	O
ways	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
when	O
I	O
could	O
n't	O
stand	O
it	O
no	O
longer	O
I	O
lit	O
out	O
.	O

I	O
got	O
into	O
my	O
old	O
rags	O
and	O
my	O
sugar-hogshead	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
free	O
and	O
satisfied	O
.	O

But	O
Tom	B-PER
Sawyer	I-PER
he	O
hunted	O
me	O
up	O
and	O
said	O
he	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
start	O
a	O
band	O
of	O
robbers	B-PER
,	O
and	O
I	O
might	O
join	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
the	B-PER
widow	I-PER
and	O
be	O
respectable	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
went	O
back	O
.	O

The	B-PER
widow	I-PER
she	O
cried	O
over	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
me	O
a	O
poor	O
lost	O
lamb	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
called	O
me	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
other	O
names	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
never	O
meant	O
no	O
harm	O
by	O
it	O
.	O

She	O
put	O
me	O
in	O
them	O
new	O
clothes	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
n't	O
do	O
nothing	O
but	O
sweat	O
and	O
sweat	O
,	O
and	O
feel	O
all	O
cramped	O
up	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
then	O
,	O
the	O
old	O
thing	O
commenced	O
again	O
.	O

The	B-PER
widow	I-PER
rung	O
a	O
bell	O
for	O
supper	O
,	O
and	O
you	O
had	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
time	O
.	O

When	O
you	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
table	O
you	O
could	O
n't	O
go	O
right	O
to	O
eating	O
,	O
but	O
you	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
the	B-PER
widow	I-PER
to	O
tuck	O
down	O
her	O
head	O
and	O
grumble	O
a	O
little	O
over	O
the	O
victuals	O
,	O
though	O
there	O
war	O
n't	O
really	O
anything	O
the	O
matter	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
--	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
nothing	O
only	O
everything	O
was	O
cooked	O
by	O
itself	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
barrel	O
of	O
odds	O
and	O
ends	O
it	O
is	O
different	O
;	O
things	O
get	O
mixed	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
juice	O
kind	O
of	O
swaps	O
around	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
things	O
go	O
better	O
.	O

After	O
supper	O
she	O
got	O
out	O
her	O
book	O
and	O
learned	O
me	O
about	O
Moses	B-PER
and	O
the	B-PER
Bulrushers	I-PER
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
sweat	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
all	O
about	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
by	O
and	O
by	O
she	O
let	O
it	O
out	O
that	O
Moses	B-PER
had	O
been	O
dead	O
a	O
considerable	O
long	O
time	O
;	O
so	O
then	O
I	O
did	O
n't	O
care	O
no	O
more	O
about	O
him	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
take	O
no	O
stock	O
in	O
dead	B-PER
people	I-PER
.	O

Pretty	O
soon	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
smoke	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
the	B-PER
widow	I-PER
to	O
let	O
me	O
.	O

But	O
she	O
would	O
n't	O
.	O

She	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
mean	O
practice	O
and	O
was	O
n't	O
clean	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
must	O
try	O
to	O
not	O
do	O
it	O
any	O
more	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
just	O
the	O
way	O
with	O
some	B-PER
people	I-PER
.	O

They	O
get	O
down	O
on	O
a	O
thing	O
when	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
nothing	O
about	O
it	O
.	O

Here	O
she	O
was	O
a-bothering	O
about	O
Moses	B-PER
,	I-PER
which	I-PER
was	I-PER
no	I-PER
kin	I-PER
to	I-PER
her	I-PER
,	I-PER
and	I-PER
no	I-PER
use	I-PER
to	I-PER
anybody	I-PER
,	I-PER
being	I-PER
gone	I-PER
,	I-PER
you	I-PER
see	I-PER
,	O
yet	O
finding	O
a	O
power	O
of	O
fault	O
with	O
me	O
for	O
doing	O
a	O
thing	O
that	O
had	O
some	O
good	O
in	O
it	O
.	O

And	O
she	O
took	O
snuff	O
,	O
too	O
;	O
of	O
course	O
that	O
was	O
all	O
right	O
,	O
because	O
she	O
done	O
it	O
herself	O
.	O

Her	O
sister	O
,	O
Miss	B-PER
Watson	I-PER
,	O
a	B-PER
tolerable	I-PER
slim	I-PER
old	I-PER
maid	I-PER
,	O
with	O
goggles	O
on	O
,	O
had	O
just	O
come	O
to	O
live	O
with	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
a	O
set	O
at	O
me	O
now	O
with	O
a	O
spelling-book	O
.	O

She	O
worked	O
me	O
middling	O
hard	O
for	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	B-PER
widow	I-PER
made	O
her	O
ease	O
up	O
.	O

I	O
could	O
n't	O
stood	O
it	O
much	O
longer	O
.	O

Then	O
for	O
an	O
hour	O
it	O
was	O
deadly	O
dull	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
fidgety	O
.	O

Miss	B-PER
Watson	I-PER
would	O
say	O
,	O
“	O
Do	O
n't	O
put	O
your	O
feet	O
up	O
there	O
,	O
Huckleberry	B-PER
;	O
”	O
and	O
“	O
Do	O
n't	O
scrunch	O
up	O
like	O
that	O
,	O
Huckleberry	B-PER
--	O
set	O
up	O
straight	O
;	O
”	O
and	O
pretty	O
soon	O
she	O
would	O
say	O
,	O
“	O
Do	O
n't	O
gap	O
and	O
stretch	O
like	O
that	O
,	O
Huckleberry	B-PER
--	O
why	O
do	O
n't	O
you	O
try	O
to	O
behave	O
?	O
”	O

Then	O
she	O
told	O
me	O
all	O
about	O
the	B-LOC
bad	I-LOC
place	I-LOC
,	O
and	O
I	O
said	O
I	O
wished	O
I	O
was	O
there	B-LOC
.	O

She	O
got	O
mad	O
then	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
did	O
n't	O
mean	O
no	O
harm	O
.	O

All	O
I	O
wanted	O
was	O
to	O
go	O
somewheres	O
;	O
all	O
I	O
wanted	O
was	O
a	O
change	O
,	O
I	O
war	O
n't	O
particular	O
.	O

She	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
wicked	O
to	O
say	O
what	O
I	O
said	O
;	O
said	O
she	O
would	O
n't	O
say	O
it	O
for	O
the	B-LOC
whole	I-LOC
world	I-LOC
;	O
she	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
live	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	B-LOC
good	I-LOC
place	I-LOC
.	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
n't	O
see	O
no	O
advantage	O
in	O
going	O
where	O
she	O
was	O
going	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
made	O
up	O
my	O
mind	O
I	O
would	O
n't	O
try	O
for	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
never	O
said	O
so	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
would	O
only	O
make	O
trouble	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
n't	O
do	O
no	O
good	O
.	O

Now	O
she	O
had	O
got	O
a	O
start	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
went	O
on	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
all	O
about	O
the	B-LOC
good	I-LOC
place	I-LOC
.	O

She	O
said	O
all	O
a	B-PER
body	I-PER
would	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
there	B-LOC
was	O
to	O
go	O
around	O
all	O
day	O
long	O
with	O
a	O
harp	O
and	O
sing	O
,	O
forever	O
and	O
ever	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
did	O
n't	O
think	O
much	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
never	O
said	O
so	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
her	O
if	O
she	O
reckoned	O
Tom	B-PER
Sawyer	I-PER
would	O
go	O
there	B-LOC
,	O
and	O
she	O
said	O
not	O
by	O
a	O
considerable	O
sight	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
glad	O
about	O
that	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
wanted	O
him	O
and	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
together	O
.	O

Miss	B-PER
Watson	I-PER
she	O
kept	O
pecking	O
at	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
got	O
tiresome	O
and	O
lonesome	O
.	O

By	O
and	O
by	O
they	O
fetched	O
the	B-PER
niggers	I-PER
in	O
and	O
had	O
prayers	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
everybody	B-PER
was	O
off	O
to	O
bed	O

I	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
my	B-FAC
room	I-FAC
with	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
candle	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
table	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
set	O
down	O
in	O
a	O
chair	O
by	O
the	O
window	O
and	O
tried	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
something	O
cheerful	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
war	O
n't	O
no	O
use	O
.	O

I	O
felt	O
so	O
lonesome	O
I	O
most	O
wished	O
I	O
was	O
dead	O
.	O

The	O
stars	O
were	O
shining	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
leaves	O
rustled	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
ever	O
so	O
mournful	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
heard	O
an	O
owl	O
,	O
away	O
off	O
,	O
who-whooing	O
about	O
somebody	B-PER
that	I-PER
was	I-PER
dead	I-PER
,	O
and	O
a	O
whippowill	O
and	O
a	O
dog	O
crying	O
about	O
somebody	B-PER
that	I-PER
was	I-PER
going	I-PER
to	I-PER
die	I-PER
;	O
and	O
the	O
wind	O
was	O
trying	O
to	O
whisper	O
something	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
n't	O
make	O
out	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
it	O
made	O
the	O
cold	O
shivers	O
run	O
over	O
me	O
.	O

Then	O
away	O
out	O
in	O
the	B-LOC
woods	I-LOC
I	O
heard	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
sound	O
that	O
a	O
ghost	O
makes	O
when	O
it	O
wants	O
to	O
tell	O
about	O
something	O
that	O
's	O
on	O
its	O

and	O
ca	O
n't	O
make	O
itself	O

and	O
so	O
ca	O
n't	O
rest	O
easy	O
in	O
its	O
grave	B-FAC
,	O
and	O
has	O
to	O
go	O
about	O
that	O
way	O
every	O
night	O
grieving	O
.	O

I	O
got	O
so	O
down-hearted	O
and	O
scared	O
I	O
did	O
wish	O
I	O
had	O
some	B-PER
company	I-PER
.	O

Pretty	O
soon	O
a	O
spider	O
went	O
crawling	O
up	O
my	O
shoulder	O

and	O
I	O
flipped	O
it	O
off	O
and	O
it	O
lit	O
in	O
the	O
candle	O
;	O
and	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
budge	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
shriveled	O
up	O

I	O
did	O
n't	O
need	O
anybody	B-PER
to	O
tell	O
me	O
that	O
that	O
was	O
an	O
awful	O
bad	O
sign	O
and	O
would	O
fetch	O
me	O
some	O
bad	O
luck	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
was	O
scared	O
and	O
most	O
shook	O
the	O
clothes	O
off	O
of	O
me	O

I	O
got	O
up	O
and	O
turned	O
around	O
in	O
my	O
tracks	O
three	O
times	O
and	O
crossed	O
my	O
breast	O
every	O
time	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
tied	O
up	O
a	O

lock	O
of	O
my	O

with	O
a	O

to	O
keep	O

But	O
I	O
