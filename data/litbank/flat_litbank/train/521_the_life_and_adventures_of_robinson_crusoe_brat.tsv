from	O
whom	O
I	O
was	O
called	O
Robinson	B-PER
Kreutznaer	I-PER

corruption	O

in	O
England	B-GPE

Crusoe	B-PER
;	O
and	O
so	O
my	B-PER
companions	I-PER
always	O

I	O
had	O
two	B-PER
elder	I-PER
brothers	I-PER
,	O
one	O
of	O
whom	O
was	O
lieutenant-colonel	B-PER
to	I-PER
an	I-PER
English	I-PER
regiment	I-PER
of	I-PER
foot	I-PER
in	I-PER
Flanders	I-PER

What	O
became	O
of	O
my	B-PER
second	I-PER
brother	I-PER
I	O
never	O
knew	O
,	O
any	O
more	O
than	O
my	B-PER
father	I-PER
or	O
mother	B-PER
knew	O
what	O
became	O
of	O
me	O
.	O

Being	O
the	B-PER
third	I-PER
son	I-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
family	I-PER
and	O
not	O
bred	O
to	O
any	O
trade	O
,	O
my	O
head	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
filled	O
very	O
early	O
with	O
rambling	O
thoughts	O
.	O

My	B-PER
father	I-PER
,	I-PER
who	I-PER
was	I-PER
very	I-PER
ancient	I-PER
,	O
had	O
given	O
me	O
a	O
competent	O
share	O
of	O
learning	O
,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
house-education	O
and	O
a	B-FAC
country	I-FAC
free	I-FAC
school	I-FAC
generally	O
go	O
,	O
and	O
designed	O
me	O
for	O
the	O
law	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
satisfied	O
with	O
nothing	O
but	O
going	O
to	O
sea	B-LOC
;	O
and	O
my	O
inclination	O
to	O
this	O
led	O
me	O
so	O
strongly	O
against	O
the	O
will	O
,	O
nay	O
,	O
the	O
commands	O
of	O
my	B-PER
father	I-PER
,	O
and	O
against	O
all	O
the	O
entreaties	O
and	O
persuasions	O
of	O
my	B-PER
mother	I-PER
and	O
other	O
friends	B-PER
,	O
that	O
there	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
something	O
fatal	O
in	O
that	O
propensity	O
of	O
nature	O
,	O
tending	O
directly	O
to	O
the	O
life	O
of	O
misery	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
befall	O
me	O

My	B-PER
father	I-PER
,	O
a	B-PER
wise	I-PER
and	I-PER
grave	I-PER
man	I-PER
,	O
gave	O
me	O
serious	O
and	O
excellent	O
counsel	O
against	O
what	O
he	O
foresaw	O
was	O
my	O
design	O
.	O

He	O
called	O
me	O
one	O
morning	O
into	O
his	B-FAC
chamber	I-FAC
,	O
where	O
he	O
was	O
confined	O
by	O
the	O
gout	O
,	O
and	O
expostulated	O
very	O
warmly	O
with	O
me	O
upon	O
this	O
subject	O
.	O

He	O
asked	O
me	O
what	O
reasons	O
,	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
mere	O
wandering	O
inclination	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
for	O
leaving	O
father	B-FAC
’s	I-FAC
house	I-FAC
and	O
my	B-GPE
native	I-GPE
country	I-GPE
,	O
where	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
well	O
introduced	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
prospect	O
of	O
raising	O
my	O

by	O
application	O

with	O
a	O
life	O
of	O

what	O
might	O

which	O
he	O
had	O

by	O

the	O

He	O

me	O
I	O

the	O

of	O
this	O
state	O
by	O
this	O

which	O
all	B-PER

that	O

the	O

between	O

that	O
the	B-PER

He	O

observed	O
in	O
this	O

which	O
was	O
truly	O
prophetic	O

my	B-PER

it	O

so	O
himself	O

I	O

I	O
observed	O
the	O

down	O

very	O
plentifully	O

especially	O
when	O
he	O

and	O
that	O
when	O

none	O

he	O

off	O
the	O

told	O
me	O
his	O
heart	O

so	O
full	O
he	O
could	O
say	O
no	O
more	O
to	O
me	O

I	O
was	O

this	O

and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
who	O
could	O
be	O
otherwise	O

and	O
I	O
resolved	O
not	O

any	O

to	O

my	B-PER
father	I-PER
’s	O
desire	O

But	O
alas	O
!	O

a	O
few	O
days	O
wore	O
it	O
all	O
off	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O

,	O
to	O
prevent	O
any	O
of	O
my	B-PER

further	O

in	O
a	O
few	O

him	O

However	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
act	O
quite	O
so	O
hastily	O
as	O
the	O
first	O
heat	O
of	O
my	O

;	O
but	O
I	O
took	O
my	B-PER
mother	I-PER
at	O
a	O
time	O
when	O
I	O
thought	O
her	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
pleasant	O
than	O
ordinary	O

and	O
told	O
her	O
that	O
my	O

so	O
entirely	O
bent	O

the	B-LOC

that	O
I	O
