THE	B-PER

that	O

It	O
was	O
as	O
a	O
concession	O

His	O
stamps	O
were	O
his	O
greatest	O
happiness	O
and	O
he	O
bestowed	O
impatient	O
frowns	O
on	O
any	B-PER
one	I-PER
who	I-PER
interrupted	I-PER
him	I-PER
at	I-PER
play	I-PER

them	O

they	O
devoured	O
his	O
allowance	O

he	O
lay	O
awake	O
at	O
night	O
musing	O
untiringly	O
on	O
their	O
variety	O
and	O
many-colored	O
splendor	O

At	O
sixteen	O
he	O
had	O
lived	O
almost	O
entirely	O
within	O
himself	O
,	O
an	B-PER
inarticulate	I-PER
boy	I-PER
,	O
thoroughly	O
un-American	O

and	O
politely	O
bewildered	O
by	O
his	B-PER
contemporaries	I-PER

The	O
two	O
preceding	O
years	O
had	O
been	O
spent	O
in	O
Europe	B-GPE
with	O
a	B-PER
private	I-PER
tutor	I-PER

who	I-PER
persuaded	I-PER
him	I-PER
that	I-PER
Harvard	I-PER
was	I-PER
the	I-PER
thing	I-PER
;	O
it	O
would	O
"	O

it	O
would	O

it	O
would	O
give	O
him	O
innumerable	B-PER
self-sacrificing	I-PER

So	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
Harvard	B-ORG

there	O
was	O
no	O

Oblivious	O
to	O
the	O
social	O
system	O

he	O
lived	O
for	O
a	O
while	O
alone	O
and	O
unsought	O
in	O
a	B-FAC

His	O
allowance	O
was	O
more	O
than	O
liberal	O

He	O
laid	O
the	O
foundations	O
for	O
a	B-FAC
library	I-FAC
by	O
purchasing	O
from	O
a	O

bibliophile	B-PER

a	O

,	O
finding	O
later	O
that	O
he	O

been	O
amazingly	O
overcharged	O

He	O
became	O
an	B-PER
exquisite	I-PER

amassed	O
a	O
rather	O
pathetic	O
collection	O
of	O

neckties	O
too	O

in	O
this	O
secret	O

he	O
would	O
parade	O
before	O
a	O
mirror	O
in	O
his	B-FAC

lie	O
stretched	O
in	O

along	O

in	O

it	O
seemed	O
he	O
was	O
never	O

Curiously	O
enough	O
he	O
found	O
in	O
senior	O

that	O
he	O
had	O
acquired	O
a	O
position	O
