Miss	B-PER

startled	O

at	O

people	B-PER
looked	O
them	O
over	O
for	O
a	O
day	O
or	O
two	O
before	O

and	O
often	O
did	O
not	O
find	O
out	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
“	O

till	O
they	O
had	O

She	O
knew	O
that	O
the	B-PER
intruder	I-PER
was	O
ill-bred	O
,	O
even	O
before	O
she	O
glanced	O
at	O
him	O

He	O
was	O
an	B-PER
old	I-PER
man	I-PER

There	O
was	O
something	O
childish	O
in	O
those	O
eyes	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
childishness	O

it	O
was	O
Miss	B-PER

his	O

He	O
was	O
probably	O
trying	O
to	O

acquainted	O
with	O
them	O
before	O
they	O

into	O
the	O

So	O
she	O
assumed	O
a	O
dazed	O
expression	O
when	O
he	O

to	O
her	O

The	B-PER

Miss	B-PER
Bartlett	I-PER

in	O
reply	O
,	O
opened	O
her	O

as	O
little	O
as	O

And	O
he	O
thumped	O
with	O
his	O

a	B-PER

turned	O

He	O
did	O
not	O

as	O
he	O
spoke	O

his	O

Lucy	B-PER

was	O
perplexed	O

she	O

what	O

known	O
as	O
“	O

she	O
had	O
an	O
odd	O
feeling	O
that	O
whenever	O
these	B-PER

tourists	I-PER
spoke	O
the	O
contest	O

the	B-PER

Miss	B-PER
