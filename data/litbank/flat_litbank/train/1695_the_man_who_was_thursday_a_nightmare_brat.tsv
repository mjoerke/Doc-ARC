THE	B-PER
TWO	I-PER
POETS	I-PER
OF	O
SAFFRON	B-GPE
PARK	I-GPE
THE	B-GPE
suburb	I-GPE
of	I-GPE
Saffron	I-GPE
Park	I-GPE
lay	O
on	O
the	O
sunset	O
side	O
of	O
London	B-GPE
,	O
as	O
red	O
and	O
ragged	O
as	O
a	O
cloud	O
of	O
sunset	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
built	O
of	O
a	O
bright	O
brick	O
throughout	O
;	O
its	O
sky-line	O
was	O
fantastic	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
its	O
ground	O
plan	O
was	O
wild	O
.	O

It	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
outburst	O
of	O
a	B-PER
speculative	I-PER
builder	I-PER
,	I-PER
faintly	I-PER
tinged	I-PER
with	I-PER
art	I-PER
,	I-PER
who	I-PER
called	I-PER
its	I-PER
architecture	I-PER
sometimes	I-PER
Elizabethan	I-PER
and	I-PER
sometimes	I-PER
Queen	I-PER
Anne	I-PER
,	I-PER
apparently	I-PER
under	I-PER
the	I-PER
impression	I-PER
that	I-PER
the	I-PER
two	I-PER
sovereigns	I-PER
were	I-PER
identical	I-PER
.	O

It	O
was	O
described	O
with	O
some	O
justice	O
as	O
an	O
artistic	O
colony	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
never	O
in	O
any	O
definable	O
way	O
produced	O
any	O
art	O
.	O

But	O
although	O
its	O
pretensions	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
intellectual	O
centre	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
vague	O
,	O
its	O
pretensions	O
to	O
be	O
a	B-GPE
pleasant	I-GPE
place	I-GPE
were	O
quite	O
indisputable	O
.	O

The	B-PER
stranger	I-PER
who	I-PER
looked	I-PER
for	I-PER
the	I-PER
first	I-PER
time	I-PER
at	I-PER
the	I-PER
quaint	I-PER
red	I-PER
houses	I-PER
could	O
only	O
think	O
how	O
very	O
oddly	O
shaped	O
the	B-PER
people	I-PER
must	O
be	O
who	O
could	O
fit	O
in	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

Nor	O
when	O
he	O
met	O
the	B-PER
people	I-PER
was	O
he	O
disappointed	O
in	O
this	O
respect	O
.	O

The	B-GPE
place	I-GPE
was	O
not	O
only	O
pleasant	O
,	O
but	O
perfect	O
,	O
if	O
once	O
he	O
could	O
regard	O
it	O
not	O
as	O
a	O
deception	O
but	O
rather	O
as	O
a	O
dream	O
.	O

Even	O
if	O
the	B-PER
people	I-PER
were	O
not	O
“	O
artists	B-PER
,	O
”	O
the	O
whole	O
was	O
nevertheless	O
artistic	O
.	O

That	B-PER
young	I-PER
man	I-PER
with	I-PER
the	I-PER
long	I-PER
,	I-PER
auburn	I-PER
hair	I-PER
and	I-PER
the	I-PER
impudent	I-PER
face	I-PER
--	O
that	B-PER
young	I-PER
man	I-PER
was	O
not	O
really	O
a	B-PER
poet	I-PER
;	O
but	O
surely	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
poem	O
.	O

That	B-PER
old	I-PER
gentleman	I-PER
with	I-PER
the	I-PER
wild	I-PER
,	I-PER
white	I-PER
beard	I-PER
and	I-PER
the	I-PER
wild	I-PER
,	I-PER
white	I-PER
hat	I-PER
--	O
that	B-PER
venerable	I-PER
humbug	I-PER
was	O
not	O
really	O
a	B-PER
philosopher	I-PER
;	O
but	O
at	O
least	O
he	O
was	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
philosophy	O
in	O
others	O
.	O

That	B-PER
scientific	I-PER
gentleman	I-PER
with	I-PER
the	I-PER
bald	I-PER
,	I-PER
egg-like	I-PER
head	I-PER
and	I-PER
the	I-PER
bare	I-PER
,	I-PER
bird-like	I-PER
neck	I-PER
had	O
no	O
real	O
right	O
to	O
the	O
airs	O
of	O
science	O
that	O
he	O
assumed	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
not	O
discovered	O
anything	O
new	O
in	O
biology	O
;	O
but	O
what	O
biological	O
creature	O
could	O
he	O
have	O
discovered	O
more	O
singular	O
than	O
himself	O
?	O

Thus	O
,	O
and	O
thus	O
only	O
,	O
the	B-GPE
whole	I-GPE
place	I-GPE
had	O
properly	O
to	O
be	O
regarded	O
;	O
it	O
had	O
to	O
be	O
considered	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
a	O
workshop	O
for	O
artists	B-PER
,	O
but	O
as	O
a	O
frail	O
but	O
finished	O
work	O
of	O
art	O
.	O

A	B-PER
man	I-PER
who	I-PER
stepped	I-PER
into	I-PER
its	I-PER
social	I-PER
atmosphere	I-PER
felt	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
stepped	O
into	O
a	O
written	O
comedy	O
.	O

More	O
especially	O
this	O
attractive	O
unreality	O
fell	O
upon	O
it	O
about	O
nightfall	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
extravagant	O
roofs	O
were	O
dark	O
against	O
the	O
afterglow	O
and	O
the	B-GPE
whole	I-GPE
insane	I-GPE
village	I-GPE
seemed	O
as	O
separate	O
as	O
a	O
drifting	O
cloud	O
.	O

This	O
again	O
was	O
more	O
strongly	O
true	O
of	O
the	O
many	O
nights	O
of	O
local	O
festivity	O
,	O
when	O
the	B-FAC
little	I-FAC
gardens	I-FAC
were	O
often	O
illuminated	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
big	O
Chinese	O
lanterns	O
glowed	O
in	O
the	O
dwarfish	O
trees	O
like	O
some	O
fierce	O
and	O
monstrous	O
fruit	O
.	O

And	O
this	O
was	O
strongest	O
of	O
all	O
on	O
one	O
particular	O
evening	O
,	O
still	O
vaguely	O
remembered	O
in	O
the	O
locality	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
the	B-PER
auburn-haired	I-PER
poet	I-PER
was	O
the	B-PER
hero	I-PER
.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
by	O
any	O
means	O
the	O
only	O
evening	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
the	B-PER
hero	I-PER
.	O

On	O
many	O
nights	O
those	O
passing	O
by	O
his	B-FAC
little	I-FAC
back	I-FAC
garden	I-FAC
might	O
hear	O
his	O
high	O
,	O
didactic	O
voice	O
laying	O
down	O
the	O
law	O
to	O
men	B-PER
and	O
particularly	O
to	O
women	B-PER
.	O

The	O
attitude	O
of	O
women	B-PER
in	O
such	O
cases	O
was	O
indeed	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
paradoxes	O
of	O
the	B-GPE
place	I-GPE
.	O

Most	B-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
women	I-PER
were	O
of	O
the	O
kind	O
vaguely	O
called	O
emancipated	O
,	O
and	O
professed	O
some	O
protest	O
against	O
male	O
supremacy	O
.	O

Yet	O
these	B-PER
new	I-PER
women	I-PER
would	O
always	O
pay	O
to	O
a	B-PER
man	I-PER
the	O
extravagant	O
compliment	O
which	O
no	B-PER
ordinary	I-PER
woman	I-PER
ever	O
pays	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
of	O
listening	O
while	O
he	O
is	O
talking	O
.	O

And	O
Mr.	B-PER
Lucian	I-PER
Gregory	I-PER
,	O
the	B-PER
red-haired	I-PER
poet	I-PER
,	O
was	O
really	O
(	O
in	O
some	O
sense	O
)	O
a	B-PER
man	I-PER
worth	O
listening	O
to	O
,	O
even	O
if	O
one	O
only	O
laughed	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

He	O
put	O
the	O
old	O
cant	O
of	O
the	O
lawlessness	O
of	O
art	O
and	O
the	O
art	O
of	O
lawlessness	O
with	O
a	O
certain	O
impudent	O
freshness	O
which	O
gave	O
at	O
least	O
a	O
momentary	O
pleasure	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
helped	O
in	O
some	O
degree	O
by	O
the	O
arresting	O
oddity	O
of	O
his	O
appearance	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
worked	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
phrase	O
goes	O
,	O
for	O
all	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
.	O

His	O
dark	O
red	O
hair	O
parted	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
was	O
literally	O
like	O
a	B-PER
woman	I-PER
’s	O
,	O
and	O
curved	O
into	O
the	O
slow	O
curls	O
of	O
a	B-PER
virgin	I-PER
in	O
a	O
pre-Raphaelite	O
picture	O
.	O

From	O
within	O
this	O
almost	O
saintly	O
oval	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
his	O
face	O
projected	O
suddenly	O
broad	O
and	O
brutal	O
,	O
the	O
chin	O
carried	O
forward	O
with	O
a	O
look	O
of	O
cockney	O
contempt	O
.	O

This	O
combination	O
at	O
once	O
tickled	O
and	O
terrified	O
the	O
nerves	O
of	O
a	O
neurotic	O
population	O
.	O

He	O
seemed	O
like	O
a	O
walking	O
blasphemy	O
,	O
a	O
blend	O
of	O
the	B-PER
angel	I-PER
and	O
the	O
ape	O
.	O

This	O
particular	O
evening	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
remembered	O
for	O
nothing	O
else	O
,	O
will	O
be	O
remembered	O
in	O
that	B-GPE
place	I-GPE
for	O
its	O
strange	O
sunset	O
.	O

It	O
looked	O
like	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	B-LOC
world	I-LOC
.	O

All	O
the	O
heaven	O
seemed	O
covered	O
with	O
a	O
quite	O
vivid	O
and	O
palpable	O
plumage	O
;	O
you	O
could	O
only	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
sky	O
was	O
full	O
of	O
feathers	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
feathers	O
that	O
almost	O
brushed	O
the	O
face	O
.	O

Across	O
the	O
great	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
dome	O
they	O
were	O
grey	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
strangest	O
tints	O
of	O
violet	O
and	O
mauve	O
and	O
an	O
unnatural	O
pink	O
or	O
pale	O
green	O
;	O
but	O
towards	O
the	O
west	O
the	O
whole	O
grew	O
past	O
description	O
,	O
transparent	O
and	O
passionate	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
last	O
red-hot	O
plumes	O
of	O
it	O
covered	O
up	O
the	O
sun	O
like	O
something	O
too	O
good	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
.	O

The	O
whole	O
was	O
so	O
close	O
about	O
the	B-LOC
earth	I-LOC
,	O
as	O
to	O
express	O
nothing	O
but	O
a	O
violent	O
secrecy	O
.	O

The	O
very	O
empyrean	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
secret	O
.	O

It	O
expressed	O
that	O
splendid	O
smallness	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
soul	O
of	O
local	O
patriotism	O
.	O

The	O
very	O
sky	O
seemed	O
small	O
.	O

I	O
say	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
some	B-PER
inhabitants	I-PER
who	I-PER
may	I-PER
remember	I-PER
the	I-PER
evening	I-PER
if	I-PER
only	I-PER
by	I-PER
that	I-PER
oppressive	I-PER
sky	I-PER
.	O

There	O
are	O
others	B-PER
who	I-PER
may	I-PER
remember	I-PER
it	I-PER
because	I-PER
it	I-PER
marked	I-PER
the	I-PER
first	I-PER
appearance	I-PER
in	I-PER
the	I-PER
place	I-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
second	I-PER
poet	I-PER
of	I-PER
Saffron	I-PER
Park	I-PER
.	O

For	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
the	B-PER
red-haired	I-PER
revolutionary	I-PER
had	O
reigned	O
without	O
a	B-PER
rival	I-PER
;	O
it	O
was	O
upon	O
the	O
night	O
of	O
the	O
sunset	O
that	O
his	O
solitude	O
suddenly	O
ended	O
.	O

The	B-PER
new	I-PER
poet	I-PER
,	I-PER
who	I-PER
introduced	I-PER
himself	I-PER
by	I-PER
the	I-PER
name	I-PER
of	I-PER
Gabriel	I-PER
Syme	I-PER
was	O
a	O
very	O
mild-looking	O
mortal	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
fair	O
,	O
pointed	O
beard	O
and	O
faint	O
,	O
yellow	O
hair	O
.	O

But	O
an	O
impression	O
grew	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
less	O
meek	O
than	O
he	O
looked	O
.	O

He	O
signalised	O
his	O
entrance	O
by	O
differing	O
with	O
the	B-PER
established	I-PER
poet	I-PER
,	O
Gregory	B-PER
,	O
upon	O
the	O
whole	O
nature	O
of	O
poetry	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
that	O
he	O
(	O
Syme	B-PER
)	O
was	O
poet	B-PER
of	I-PER
law	I-PER
,	O
a	B-PER
poet	I-PER
of	I-PER
order	I-PER
;	O
nay	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
he	O
was	O
a	B-PER
poet	I-PER
of	I-PER
respectability	I-PER
.	O

So	O
all	B-PER
the	I-PER
Saffron	I-PER
Parkers	I-PER
looked	O
at	O
him	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
that	O

fallen	O
out	O
of	O
that	O
impossible	O
