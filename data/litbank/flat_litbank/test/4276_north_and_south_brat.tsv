But	O
,	O
as	O
Margaret	B-PER
half	O
suspected	O
,	O
Edith	B-PER
had	O
fallen	O
asleep	O

She	O
lay	O
curled	O
up	O
on	O
the	O
sofa	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
back	I-FAC
drawing-room	I-FAC
in	O
Harley	B-FAC
Street	I-FAC
,	O
looking	O
very	O
lovely	O
in	O
her	O
white	O
muslin	O
and	O
blue	O
ribbons	O

If	O
Titania	B-PER
had	O
ever	O

dressed	O
in	O
white	O
muslin	O

blue	O

had	O

a	O
crimson	O

sofa	O

a	B-FAC
back	I-FAC
drawing-room	I-FAC
,	O
Edith	B-PER
might	O
have	O
been	O
taken	O
for	O
her	O
.	O

Margaret	B-PER
was	O
struck	O
afresh	O
by	O
her	B-PER
cousin	I-PER
's	O
beauty	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
grown	O
up	O
together	O
from	O
childhood	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
along	O
Edith	B-PER
had	O
been	O
remarked	O
upon	O
by	O
every	B-PER
one	I-PER
,	O
except	O
Margaret	B-PER
,	O
for	O
her	O
prettiness	O
;	O
but	O
Margaret	B-PER
had	O
never	O
thought	O
about	O
it	O
until	O
the	O
last	O
few	O
days	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
prospect	O
of	O
soon	O
losing	O
her	B-PER
companion	I-PER
seemed	O
to	O
give	O
force	O
to	O
every	O
sweet	O
quality	O
and	O
charm	O
which	O
Edith	B-PER
possessed	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
been	O
talking	O
about	O
wedding	O
dresses	O
,	O
and	O
wedding	O
ceremonies	O
;	O
and	O
Captain	B-PER
Lennox	I-PER
,	O
and	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
told	O
Edith	B-PER
about	O
her	O
future	O
life	O
at	O
Corfu	B-GPE
,	O
where	O
his	O
regiment	O
was	O
stationed	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
difficulty	O
of	O
keeping	O
a	O
piano	O
in	O
good	O
tune	O
(	O
a	O
difficulty	O
which	O
Edith	B-PER
seemed	O
to	O
consider	O
as	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
formidable	O
that	O
could	O
befall	O
her	O
in	O
her	O
married	O
life	O
)	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
gowns	O
she	O
should	O
want	O
in	O
the	O
visits	O
to	O
Scotland	B-GPE
,	O
which	O
would	O
immediately	O
succeed	O
her	O
marriage	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
whispered	O
tone	O
had	O
latterly	O
become	O
more	O
drowsy	O
;	O
and	O
Margaret	B-PER
,	O
after	O
a	O
pause	O
of	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
,	O
found	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
fancied	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
spite	O
of	O
the	O
buzz	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
next	I-FAC
room	I-FAC
,	O
Edith	B-PER
had	O
rolled	O
herself	O
up	O
into	O
a	O
soft	O
ball	O
of	O
muslin	O
and	O
ribbon	O
,	O
and	O
silken	O
curls	O
,	O
and	O
gone	O
off	O
into	O
a	O
peaceful	O
little	O
after-dinner	O
nap	O
.	O

Margaret	B-PER
had	O
been	O
on	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
telling	O
her	B-PER
cousin	I-PER
of	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
plans	O
and	O
visions	O
which	O
she	O
entertained	O
as	O
to	O
her	O
future	O
life	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
parsonage	O
,	O
where	O
her	B-PER
father	I-PER
and	O
mother	B-PER
lived	O
;	O
and	O
where	O
her	O
bright	O
holidays	O
had	O
always	O
been	O
passed	O
,	O
though	O
for	O
the	O
last	O
ten	O
years	O
her	B-FAC
aunt	I-FAC
Shaw	I-FAC
's	I-FAC
house	I-FAC
had	O
been	O
considered	O
as	O
her	B-FAC
home	I-FAC
.	O

But	O
in	O
default	O
of	O
a	B-PER
listener	I-PER
,	O
she	O
had	O
to	O
brood	O
over	O
the	O
change	O
in	O
her	O
life	O
silently	O
as	O
heretofore	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
happy	O
brooding	O
,	O
although	O
tinged	O
with	O
regret	O
at	O
being	O
separated	O
for	O
an	O
indefinite	O
time	O
from	O
her	B-PER
gentle	I-PER
aunt	I-PER
and	O
dear	B-PER
cousin	I-PER
.	O

As	O
she	O
thought	O
of	O
the	O
delight	O
of	O
filling	O
the	O
important	O
post	O
of	O
only	B-PER
daughter	I-PER
in	I-PER
Helstone	I-PER
parsonage	I-PER
,	O
pieces	O
of	O
the	O
conversation	O
out	O
of	O
the	B-FAC
next	I-FAC
room	I-FAC
came	O
upon	O
her	O
ears	O
.	O

Her	B-PER
aunt	I-PER
Shaw	B-PER
was	O
talking	O
to	O
the	B-PER
five	I-PER
or	I-PER
six	I-PER
ladies	I-PER
who	I-PER
had	I-PER
been	I-PER
dining	I-PER
there	I-PER
,	I-PER
and	I-PER
whose	I-PER
husbands	I-PER
were	I-PER
still	I-PER
in	I-PER
the	I-PER
dining-room	I-PER
.	O

They	O
were	O
the	O
familiar	O
acquaintances	O
of	O
the	B-FAC
house	I-FAC
;	O
neighbours	B-PER
whom	I-PER
Mrs.	I-PER
Shaw	I-PER
called	I-PER
friends	I-PER
,	O
because	O
she	O
happened	O
to	O
dine	O
with	O
them	O
more	O
frequently	O
than	O
with	O
any	B-PER
other	I-PER
people	I-PER
,	O
and	O
because	O
if	O
she	O
or	O
Edith	B-PER
wanted	O
anything	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
they	O
from	O
her	O
,	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
scruple	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
call	O
at	O
each	B-FAC
other	I-FAC
's	I-FAC
houses	I-FAC
before	O
luncheon	O
.	O

These	B-PER
ladies	I-PER
and	O
their	B-PER
husbands	I-PER
were	O
invited	O
,	O
in	O
their	O
capacity	O
of	O
friends	B-PER
,	O
to	O
eat	O
a	O
farewell	O
dinner	O
in	O
honour	O
of	O
Edith	B-PER
's	O
approaching	O
marriage	O
.	O

Edith	B-PER
had	O
rather	O
objected	O
to	O
this	O
arrangement	O
,	O
for	O
Captain	B-PER
Lennox	I-PER
was	O
expected	O
to	O
arrive	O
by	O
a	B-VEH
late	I-VEH
train	I-VEH
this	O
very	O
evening	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
although	O
she	O
was	O
a	B-PER
spoiled	I-PER
child	I-PER
,	O
she	O
was	O
too	O
careless	O
and	O
idle	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
strong	O
will	O
of	O
her	O
own	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
way	O
when	O
she	O
found	O
that	O
her	B-PER
mother	I-PER
had	O
absolutely	O
ordered	O
those	O
extra	O
delicacies	O
of	O
the	O
season	O
which	O
are	O
always	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
efficacious	O
against	O
immoderate	O
grief	O
at	O
farewell	O
dinners	O
.	O

She	O
contented	O
herself	O
by	O
leaning	O
back	O
in	O
her	O
chair	O
,	O
merely	O
playing	O
with	O
the	O
food	O
on	O
her	O
plate	O
,	O
and	O
looking	O
grave	O
and	O
absent	O
;	O
while	O
all	O
around	O
her	O
were	O
enjoying	O
the	O
mots	O
of	O
Mr.	B-PER
Grey	I-PER
,	O
the	B-PER
gentleman	I-PER
who	I-PER
always	I-PER
took	I-PER
the	I-PER
bottom	I-PER
of	I-PER
the	I-PER
table	I-PER
at	I-PER
Mrs.	I-PER
Shaw	I-PER
's	I-PER
dinner	I-PER
parties	I-PER
,	I-PER
and	I-PER
asked	I-PER
Edith	I-PER
to	I-PER
give	I-PER
them	I-PER
some	I-PER
music	I-PER
in	I-PER
the	I-PER
drawing-room	I-PER
.	O

Mr.	B-PER
Grey	I-PER
was	O
particularly	O
agreeable	O
over	O
this	O
farewell	O
dinner	O
,	O
and	O
the	B-PER
gentlemen	I-PER
staid	O
down	O
stairs	B-FAC
longer	O
than	O
usual	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
very	O
well	O
they	O
did	O
--	O
to	O
judge	O
from	O
the	O
fragments	O
of	O
conversation	O
which	O
Margaret	B-PER
overheard	O
.	O
'	O

I	O
suffered	O
too	O
much	O
myself	O
;	O
not	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
extremely	O
happy	O
with	O
the	B-PER
poor	I-PER
dear	I-PER
General	I-PER
,	O
but	O
still	O
disparity	O
of	O
age	O
is	O
a	O
drawback	O
;	O
one	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
resolved	O
Edith	B-PER
should	O
not	O
have	O
to	O
encounter	O
.	O

Of	O
course	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
maternal	O
partiality	O
,	O
I	O
foresaw	O
that	O
the	B-PER
dear	I-PER
child	I-PER
was	O
likely	O
to	O
marry	O
early	O
;	O
indeed	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
often	O
said	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
sure	O
she	O
would	O
be	O
married	O
before	O
she	O
was	O
nineteen	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
quite	O
a	O
prophetic	O
feeling	O
when	O
Captain	B-PER
Lennox	I-PER
'	O
--	O
and	O
here	O
the	O
voice	O
dropped	O
into	O
a	O
whisper	O
,	O
but	O
Margaret	B-PER
could	O
easily	O
supply	O
the	O
blank	O
.	O

The	O
course	O
of	O
true	O
love	O
in	O
Edith	B-PER
's	O
case	O
had	O
run	O
remarkably	O
smooth	O
.	O

Mrs.	B-PER
Shaw	I-PER
had	O
given	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
presentiment	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
expressed	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
had	O
rather	O
urged	O
on	O
the	O
marriage	O
,	O
although	O
it	O
was	O
below	O
the	O
expectations	O
which	O
many	O
of	O
Edith	B-PER
's	O
acquaintances	O
had	O
formed	O
for	O
her	O
,	O
a	B-PER
young	I-PER
and	I-PER
pretty	I-PER
heiress	I-PER
.	O

But	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Shaw	I-PER
said	O
that	O
her	B-PER
only	I-PER
child	I-PER
should	O
marry	O
for	O
love	O
,	O
--	O
and	O
sighed	O
emphatically	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
love	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
her	O
motive	O
for	O
marrying	O
the	B-PER
General	I-PER
.	O

Mrs.	B-PER
Shaw	I-PER
enjoyed	O
the	O
romance	O
of	O
the	O
present	O
engagement	O
rather	O
more	O
than	O
her	B-PER
daughter	I-PER
.	O

Not	O
but	O
that	O
Edith	B-PER
was	O
very	O
thoroughly	O
and	O
properly	O
in	O
love	O
;	O
still	O
she	O
would	O
certainly	O
have	O
preferred	O
a	B-FAC
good	I-FAC
house	I-FAC
in	I-FAC
Belgravia	I-FAC
,	O
to	O
all	O
the	O
picturesqueness	O
of	O
the	O
life	O
which	O
Captain	B-PER
Lennox	I-PER
described	O
at	O
Corfu	B-GPE
.	O

The	O
very	O
parts	O
which	O
made	O
Margaret	B-PER
glow	O
as	O
she	O
listened	O
,	O
Edith	B-PER
pretended	O
to	O
shiver	O
and	O
shudder	O
at	O
;	O
partly	O
for	O
the	O
pleasure	O
she	O
had	O
in	O
being	O
coaxed	O
out	O
of	O
her	O
dislike	O
by	O
her	B-PER
fond	I-PER
lover	I-PER
,	O
and	O
partly	O
because	O
anything	O
of	O
a	O
gipsy	O
or	O
make-shift	O
life	O
was	O
really	O
distasteful	O
to	O
her	O
.	O

Yet	O
had	O
any	B-PER
one	I-PER
come	O
with	O
a	B-FAC
fine	I-FAC
house	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
a	B-FAC
fine	I-FAC
estate	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
a	O
fine	O
title	O
to	O
boot	O
,	O
Edith	B-PER
would	O
still	O
have	O
clung	O
to	O
Captain	B-PER
Lennox	I-PER
while	O
the	O
temptation	O
lasted	O
;	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
over	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
possible	O
she	O
might	O
have	O
had	O
little	O
qualms	O
of	O
ill-concealed	O
regret	O
that	O
Captain	B-PER
Lennox	I-PER
could	O
not	O
have	O
united	O
in	O
his	B-PER
person	I-PER
everything	O
that	O
was	O

She	O
remembered	O
the	O
dark	O
,	O
dim	O
look	O
of	O
the	B-FAC
London	I-FAC
nursery	I-FAC
,	O
presided	O
over	O
by	O
an	B-PER
austere	I-PER

ceremonious	I-PER
nurse	I-PER

who	I-PER
was	I-PER
terribly	I-PER
particular	I-PER
about	I-PER
clean	I-PER
hands	I-PER

torn	I-PER
frocks	I-PER

She	O

the	O

up	O

from	O
her	B-PER
father	I-PER

who	O
were	O
dining	O
somewhere	O
down	O
below	O
an	O

depth	O

for	O
unless	O

up	O

the	O

(	O
the	O
child	B-PER
thought	O
)	O

they	O
must	O
be	O
deep	O
down	O

the	O

the	B-LOC

At	O

in	O
Harley	B-FAC

her	B-FAC
mother	I-FAC

her	B-FAC

as	O

early	O

in	O
the	B-FAC

Margaret	B-PER

Oh	O
!	O

well	O
did	O
the	B-PER
tall	I-PER
stately	I-PER
girl	I-PER
of	I-PER
eighteen	I-PER
remember	O
the	O
tears	O
shed	O
with	O
such	O
wild	O
passion	O
of	O
grief	O
by	O
the	B-PER
little	I-PER
girl	I-PER
of	I-PER
nine	I-PER
,	O
as	O
she	O
hid	O
her	O
face	O
under	O
the	O
bed-clothes	O
,	O
in	O
that	O
first	O
night	O
;	O
and	O
how	O
she	O
was	O
bidden	O
not	O
to	O
cry	O
by	O
the	B-PER
nurse	I-PER
,	O
because	O
it	O
would	O
disturb	O
Miss	B-PER
Edith	I-PER
;	O
and	O
how	O
she	O
had	O
cried	O
as	O
bitterly	O
,	O
but	O
more	O
quietly	O
,	O
till	O
her	O
newly-seen	B-PER
,	I-PER
grand	I-PER
,	I-PER
pretty	I-PER
aunt	I-PER
had	O
come	O
softly	O
upstairs	B-FAC

Mr.	B-PER
Hale	I-PER
to	O
show	O
him	O
his	B-PER
little	I-PER
sleeping	I-PER
daughter	I-PER

Then	O
the	B-PER
little	I-PER
Margaret	I-PER
had	O
hushed	O
her	O
sobs	O
,	O
and	O
tried	O
to	O
lie	O
quiet	O
as	O
if	O
asleep	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
making	O
her	B-PER
father	I-PER
unhappy	O
by	O
her	O
grief	O
,	O
which	O
she	O
dared	O
not	O
express	O
before	O
her	B-PER
aunt	I-PER
,	O
and	O
which	O
she	O
rather	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
wrong	O
to	O
feel	O
at	O
all	O
after	O
the	O
long	O
hoping	O
,	O
and	O
planning	O
,	O
and	O
contriving	O
they	O
had	O
gone	O
through	O
at	O
home	B-FAC
,	O
before	O
her	O
wardrobe	O
could	O
be	O
arranged	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
suit	O
her	O
grander	O
circumstances	O
,	O
and	O
before	O
papa	B-PER
could	O
leave	O
his	B-FAC
parish	I-FAC
to	O
come	O
up	O
to	O
London	B-GPE
,	O
even	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
days	O

Now	O

to	O
love	O
the	B-FAC

nursery	I-FAC
,	O
though	O
it	O
was	O

a	B-FAC
dismantled	I-FAC
place	I-FAC

she	O
looked	O
all	O
round	O

with	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
cat-like	O
regret	O

at	O
the	O
