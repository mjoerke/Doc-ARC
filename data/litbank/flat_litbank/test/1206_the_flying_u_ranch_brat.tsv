The	B-PER

his	O

and	O
Happy	B-PER

followed	O

but	O
the	O

of	O
the	B-PER

unobtrusively	O
took	O

From	O
his	O
black-and-white	O

swept	O

swept	O
in	O

Miguel	B-PER
was	O
not	O

by	O
the	O
inspection	O

He	O
was	O
tall	O

straight	O

and	O
swarthily	O
handsome	O

and	O
he	O
stood	O
with	O
the	O
complacence	O
of	O
a	B-PER
stage	I-PER
favorite	I-PER
waiting	I-PER
for	I-PER
the	I-PER
applause	I-PER

and	O
,	O
while	O
he	O

he	O
sifted	O

into	O
a	O
cigarette	O
paper	O
daintily	O
,	O
with	O
his	O
little	O
finger	O
extended	O

There	O
was	O
a	O

upon	O
that	O

;	O
a	O

with	O
a	O
moonstone	O
setting	O
as	O

as	O
the	O
eye	O
of	O
a	O

,	O
and	O
the	B-PER

caught	O
the	O
pale	O
gleam	O
of	O
it	O
and	O
drew	O
a	O
long	O
breath	O

He	O
lighted	O
a	O
match	O
nonchalantly	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
artfully	O
simple	O
method	O
of	O
pinching	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
it	O
with	O
his	O

,	O
leaned	O
negligently	O
against	O
the	O
wall	O
of	O
the	B-FAC

,	O
and	O
regarded	O
the	B-PER

incuriously	O
while	O
he	O
smoked	O

“	O
Any	B-PER

he	O

languidly	O

after	O
a	O

The	B-PER

went	O
prickly	O
hot	O

The	B-PER
girls	I-PER
in	I-PER
that	I-PER
neighborhood	I-PER
were	O
held	O
in	O
esteem	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
that	O
in	O
his	O
tone	O
which	O
gave	O
offense	O

“	O

Big	B-PER

him	O

Miguel	B-PER
shot	O
an	O
oblique	O
glance	O
at	O
Big	B-PER
Medicine	I-PER
,	O
examined	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
his	O
cigarette	O

and	O
gave	O
a	O
lift	O
of	O
shoulder	O
,	O
which	O
might	O
mean	O
anything	O
or	O
nothing	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
was	O
irritating	O
to	O
a	O
degree	O
.	O

He	O
did	O
not	O
pursue	O
the	O
subject	O
further	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
several	O
belated	O

were	O

At	O
supper	O
they	O
talked	O
with	O
him	O
perfunctorily	O
,	O
and	O
covertly	O
sneered	O
because	O
he	O
sprinkled	O
his	O
food	O
liberally	O
with	O
cayenne	O
and	O
his	O
speech	O
with	O
Spanish	O
words	O
pronounced	O
with	O
soft	O
,	O
slurred	O
vowels	O
that	O
made	O
them	O
sound	O
unfamiliar	O
,	O
and	O
against	O
which	O
his	O
English	O
contrasted	O
sharply	O
with	O
its	O
crisp	O
,	O
American	O
enunciation	O
.	O

He	O
met	O
their	O
infrequent	O
glances	O
with	O
the	O
cool	O
stare	O
of	O
absolute	O
indifference	O
to	O
their	O
opinion	O
of	O
him	O

their	O

with	O
