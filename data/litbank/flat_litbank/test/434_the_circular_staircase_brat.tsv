TAKE	O
A	B-FAC
COUNTRY	I-FAC
HOUSE	I-FAC
This	O
is	O
the	O
story	O
of	O
how	O
a	B-PER
middle-aged	I-PER
spinster	I-PER
lost	O
her	O
mind	O
,	O
deserted	O
her	B-PER
domestic	I-PER
gods	I-PER
in	O
the	O
city	O
,	O
took	O
a	B-FAC
furnished	I-FAC
house	I-FAC
for	O
the	O
summer	O
out	O
of	O
town	B-GPE
,	O
and	O
found	O
herself	O
involved	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
mysterious	O
crimes	O
that	O
keep	O
our	O
newspapers	O
and	O
detective	O
agencies	O
happy	O
and	O
prosperous	O
.	O

For	O
twenty	O
years	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
perfectly	O
comfortable	O
;	O
for	O
twenty	O
years	O
I	O
had	O
had	O
the	O
window-boxes	O
filled	O
in	O
the	O
spring	O
,	O
the	O
carpets	O
lifted	O
,	O
the	O
awnings	O
put	O
up	O
and	O
the	O
furniture	O
covered	O
with	O
brown	O
linen	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
many	O
summers	O
I	O
had	O
said	O
good-by	O
to	O
my	B-PER
friends	I-PER
,	O
and	O
,	O
after	O
watching	O
their	O
perspiring	O
hegira	O
,	O
had	O
settled	O
down	O
to	O
a	O
delicious	O
quiet	O
in	O
town	B-GPE
,	O
where	O
the	O
mail	O
comes	O
three	O
times	O
a	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
water	O
supply	O
does	O
not	O
depend	O
on	O
a	O
tank	O
on	O
the	O
roof	O
.	O

And	O
then	O
--	O
the	O
madness	O
seized	O
me	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
look	O
back	O
over	O
the	O
months	O
I	O
spent	O
at	O
Sunnyside	B-GPE
,	O
I	O
wonder	O
that	O
I	O
survived	O
at	O
all	O
.	O

As	O
it	O
is	O
,	O
I	O
show	O
the	O
wear	O
and	O
tear	O
of	O
my	O
harrowing	O
experiences	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
turned	O
very	O
gray	O
--	O
Liddy	B-PER
reminded	O
me	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
only	O
yesterday	O
,	O
by	O
saying	O
that	O
a	O
little	O
bluing	O
in	O
the	O
rinse-water	O
would	O
make	O
my	O
hair	O
silvery	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
a	O
yellowish	O
white	O
.	O

I	O
hate	O
to	O
be	O
reminded	O
of	O
unpleasant	O
things	O
and	O
I	O
snapped	O
her	O
off	O
.	O

"	O
No	O
,	O
"	O
I	O
said	O
sharply	O
,	O
"	O
I	O
'm	O
not	O
going	O
to	O

Liddy	B-PER
's	O
nerves	O
are	O
gone	O
,	O
she	O
says	O
,	O
since	O
that	O
awful	O
summer	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
has	O
enough	O
left	O
,	O
goodness	O
knows	O

And	O
when	O
she	O
begins	O
to	O
go	O
around	O
with	O
a	O
lump	O
in	O
her	O
throat	O
,	O
all	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
is	O
to	O
threaten	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
Sunnyside	B-GPE
,	O
and	O
she	O
is	O
frightened	O
into	O
a	O
semblance	O
of	O
cheerfulness	O
,	O
--	O
from	O
which	O
you	O
may	O
judge	O
that	O
the	O
summer	O
there	O
was	O
anything	O
but	O
a	O
success	O
.	O

The	O
newspaper	O
accounts	O
have	O
been	O
so	O
garbled	O
and	O
incomplete	O
--	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
mentioned	O
me	O
but	O
once	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
only	O
as	O
the	B-PER
tenant	I-PER
at	O
the	O
time	O
the	O
thing	O
happened	O
--	O
that	O
I	O
feel	O
it	O
my	O
due	O
to	O
tell	O
what	O
I	O
know	O
.	O

Mr.	B-PER
Jamieson	I-PER
,	O
the	B-PER
detective	I-PER
,	O
said	O
himself	O
he	O
could	O
never	O
have	O
done	O
without	O
me	O
,	O
although	O
he	O
gave	O
me	O
little	O
enough	O
credit	O
,	O
in	O
print	O
.	O

I	O
shall	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
several	O
years	O
--	O
thirteen	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
exact	O
--	O
to	O
start	O
my	O
story	O
.	O

At	O
that	O
time	O
my	B-PER
brother	I-PER
died	O
,	O
leaving	O
me	O
his	B-PER
two	I-PER
children	I-PER
.	O

Halsey	B-PER
was	O
eleven	O
then	O
,	O
and	O
Gertrude	B-PER
was	O
seven	O
.	O

All	O
the	O
responsibilities	O
of	O
maternity	O
were	O
thrust	O
upon	O
me	O
suddenly	O
;	O
to	O
perfect	O
the	O
profession	O
of	O
motherhood	O
requires	O
precisely	O
as	O
many	O
years	O
as	O
the	B-PER
child	I-PER
has	O
lived	O
,	O
like	O
the	B-PER
man	I-PER
who	I-PER
started	I-PER
to	I-PER
carry	I-PER
the	I-PER
calf	I-PER
and	I-PER
ended	I-PER
by	I-PER
walking	I-PER
along	I-PER
with	I-PER
the	I-PER
bull	I-PER
on	I-PER
his	I-PER
shoulders	I-PER
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
the	O
best	O
I	O
could	O
.	O

When	O
Gertrude	B-PER
got	O
past	O
the	O
hair-ribbon	O
age	O
,	O
and	O
Halsey	B-PER
asked	O
for	O
a	O
scarf-pin	O
and	O
put	O
on	O
long	O
trousers	O
--	O
and	O
a	O
wonderful	O
help	O
that	O
was	O
to	O
the	O
darning	O
.	O

--	O
I	O
sent	O
them	O
away	O
to	O
good	B-FAC
schools	I-FAC
.	O

After	O
that	O
,	O
my	O
responsibility	O
was	O
chiefly	O
postal	O
,	O
with	O
three	O
months	O
every	O
summer	O
in	O
which	O
to	O
replenish	O
their	O
wardrobes	O
,	O
look	O
over	O
their	O
lists	O
of	O
acquaintances	O
,	O
and	O
generally	O
to	O
take	O
my	O
foster-motherhood	O
out	O
of	O
its	O
nine	O
months	O
'	O
retirement	O
in	O
camphor	O
.	O

I	O
missed	O
the	O
summers	O
with	O
them	O
when	O
,	O
somewhat	O
later	O
,	O
at	O
boarding-school	B-FAC
and	O
college	B-FAC
,	O
the	B-PER
children	I-PER
spent	O
much	O
of	O
their	O
vacations	O
with	O
friends	B-PER
.	O

Gradually	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
my	O
name	O
signed	O
to	O
a	O
check	O
was	O
even	O
more	O
welcome	O
than	O
when	O
signed	O
to	O
a	O
letter	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
wrote	O
them	O
at	O
stated	O
intervals	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
Halsey	B-PER
had	O
finished	O
his	O
electrical	O
course	O
and	O
Gertrude	B-PER
her	B-FAC
boarding-school	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
both	O
came	O
home	B-FAC
to	O
stay	O
,	O
things	O
were	O
suddenly	O
changed	O
.	O

The	O
winter	O
Gertrude	B-PER
came	O
out	O
was	O
nothing	O
but	O
a	O
succession	O
of	O
sitting	O
up	O
late	O
at	O
night	O
to	O
bring	O
her	B-FAC
home	I-FAC
from	O
things	O
,	O
taking	O
her	O
to	O
the	B-PER
dressmakers	I-PER
between	O
naps	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
discouraging	O
ineligible	B-PER
youths	I-PER
with	I-PER
either	I-PER
more	I-PER
money	I-PER
than	I-PER
brains	I-PER
,	I-PER
or	I-PER
more	I-PER
brains	I-PER
than	I-PER
money	I-PER
.	O

Also	O
,	O
I	O
acquired	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
things	O
:	O
to	O
say	O
lingerie	O
for	O
under-garments	O
,	O
"	O
frocks	O
"	O
and	O
"	O
gowns	O
"	O
instead	O
of	O
dresses	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
beardless	B-PER
sophomores	I-PER
are	O
not	O
college	B-PER
boys	I-PER
,	O
but	O
college	B-PER
men	I-PER
.	O

Halsey	B-PER
required	O
less	O
personal	O
supervision	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
they	O
both	O
got	O
their	B-PER
mother	I-PER
's	O
fortune	O
that	O
winter	O
,	O
my	O
responsibility	O
became	O
purely	O
moral	O
.	O

Halsey	B-PER
bought	O
a	B-VEH
car	I-VEH
,	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
learned	O
how	O
to	O
tie	O
over	O
my	O
bonnet	O
a	O
gray	O
baize	O
veil	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
after	O
a	O
time	O
,	O
never	O
to	O
stop	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
dogs	O
one	O
has	O
run	O
down	O
.	O

People	B-PER
are	O
apt	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
unpleasant	O
about	O
their	O
dogs	O
.	O

The	O
additions	O
to	O
my	O
education	O
made	O
me	O
a	B-PER
properly	I-PER
equipped	I-PER
maiden	I-PER
aunt	I-PER
,	O
and	O
by	O
spring	O
I	O
was	O
quite	O
tractable	O
.	O

So	O
when	O
Halsey	B-PER
suggested	O
camping	O
in	O
the	O
Adirondacks	B-LOC
and	O
Gertrude	B-PER
wanted	O
Bar	B-GPE
Harbor	I-GPE
,	O
we	O
compromised	O
on	O
a	B-FAC
good	I-FAC
country	I-FAC
house	I-FAC
with	O
links	O
near	O
,	O
within	O
motor	O
distance	O
of	O
town	B-GPE
and	O
telephone	O
distance	O
of	O
the	B-PER
doctor	I-PER
.	O

That	O
was	O
how	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
Sunnyside	B-GPE
.	O

We	O
went	O
out	O
to	O
inspect	O
the	B-FAC
property	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
deserve	O
its	O
name	O
.	O

Its	O
cheerful	O
appearance	O
gave	O
no	O
indication	O
whatever	O
of	O
anything	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ordinary	O
.	O

Only	O
one	O
thing	O
seemed	O
unusual	O
to	O
me	O
:	O
the	B-PER
housekeeper	I-PER
,	I-PER
who	I-PER
had	I-PER
been	I-PER
left	I-PER
in	I-PER
charge	I-PER
,	O
had	O
moved	O
from	O
the	B-FAC
house	I-FAC
to	O
the	B-FAC
gardener	I-FAC
's	I-FAC
lodge	I-FAC
,	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
before	O
.	O

As	O
the	B-FAC
lodge	I-FAC
was	O
far	O
enough	O
away	O
from	O
the	B-FAC
house	I-FAC
,	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
either	O
fire	O
or	O
thieves	B-PER
could	O
complete	O
their	O
work	O
of	O
destruction	O
undisturbed	O
.	O

The	B-FAC
property	I-FAC
was	O
an	O
extensive	O
one	O
:	O
the	B-FAC
house	I-FAC
on	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
a	B-LOC
hill	I-LOC
,	O
which	O
sloped	O
away	O
in	O
great	O
stretches	O
of	O
green	B-FAC
lawn	I-FAC
and	O
clipped	O
hedges	O
,	O
to	O
the	B-FAC
road	I-FAC
;	O
and	O
across	O
the	B-LOC
valley	I-LOC
,	O
perhaps	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
miles	O
away	O
,	O
was	O
the	B-FAC
Greenwood	I-FAC
Club	I-FAC
House	I-FAC
.	O

Gertrude	B-PER
and	O
Halsey	B-PER
were	O
infatuated	O
.	O

"	O
Why	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
everything	O
you	O
want	O
,	O
"	O
Halsey	B-PER
said	O
"	O
View	O
,	O
air	O
,	O
good	O
water	O
and	O
good	B-FAC
roads	I-FAC
.	O

As	O
for	O
the	B-FAC
house	I-FAC
,	O
it	O
's	O
big	O
enough	O
for	O
a	B-FAC
hospital	I-FAC
,	O
if	O
it	O
has	O
a	O
Queen	O
Anne	O
front	O
and	O
a	O
Mary	O
Anne	O
back	O
,	O
"	O
which	O
was	O
ridiculous	O
:	O
it	O
was	O
pure	O
Elizabethan	O
.	O

Of	O
course	O
we	O
took	O
the	B-FAC
place	I-FAC
;	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
my	O
idea	O
of	O
comfort	O
,	O
being	O
much	O
too	O
large	O
and	O
sufficiently	O
isolated	O
to	O
make	O
the	B-PER
servant	I-PER
question	O
serious	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
give	O
myself	O
credit	O
for	O
this	O
:	O
whatever	O
has	O
happened	O
since	O
,	O
I	O
never	O
blamed	O
Halsey	B-PER
and	O
Gertrude	B-PER
for	O
taking	O
me	O
there	B-FAC

And	O
another	O
thing	O
:	O
if	O
the	O
series	O
of	O
catastrophes	O
there	B-FAC
did	O
nothing	O
else	O
,	O
it	O
taught	O
me	O
one	O
thing	O
--	O
that	O
somehow	O
,	O
somewhere	O

from	O
perhaps	O
a	B-PER
half-civilized	I-PER
ancestor	I-PER

wore	I-PER
a	I-PER
sheepskin	I-PER
garment	I-PER
and	I-PER
trailed	I-PER
his	I-PER

I	O
have	O
in	O
me	O
the	O
instinct	O

Were	O

as	O
no	O

with	O
the	O

but	O
as	O
Halsey	B-PER

always	O
attentive	O

a	B-PER

I	O
knew	O

only	O
through	O
his	O

with	O
the	B-ORG

I	O
cleared	O

away	O
to	O
a	O

party	O

and	O
moved	O
out	O

Sunnyside	B-GPE
