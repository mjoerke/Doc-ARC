The	B-PER

lady	I-PER
pulled	O
her	O

down	O

looked	O
over	O
them	O
about	O
the	B-FAC

up	O

small	O
a	O

just	O

She	O
looked	O
perplexed	O
for	O
a	O
moment	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
said	O

not	O
fiercely	O

still	O
loud	O
enough	O
for	O
the	O

She	O

with	O
the	O

so	O
she	O
needed	O

She	O

She	O
went	O
to	O
the	O

she	O
lifted	O
up	O

There	O
was	O

A	O
bit	O
of	O
a	O
scare	O

through	O

a	O
touch	O
of	O

it	O
flattered	O
her	O

Not	O
because	O
his	O
troubles	O
were	O
one	O
whit	O
less	O
heavy	O
and	O
bitter	O
to	O
him	O
than	O
a	B-PER
man	I-PER
's	O
are	O
to	O
a	B-PER
man	I-PER
,	O
but	O
because	O
a	O
new	O
and	O
powerful	O
interest	O
bore	O
them	O
down	O
and	O
drove	O
them	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
mind	O
for	O
the	O
time	O
--	O
just	O
as	O
men	B-PER
's	O
misfortunes	O
are	O
forgotten	O
in	O
the	O
excitement	O
of	O
new	O
enterprises	O
.	O

This	O
new	O
interest	O
was	O
a	O
valued	O
novelty	O
in	O
whistling	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
just	O
acquired	O
from	O
a	B-PER
negro	I-PER
,	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
suffering	O
to	O
practise	O
it	O
un-disturbed	O
.	O

It	O
consisted	O
in	O
a	O
peculiar	O
bird-like	O
turn	O
,	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
liquid	O
warble	O
,	O
produced	O
by	O
touching	O
the	O
tongue	O
to	O
the	O
roof	O
of	O
the	O
mouth	O
at	O
short	O
intervals	O
in	O
the	O

of	O

--	O
the	B-PER
reader	I-PER
probably	O
remembers	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
has	O
ever	O
been	O
a	B-PER
boy	I-PER
.	O

Diligence	O
and	O
attention	O
soon	O
gave	O
him	O
the	O
knack	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
strode	O
down	O
the	B-FAC
street	I-FAC
with	O
his	O
mouth	O
full	O
of	O
harmony	O
and	O
his	O
soul	O
full	O
of	O
gratitude	O
.	O

He	O
felt	O
much	O
as	O
an	B-PER
astronomer	I-PER
feels	O
who	O
has	O
discovered	O
a	O
new	O
planet	O
--	O
no	O

the	O
advantage	O
was	O
with	O
the	B-PER
boy	I-PER
,	O
not	O
the	B-PER

The	O
summer	O
evenings	O
were	O
long	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
dark	O
,	O
yet	O
.	O

Presently	O
Tom	B-PER
checked	O
his	O
whistle	O
.	O

A	B-PER
stranger	I-PER
was	O
before	O
him	O
--	O
a	B-PER
boy	I-PER
a	O
shade	O
larger	O
than	O
himself	O
.	O

A	B-PER
new-comer	I-PER
of	I-PER
any	I-PER
age	I-PER
or	I-PER
either	I-PER
sex	I-PER
was	O
an	O
im-pressive	O
curiosity	O
in	O
the	B-GPE
poor	I-GPE
little	I-GPE
shabby	I-GPE
village	I-GPE
of	I-GPE
St.	I-GPE
Petersburg	I-GPE
.	O

This	B-PER
boy	I-PER
was	O
well	O
dressed	O
,	O
too	O
--	O
well	O
dressed	O
on	O
a	O
week-day	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
simply	O
as	O
astounding	O
.	O

His	O
cap	O
was	O
a	O
dainty	O
thing	O
,	O
his	O
close-buttoned	O
blue	O
cloth	O
roundabout	O
was	O
new	O
and	O
natty	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
were	O
his	O
pantaloons	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
shoes	O
on	O
--	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
Friday	O
.	O

He	O
even	O
wore	O
a	O
necktie	O
,	O
a	O
bright	O
bit	O
of	O
ribbon	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
a	O
citified	O
air	O
about	O
him	O
that	O
ate	O
into	O
Tom	B-PER
's	O
vitals	O
.	O

The	O
more	O
Tom	B-PER
stared	O
at	O
the	O
splendid	O
marvel	O
,	O
the	O
higher	O
he	O
turned	O
up	O
his	O
nose	O
at	O
his	O
finery	O
and	O
the	O
shabbier	O
and	O
shabbier	O
his	O
own	O
outfit	O
seemed	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
grow	O
.	O

Neither	B-PER
boy	I-PER
spoke	O
.	O

If	O
one	O
moved	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
moved	O
--	O
but	O
only	O
sidewise	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
circle	O
;	O
they	O
kept	O
face	O
to	O
face	O
and	O
eye	O
to	O
eye	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

Finally	O
Tom	B-PER
said	O
:	O
“	O
I	O
can	O
lick	O
you	O

”	O

“	O
I	O
