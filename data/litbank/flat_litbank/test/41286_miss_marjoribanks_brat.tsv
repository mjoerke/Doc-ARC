Dr	B-PER

His	B-PER

for	O
the	B-PER

with	O

up	O
her	O

the	O

Miss	B-PER

her	B-PER

it	O

make	O
a	B-FAC

Miss	B-PER
Marjoribanks	I-PER
was	O
not	O
vain	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
word	O
had	O
taken	O
possession	O
of	O
her	O
imagination	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
natural	O
,	O
and	O
solaced	O
her	O
much	O
when	O
she	O
made	O
the	O
painful	O
discovery	O
that	O
her	O
gloves	O
were	O
half	O
a	O
number	O
larger	O

and	O
her	O

a	O

the	O
hands	O

both	O
perfectly	O

being	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
well	O
clothed	O

plump	O

were	O
much	O
more	O
presentable	O

pleasant	O
to	O

than	O
the	O
lean	O
rudimentary	O
schoolgirl	B-PER

with	O
which	O

were	O
surrounded	O

To	O
add	O
to	O
these	O
excellences	O

Lucilla	B-PER

a	O
mass	O
of	O

nothing	O

She	O
wore	O
it	O
in	O
large	O

for	O
it	O

this	O
aggravating	O
quality	O

that	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
grow	O
long	O

but	O
would	O
grow	O
ridiculously	O

unmanageably	O
thick	O

to	O
the	O

of	O
her	B-PER

to	O
her	O

no	O

with	O
those	O

These	O
were	O
the	O
external	O
characteristics	O
of	O
the	B-PER

was	I-PER
going	I-PER

to	I-PER
be	I-PER
a	I-PER

to	I-PER
her	I-PER

his	I-PER

In	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
her	O

Dr	B-PER

that	O
a	O

the	O

"	O

was	O
not	O
there	B-FAC
to	O
soothe	O
her	O
last	O
moments	O

"	O

Lucilla	B-PER
said	O
to	O
herself	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
sob	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
feelings	O
sufficiently	O
real	O
in	O
their	O
way	O

After	O
this	O
,	O
the	B-PER
devoted	I-PER
daughter	I-PER
made	O
up	O
her	O
mind	O
to	O
come	O
downstairs	B-FAC
again	O
,	O
pale	O
as	O

self-controlled	O

and	O
devote	O
herself	O
to	O
papa	B-PER

Perhaps	O

if	O
great	O
emotion	O
should	O
make	O
him	O
tearless	O
,	O
as	O
such	O
cases	O

Miss	B-PER

his	O

surprise	O
him	O
into	O

All	O
this	O
went	O
briskly	O
through	O
her	O
mind	O

undeterred	O
by	O
the	O
reflection	O
that	O
tears	O
were	O
as	O
much	O
out	O
of	O
the	B-PER
Doctor	I-PER

way	O
as	O

in	O
this	O
mood	O
she	O
sped	O
swiftly	O
along	O
in	O
the	O
inspiration	O
of	O
her	O
first	O
sorrow	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
imagined	O

but	O
in	O
reality	O
to	O
suffer	O
her	O
first	O
disappointment	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
of	O
a	O
less	O

than	O
that	O

When	O
Miss	B-PER

The	B-PER

was	O
tearless	O

indeed	O

not	O
from	O
excess	O
of	O

On	O

a	O

him	O

he	O
became	O

how	O

of	O
his	B-PER

which	O
bulked	O
before	O

out	O
