crowd	I-PER
of	I-PER
beings	I-PER

for	I-PER
to	I-PER
the	I-PER
eye	I-PER
and	I-PER
ear	I-PER
they	I-PER
seem	I-PER
naught	I-PER
but	I-PER
savage	I-PER
creatures	I-PER
,	I-PER
animated	I-PER
by	I-PER
vile	I-PER
passions	I-PER

by	I-PER

the	O
very	O
spot	O
where	O
,	O
a	O
decade	O

a	B-PER
proud	I-PER
tyrant	I-PER
raised	O
an	O
undying	O
monument	O
to	O
the	O
nation	O

glory	O
and	O
his	O
own	O
vanity	O

During	O
the	O
greater	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
the	O
guillotine	O
had	O
been	O
kept	O
busy	O
at	O
its	O
ghastly	O
work	O
:	O
all	O
that	O
France	B-GPE
had	O
boasted	O
of	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
centuries	O
,	O
of	O
ancient	O
names	O

and	O
blue	O

paid	O

to	O
her	O

for	O

The	O
carnage	O
had	O
only	O
ceased	O
at	O
this	O
late	O
hour	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
because	O
there	O
were	O
other	O
more	O
interesting	O
sights	O
for	O
the	B-PER
people	I-PER
to	O
witness	O
,	O
a	O

while	O
before	O
the	O
final	O
closing	O
of	O
the	O

for	O
the	O
night	O

And	O
so	O
the	B-PER
crowd	I-PER
rushed	O
away	O
from	O
the	B-FAC
Place	I-FAC

Greve	I-FAC
and	O
made	O
for	O

to	O
watch	O
this	O
interesting	O
and	O
amusing	O

It	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
every	O
day	O
,	O
for	O
those	B-PER
aristos	I-PER
were	O
such	B-PER
fools	I-PER

They	O

since	I-PER

NOBLESSE	I-PER

Their	B-PER

the	B-PER

them	O

the	O

of	O
their	O

,	O
and	O
now	O
the	B-PER
people	I-PER
had	O
become	O
the	B-PER
rulers	I-PER
of	I-PER
France	I-PER
and	O
crushed	O
their	B-PER
former	I-PER
masters	I-PER

not	O
beneath	O
their	O

for	O
they	O
went	O
shoeless	O
mostly	O
in	O
these	O
days	O

but	O
a	O
more	O
effectual	O
weight	O

And	O
daily	O
,	O
hourly	O
,	O
the	O
hideous	O
instrument	O
of	O

old	B-PER
men	I-PER
,	O
young	B-PER
women	I-PER

tiny	B-PER

until	O
the	O
day	O
when	O
it	O
would	O
finally	O
demand	O
the	O

of	O
a	B-PER
King	I-PER
and	O
of	O
a	B-PER
beautiful	I-PER

But	O
this	O

it	O

the	B-PER

Every	B-PER
aristocrat	I-PER
was	O
a	B-PER
traitor	I-PER

as	O
his	B-PER

been	O
before	O
him	O
:	O
for	O
two	O
hundred	O
years	O

keep	O
a	O

;	O
now	O
the	B-PER

of	I-PER
those	I-PER
who	I-PER
had	I-PER
helped	I-PER
to	I-PER

those	I-PER

if	O
they	O

to	O

the	O

of	O
the	B-PER

And	O
they	O
did	O
try	O
to	O

and	O
tried	O
to	O

:	O
that	O
was	O
just	O
the	O
fun	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O

Every	O

some	B-PER

In	O
various	O

under	O

they	O
tried	O
to	O

through	O
the	O

by	O
citizen	B-PER

some	I-PER

equally	I-PER
accursed	I-PER

and	I-PER
there	I-PER

to	I-PER

who	I-PER
had	I-PER
once	I-PER
called	I-PER
themselves	I-PER
sovereigns	I-PER
of	I-PER
France	I-PER
.	O

But	O
they	O
were	O
nearly	O
always	O
caught	O
at	O
the	O
barricades	O
,	O
Sergeant	B-PER
Bibot	I-PER
especially	O
at	O
the	B-FAC
West	I-FAC
Gate	I-FAC
had	O
a	O
wonderful	O
nose	O
for	O
scenting	O
an	B-PER
aristo	I-PER
in	I-PER
the	I-PER
most	I-PER
perfect	I-PER
disguise	I-PER
.	O

Then	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
the	O
fun	O
began	O
.	O

Bibot	B-PER
would	O
look	O
at	O
his	B-PER
prey	I-PER
as	O
a	O
cat	O
looks	O
upon	O
the	O
mouse	O
,	O
play	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
sometimes	O
for	O
quite	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
pretend	O
to	O
be	O
hoodwinked	O
by	O
the	O
disguise	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
wigs	O
and	O
other	O
bits	O
of	O
theatrical	O
make-up	O
which	O
hid	O
the	O
identity	O
of	O
a	B-PER
CI-DEVANT	I-PER
noble	I-PER
marquise	I-PER
or	I-PER
count	I-PER
.	O

Oh	O
!	O

Bibot	B-PER
had	O
a	O
keen	O
sense	O
of	O
humour	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
well	O
worth	O
hanging	O
round	O
that	O
West	O
Barricade	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
see	O
him	O
catch	O
an	B-PER
aristo	I-PER
in	O
the	O
very	O
act	O
of	O
trying	O
to	O
flee	O
from	O
the	O
vengeance	O
of	O
the	B-PER
people	I-PER
.	O

Sometimes	O
Bibot	B-PER
would	O
let	O
his	B-PER
prey	I-PER
actually	O
out	O
by	O
the	O
gates	O
,	O
allowing	O
him	O
to	O
think	O
for	O
the	O
space	O
of	O
two	O
minutes	O
at	O
least	O
that	O
he	O
really	O
had	O
escaped	O
out	O
of	O
Paris	B-GPE
,	O
and	O
might	O
even	O
manage	O
to	O
reach	O
the	B-LOC
coast	I-LOC
of	O
England	B-GPE
in	O
safety	O
,	O
but	O
Bibot	B-PER
would	O
let	O
the	B-PER
unfortunate	I-PER
wretch	I-PER
walk	O
about	O
ten	O
metres	O
towards	O
the	B-LOC
open	I-LOC
country	I-LOC
,	O
then	O
he	O
would	O
send	O
two	B-PER
men	I-PER
after	O
him	O
and	O
bring	O
him	O
back	O
,	O
stripped	O
of	O
his	O
disguise	O
.	O

Oh	O
!	O

that	O
was	O
extremely	O
funny	O
,	O
for	O
as	O
often	O
as	O
not	O
the	B-PER
fugitive	I-PER
would	O
prove	O
to	O
be	O
a	B-PER
woman	I-PER
,	O
some	B-PER
proud	I-PER
marchioness	I-PER
,	I-PER
who	I-PER
looked	I-PER
terribly	I-PER
comical	I-PER
when	I-PER
she	I-PER
found	I-PER
herself	I-PER
in	I-PER
Bibot	I-PER
's	I-PER
clutches	I-PER
after	I-PER
all	I-PER
,	I-PER
and	I-PER
knew	I-PER
that	I-PER
a	I-PER
summary	I-PER
trial	I-PER
would	I-PER
await	I-PER
her	I-PER
the	I-PER
next	I-PER
day	I-PER
and	I-PER
after	I-PER
that	I-PER
,	I-PER
the	I-PER
fond	I-PER
embrace	I-PER
of	I-PER
Madame	I-PER
la	I-PER
Guillotine	I-PER
.	O

No	O
wonder	O
that	O
on	O
this	O
fine	O
afternoon	O
in	O
September	O
the	O
crowd	O
round	O
Bibot	B-PER
's	O
gate	O
was	O
eager	O
and	O
excited	O
.	O

The	O
lust	O
of	O
blood	O
grows	O
with	O
its	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
satiety	O
:	O
the	B-PER
crowd	I-PER
had	O
seen	O
a	O
hundred	O
noble	O
heads	O
fall	O
beneath	O
the	O
guillotine	O
to-day	O
,	O
it	O
wanted	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
see	O
another	B-PER
hundred	I-PER
fall	O
on	O
the	O
morrow	O
.	O

Bibot	B-PER
was	O
sitting	O
on	O
an	O
overturned	O
and	O
empty	O
cask	O
close	O
by	O
the	O
gate	O
of	O
the	O
barricade	O
;	O
a	O
small	O
detachment	O
of	O
citoyen	B-PER
soldiers	I-PER
was	O
under	O
his	O
command	O
.	O

The	O
work	O
had	O
been	O
very	O
hot	O
lately	O
.	O

Those	B-PER
cursed	I-PER
aristos	I-PER
were	O
becoming	O
terrified	O
and	O
tried	O
their	O
hardest	O
to	O
slip	O
out	O
of	O
Paris	B-GPE
:	O
men	B-PER
,	I-PER
women	I-PER
and	I-PER
children	I-PER
,	I-PER
whose	I-PER
ancestors	I-PER
,	I-PER
even	I-PER
in	I-PER
remote	I-PER
ages	I-PER
,	I-PER
had	I-PER
served	I-PER
those	I-PER
traitorous	I-PER
Bourbons	I-PER

all	I-PER
traitors	I-PER
themselves	I-PER
and	I-PER
right	I-PER
food	I-PER
for	I-PER
the	I-PER
guillotine	I-PER

Every	O
day	O
Bibot	B-PER
had	O
had	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
of	O
unmasking	O
some	B-PER
fugitive	I-PER
royalists	I-PER
and	O
sending	O
them	O
back	O
to	O
be	O
tried	O
by	O
the	B-ORG
Committee	I-ORG
of	I-ORG
Public	I-ORG
Safety	I-ORG
,	O
presided	O
over	O
by	O
that	B-PER
good	I-PER
patriot	I-PER
,	O
Citoyen	B-PER
Foucquier-Tinville	I-PER
.	O

Robespierre	B-PER
and	O
Danton	B-PER
both	O
had	O
commended	O
Bibot	B-PER
for	O
his	O
zeal	O
and	O
Bibot	B-PER
was	O
proud	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
he	O
on	O
his	O
own	O
initiative	O
had	O
sent	O
at	B-PER
least	I-PER
fifty	I-PER
aristos	I-PER
to	O
the	O
guillotine	O
.	O

But	O
to-day	O
all	B-PER
the	I-PER
sergeants	I-PER
in	I-PER
command	I-PER
at	I-PER
the	I-PER
various	I-PER
barricades	I-PER
had	O
had	O
special	O
orders	O

Recently	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
aristos	B-PER
had	O
succeeded	O
in	O
escaping	O
out	O
of	O
France	B-GPE
and	O
in	O
reaching	O
England	B-GPE
safely	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
curious	O
rumours	O
about	O
these	O
escapes	O
;	O
they	O
had	O
become	O
very	O
frequent	O
and	O
singularly	O
daring	O
;	O
the	B-PER
people	I-PER
's	O
minds	O
were	O
becoming	O
strangely	O
excited	O
about	O
it	O
all	O
.	O

Sergeant	B-PER
Grospierre	I-PER
had	O
been	O
sent	O
to	O
the	O
guillotine	O
for	O
allowing	O
a	B-PER
whole	I-PER
family	I-PER
of	I-PER
aristos	I-PER
to	O
slip	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
North	O
Gate	O
under	O
his	O
very	O
nose	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
asserted	O
that	O
these	O
escapes	O
were	O
organised	O
by	O
a	B-PER
band	I-PER
of	I-PER
Englishmen	I-PER
,	I-PER
whose	I-PER
daring	I-PER
seemed	I-PER
to	I-PER
be	I-PER
unparalleled	I-PER
,	I-PER
and	I-PER
who	I-PER
,	I-PER
from	I-PER
sheer	I-PER
desire	I-PER
to	I-PER
meddle	I-PER
in	I-PER
what	I-PER
did	I-PER
not	I-PER
concern	I-PER
them	I-PER
,	I-PER
spent	I-PER
their	I-PER
spare	I-PER
time	I-PER
in	I-PER
snatching	I-PER
away	I-PER
lawful	I-PER
victims	I-PER
destined	I-PER
for	I-PER
Madame	I-PER
la	I-PER
Guillotine	I-PER
.	O

These	O
rumours	O
soon	O
grew	O
in	O
extravagance	O
;	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
doubt	O
that	O
this	B-PER
band	I-PER
of	I-PER
meddlesome	I-PER
Englishmen	I-PER
did	O
exist	O
;	O
moreover	O
,	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
under	O
the	O
leadership	O
of	O
a	B-PER
man	I-PER
whose	I-PER
pluck	I-PER
and	I-PER
audacity	I-PER
were	I-PER
almost	I-PER
fabulous	I-PER
.	O

Strange	O
stories	O
were	O
afloat	O
of	O
how	O
he	O
and	O
those	B-PER
aristos	I-PER
whom	I-PER
he	I-PER
rescued	I-PER
became	O
suddenly	O
invisible	O
as	O
they	O
reached	O
the	O
barricades	O
and	O
escaped	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
gates	O
by	O
sheer	O
supernatural	O
agency	O
.	O

No	B-PER
one	I-PER
had	O
seen	O
these	B-PER
mysterious	I-PER
Englishmen	I-PER
;	O
as	O
for	O
their	B-PER
leader	I-PER
,	O
he	O
was	O
never	O
spoken	O

save	O
with	O
a	O
superstitious	O

Citoyen	B-PER
Foucquier-Tinville	I-PER
would	O
in	O
the	O
course	O

the	O
day	O
receive	O
a	O
scrap	O

paper	O
from	O
some	O

sometimes	O

find	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
