His	O

his	B-PER

He	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
one	O

for	O
his	O

his	O

Terry	B-PER
was	O
strong	O
on	O
facts	O

geography	O

those	O

Jeff	B-PER
could	O
beat	O
him	O
any	O

and	O
I	O
did	O

it	O
was	O
they	O
talked	O
about	O

so	O
long	O
as	O
it	O
connected	O
with	O

There	O
are	O

We	O
three	O
had	O
a	O
chance	O
to	O
join	O
a	O
big	O
scientific	O
expedition	O
.	O

They	O
needed	O
a	B-PER
doctor	I-PER
,	O
and	O
that	O
gave	O
Jeff	B-PER
an	O
excuse	O
for	O
dropping	O
his	O
just	O
opening	O
practice	O
;	O
they	O
needed	O
Terry	B-PER
’s	O
experience	O

his	O
machine	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
money	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
got	O
in	O
through	O
Terry	B-PER
’s	O
influence	O

The	O
expedition	O
was	O
up	O
among	O
the	B-LOC
thousand	I-LOC
tributaries	I-LOC
and	I-LOC
enormous	I-LOC
hinterland	I-LOC
of	I-LOC
a	I-LOC
great	I-LOC

up	O
where	O
the	O

had	O
to	O

savage	O
dialects	O
studied	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
manner	O
of	O
strange	O
flora	O

expected	O

But	O
this	O

is	O
not	O
about	O
that	O
expedition	O

That	O
was	O
only	O
the	O
merest	O
starter	O
for	O
ours	O

My	O
interest	O
was	O
first	O
roused	O
by	O
talk	O
among	O
our	B-PER
guides	I-PER

I	O
’m	O
quick	O
at	O
languages	O
,	O
know	O
a	O

and	O
pick	O
them	O
up	O
readily	O

What	O
with	O
that	O
and	O
a	B-PER
really	I-PER
good	I-PER
interpreter	I-PER
we	I-PER
took	I-PER
with	I-PER
us	I-PER
,	O
I	O
made	O
out	O
quite	O
a	O
few	O
legends	O

folk	O

of	O
these	B-PER
scattered	I-PER
tribes	I-PER

And	O
as	O
we	O
got	O
farther	O
and	O
farther	O
upstream	O

in	O
a	O

I	O
noticed	O

their	O
legends	O
all	O
agreed	O
on	O
the	O

that	O
there	O
was	O
this	B-GPE
strange	I-GPE
country	I-GPE
where	I-GPE
no	I-GPE
men	I-GPE
lived	I-GPE
--	O
only	O
women	B-PER
and	O
girl	B-PER
children	I-PER

None	O

them	O
had	O

It	O

for	O
any	B-PER

But	O
there	O
were	O
tales	O
of	O
long	O

when	O
some	B-PER

It	O
was	O
no	O
place	O
for	O

of	O
that	O
they	O
seemed	O
sure	O

I	O
told	O
the	B-PER
boys	I-PER
about	O
these	O
stories	O

and	O
they	O
laughed	O
at	O
them	O

Naturally	O
I	O
did	O
myself	O

I	O
knew	O
the	O
stuff	O
that	O

But	O
when	O
we	O
had	O
reached	O
our	O

point	O
,	O
just	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
we	O

had	O
to	O
turn	O

as	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
expeditions	O
must	O
in	O

,	O
we	O

made	O
a	O
discovery	O

The	B-FAC
main	I-FAC
encampment	I-FAC
was	O
on	O
a	B-LOC
spit	I-LOC
of	I-LOC
land	I-LOC
running	I-LOC
out	I-LOC
into	I-LOC
the	I-LOC

or	I-LOC
what	I-LOC
we	I-LOC

It	O
had	O
the	O

had	O
been	O
seeing	O
for	O
weeks	O
past	O

the	O

I	O
happened	O
to	O

I	O

I	O

“	O

The	B-PER

Jeff	B-PER

with	O
his	O

It	O
was	O
early	O

we	O

leaving	O

we	O

away	O

secretly	O

to	O

some	O

to	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
long	O
two	O

nearer	O

I	O
fancy	O
the	B-PER
savage	I-PER
could	O
have	O
done	O
it	O
alone	O
much	O
quicker	O

There	O
was	O
a	B-LOC
desperate	I-LOC
tangle	I-LOC
of	I-LOC
wood	I-LOC
and	I-LOC
water	I-LOC
and	O
a	B-LOC
swampy	I-LOC
patch	I-LOC
we	I-LOC
never	I-LOC
should	I-LOC
have	I-LOC

our	I-LOC

But	O
there	O
was	O

I	O
could	O

Terry	B-PER

with	O
compass	O

notebook	O

marking	O

trying	O

We	O
came	O
after	O
a	O

to	O
a	B-LOC
sort	I-LOC
of	I-LOC
marshy	I-LOC
lake	I-LOC
,	O
very	O
big	O

so	O
that	O
the	B-LOC
circling	I-LOC

looked	O
quite	O
low	O
and	O
dim	O
across	O
it	O

Our	B-PER
guide	I-PER
told	O
us	O
that	O
boats	B-VEH
could	O
go	O
from	O
there	B-LOC
to	O
our	B-FAC
camp	I-FAC

but	O
“	O

This	O
water	O
was	O
somewhat	O
clearer	O
than	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
left	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
judge	O
well	O
from	O
the	O
margin	O

We	O
skirted	O
it	O
for	O
another	O
half	O
hour	O
or	O
so	O
,	O
the	O
ground	O
growing	O
firmer	O
as	O
we	O
advanced	O

and	O
presently	O
we	O
turned	O
the	O
corner	O
of	O
a	B-LOC
wooded	I-LOC
promontory	I-LOC
and	O
saw	O
a	B-LOC
quite	I-LOC
different	I-LOC
country	I-LOC
--	O
a	O
sudden	O
view	O
of	O
mountains	B-LOC

we	O
