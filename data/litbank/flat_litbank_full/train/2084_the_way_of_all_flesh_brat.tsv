CHAPTER	O
I	O
When	O
I	O
was	O
a	B-PER
small	I-PER
boy	I-PER
at	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
the	O
century	O
I	O
remember	O
an	B-PER
old	I-PER
man	I-PER
who	I-PER
wore	I-PER
knee-breeches	I-PER
and	I-PER
worsted	I-PER
stockings	I-PER
,	I-PER
and	I-PER
who	I-PER
used	I-PER
to	I-PER
hobble	I-PER
about	I-PER
the	I-PER
street	I-PER
of	I-PER
our	I-PER
village	I-PER
with	I-PER
the	I-PER
help	I-PER
of	I-PER
a	I-PER
stick	I-PER
.	O

He	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
getting	O
on	O
for	O
eighty	O
in	O
the	O
year	O
1807	O
,	O
earlier	O
than	O
which	O
date	O
I	O
suppose	O
I	O
can	O
hardly	O
remember	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
born	O
in	O
1802	O
.	O

A	O
few	O
white	O
locks	O
hung	O
about	O
his	O
ears	O
,	O
his	O
shoulders	O
were	O
bent	O
and	O
his	O
knees	O
feeble	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
still	O
hale	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
much	O
respected	O
in	O
our	B-GPE
little	I-GPE
world	I-GPE
of	I-GPE
Paleham	I-GPE
.	O

His	O
name	O
was	O
Pontifex	B-PER
.	O

His	B-PER
wife	I-PER
was	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
his	B-PER
master	I-PER
;	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
told	O
she	O
brought	O
him	O
a	O
little	O
money	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
can	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
much	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
a	B-PER
tall	I-PER
,	I-PER
square-shouldered	I-PER
person	I-PER
(	I-PER
I	I-PER
have	I-PER
heard	I-PER
my	I-PER
father	I-PER
call	I-PER
her	I-PER
a	I-PER
Gothic	I-PER
woman	I-PER
)	I-PER
who	I-PER
had	I-PER
insisted	I-PER
on	I-PER
being	I-PER
married	I-PER
to	I-PER
Mr	I-PER
Pontifex	I-PER
when	I-PER
he	I-PER
was	I-PER
young	I-PER
and	I-PER
too	I-PER
good-natured	I-PER
to	I-PER
say	I-PER
nay	I-PER
to	I-PER
any	I-PER
woman	I-PER
who	I-PER
wooed	I-PER
him	I-PER
.	O

The	B-PER
pair	I-PER
had	O
lived	O
not	O
unhappily	O
together	O
,	O
for	O
Mr	B-PER
Pontifex	I-PER
's	O
temper	O
was	O
easy	O
and	O
he	O
soon	O
learned	O
to	O
bow	O
before	O
his	B-PER
wife	I-PER
's	O
more	O
stormy	O
moods	O
.	O

Mr	B-PER
Pontifex	I-PER
was	O
a	B-PER
carpenter	I-PER
by	I-PER
trade	I-PER
;	O
he	O
was	O
also	O
at	O
one	O
time	O
parish	B-PER
clerk	I-PER
;	O
when	O
I	O
remember	O
him	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
so	O
far	O
risen	O
in	O
life	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
no	O
longer	O
compelled	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
his	O
own	O
hands	O
.	O

In	O
his	O
earlier	O
days	O
he	O
had	O
taught	O
himself	O
to	O
draw	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
say	O
he	O
drew	O
well	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
surprising	O
he	O
should	O
draw	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
he	O
did	O
.	O

My	B-PER
father	I-PER
,	I-PER
who	I-PER
took	I-PER
the	I-PER
living	I-PER
of	I-PER
Paleham	I-PER
about	I-PER
the	I-PER
year	I-PER
1797	I-PER
,	O
became	O
possessed	O
of	O
a	O
good	O
many	O
of	O
old	B-PER
Mr	I-PER
Pontifex	I-PER
's	O
drawings	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
always	O
of	O
local	O
subjects	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
unaffectedly	O
painstaking	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
passed	O
for	O
the	O
work	O
of	O
some	B-PER
good	I-PER
early	I-PER
master	I-PER
.	O

I	O
remember	O
them	O
as	O
hanging	O
up	O
framed	O
and	O
glazed	O
in	O
the	O
study	O
at	O
the	B-FAC
Rectory	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
tinted	O
,	O
as	O
all	O
else	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
room	I-FAC
was	O
tinted	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
green	O
reflected	O
from	O
the	O
fringe	O
of	O
ivy	O
leaves	O
that	O
grew	O
around	O
the	O
windows	O
.	O

I	O
wonder	O
how	O
they	O
will	O
actually	O
cease	O
and	O
come	O
to	O
an	O
end	O
as	O
drawings	O
,	O
and	O
into	O
what	O
new	O
phases	O
of	O
being	O
they	O
will	O
then	O
enter	O
.	O

Not	O
content	O
with	O
being	O
an	B-PER
artist	I-PER
,	O
Mr	B-PER
Pontifex	I-PER
must	O
needs	O
also	O
be	O
a	B-PER
musician	I-PER
.	O

He	O
built	O
the	O
organ	O
in	O
the	B-FAC
church	I-FAC
with	O
his	O
own	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
smaller	O
one	O
which	O
he	O
kept	O
in	O
his	B-FAC
own	I-FAC
house	I-FAC
.	O

He	O
could	O
play	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
draw	O
,	O
not	O
very	O
well	O
according	O
to	O
professional	O
standards	O
,	O
but	O
much	O
better	O
than	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
expected	O
.	O

I	O
myself	O
showed	O
a	O
taste	O
for	O
music	O
at	O
an	O
early	O
age	O
,	O
and	O
old	B-PER
Mr	I-PER
Pontifex	I-PER
on	O
finding	O
it	O
out	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
soon	O
did	O
,	O
became	O
partial	O
to	O
me	O
in	O
consequence	O
.	O

It	O
may	O
be	O
thought	O
that	O
with	O
so	O
many	O
irons	O
in	O
the	O
fire	O
he	O
could	O
hardly	O
be	O
a	B-PER
very	I-PER
thriving	I-PER
man	I-PER
,	O
but	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
case	O
.	O

His	B-PER
father	I-PER
had	O
been	O
a	B-PER
day	I-PER
labourer	I-PER
,	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
himself	O
begun	O
life	O
with	O
no	O
other	O
capital	O
than	O
his	O
good	O
sense	O
and	O
good	O
constitution	O
;	O
now	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
goodly	O
show	O
of	O
timber	O
about	O
his	B-FAC
yard	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
a	O
look	O
of	O
solid	O
comfort	O
over	O
his	B-FAC
whole	I-FAC
establishment	I-FAC
.	O

Towards	O
the	O
close	O
of	O
the	O
eighteenth	O
century	O
and	O
not	O
long	O
before	O
my	B-PER
father	I-PER
came	O
to	O
Paleham	B-GPE
,	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
a	B-FAC
farm	I-FAC
of	I-FAC
about	I-FAC
ninety	I-FAC
acres	I-FAC
,	O
thus	O
making	O
a	O
considerable	O
rise	O
in	O
life	O
.	O

Along	O
with	O
the	B-FAC
farm	I-FAC
there	O
went	O
an	B-FAC
old-fashioned	I-FAC
but	I-FAC
comfortable	I-FAC
house	I-FAC
with	I-FAC
a	I-FAC
charming	I-FAC
garden	I-FAC
and	I-FAC
an	I-FAC
orchard	I-FAC
.	O

The	B-PER
carpenter	I-PER
's	O
business	O
was	O
now	O
carried	O
on	O
in	O
one	B-FAC
of	I-FAC
the	I-FAC
outhouses	I-FAC
that	I-FAC
had	I-FAC
once	I-FAC
been	I-FAC
part	I-FAC
of	I-FAC
some	I-FAC
conventual	I-FAC
buildings	I-FAC
,	O
the	O
remains	O
of	O
which	O
could	O
be	O
seen	O
in	O
what	O
was	O
called	O
the	B-FAC
Abbey	I-FAC
Close	I-FAC

The	B-FAC
house	I-FAC
itself	I-FAC
,	I-FAC
embosomed	I-FAC
in	I-FAC
honeysuckles	I-FAC
and	I-FAC
creeping	I-FAC
roses	I-FAC
,	O
was	O
an	B-FAC
ornament	I-FAC
to	I-FAC
the	I-FAC
whole	I-FAC
village	I-FAC
,	O
nor	O
were	O
its	O

Mrs	B-PER

I	O

whatever	O
Mr	B-PER

up	O

we	O
had	O
no	O
cause	O

and	O
then	O
Mr	B-PER
Pontifex	I-PER
would	O
play	O

us	O
upon	O
the	O

we	O
would	O
stand	O

our	I-PER

Mrs	B-PER
Pontifex	I-PER
had	O
no	O

at	O

I	O
can	O
call	O

no	O

her	B-PER

plenty	O

him	O

would	O

I	O

my	B-PER

CHAPTER	NULL
II	NULL
Old	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
1750	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
fifteen	NULL
years	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
bore	NULL
no	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
astonished	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
village	NULL
by	NULL
showing	NULL
unmistakable	NULL
signs	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
disposition	NULL
to	NULL
present	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
heir	NULL
or	NULL
heiress	NULL
.	NULL

Hers	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
been	NULL
considered	NULL
a	NULL
hopeless	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
on	NULL
consulting	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
concerning	NULL
the	NULL
meaning	NULL
of	NULL
certain	NULL
symptoms	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
informed	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
significance	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
became	NULL
very	NULL
angry	NULL
and	NULL
abused	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
roundly	NULL
for	NULL
talking	NULL
nonsense	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
thread	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
needle	NULL
in	NULL
anticipation	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
confinement	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
absolutely	NULL
unprepared	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
her	NULL
neighbours	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
better	NULL
judges	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
condition	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
got	NULL
things	NULL
ready	NULL
without	NULL
telling	NULL
her	NULL
anything	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
feared	NULL
Nemesis	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
assuredly	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
who	NULL
or	NULL
what	NULL
Nemesis	NULL
was	NULL
;	NULL
perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
feared	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
mistake	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
;	NULL
from	NULL
whatever	NULL
cause	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
refusal	NULL
to	NULL
recognise	NULL
the	NULL
obvious	NULL
arose	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
certainly	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
recognise	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
one	NULL
snowy	NULL
night	NULL
in	NULL
January	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
was	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
urgent	NULL
speed	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
rough	NULL
country	NULL
roads	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
arrived	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
two	NULL
patients	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
assistance	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
born	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
due	NULL
time	NULL
christened	NULL
George	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
honour	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
then	NULL
reigning	NULL
majesty	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
belief	NULL
George	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
nature	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
obstinate	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
mother	NULL
who	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
except	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
(	NULL
and	NULL
him	NULL
only	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
fashion	NULL
)	NULL
was	NULL
most	NULL
tenderly	NULL
attached	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
unexpected	NULL
child	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
age	NULL
;	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
she	NULL
showed	NULL
it	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
grew	NULL
up	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
sturdy	NULL
bright-eyed	NULL
little	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
intelligence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
trifle	NULL
too	NULL
great	NULL
readiness	NULL
at	NULL
book	NULL
learning	NULL
.	NULL

Being	NULL
kindly	NULL
treated	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
nature	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
of	NULL
anyone	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
healthy	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
_	NULL
meum	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
little	NULL
of	NULL
_	NULL
tuum	NULL
_	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
help	NULL
.	NULL

Brought	NULL
up	NULL
much	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
air	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
situated	NULL
and	NULL
healthiest	NULL
villages	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
little	NULL
limbs	NULL
had	NULL
fair	NULL
play	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
days	NULL
children	NULL
's	NULL
brains	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
overtasked	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
now	NULL
are	NULL
;	NULL
perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
very	NULL
reason	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
showed	NULL
an	NULL
avidity	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
seven	NULL
or	NULL
eight	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
read	NULL
,	NULL
write	NULL
and	NULL
sum	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
boy	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
age	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
father	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
rector	NULL
of	NULL
Paleham	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
remember	NULL
George	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
's	NULL
childhood	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
neighbours	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
was	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
as	NULL
unusually	NULL
quick	NULL
and	NULL
forward	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
were	NULL
naturally	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
offspring	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
become	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kings	NULL
and	NULL
councillors	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
however	NULL
to	NULL
resolve	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
son	NULL
shall	NULL
win	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
's	NULL
larger	NULL
prizes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
another	NULL
to	NULL
square	NULL
matters	NULL
with	NULL
fortune	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
respect	NULL
.	NULL

George	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
brought	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
carpenter	NULL
and	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
no	NULL

A	NULL
quick	NULL
,	NULL
intelligent	NULL
boy	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
address	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sound	NULL
constitution	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
coming	NULL
of	NULL
respectable	NULL
parents	NULL
,	NULL
has	NULL
a	NULL
potential	NULL
value	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
practised	NULL
business	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
subordinates	NULL
is	NULL
little	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
overlook	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
his	NULL
visit	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
Mr	NULL
Fairlie	NULL
proposed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
lad	NULL
's	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
promising	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
did	NULL
well	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
him	NULL
forward	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
son	NULL
's	NULL
interest	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
at	NULL
heart	NULL
to	NULL
refuse	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
offer	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
was	NULL
soon	NULL
arranged	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
Fairlies	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
George	NULL
was	NULL
sent	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
coach	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
met	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
and	NULL
aunt	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
arranged	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
live	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
George	NULL
's	NULL
great	NULL
start	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
now	NULL
wore	NULL
more	NULL
fashionable	NULL
clothes	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
yet	NULL
been	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
any	NULL
little	NULL
rusticity	NULL
of	NULL
gait	NULL
or	NULL
pronunciation	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
from	NULL
Paleham	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
quickly	NULL
and	NULL
completely	NULL
lost	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
ere	NULL
long	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
detect	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
born	NULL
and	NULL
bred	NULL
among	NULL
people	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
commonly	NULL
called	NULL
education	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
paid	NULL
great	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
justified	NULL
the	NULL
favourable	NULL
opinion	NULL
which	NULL
Mr	NULL
Fairlie	NULL
had	NULL
formed	NULL
concerning	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
Mr	NULL
Fairlie	NULL
would	NULL
send	NULL
him	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Paleham	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
'	NULL
holiday	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ere	NULL
long	NULL
his	NULL
parents	NULL
perceived	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
acquired	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL
and	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
talking	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
any	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
Paleham	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
their	NULL
proper	NULL
places	NULL
,	NULL
resigning	NULL
all	NULL
appearance	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
parental	NULL
control	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
indeed	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
necessity	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
return	NULL
,	NULL
George	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
kindly	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
retained	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
affectionate	NULL
feeling	NULL
towards	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
imagine	NULL
him	NULL
ever	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
again	NULL
for	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

George	NULL
's	NULL
visits	NULL
to	NULL
Paleham	NULL
were	NULL
never	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
from	NULL
London	NULL
was	NULL
under	NULL
fifty	NULL
miles	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
direct	NULL
coach	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
journey	NULL
was	NULL
easy	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
novelty	NULL
to	NULL
wear	NULL
off	NULL
either	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
or	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
parents	NULL
.	NULL

George	NULL
liked	NULL
the	NULL
fresh	NULL
country	NULL
air	NULL
and	NULL
green	NULL
fields	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
accustomed	NULL
in	NULL
Paternoster	NULL
Row	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
narrow	NULL
gloomy	NULL
lane	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

Independently	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pleasure	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
the	NULL
familiar	NULL
faces	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
farmers	NULL
and	NULL
villagers	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
also	NULL
being	NULL
seen	NULL
and	NULL
being	NULL
congratulated	NULL
on	NULL
growing	NULL
up	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
fine-looking	NULL
and	NULL
fortunate	NULL
young	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
youth	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
his	NULL
light	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
bushel	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
uncle	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
him	NULL
taught	NULL
Latin	NULL
and	NULL
Greek	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
evening	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
kindly	NULL
to	NULL
these	NULL
languages	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
rapidly	NULL
and	NULL
easily	NULL
mastered	NULL
what	NULL
many	NULL
boys	NULL
take	NULL
years	NULL
in	NULL
acquiring	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
his	NULL
knowledge	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
self-confidence	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
itself	NULL
felt	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
intended	NULL
it	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
;	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
soon	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
pose	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
judge	NULL
of	NULL
literature	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
judge	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL
,	NULL
architecture	NULL
,	NULL
music	NULL
and	NULL
everything	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
path	NULL
was	NULL
easy	NULL
.	NULL

Like	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
value	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
ostentatious	NULL
and	NULL
less	NULL
liberal	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
;	NULL
while	NULL
yet	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
thorough	NULL
little	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
well	NULL
rather	NULL
upon	NULL
principles	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
tested	NULL
by	NULL
personal	NULL
experiment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
recognised	NULL
as	NULL
principles	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
from	NULL
those	NULL
profounder	NULL
convictions	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
instinctive	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
give	NULL
no	NULL
account	NULL
concerning	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
wondered	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
son	NULL
had	NULL
fairly	NULL
distanced	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
inarticulate	NULL
way	NULL
the	NULL
father	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
perfectly	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
years	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
to	NULL
wearing	NULL
his	NULL
best	NULL
clothes	NULL
whenever	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
would	NULL
he	NULL
discard	NULL
them	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
ordinary	NULL
ones	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
old	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
,	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
pride	NULL
and	NULL
affection	NULL
,	NULL
felt	NULL
also	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whose	NULL
ways	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
outward	NULL
agreement	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
ways	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
felt	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
George	NULL
was	NULL
pure	NULL
and	NULL
absolute	NULL
perfection	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
pleasure	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
resembled	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
family	NULL
in	NULL
feature	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
disposition	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
George	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
twenty-five	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
partnership	NULL
on	NULL
very	NULL
liberal	NULL
terms	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
little	NULL
cause	NULL
to	NULL
regret	NULL
this	NULL
step	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
infused	NULL
fresh	NULL
vigour	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
concern	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
vigorous	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thirty	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
receipt	NULL
of	NULL
not	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
1500	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
share	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
profits	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
years	NULL
later	NULL
he	NULL
married	NULL
a	NULL
lady	NULL
about	NULL
seven	NULL
years	NULL
younger	NULL
than	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
handsome	NULL
dowry	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
died	NULL
in	NULL
1805	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
her	NULL
youngest	NULL
child	NULL
Alethea	NULL
was	NULL
born	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
marry	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
III	NULL
In	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
century	NULL
five	NULL
little	NULL
children	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
nurses	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
periodical	NULL
visits	NULL
to	NULL
Paleham	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
needless	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
rising	NULL
generation	NULL
of	NULL
Pontifexes	NULL
,	NULL
towards	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
couple	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
grandparents	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
tenderly	NULL
deferential	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Lord	NULL
Lieutenant	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
County	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
names	NULL
were	NULL
Eliza	NULL
,	NULL
Maria	NULL
,	NULL
John	NULL
,	NULL
Theobald	NULL
(	NULL
who	NULL
like	NULL
myself	NULL
was	NULL
born	NULL
in	NULL
1802	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Alethea	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
always	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
prefix	NULL
"	NULL
master	NULL
"	NULL
or	NULL
"	NULL
miss	NULL
"	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
names	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
grandchildren	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
Alethea	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
favourite	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
have	NULL
resisted	NULL
his	NULL
grandchildren	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
as	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
resisted	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
;	NULL
even	NULL
old	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
yielded	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
son	NULL
's	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
licence	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
allowed	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
sisters	NULL
and	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
stood	NULL
next	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
regard	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
regulations	NULL
only	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
attend	NULL
to	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
wipe	NULL
their	NULL
shoes	NULL
well	NULL
on	NULL
coming	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
not	NULL
overfeed	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
's	NULL
organ	NULL
with	NULL
wind	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
pipes	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
us	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Rectory	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
time	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
annual	NULL
visit	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
Pontifexes	NULL
to	NULL
Paleham	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
prevailing	NULL
licence	NULL
;	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
tea	NULL
with	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
her	NULL
grandchildren	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
our	NULL
young	NULL
friends	NULL
were	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Rectory	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
tea	NULL
with	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
what	NULL
we	NULL
considered	NULL
great	NULL
times	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
fell	NULL
desperately	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
Alethea	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
we	NULL
all	NULL
fell	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
plurality	NULL
and	NULL
exchange	NULL
whether	NULL
of	NULL
wives	NULL
or	NULL
husbands	NULL
being	NULL
openly	NULL
and	NULL
unblushingly	NULL
advocated	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
nurses	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
merry	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
forgotten	NULL
nearly	NULL
everything	NULL
save	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
_	NULL
were	NULL
_	NULL
very	NULL
merry	NULL
.	NULL

Almost	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
remains	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
permanent	NULL
impression	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
Theobald	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
beat	NULL
his	NULL
nurse	NULL
and	NULL
teased	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
cried	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
sha	NULL
n't	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
keep	NULL
you	NULL
on	NULL
purpose	NULL
to	NULL
torment	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

One	NULL
winter	NULL
's	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
1811	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
bell	NULL
tolling	NULL
while	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
dressing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
nursery	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
told	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
old	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
.	NULL

Our	NULL
man-servant	NULL
John	NULL
told	NULL
us	NULL
and	NULL
added	NULL
with	NULL
grim	NULL
levity	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
ringing	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
fit	NULL
of	NULL
paralysis	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
carried	NULL
her	NULL
off	NULL
quite	NULL
suddenly	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
shocking	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
so	NULL
because	NULL
our	NULL
nurse	NULL
assured	NULL
us	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
God	NULL
chose	NULL
we	NULL
might	NULL
all	NULL
have	NULL
fits	NULL
of	NULL
paralysis	NULL
ourselves	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
straight	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Day	NULL
of	NULL
Judgement	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Day	NULL
of	NULL
Judgement	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
opinion	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
most	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
under	NULL
any	NULL
circumstances	NULL
be	NULL
delayed	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
years	NULL
longer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
world	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
burned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
ourselves	NULL
be	NULL
consigned	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
eternity	NULL
of	NULL
torture	NULL
,	NULL
unless	NULL
we	NULL
mended	NULL
our	NULL
ways	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
we	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
seemed	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
alarming	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
fell	NULL
to	NULL
screaming	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
hullabaloo	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
nurse	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
peace	NULL
to	NULL
reassure	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
we	NULL
wept	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
more	NULL
composedly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
tea	NULL
and	NULL
cakes	NULL
for	NULL
us	NULL
now	NULL
at	NULL
old	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Pontifex	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

we	NULL

a	NULL
great	NULL
excitement	NULL
;	NULL
old	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
sent	NULL
round	NULL
a	NULL
penny	NULL
loaf	NULL
to	NULL
every	NULL
inhabitant	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
custom	NULL
still	NULL
not	NULL
uncommon	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
century	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
loaf	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
dole	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
custom	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
penny	NULL
loaves	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
before	NULL
seen	NULL
one	NULL
;	NULL
moreover	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
presents	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
as	NULL
inhabitants	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
treated	NULL
as	NULL
grown	NULL
up	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
our	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
servants	NULL
had	NULL
each	NULL
one	NULL
loaf	NULL
sent	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
yet	NULL
suspected	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
inhabitants	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
;	NULL
finally	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
loaves	NULL
were	NULL
new	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
passionately	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
new	NULL
bread	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
seldom	NULL
or	NULL
never	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
supposed	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

Our	NULL
affection	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
our	NULL
old	NULL
friend	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
combined	NULL
attacks	NULL
of	NULL
archaeological	NULL
interest	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
rights	NULL
of	NULL
citizenship	NULL
and	NULL
property	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
pleasantness	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
and	NULL
goodness	NULL
for	NULL
food	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
loaves	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
importance	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
given	NULL
us	NULL
by	NULL
our	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
intimate	NULL
with	NULL
someone	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
actually	NULL
died	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
upon	NULL
further	NULL
inquiry	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
reason	NULL
to	NULL
anticipate	NULL
an	NULL
early	NULL
death	NULL
for	NULL
anyone	NULL
of	NULL
ourselves	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
being	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
rather	NULL
liked	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
someone	NULL
else	NULL
's	NULL
being	NULL
put	NULL
away	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
churchyard	NULL
;	NULL
we	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
time	NULL
from	NULL
extreme	NULL
depression	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
no	NULL
less	NULL
extreme	NULL
exultation	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
heaven	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
earth	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
revealed	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
perception	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
benefiting	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
fear	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
we	NULL
took	NULL
an	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
health	NULL
of	NULL
everyone	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
whose	NULL
position	NULL
rendered	NULL
a	NULL
repetition	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dole	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
likely	NULL
.	NULL

Those	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
all	NULL
great	NULL
things	NULL
seemed	NULL
far	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
astonished	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
that	NULL
Napoleon	NULL
Buonaparte	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
actually	NULL
living	NULL
person	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
man	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
have	NULL
lived	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
our	NULL
own	NULL
doors	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
lent	NULL
colour	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
view	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Day	NULL
of	NULL
Judgement	NULL
might	NULL
indeed	NULL
be	NULL
nearer	NULL
than	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
nurse	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
those	NULL
days	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
lay	NULL
longer	NULL
and	NULL
drifted	NULL
deeper	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lanes	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
does	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
milk	NULL
was	NULL
sometimes	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL
frozen	NULL
in	NULL
winter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
taken	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
kitchen	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
rectories	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
now	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
milk	NULL
comes	NULL
in	NULL
frozen	NULL
sometimes	NULL
in	NULL
winter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
wonder	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
see	NULL
any	NULL
frozen	NULL
milk	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
the	NULL
winters	NULL
are	NULL
warmer	NULL
than	NULL
they	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

About	NULL
one	NULL
year	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
also	NULL
was	NULL
gathered	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
fathers	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
father	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
died	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
theory	NULL
about	NULL
sunsets	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
two	NULL
steps	NULL
built	NULL
up	NULL
against	NULL
a	NULL
wall	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
garden	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
and	NULL
watch	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
whenever	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
father	NULL
came	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
setting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
resting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
looking	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
field	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
path	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
my	NULL
father	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
father	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
say	NULL
"	NULL
Good-bye	NULL
,	NULL
sun	NULL
;	NULL
good	NULL
-	NULL
bye	NULL
,	NULL
sun	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
sank	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
tone	NULL
and	NULL
manner	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
feeling	NULL
very	NULL
feeble	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
sunset	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
dole	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
grandchildren	NULL
were	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
funeral	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
remonstrated	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
much	NULL
by	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

John	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
sneered	NULL
at	NULL
penny	NULL
loaves	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
intimated	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
wanted	NULL
one	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
because	NULL
my	NULL
papa	NULL
and	NULL
mamma	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
afford	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
me	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
whereon	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
we	NULL
did	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
fighting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
rather	NULL
think	NULL
John	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
my	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
nurse	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
outgrowing	NULL
nurses	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
reported	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
to	NULL
higher	NULL
quarters	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
put	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
ignominy	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
awakened	NULL
from	NULL
our	NULL
dream	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
long	NULL
enough	NULL
before	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
"	NULL
penny	NULL

"	NULL
mentioned	NULL
without	NULL
our	NULL
ears	NULL
tingling	NULL
with	NULL
shame	NULL

If	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL

we	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL

deigned	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
more	NULL
came	NULL
Waterloo	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
European	NULL
peace	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Mr	NULL
George	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
went	NULL
abroad	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
seeing	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
in	NULL
after	NULL
years	NULL
the	NULL
diary	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
occasions	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
characteristic	NULL
document	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
author	NULL
before	NULL
starting	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
admire	NULL
only	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
creditable	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
admire	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
nature	NULL
and	NULL
art	NULL
only	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
spectacles	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
handed	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
generation	NULL
after	NULL
generation	NULL
of	NULL
prigs	NULL
and	NULL
impostors	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
glimpse	NULL
of	NULL
Mont	NULL
Blanc	NULL
threw	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
conventional	NULL
ecstasy	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
feelings	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
express	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
gasped	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
hardly	NULL
dared	NULL
to	NULL
breathe	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
viewed	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
monarch	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mountains	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
fancy	NULL
the	NULL
genius	NULL
seated	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
stupendous	NULL
throne	NULL
far	NULL
above	NULL
his	NULL
aspiring	NULL
brethren	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
solitary	NULL
might	NULL
defying	NULL
the	NULL
universe	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
overcome	NULL
by	NULL
my	NULL
feelings	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
bereft	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
faculties	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
worlds	NULL
have	NULL
spoken	NULL
after	NULL
my	NULL
first	NULL
exclamation	NULL
till	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
some	NULL
relief	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
gush	NULL
of	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
pain	NULL
I	NULL
tore	NULL
myself	NULL
from	NULL
contemplating	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
'	NULL
at	NULL
distance	NULL
dimly	NULL
seen	NULL

I	NULL
felt	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL

walked	NULL

My	NULL

I	NULL
found	NULL
some	NULL
relief	NULL
by	NULL
exhausting	NULL
my	NULL
feelings	NULL
through	NULL
exercise	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL

he	NULL
reached	NULL
Chamonix	NULL

went	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
Sunday	NULL

Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
's	NULL

gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL

two	NULL

wonder	NULL

I	NULL
wonder	NULL
how	NULL
often	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
himself	NULL

quite	NULL
as	NULL
big	NULL
a	NULL
gun	NULL

if	NULL
the	NULL

him	NULL

how	NULL
often	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL
any	NULL

the	NULL
visitors	NULL

recognizing	NULL
him	NULL

admiring	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
sitting	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

how	NULL
often	NULL

vexed	NULL

perhaps	NULL

Returning	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
,	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
what	NULL

believed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
masterpieces	NULL
of	NULL
Greek	NULL

art	NULL

no	NULL
he	NULL
brought	NULL
back	NULL
some	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL

satisfied	NULL

bear	NULL
the	NULL

examination	NULL

Was	NULL
George	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Fortune	NULL
's	NULL
favoured	NULL

not	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

for	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
consider	NULL
himself	NULL

he	NULL
took	NULL
whatever	NULL

never	NULL
thanked	NULL

being	NULL
firmly	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
whatever	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL

was	NULL
of	NULL

own	NULL
getting	NULL

And	NULL
so	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL

after	NULL
Fortune	NULL

made	NULL
him	NULL

get	NULL
it	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
some	NULL
men	NULL
are	NULL
independent	NULL
of	NULL
antecedents	NULL

have	NULL
an	NULL

no	NULL

this	NULL
is	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL

it	NULL
may	NULL

Let	NULL
it	NULL
suffice	NULL
that	NULL
George	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
consider	NULL
himself	NULL
fortunate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
who	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
consider	NULL
himself	NULL
fortunate	NULL
is	NULL
unfortunate	NULL
.	NULL

True	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
rich	NULL
,	NULL
universally	NULL
respected	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
natural	NULL
constitution	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL

eaten	NULL

drunk	NULL
less	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
indisposition	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
his	NULL
main	NULL
strength	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
though	NULL
his	NULL
capacity	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
average	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
too	NULL

It	NULL

this	NULL
rock	NULL

just	NULL

much	NULL
more	NULL

his	NULL
neighbours	NULL

will	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
too	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
shown	NULL
them	NULL

but	NULL
not	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
puzzle	NULL
them	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
far	NULL
safer	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL

he	NULL

risen	NULL
too	NULL

It	NULL

any	NULL

arrived	NULL
at	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
a	NULL

kind	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
fortune	NULL
generally	NULL
attends	NULL
self-made	NULL
men	NULL

the	NULL

certainly	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
's	NULL
success	NULL
was	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
rapid	NULL
.	NULL

Only	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
years	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
partner	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
and	NULL

both	NULL
died	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
months	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
their	NULL
heir	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
sole	NULL
partner	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
business	NULL
but	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
fortune	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
30,000	NULL
pounds	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bargain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
sum	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

Money	NULL
came	NULL
pouring	NULL
in	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
faster	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
fonder	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
frequently	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
valued	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
sake	NULL

but	NULL
only	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
means	NULL

Yet	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL

it	NULL

felt	NULL
this	NULL

his	NULL
money	NULL

His	NULL
money	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL

money	NULL
never	NULL
made	NULL
noise	NULL

not	NULL
spill	NULL

or	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
open	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL

His	NULL
dividends	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
quarrel	NULL
among	NULL
themselves	NULL

nor	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
under	NULL
any	NULL
uneasiness	NULL
lest	NULL
his	NULL

reaching	NULL
manhood	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
VI	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
trouble	NULL
himself	NULL
much	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
motives	NULL
.	NULL

People	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
introspective	NULL
then	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
now	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
lived	NULL
more	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
rule	NULL
of	NULL
thumb	NULL
.	NULL

Dr	NULL
Arnold	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
sown	NULL
that	NULL
crop	NULL
of	NULL
earnest	NULL
thinkers	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
now	NULL
harvesting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
men	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
why	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
way	NULL
if	NULL
no	NULL
evil	NULL
consequences	NULL
to	NULL
themselves	NULL
seemed	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
upon	NULL
their	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
as	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
sometimes	NULL
let	NULL
themselves	NULL
in	NULL
for	NULL
more	NULL
evil	NULL
consequences	NULL
than	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
bargained	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

Like	NULL
other	NULL
rich	NULL
men	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
century	NULL
he	NULL
ate	NULL
and	NULL
drank	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
health	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
his	NULL
excellent	NULL
constitution	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
proof	NULL
against	NULL
a	NULL
prolonged	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
overfeeding	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
now	NULL
consider	NULL
overdrinking	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
liver	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
unfrequently	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
order	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
breakfast	NULL
looking	NULL
yellow	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
people	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
look	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
rule	NULL
the	NULL
eating	NULL
of	NULL
sour	NULL
grapes	NULL
that	NULL
causes	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
's	NULL
teeth	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
set	NULL
on	NULL
edge	NULL
.	NULL

Well-to-do	NULL
parents	NULL
seldom	NULL
eat	NULL
many	NULL
sour	NULL
grapes	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
danger	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
lies	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
parents	NULL
eating	NULL
too	NULL
many	NULL
sweet	NULL
ones	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
grant	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
sight	NULL
it	NULL
seems	NULL
very	NULL
unjust	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
parents	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
fun	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
be	NULL
punished	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
young	NULL
people	NULL
should	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
part	NULL
and	NULL
parcel	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
parents	NULL
and	NULL
therefore	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fun	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
person	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
parents	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
forgotten	NULL
the	NULL
fun	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
people	NULL
do	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
headache	NULL
after	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
tipsy	NULL
overnight	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
headache	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
pretend	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
person	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
got	NULL
drunk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
claim	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
his	NULL
self	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
preceding	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
his	NULL
self	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
who	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
punished	NULL
;	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
should	NULL
offspring	NULL
complain	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
headache	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
has	NULL
earned	NULL
when	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
person	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
parents	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
continuation	NULL
of	NULL
identity	NULL

though	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
immediately	NULL

is	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
real	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
case	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
is	NULL
really	NULL
hard	NULL
is	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
parents	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
fun	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
born	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
are	NULL
punished	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
these	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
black	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
very	NULL
gloomy	NULL
views	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL

of	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL

them	NULL

who	NULL

the	NULL

The	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
fresh	NULL
air	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
affect	NULL
the	NULL
happiness	NULL
of	NULL
children	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
London	NULL
alley	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL

sing	NULL

play	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL

So	NULL
the	NULL
absence	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
genial	NULL
mental	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
commonly	NULL
recognised	NULL
by	NULL
children	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
known	NULL
it	NULL

Young	NULL

a	NULL

either	NULL

Even	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
unhappy	NULL

very	NULL
unhappy	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
astonishing	NULL
how	NULL
easily	NULL
they	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
prevented	NULL
from	NULL
finding	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL

To	NULL
parents	NULL
who	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
lead	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
life	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
:	NULL
Tell	NULL
your	NULL
children	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
very	NULL
naughty	NULL
--	NULL
much	NULL
naughtier	NULL
than	NULL
most	NULL

Point	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
people	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
acquaintances	NULL
as	NULL
models	NULL
of	NULL
perfection	NULL

impress	NULL
your	NULL
own	NULL
children	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
inferiority	NULL

You	NULL
carry	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
more	NULL
guns	NULL
than	NULL
they	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
fight	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
is	NULL
called	NULL
moral	NULL
influence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
enable	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
bounce	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
please	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
think	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
yet	NULL
caught	NULL
you	NULL
lying	NULL
often	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
suspect	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL

you	NULL

yourself	NULL

they	NULL

how	NULL
great	NULL

you	NULL
are	NULL

how	NULL
soon	NULL
you	NULL

run	NULL
away	NULL

if	NULL
they	NULL
fight	NULL
you	NULL
with	NULL
persistency	NULL

judgement	NULL

You	NULL
keep	NULL
the	NULL
dice	NULL
and	NULL
throw	NULL
them	NULL
both	NULL
for	NULL
your	NULL
children	NULL

yourself	NULL

Load	NULL
them	NULL

for	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
easily	NULL
manage	NULL
to	NULL
stop	NULL
your	NULL
children	NULL
from	NULL
examining	NULL
them	NULL

Tell	NULL
them	NULL
how	NULL
singularly	NULL
indulgent	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL

insist	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
incalculable	NULL
benefit	NULL
you	NULL
conferred	NULL

them	NULL

firstly	NULL
in	NULL
bringing	NULL
them	NULL

the	NULL
world	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL

more	NULL
particularly	NULL
in	NULL
bringing	NULL
them	NULL
into	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
your	NULL
own	NULL
children	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
anyone	NULL
else	NULL

Say	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
their	NULL
highest	NULL
interests	NULL
at	NULL

whenever	NULL
you	NULL

out	NULL

Harp	NULL
much	NULL
upon	NULL
these	NULL

Feed	NULL
them	NULL

upon	NULL
such	NULL
brimstone	NULL

the	NULL

True	NULL

your	NULL
children	NULL
will	NULL
probably	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
some	NULL
day	NULL

not	NULL
until	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL

to	NULL
them	NULL

inconvenience	NULL

Some	NULL
satirists	NULL
have	NULL
complained	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
inasmuch	NULL
as	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
pleasures	NULL
belong	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fore	NULL
part	NULL

it	NULL

we	NULL

the	NULL

a	NULL
decrepit	NULL

To	NULL
me	NULL
it	NULL
seems	NULL
that	NULL
youth	NULL

an	NULL
overpraised	NULL
season	NULL

Fontenelle	NULL
at	NULL

what	NULL

the	NULL

said	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

that	NULL

we	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
VII	NULL
A	NULL
few	NULL
words	NULL
may	NULL
suffice	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
alluding	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
foregoing	NULL
chapter	NULL
.	NULL

Eliza	NULL
and	NULL
Maria	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
elder	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
neither	NULL
exactly	NULL
pretty	NULL
nor	NULL
exactly	NULL
plain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
respects	NULL
model	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Alethea	NULL
was	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
pretty	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
lively	NULL
,	NULL
affectionate	NULL
disposition	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
sharp	NULL
contrast	NULL
with	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
brothers	NULL
and	NULL
sisters	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
trace	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
grandfather	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
love	NULL
of	NULL
fun	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
had	NULL
none	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
boisterous	NULL
and	NULL
rather	NULL
coarse	NULL
quasi-humour	NULL
which	NULL
passed	NULL
for	NULL
wit	NULL
with	NULL
many	NULL
.	NULL

John	NULL
grew	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
good-looking	NULL
,	NULL
gentlemanly	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
features	NULL
a	NULL
trifle	NULL
too	NULL
regular	NULL
and	NULL
finely	NULL
chiselled	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
dressed	NULL
himself	NULL
so	NULL
nicely	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
good	NULL
address	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stuck	NULL
so	NULL
steadily	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
books	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
favourite	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
masters	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
instinct	NULL
for	NULL
diplomacy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
popular	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lectures	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
read	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
older	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
moreover	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
develop	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
whose	NULL
hands	NULL
the	NULL
prospects	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
house	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
decline	NULL
.	NULL

John	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
humour	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
comparatively	NULL
early	NULL
age	NULL
admitted	NULL
to	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
confidence	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
nature	NULL
to	NULL
bestow	NULL
on	NULL
anyone	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
brother	NULL
Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
match	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
accepted	NULL
his	NULL
fate	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
good-looking	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
brother	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
address	NULL
so	NULL
good	NULL
;	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
violently	NULL
passionate	NULL
;	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
reserved	NULL
and	NULL
shy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
indolent	NULL
in	NULL
mind	NULL
and	NULL
body	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
tidy	NULL
than	NULL
John	NULL
,	NULL
less	NULL
well	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
assert	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
less	NULL
skilful	NULL
in	NULL
humouring	NULL
the	NULL
caprices	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
loved	NULL
anyone	NULL
heartily	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL
circle	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
repress	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
invite	NULL
his	NULL
affection	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
exception	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
Alethea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
quick	NULL
and	NULL
lively	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
somewhat	NULL
morose	NULL
temper	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
the	NULL
scapegoat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
sometimes	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
two	NULL
fathers	NULL
to	NULL
contend	NULL
against	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
brother	NULL
John	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
third	NULL
and	NULL
fourth	NULL
also	NULL
might	NULL
almost	NULL
be	NULL
added	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
sisters	NULL
Eliza	NULL
and	NULL
Maria	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
bondage	NULL
very	NULL
acutely	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
constitutionally	NULL
timid	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
strong	NULL
hand	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
knitted	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
closest	NULL
outward	NULL
harmony	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
brother	NULL
and	NULL
sisters	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boys	NULL
were	NULL
of	NULL
use	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
father	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
respect	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
mean	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
played	NULL
them	NULL
off	NULL
against	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
kept	NULL
them	NULL
but	NULL
poorly	NULL
supplied	NULL
with	NULL
pocket	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
Theobald	NULL
would	NULL
urge	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
claims	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
elder	NULL
brother	NULL
were	NULL
naturally	NULL
paramount	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
insisted	NULL
to	NULL
John	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
numerous	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
affirm	NULL
solemnly	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
expenses	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
heavy	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
death	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
to	NULL
divide	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
whether	NULL
they	NULL
compared	NULL
notes	NULL
or	NULL
no	NULL
,	NULL
provided	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
presence	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
complain	NULL
even	NULL
behind	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
knew	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
intimately	NULL
as	NULL
anyone	NULL
was	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
at	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
very	NULL
rarely	NULL
mentioned	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
name	NULL
even	NULL
while	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
was	NULL
alive	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
once	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
hearing	NULL
afterwards	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
school	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
actively	NULL
disliked	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
brother	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
dull	NULL
and	NULL
deficient	NULL
in	NULL
animal	NULL
spirits	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
popular	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
frocks	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
settled	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
seemly	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
well-known	NULL
publisher	NULL
of	NULL
religious	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
devote	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
sons	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
;	NULL
this	NULL
might	NULL
tend	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
firm	NULL
;	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
had	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
interest	NULL
with	NULL
bishops	NULL
and	NULL
Church	NULL
dignitaries	NULL
and	NULL
might	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
preferment	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
offered	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
influence	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
's	NULL
future	NULL
destiny	NULL
was	NULL
kept	NULL
well	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
earliest	NULL
childhood	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
treated	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
virtually	NULL
settled	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
acquiescence	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
show	NULL
of	NULL
freedom	NULL
was	NULL
allowed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL

and	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
too	NULL
equitable	NULL
to	NULL
grudge	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
whatever	NULL
benefit	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
derive	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
horror	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
exclaim	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
driving	NULL
any	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
profession	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
.	NULL

Far	NULL
be	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
pressure	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
son	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
as	NULL
regards	NULL
any	NULL
profession	NULL
and	NULL
much	NULL
less	NULL
when	NULL
so	NULL
sacred	NULL
a	NULL
calling	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
ministry	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
talk	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
when	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
visitors	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
so	NULL
wisely	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
listening	NULL
guests	NULL
considered	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
paragon	NULL
of	NULL
right-mindedness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
emphasis	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
rosy	NULL
gills	NULL
and	NULL
bald	NULL
head	NULL
looked	NULL
so	NULL
benevolent	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
difficult	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
carried	NULL
away	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
discourse	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
heads	NULL
of	NULL
families	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
gave	NULL
their	NULL
sons	NULL
absolute	NULL
liberty	NULL
of	NULL
choice	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
professions	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
afterwards	NULL
considerable	NULL
cause	NULL
to	NULL
regret	NULL
having	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
visitors	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
Theobald	NULL
look	NULL
shy	NULL
and	NULL
wholly	NULL
unmoved	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
exhibition	NULL
of	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
consideration	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
wishes	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
remark	NULL
to	NULL
themselves	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
seemed	NULL
hardly	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
equal	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
set	NULL
him	NULL
down	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
unenthusiastic	NULL
youth	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
more	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
sensible	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
advantages	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
righteousness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
transaction	NULL
more	NULL
firmly	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
ill	NULL
at	NULL
ease	NULL
kept	NULL
him	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
profound	NULL
and	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
without	NULL
break	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
fully	NULL
alive	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
understanding	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
feared	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
scowl	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
opposition	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
violent	NULL
threats	NULL

or	NULL
coarse	NULL
sneers	NULL

would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
taken	NULL
_	NULL
au	NULL
serieux	NULL
_	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
stronger	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rightly	NULL
or	NULL
wrongly	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
credit	NULL
for	NULL
being	NULL
quite	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
his	NULL
threats	NULL
into	NULL
execution	NULL
.	NULL

Opposition	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
got	NULL
him	NULL
anything	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
indeed	NULL
had	NULL
yielding	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
unless	NULL
he	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
want	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
wanted	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
entertained	NULL
thoughts	NULL
of	NULL
resistance	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
none	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
to	NULL
oppose	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
completely	NULL
lost	NULL
for	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
exercise	NULL
that	NULL
hardly	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
wish	NULL
remain	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
left	NULL
save	NULL
dull	NULL
acquiescence	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
ass	NULL
crouched	NULL
between	NULL
two	NULL
burdens	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
ill-defined	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
ideals	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
his	NULL
actuals	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
occasionally	NULL
dream	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
soldier	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
sailor	NULL
far	NULL
away	NULL
in	NULL
foreign	NULL
lands	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
farmer	NULL
's	NULL
boy	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
wolds	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
enough	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
any	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
turning	NULL
his	NULL
dreams	NULL
into	NULL
realities	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
drifted	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
stream	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
slow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
afraid	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
muddy	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
Catechism	NULL
has	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
unhappy	NULL
relations	NULL
which	NULL
commonly	NULL
even	NULL
now	NULL
exist	NULL
between	NULL
parents	NULL
and	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
written	NULL
too	NULL
exclusively	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
parental	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
person	NULL
who	NULL
composed	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
children	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
clearly	NULL
not	NULL
young	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
should	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
liked	NULL
children	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
"	NULL
my	NULL
good	NULL
child	NULL
"	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
rightly	NULL
,	NULL
are	NULL
once	NULL
put	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
mouth	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
catechist	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
carry	NULL
a	NULL
harsh	NULL
sound	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
general	NULL
impression	NULL
it	NULL
leaves	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
wickedness	NULL
at	NULL
birth	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
very	NULL
imperfectly	NULL
wiped	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
baptism	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
mere	NULL
fact	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
young	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
has	NULL
something	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
savours	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
distinctly	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
sin	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
edition	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
is	NULL
ever	NULL
required	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
introduce	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
words	NULL
insisting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
duty	NULL
of	NULL
seeking	NULL
all	NULL
reasonable	NULL
pleasure	NULL
and	NULL
avoiding	NULL
all	NULL
pain	NULL
that	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
honourably	NULL
avoided	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
children	NULL
taught	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
they	NULL
like	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
,	NULL
merely	NULL
because	NULL
certain	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
say	NULL
they	NULL
like	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
foolish	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
they	NULL
believe	NULL
this	NULL
or	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
understand	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
urged	NULL
that	NULL
these	NULL
additions	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
Catechism	NULL
too	NULL
long	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
curtail	NULL
the	NULL
remarks	NULL
upon	NULL
our	NULL
duty	NULL
towards	NULL
our	NULL
neighbour	NULL
and	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
sacraments	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
paragraph	NULL
beginning	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
desire	NULL
my	NULL
Lord	NULL
God	NULL
our	NULL
Heavenly	NULL
Father	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
perhaps	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
Theobald	NULL

and	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
recasting	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Catechism	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
VIII	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
had	NULL
set	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
's	NULL
becoming	NULL
a	NULL
fellow	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
college	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
would	NULL
provide	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
ensure	NULL
his	NULL
getting	NULL
a	NULL
living	NULL
if	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
ecclesiastical	NULL
friends	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
just	NULL
well	NULL
enough	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
to	NULL
render	NULL
this	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sent	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
smaller	NULL
colleges	NULL
at	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
private	NULL
tutors	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
system	NULL
of	NULL
examination	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
adopted	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
before	NULL
Theobald	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
degree	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
improved	NULL
his	NULL
chances	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fellowship	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
whatever	NULL
ability	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
was	NULL
classical	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
mathematical	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
system	NULL
gave	NULL
more	NULL
encouragement	NULL
to	NULL
classical	NULL
studies	NULL
than	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
given	NULL
hitherto	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
independence	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
worked	NULL
hard	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
the	NULL
notion	NULL
of	NULL
becoming	NULL
a	NULL
fellow	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
therefore	NULL
applied	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
degree	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
getting	NULL
a	NULL
fellowship	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
probability	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
senior	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
pleased	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
present	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
works	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
standard	NULL
writer	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
select	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
chose	NULL
the	NULL
works	NULL
of	NULL
Bacon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Bacon	NULL
accordingly	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
appearance	NULL
in	NULL
ten	NULL
nicely	NULL
bound	NULL
volumes	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
little	NULL
inspection	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
showed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
copy	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
hand	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
his	NULL
degree	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
was	NULL
ordination	NULL
--	NULL
about	NULL
which	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
little	NULL
hitherto	NULL
beyond	NULL
acquiescing	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
some	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
actually	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
asserting	NULL
itself	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
months	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
rather	NULL
frightened	NULL
him	NULL
inasmuch	NULL
as	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
way	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
once	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
near	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
ordination	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
distant	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
made	NULL
some	NULL
feeble	NULL
efforts	NULL
to	NULL
escape	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
perceived	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
correspondence	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
Ernest	NULL
found	NULL
among	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
papers	NULL
written	NULL
on	NULL
gilt-edged	NULL
paper	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
faded	NULL
ink	NULL
and	NULL
tied	NULL
neatly	NULL
round	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
tape	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
note	NULL
or	NULL
comment	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
altered	NULL
nothing	NULL

The	NULL
letters	NULL
are	NULL

I	NULL

not	NULL

as	NULL
the	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
sure	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
running	NULL
counter	NULL
to	NULL
your	NULL

if	NULL
I	NULL

sometimes	NULL

I	NULL

is	NULL

Is	NULL
it	NULL
moral	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
brought	NULL
such	NULL
things	NULL
upon	NULL
himself	NULL
?	NULL

Someone	NULL
should	NULL
do	NULL
for	NULL
morals	NULL
what	NULL
that	NULL
old	NULL
Pecksniff	NULL
Bacon	NULL
has	NULL
obtained	NULL
the	NULL
credit	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
done	NULL
for	NULL

.	NULL

But	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Allaby	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Allaby	NULL
talked	NULL
about	NULL
having	NULL
married	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
daughters	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
easiest	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
talked	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
other	NULL
mothers	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
of	NULL
hearts	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
her	NULL
doing	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

First	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
connection	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
practise	NULL
certain	NULL
manoeuvres	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
rehearsed	NULL
in	NULL
imagination	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
apply	NULL
in	NULL
practice	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
weeks	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
_	NULL
wurra	NULL
wurra	NULL
_	NULL
of	NULL
hopes	NULL
and	NULL
fears	NULL
and	NULL
little	NULL
stratagems	NULL
which	NULL
as	NULL
often	NULL
as	NULL
not	NULL
proved	NULL
injudicious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
somehow	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
bound	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
arrow	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
daughter	NULL
's	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
all	NULL
a	NULL
fluke	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
little	NULL
or	NULL
no	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
repeating	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
indeed	NULL
repeated	NULL
it	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
might	NULL
perhaps	NULL
with	NULL
good	NULL
luck	NULL
repeat	NULL
it	NULL
yet	NULL
once	NULL
again	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
five	NULL
times	NULL
over	NULL
!	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
awful	NULL
:	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
rather	NULL
have	NULL
three	NULL
confinements	NULL
than	NULL
go	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
wear	NULL
and	NULL
tear	NULL
of	NULL
marrying	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
daughter	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
poor	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Allaby	NULL
never	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
without	NULL
an	NULL
eye	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
future	NULL
son-in-law	NULL
.	NULL

Papas	NULL
and	NULL
mammas	NULL
sometimes	NULL
ask	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
whether	NULL
their	NULL
intentions	NULL
are	NULL
honourable	NULL
towards	NULL
their	NULL
daughters	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
might	NULL
occasionally	NULL
ask	NULL
papas	NULL
and	NULL
mammas	NULL
whether	NULL
their	NULL
intentions	NULL
are	NULL
honourable	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
accept	NULL
invitations	NULL
to	NULL
houses	NULL
where	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
still	NULL
unmarried	NULL
daughters	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
afford	NULL
a	NULL
curate	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Mr	NULL
Allaby	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
were	NULL
discussing	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
next	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
some	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
help	NULL
me	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
Sunday	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
guinea	NULL
a	NULL
Sunday	NULL
will	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
can	NULL
chop	NULL
and	NULL
change	NULL
till	NULL
we	NULL
get	NULL
someone	NULL
who	NULL
suits	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

So	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
settled	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Allaby	NULL
's	NULL
health	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
strong	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
help	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
performance	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
Sunday	NULL
duty	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Allaby	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
friend	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Cowey	NULL
,	NULL
wife	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
celebrated	NULL
Professor	NULL
Cowey	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
truly	NULL
spiritually	NULL
minded	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
trifle	NULL
portly	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
incipient	NULL
beard	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
extensive	NULL
connection	NULL
among	NULL
undergraduates	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
especially	NULL
among	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
part	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
evangelical	NULL
movement	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
height	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
evening	NULL
parties	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
prayer	NULL
was	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
entertainment	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
spiritually	NULL
minded	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
enthusiastic	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Allaby	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
exclaim	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
thorough	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
fund	NULL
of	NULL
strong	NULL
masculine	NULL
good	NULL
sense	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
too	NULL
had	NULL
daughters	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Allaby	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
less	NULL
fortunate	NULL
than	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Allaby	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
age	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
desolate	NULL
indeed	NULL
if	NULL
her	NULL
Professor	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
spared	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Cowey	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
run	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
bachelor	NULL
clergy	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
University	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
person	NULL
to	NULL
assist	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Allaby	NULL
in	NULL
finding	NULL
an	NULL
eligible	NULL
assistant	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
this	NULL
last	NULL
named	NULL
lady	NULL
drove	NULL
over	NULL
one	NULL
morning	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
November	NULL
of	NULL
1825	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
arrangement	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
an	NULL
early	NULL
dinner	NULL
with	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Cowey	NULL
and	NULL
spend	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
dinner	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
ladies	NULL
retired	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
business	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
began	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
they	NULL
fenced	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
they	NULL
saw	NULL
through	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
what	NULL
loyalty	NULL
they	NULL
pretended	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
through	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
what	NULL
gentle	NULL
dalliance	NULL
they	NULL
prolonged	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
discussing	NULL
the	NULL
spiritual	NULL
fitness	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
or	NULL
that	NULL
deacon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
pros	NULL

cons	NULL
connected	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
spiritual	NULL
fitness	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
disposed	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
imagination	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
reader	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Cowey	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
scheming	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
account	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
scheme	NULL
for	NULL
anyone	NULL
rather	NULL

not	NULL
scheme	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL

Many	NULL

her	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
hour	NULL
of	NULL
need	NULL

,	NULL
provided	NULL

Mrs	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
X	NULL
The	NULL
interview	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
all	NULL
other	NULL
good	NULL
things	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
were	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Allaby	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
six	NULL
miles	NULL
'	NULL
drive	NULL
to	NULL
Crampsford	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
muffled	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
her	NULL
seat	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Allaby	NULL
's	NULL

factotum	NULL

,	NULL
James	NULL

could	NULL
perceive	NULL
no	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
appearance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
little	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
series	NULL
of	NULL
delightful	NULL
visions	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
driving	NULL
home	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
mistress	NULL
.	NULL

Professor	NULL
Cowey	NULL
had	NULL
published	NULL
works	NULL
through	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
account	NULL
been	NULL
taken	NULL
in	NULL
tow	NULL
by	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Cowey	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
University	NULL
career	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
eye	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
past	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
him	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
list	NULL
of	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
for	NULL
whom	NULL
wives	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
provided	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
poor	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Allaby	NULL
did	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
husband	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
daughters	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
now	NULL
wrote	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
terms	NULL
that	NULL
awakened	NULL
his	NULL
curiosity	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
she	NULL
broached	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Allaby	NULL
's	NULL
failing	NULL
health	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
smoothing	NULL
away	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
difficulties	NULL
as	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Cowey	NULL
's	NULL
due	NULL

it	NULL

pass	NULL
that	NULL
Theobald	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Crampsford	NULL
for	NULL
six	NULL
successive	NULL
Sundays	NULL
and	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Allaby	NULL
's	NULL
duty	NULL
at	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
guinea	NULL
a	NULL
Sunday	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Cowey	NULL
cut	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
stipend	NULL
mercilessly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
strong	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
resist	NULL
.	NULL

Ignorant	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
plots	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
being	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
peace	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL
beyond	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
earning	NULL
his	NULL
three	NULL
guineas	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
of	NULL
astonishing	NULL
the	NULL
inhabitants	NULL
of	NULL
Crampsford	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
academic	NULL
learning	NULL
,	NULL
Theobald	NULL
walked	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Rectory	NULL
one	NULL
Sunday	NULL
morning	NULL
early	NULL
in	NULL
December	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
only	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
ordained	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
pains	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
sermon	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
of	NULL
geology	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fore	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
theological	NULL
bugbear	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
showed	NULL
that	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
geology	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
anything	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
liberal	NULL
entirely	NULL
to	NULL
pooh-pooh	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
confirmed	NULL
the	NULL
absolutely	NULL
historical	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Mosaic	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Creation	NULL
as	NULL
given	NULL
in	NULL
Genesis	NULL
.	NULL

Any	NULL
phenomena	NULL
which	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
sight	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
against	NULL
this	NULL
view	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
partial	NULL
phenomena	NULL
and	NULL
broke	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
investigation	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
more	NULL
excellent	NULL
taste	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Theobald	NULL
adjourned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rectory	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
dine	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
services	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Allaby	NULL
complimented	NULL
him	NULL
warmly	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
debut	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
ladies	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
find	NULL
words	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
express	NULL
their	NULL
admiration	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
women	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
women	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
thrown	NULL
in	NULL
contact	NULL
with	NULL
were	NULL
his	NULL
sisters	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
were	NULL
always	NULL
correcting	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
school	NULL
friends	NULL
whom	NULL
these	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
their	NULL
father	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
to	NULL
Elmhurst	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
had	NULL
either	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
shy	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
and	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
amalgamated	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
clever	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
smart	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
smart	NULL
things	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
talked	NULL
about	NULL
music	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
music	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
pictures	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
pictures	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
books	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
classics	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
books	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
dance	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
dance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Cowey	NULL
's	NULL
parties	NULL
again	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
some	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
introduced	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
himself	NULL
agreeable	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
left	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
successful	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Cowey	NULL
's	NULL
set	NULL
were	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL
means	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
attractive	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
found	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
University	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Theobald	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
excused	NULL
for	NULL
not	NULL
losing	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
if	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thrown	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
prettier	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
agreeable	NULL
girls	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
immediately	NULL
cut	NULL
out	NULL
by	NULL
someone	NULL
less	NULL
bashful	NULL
than	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sneaked	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
fair	NULL
sex	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
impotent	NULL
man	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
pool	NULL
of	NULL
Bethesda	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
a	NULL
really	NULL
nice	NULL
girl	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
fate	NULL
had	NULL
thrown	NULL
none	NULL
such	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
except	NULL
his	NULL
youngest	NULL
sister	NULL
Alethea	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
perhaps	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
experience	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
women	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
done	NULL
him	NULL
any	NULL
good	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
associate	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
any	NULL
pleasure	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
Hamlet	NULL
in	NULL
connection	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
completely	NULL
cut	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
edition	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
required	NULL
to	NULL
act	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
disbelieve	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
existence	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
kissing	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
kissed	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
except	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
sisters	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
small	NULL
children	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

Over	NULL
and	NULL
above	NULL
these	NULL
kisses	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
until	NULL
quite	NULL
lately	NULL
been	NULL
required	NULL
to	NULL
imprint	NULL
a	NULL
solemn	NULL
flabby	NULL
kiss	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
morning	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
cheek	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
belief	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
extent	NULL
of	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
knowledge	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
kissing	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
now	NULL
writing	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
foregoing	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
dislike	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
mysterious	NULL
beings	NULL
whose	NULL
ways	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
ways	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
their	NULL
thoughts	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
these	NULL
antecedents	NULL
Theobald	NULL
naturally	NULL
felt	NULL
rather	NULL
bashful	NULL
on	NULL
finding	NULL
himself	NULL
the	NULL
admired	NULL
of	NULL
five	NULL
strange	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
myself	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
once	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
tea	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
girls	NULL
'	NULL
school	NULL
where	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
sisters	NULL
was	NULL
boarding	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
about	NULL
twelve	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
.	NULL

Everything	NULL
went	NULL
off	NULL
well	NULL
during	NULL
tea-time	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Lady	NULL
Principal	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
establishment	NULL
was	NULL
present	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
alone	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
mistress	NULL
's	NULL
back	NULL
was	NULL
turned	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
pointed	NULL
her	NULL
finger	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
solemnly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
A	NULL
na-a-sty	NULL
bo-o-y	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
followed	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
rotation	NULL
making	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
gesture	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
reproach	NULL
upon	NULL
my	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
gave	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
scare	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
I	NULL
cried	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
before	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
again	NULL
face	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
felt	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
myself	NULL
done	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
'	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
Miss	NULL
Allabys	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
nasty	NULL
bo-o-oy	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
papa	NULL
and	NULL
mamma	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
cordial	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
themselves	NULL
lifted	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
deftly	NULL
over	NULL
conversational	NULL
stiles	NULL
that	NULL
before	NULL
dinner	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
Theobald	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
really	NULL
very	NULL
charming	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
being	NULL
appreciated	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
hitherto	NULL
been	NULL
accustomed	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
dinner	NULL
his	NULL
shyness	NULL
wore	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL
means	NULL
plain	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
academic	NULL
prestige	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
fair	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
lay	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
as	NULL
unconventional	NULL
or	NULL
ridiculous	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
he	NULL
created	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
as	NULL
favourable	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
created	NULL
upon	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
about	NULL
men	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
about	NULL
women	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
harmony	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
establishment	NULL
was	NULL
broken	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
storm	NULL
which	NULL
arose	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
who	NULL
should	NULL
become	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
dears	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
their	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
settle	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
among	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Wait	NULL
till	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
play	NULL
at	NULL
cards	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Having	NULL
said	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
retired	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
study	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
nightly	NULL
glass	NULL
of	NULL
whisky	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
pipe	NULL
of	NULL
tobacco	NULL
.	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XI	NULL
The	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
saw	NULL
Theobald	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
rooms	NULL
coaching	NULL
a	NULL
pupil	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Miss	NULL
Allabys	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
eldest	NULL
Miss	NULL
Allaby	NULL
's	NULL
bedroom	NULL
playing	NULL
at	NULL
cards	NULL
with	NULL
Theobald	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
stakes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
winner	NULL
was	NULL
Christina	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
unmarried	NULL
daughter	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
just	NULL
twenty	NULL
-	NULL
seven	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
and	NULL
therefore	NULL
four	NULL
years	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
Theobald	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
younger	NULL
sisters	NULL
complained	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
throwing	NULL
a	NULL
husband	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
Christina	NULL
try	NULL
and	NULL
catch	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
older	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
chance	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Christina	NULL
showed	NULL
fight	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
not	NULL
usual	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
by	NULL
nature	NULL
yielding	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
tempered	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
mother	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
back	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
dangerous	NULL
ones	NULL
were	NULL
packed	NULL
off	NULL
then	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
on	NULL
visits	NULL
to	NULL
friends	NULL
some	NULL
way	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
those	NULL
alone	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
remain	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
whose	NULL
loyalty	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
depended	NULL
upon	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
brothers	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
suspect	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL
believed	NULL
their	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
getting	NULL
assistance	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
really	NULL
wanted	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sisters	NULL
who	NULL
remained	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
kept	NULL
their	NULL
words	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
Christina	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
help	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
above	NULL
their	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
fair	NULL
play	NULL
they	NULL
reflected	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
sooner	NULL
Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
landed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sooner	NULL
another	NULL
deacon	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL
who	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
won	NULL
by	NULL
themselves	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
quickly	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
managed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
unreliable	NULL
sisters	NULL
were	NULL
actually	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
before	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
next	NULL
visit	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Sunday	NULL
following	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
time	NULL
Theobald	NULL
felt	NULL
quite	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
new	NULL
friends	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Allaby	NULL
insisted	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
call	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
motherly	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
in	NULL
clergymen	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
believed	NULL
every	NULL
word	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
believed	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
elders	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
youth	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

Christina	NULL
sat	NULL
next	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
dinner	NULL
and	NULL
played	NULL
her	NULL
cards	NULL
no	NULL
less	NULL
judiciously	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
played	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
bedroom	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
smiled	NULL
(	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
smile	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
strong	NULL
points	NULL
)	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
through	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
artlessnesses	NULL
and	NULL
set	NULL
forth	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
wares	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
believed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
their	NULL
most	NULL
taking	NULL
aspect	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
can	NULL
blame	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL

Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
ideal	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
dreamed	NULL
of	NULL
when	NULL
reading	NULL
Byron	NULL
upstairs	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
sisters	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
actual	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
bounds	NULL
of	NULL
possibility	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
actual	NULL
as	NULL
actuals	NULL
went	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
else	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL

Run	NULL
away	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

Marry	NULL
beneath	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
considered	NULL
a	NULL
disgrace	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
family	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

Remain	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
become	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
maid	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
?	NULL

Not	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
reasonably	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
drowning	NULL
;	NULL
Theobald	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
straw	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
catch	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
catch	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
she	NULL
accordingly	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
true	NULL
love	NULL
never	NULL
runs	NULL
smooth	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
true	NULL
match	NULL
-	NULL
making	NULL
sometimes	NULL
does	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
ground	NULL
for	NULL
complaint	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
case	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
slow	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
assigned	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
easily	NULL
than	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Cowey	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Allaby	NULL
had	NULL
dared	NULL
to	NULL
hope	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
softened	NULL
by	NULL
Christina	NULL
's	NULL
winning	NULL
manners	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
admired	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
moral	NULL
tone	NULL
of	NULL
everything	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
sweetness	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
sisters	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
readiness	NULL
to	NULL
undertake	NULL
any	NULL
small	NULL
burden	NULL
which	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
seemed	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
undertake	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
sprightly	NULL
manners	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
were	NULL
fascinating	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
unused	NULL
to	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
a	NULL
human	NULL
being	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
flattered	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
unobtrusive	NULL
but	NULL
obviously	NULL
sincere	NULL
admiration	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
favourable	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
him	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
anyone	NULL
outside	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
charming	NULL
family	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

Instead	NULL
of	NULL
snubbing	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
brother	NULL
and	NULL
sisters	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
drew	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
listened	NULL
attentively	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
evidently	NULL
wanted	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
a	NULL
college	NULL
friend	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
now	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
really	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
Miss	NULL
Allaby	NULL
's	NULL
society	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL

supposed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL

very	NULL
beautiful	NULL

Her	NULL

certainly	NULL
contralto	NULL

for	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
reach	NULL
higher	NULL
than	NULL
D	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

its	NULL
only	NULL
defect	NULL

the	NULL
soprano	NULL
could	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL

necessary	NULL

it	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
quality	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
now	NULL
assign	NULL
to	NULL
contralto	NULL

What	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
wanted	NULL
in	NULL
range	NULL
and	NULL
power	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL

She	NULL

thus	NULL
proving	NULL

as	NULL
her	NULL
mamma	NULL

thorough	NULL
knowledge	NULL

not	NULL
only	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL

at	NULL
every	NULL

added	NULL

on	NULL
a	NULL
principle	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL

taught	NULL
her	NULL

thus	NULL
added	NULL
life	NULL

an	NULL

which	NULL
everyone	NULL

so	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL

be	NULL
rather	NULL
heavy	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

which	NULL

left	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
governess	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
indeed	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
rarely	NULL
accomplished	NULL
musician	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pupil	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL

Theobald	NULL

his	NULL
courage	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
quite	NULL
clear	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
much	NULL
smitten	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
month	NULL
after	NULL
month	NULL
went	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
hope	NULL
in	NULL
Theobald	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Allaby	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
discover	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
impatient	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
number	NULL

half-guineas	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
disbursing	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
proposal	NULL
.	NULL

Christina	NULL
's	NULL
mother	NULL
assured	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
daughter	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
priceless	NULL
treasure	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
married	NULL
her	NULL

Theobald	NULL
echoed	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Allaby	NULL
's	NULL
sentiments	NULL
with	NULL
warmth	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
visited	NULL
the	NULL
Rectory	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
besides	NULL
coming	NULL
over	NULL
on	NULL

he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL

Mr	NULL

said	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Allaby	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
she	NULL

It	NULL

--	NULL
oh	NULL

she	NULL

she	NULL
is	NULL
too	NULL

too	NULL
difficult	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL

however	NULL

she	NULL
would	NULL
fall	NULL
before	NULL
a	NULL
_	NULL
great	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
hard	NULL
at	NULL
Theobald	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
blushed	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
went	NULL
by	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
propose	NULL

Another	NULL
time	NULL
Theobald	NULL
actually	NULL
took	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Cowey	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
confidence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
reader	NULL
may	NULL
guess	NULL
what	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
Christina	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Cowey	NULL
tried	NULL
the	NULL
jealousy	NULL
manoeuvre	NULL
and	NULL
hinted	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
possible	NULL
rival	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
pretended	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
alarmed	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
rudimentary	NULL
pang	NULL
of	NULL
jealousy	NULL
shot	NULL
across	NULL
his	NULL
bosom	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
with	NULL
pride	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
desperately	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
or	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
feel	NULL
so	NULL
jealous	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
day	NULL
still	NULL
went	NULL
by	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
propose	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Allabys	NULL
behaved	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
judgement	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
humoured	NULL
him	NULL
till	NULL
his	NULL
retreat	NULL
was	NULL
practically	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
still	NULL
flattered	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL

was	NULL
open	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
about	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
after	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
an	NULL
almost	NULL
daily	NULL

Theobald	NULL
a	NULL

in	NULL

Dull	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
despair	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL

of	NULL

it	NULL

within	NULL

possibility	NULL

he	NULL
might	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
Bishop	NULL

and	NULL
Christina	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
would	NULL
ultimately	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
daughter	NULL
and	NULL
intended	NULL
wife	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
,	NULL
Christina	NULL
's	NULL
thoughts	NULL
ran	NULL
much	NULL
upon	NULL
religion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
resolved	NULL
that	NULL
even	NULL
though	NULL
an	NULL
exalted	NULL
position	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
were	NULL
denied	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

Theobald	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
virtues	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
fully	NULL
appreciated	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL

Her	NULL
religious	NULL
opinions	NULL
coincided	NULL
absolutely	NULL
with	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
many	NULL
a	NULL
conversation	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
have	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
glory	NULL

God	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
completeness	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
devote	NULL
themselves	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL

as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
his	NULL
living	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
married	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
certain	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
results	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
then	NULL
ensue	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
wondered	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
blindness	NULL
shown	NULL
by	NULL
Providence	NULL
towards	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
truest	NULL
interests	NULL
in	NULL
not	NULL
killing	NULL
off	NULL

rectors	NULL
who	NULL
stood	NULL
between	NULL
Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
living	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
faster	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
those	NULL
days	NULL
people	NULL
believed	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
simple	NULL
downrightness	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
observe	NULL
among	NULL
educated	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
women	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
crossed	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
doubt	NULL
the	NULL
literal	NULL
accuracy	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
syllable	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Bible	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
any	NULL
book	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
disputed	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
anyone	NULL
who	NULL
doubted	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

True	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
scare	NULL
about	NULL
geology	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
God	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
in	NULL
six	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
He	NULL
did	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
six	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
neither	NULL
in	NULL
more	NULL
nor	NULL
less	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
He	NULL
put	NULL
Adam	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
out	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
ribs	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
,	NULL
Adam	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
Theobald	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
at	NULL
Crampsford	NULL
Rectory	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
months	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
pretty	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
larger	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
tame	NULL
wild	NULL
animals	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
God	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
Mr	NULL
Allaby	NULL
or	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
dexterously	NULL
took	NULL
out	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
ribs	NULL
without	NULL
waking	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
miraculously	NULL
healed	NULL
the	NULL
wound	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
trace	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
operation	NULL
remained	NULL
.	NULL

Finally	NULL
,	NULL
God	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
rib	NULL
perhaps	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
greenhouse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
just	NULL
such	NULL
another	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
as	NULL
Christina	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
neither	NULL
difficulty	NULL
nor	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
difficulty	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

Could	NULL
not	NULL
God	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
He	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
He	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
His	NULL
own	NULL
inspired	NULL
Book	NULL
told	NULL
us	NULL
that	NULL
He	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
this	NULL
?	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
average	NULL
attitude	NULL
of	NULL
fairly	NULL
educated	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
women	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
Mosaic	NULL
cosmogony	NULL
fifty	NULL
,	NULL
forty	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL

offered	NULL
little	NULL
scope	NULL

The	NULL
moon	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
arbour	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
damp	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
they	NULL
adjourned	NULL
further	NULL
aspirations	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
convenient	NULL
season	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
other	NULL
times	NULL
Christina	NULL
pictured	NULL
herself	NULL
and	NULL
Theobald	NULL
as	NULL
braving	NULL
the	NULL
scorn	NULL
of	NULL
almost	NULL
every	NULL
human	NULL
being	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
achievement	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
mighty	NULL
task	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
redound	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
honour	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
Redeemer	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
face	NULL
anything	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
always	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
vision	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
coronation	NULL
scene	NULL
high	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
golden	NULL
regions	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Heavens	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
diadem	NULL
was	NULL
set	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Son	NULL
of	NULL
Man	NULL
Himself	NULL
,	NULL
amid	NULL
a	NULL
host	NULL
of	NULL
angels	NULL

archangels	NULL
who	NULL
looked	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
envy	NULL

admiration	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
even	NULL
Theobald	NULL
himself	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL

If	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
Mammon	NULL
of	NULL
Righteousness	NULL
Christina	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
assuredly	NULL
made	NULL
friends	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
papa	NULL

mamma	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
estimable	NULL
people	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
receive	NULL
Heavenly	NULL
Mansions	NULL

they	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
comfortable	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
doubtless	NULL
would	NULL
her	NULL
sisters	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
might	NULL
her	NULL
brothers	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
higher	NULL
destiny	NULL
was	NULL
preparing	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
lose	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
step	NULL
towards	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
with	NULL
Theobald	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
spite	NULL

of	NULL
these	NULL
flights	NULL

religious	NULL

Christina	NULL

enough	NULL

who	NULL

married	NULL
a	NULL

neither	NULL

Mrs	NULL

Theobald	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
only	NULL
two	NULL
out	NULL

remained	NULL
single	NULL

After	NULL
three	NULL

four	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
old	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
became	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL

looked	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL

among	NULL

had	NULL
now	NULL
a	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
of	NULL
1831	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
after	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL

Theobald	NULL

who	NULL
might	NULL

The	NULL

was	NULL
then	NULL

500	NULL

a	NULL

house	NULL

Old	NULL
Mr	NULL

then	NULL
came	NULL
down	NULL
more	NULL
handsomely	NULL

was	NULL
expected	NULL

settled	NULL
10,000	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XIII	NULL
A	NULL
due	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL

been	NULL
thrown	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

it	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
could	NULL
then	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
creeping	NULL
past	NULL
a	NULL
fir	NULL
coppice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
lost	NULL
to	NULL
view	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
John	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Mr	NULL
Allaby	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
man-servant	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
shut	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
indoors	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
of	NULL
relief	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
alive	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
reaction	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
burst	NULL
of	NULL
enthusiastic	NULL
merriment	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
had	NULL
run	NULL
twenty	NULL
yards	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
to	NULL
fling	NULL
a	NULL
slipper	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
duly	NULL
flung	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
what	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
feelings	NULL
of	NULL
Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
was	NULL
passed	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
rolling	NULL
quietly	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fir	NULL
plantation	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
point	NULL
that	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
stoutest	NULL
heart	NULL
must	NULL
fail	NULL

unless	NULL
it	NULL
beat	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
breast	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
over	NULL
head	NULL

in	NULL
love	NULL

looked	NULL
more	NULL
serious	NULL
still	NULL

when	NULL
Christina	NULL
actually	NULL
named	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL

then	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
fainted	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
engagement	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
on	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
groove	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
change	NULL
was	NULL
disconcerting	NULL
.	NULL

Christina	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
nicely	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
years	NULL
;	NULL
why	NULL
--	NULL
why	NULL
--	NULL
why	NULL
should	NULL
they	NULL
not	NULL
continue	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
doing	NULL
now	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
lives	NULL
?	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
escape	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
than	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sheep	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
being	NULL
driven	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
butcher	NULL
's	NULL
back	NULL
premises	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
sheep	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
gained	NULL
by	NULL
resistance	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
none	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
behaved	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
decency	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
declared	NULL
on	NULL
all	NULL
hands	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
happiest	NULL
men	NULL
imaginable	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
the	NULL
metaphor	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
drop	NULL
had	NULL
actually	NULL
fallen	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
wretch	NULL
was	NULL
hanging	NULL
in	NULL
mid	NULL
air	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
creature	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
affections	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
creature	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
thirty-three	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
it	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
weeping	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
nose	NULL
were	NULL
reddish	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL

done	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL
was	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
Theobald	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
driven	NULL
along	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fir	NULL
Plantation	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
apparent	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Rectory	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
bobbing	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
postilion	NULL
's	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
just	NULL
over-topped	NULL
the	NULL
hedge	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
roadside	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
rose	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
stirrups	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
and	NULL
yellow	NULL
body	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
:	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
during	NULL
their	NULL
first	NULL
half	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
reader	NULL
must	NULL
guess	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
beyond	NULL
my	NULL
power	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
rummaged	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
conclusion	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
odd	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
that	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL
were	NULL
married	NULL
the	NULL
sooner	NULL
they	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
their	NULL
future	NULL
mutual	NULL
relations	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
are	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
difficulty	NULL
will	NULL
only	NULL
do	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
little	NULL
reasonable	NULL
thing	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
can	NULL
clearly	NULL
recognise	NULL
as	NULL
reasonable	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
will	NULL
always	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
step	NULL
more	NULL
easy	NULL
both	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
and	NULL
take	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
thought	NULL
Theobald	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
here	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
obvious	NULL
matter	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
considered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
an	NULL
equitable	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL
's	NULL
relative	NULL
positions	NULL
in	NULL
respect	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

Clearly	NULL
their	NULL
first	NULL
dinner	NULL
was	NULL
their	NULL
first	NULL
joint	NULL
entry	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
duties	NULL
and	NULL
pleasures	NULL
of	NULL
married	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
less	NULL
clearly	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Christina	NULL
's	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
order	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
pay	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
arguments	NULL
leading	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
conclusion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
flashed	NULL
upon	NULL
Theobald	NULL
about	NULL
three	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
miles	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
Crampsford	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
to	NULL
Newmarket	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
breakfasted	NULL
early	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
appetite	NULL
had	NULL
failed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
at	NULL
noon	NULL
without	NULL
staying	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
wedding	NULL
breakfast	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
liked	NULL
an	NULL
early	NULL
dinner	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
dawned	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
hungry	NULL
;	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
stated	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
preceding	NULL
paragraph	NULL
the	NULL
steps	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
easy	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
'	NULL
further	NULL
reflection	NULL
he	NULL
broached	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
bride	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
the	NULL
ice	NULL
was	NULL
broken	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
sudden	NULL
an	NULL
assumption	NULL
of	NULL
importance	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
nerves	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
strongest	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
strung	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
highest	NULL
tension	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
event	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
escape	NULL
observation	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
looking	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
quite	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
bride	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
married	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
feared	NULL
the	NULL
landlady	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
chamber-maid	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
waiter	NULL
--	NULL
everybody	NULL
and	NULL
everything	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
so	NULL
fast	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
speak	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
less	NULL
go	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
ordeal	NULL
of	NULL
ordering	NULL
dinner	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
hotel	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
landlady	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
begged	NULL
and	NULL
prayed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
let	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Theobald	NULL
would	NULL
only	NULL
order	NULL
dinner	NULL
this	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
order	NULL
it	NULL
any	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
future	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
inexorable	NULL
Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
put	NULL
off	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
absurd	NULL
excuses	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
master	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
not	NULL
Christina	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
two	NULL
hours	NULL
ago	NULL
promised	NULL
solemnly	NULL
to	NULL
honour	NULL
and	NULL
obey	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
turning	NULL
restive	NULL
over	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
trifle	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
loving	NULL
smile	NULL
departed	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
succeeded	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
scowl	NULL
which	NULL
that	NULL
old	NULL
Turk	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
envied	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Stuff	NULL
and	NULL
nonsense	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dearest	NULL
Christina	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
mildly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stamped	NULL
his	NULL
foot	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL

you	NULL

my	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
expect	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL

"	NULL

For	NULL
Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
logical	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bride	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
unkind	NULL
;	NULL
whereon	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
revolved	NULL
unutterable	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
six	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
unflagging	NULL
devotion	NULL
?	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
Christina	NULL
had	NULL
offered	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
stuck	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
engagement	NULL
?	NULL

Was	NULL
this	NULL
the	NULL
outcome	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
talks	NULL
about	NULL
duty	NULL
and	NULL
spiritual	NULL
mindedness	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
now	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
fail	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
step	NULL
in	NULL
obedience	NULL
to	NULL
God	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
obedience	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
drive	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Crampsford	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
complain	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Allaby	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
married	NULL
Christina	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
married	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
a	NULL
hideous	NULL
dream	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
--	NULL
But	NULL
a	NULL
voice	NULL
kept	NULL
ringing	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
ears	NULL
which	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
YOU	NULL

screamed	NULL
the	NULL
unhappy	NULL
creature	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL
remorseless	NULL
voice	NULL

"	NULL
YOU	NULL

N'T	NULL

YOU	NULL
ARE	NULL
A	NULL
MARRIED	NULL
MAN	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
rolled	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
felt	NULL
how	NULL
iniquitous	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
marriage	NULL
laws	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
buy	NULL
Milton	NULL
's	NULL
prose	NULL
works	NULL
and	NULL
read	NULL
his	NULL
pamphlet	NULL
on	NULL
divorce	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
might	NULL
perhaps	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
Newmarket	NULL

So	NULL
the	NULL
bride	NULL
sat	NULL
crying	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
bridegroom	NULL
sulked	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
feared	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
bridegroom	NULL
can	NULL
fear	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
feeble	NULL
voice	NULL
was	NULL
heard	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
bride	NULL
's	NULL
corner	NULL
saying	NULL

the	NULL

When	NULL
Theobald	NULL
heard	NULL
these	NULL
words	NULL
a	NULL
load	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
lifted	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL

he	NULL
only	NULL

that	NULL
not	NULL
too	NULL
pleasantly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

continued	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL

"	NULL
what	NULL

"	NULL
but	NULL
another	NULL
burst	NULL
of	NULL
sobs	NULL
checked	NULL
the	NULL
completion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
load	NULL
on	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
grew	NULL
lighter	NULL
and	NULL
lighter	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
henpeck	NULL
him	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL

Besides	NULL

had	NULL
she	NULL
not	NULL
diverted	NULL
his	NULL
attention	NULL
from	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
approaching	NULL

He	NULL
swallowed	NULL
down	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
apprehensions	NULL

said	NULL

still	NULL
gloomily	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL

he	NULL
drew	NULL
her	NULL

him	NULL

kissed	NULL
away	NULL

that	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
matters	NULL
might	NULL
still	NULL
go	NULL
well	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
conquered	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
battle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
gives	NULL
great	NULL
prestige	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
easy	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL
!	NULL

Why	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
treated	NULL
his	NULL
sisters	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
next	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
brother	NULL
John	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
do	NULL
we	NULL
build	NULL
castles	NULL
in	NULL
air	NULL
when	NULL
flushed	NULL
with	NULL
wine	NULL
and	NULL
conquest	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
honeymoon	NULL
saw	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Theobald	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
devotedly	NULL
obsequious	NULL
wife	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
England	NULL
.	NULL

According	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
saying	NULL
,	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
killed	NULL
the	NULL
cat	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
cat	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
kitten	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
afraid	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
challenged	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
mortal	NULL
combat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
held	NULL
up	NULL
its	NULL
dripping	NULL
head	NULL
defiantly	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rest	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
easy	NULL
.	NULL

Strange	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
described	NULL
hitherto	NULL
as	NULL
so	NULL
timid	NULL
and	NULL
easily	NULL
put	NULL
upon	NULL
should	NULL
prove	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
Tartar	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
marriage	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
passed	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
courtship	NULL
too	NULL
rapidly	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
these	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
tutor	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
college	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
been	NULL
Junior	NULL
Dean	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
yet	NULL
knew	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
whose	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
importance	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
become	NULL
adequately	NULL
developed	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
held	NULL
a	NULL
resident	NULL
fellowship	NULL
for	NULL
five	NULL
or	NULL
six	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

True	NULL
--	NULL
immediately	NULL
on	NULL
arriving	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
ten	NULL
mile	NULL
radius	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
enchantment	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
waxed	NULL
weak	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
greatness	NULL
departed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
again	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
overgrown	NULL
baby	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
perpetual	NULL
cloud	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
often	NULL
at	NULL
Elmhurst	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
spell	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
off	NULL
again	NULL

once	NULL
more	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
the	NULL

From	NULL
all	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XIV	NULL
Battersby-On-The-Hill	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
Rector	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
contained	NULL
400	NULL
or	NULL
500	NULL
inhabitants	NULL
,	NULL
scattered	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
large	NULL
area	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
consisting	NULL
entirely	NULL
of	NULL
farmers	NULL
and	NULL
agricultural	NULL
labourers	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Rectory	NULL
was	NULL
commodious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
placed	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
brow	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hill	NULL
which	NULL
gave	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
delightful	NULL
prospect	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fair	NULL
sprinkling	NULL
of	NULL
neighbours	NULL
within	NULL
visiting	NULL
range	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
exceptions	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
clergymen	NULL
and	NULL
clergymen	NULL
's	NULL
families	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
surrounding	NULL
villages	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
these	NULL
the	NULL
Pontifexes	NULL
were	NULL
welcomed	NULL
as	NULL
great	NULL
acquisitions	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
said	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
clever	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
senior	NULL
classic	NULL
and	NULL
senior	NULL
wrangler	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL
genius	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
with	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
sound	NULL
practical	NULL
common	NULL
sense	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
son	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
distinguished	NULL
man	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
the	NULL
publisher	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
property	NULL
by-and-by	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
there	NULL
not	NULL
an	NULL
elder	NULL
brother	NULL
?	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
Theobald	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
get	NULL
something	NULL
very	NULL
considerable	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
dinner	NULL
parties	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
charming	NULL
woman	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
not	NULL
exactly	NULL
pretty	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
sweet	NULL
smile	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
manner	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
bright	NULL
and	NULL
winning	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
devoted	NULL
too	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
really	NULL
did	NULL
come	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
ideas	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
lovers	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
rare	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
pair	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
degenerate	NULL
times	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
beautiful	NULL
,	NULL
etc.	NULL
,	NULL
etc	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
comments	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
neighbours	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
arrivals	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
own	NULL
parishioners	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
farmers	NULL
were	NULL
civil	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
labourers	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
wives	NULL
obsequious	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
dissent	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
legacy	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
careless	NULL
predecessor	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Theobald	NULL
said	NULL
proudly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL

The	NULL

It	NULL

what	NULL

a	NULL

forty	NULL

one	NULL

that	NULL

yet	NULL
Rome	NULL
is	NULL
still	NULL
a	NULL

I	NULL
may	NULL
say	NULL
here	NULL
that	NULL
before	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
scope	NULL
for	NULL
useful	NULL
work	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rebuilding	NULL
of	NULL
Battersby	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
carried	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
considerable	NULL
cost	NULL
,	NULL
towards	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
subscribed	NULL
liberally	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
architect	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
saved	NULL
expense	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
architecture	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
understood	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
1834	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Theobald	NULL
commenced	NULL
operations	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
waited	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL

longer	NULL

Every	NULL

himself	NULL
the	NULL

clearly	NULL
will	NULL
his	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
Battersby	NULL

in	NULL
its	NULL

always	NULL
struck	NULL
me	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL

Theobald	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
staying	NULL

Theobald	NULL
some	NULL
six	NULL

seven	NULL
months	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
married	NULL

while	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
church	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
standing	NULL

I	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL

and	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
Naaman	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
on	NULL
certain	NULL
occasions	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
accompany	NULL
his	NULL
master	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
return	NULL
after	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
cured	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
leprosy	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
carried	NULL
away	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL

recollection	NULL

generation	NULL

which	NULL

catch	NULL

Somehow	NULL

I	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XVI	NULL
He	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
this	NULL
branch	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
profession	NULL
--	NULL
indeed	NULL
he	NULL
hates	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
admit	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
not	NULL
admitting	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
has	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
confirmed	NULL
one	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
there	NULL
haunts	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
ill	NULL
defined	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
life	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
pleasanter	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
sick	NULL
sinners	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
face	NULL
an	NULL
eternity	NULL
of	NULL
torture	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
indifference	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
element	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
farmers	NULL
look	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
element	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
are	NULL
full-bodied	NULL
,	NULL
healthy	NULL
and	NULL
contented	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
between	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
them	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
gulf	NULL
fixed	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
hard	NULL
and	NULL
drawn	NULL
look	NULL
begins	NULL
to	NULL
settle	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
corners	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
coat	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
tie	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
might	NULL
know	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
parson	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knows	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
doing	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
day	NULL
convinces	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
more	NULL
firmly	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
duty	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
sadly	NULL
in	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
occupation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
has	NULL
no	NULL
taste	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
field	NULL
sports	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
considered	NULL
unbecoming	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
forty	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
ride	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
shoot	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
fish	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
play	NULL
cricket	NULL
.	NULL

Study	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
him	NULL
justice	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
really	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
inducement	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
study	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
reads	NULL
neither	NULL
old	NULL
books	NULL
nor	NULL
new	NULL
ones	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
interest	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
art	NULL
or	NULL
science	NULL
or	NULL
politics	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
sets	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
promptness	NULL
if	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
show	NULL
any	NULL
development	NULL
unfamiliar	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

True	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
writes	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
sermons	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
even	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
considers	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
_	NULL
forte	NULL
_	NULL
lies	NULL
rather	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
example	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
(	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
one	NULL
long	NULL
act	NULL
of	NULL
self-devotion	NULL
)	NULL
than	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
utterances	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
pulpit	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
breakfast	NULL
he	NULL
retires	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
study	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
cuts	NULL
little	NULL
bits	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Bible	NULL
and	NULL
gums	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
exquisite	NULL
neatness	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
little	NULL
bits	NULL
;	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
calls	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
Harmony	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Old	NULL
and	NULL
New	NULL
Testaments	NULL
.	NULL

Alongside	NULL
the	NULL
extracts	NULL
he	NULL
copies	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
perfection	NULL
of	NULL
hand-writing	NULL
extracts	NULL
from	NULL
Mede	NULL
(	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
Theobald	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
really	NULL
understood	NULL
the	NULL
Book	NULL
of	NULL
Revelation	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
Patrick	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
old	NULL
divines	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
works	NULL
steadily	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
for	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
every	NULL
morning	NULL
during	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
is	NULL
doubtless	NULL
valuable	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
some	NULL
years	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
by	NULL
he	NULL
hears	NULL
his	NULL
children	NULL
their	NULL
lessons	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
daily	NULL
oft-repeated	NULL
screams	NULL
that	NULL
issue	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
study	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
lesson	NULL
hours	NULL
tell	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
horrible	NULL
story	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
has	NULL
also	NULL
taken	NULL
to	NULL
collecting	NULL
a	NULL
_	NULL
hortus	NULL
siccus	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
interest	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
was	NULL
once	NULL
mentioned	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Saturday	NULL
Magazine	NULL
as	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
plant	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
name	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
forgotten	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
of	NULL
Battersby	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Saturday	NULL
Magazine	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
bound	NULL
in	NULL
red	NULL
morocco	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
is	NULL
kept	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
potters	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
garden	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
hears	NULL
a	NULL
hen	NULL
cackling	NULL
he	NULL
runs	NULL
and	NULL
tells	NULL
Christina	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
straightway	NULL
goes	NULL
hunting	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
egg	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
Miss	NULL
Allabys	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
sometimes	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
with	NULL
Christina	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
led	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
sister	NULL
and	NULL
brother-in-law	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
idyll	NULL
.	NULL

Happy	NULL
indeed	NULL
was	NULL
Christina	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
choice	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
choice	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fiction	NULL
which	NULL
soon	NULL
took	NULL
root	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
happy	NULL
Theobald	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
Christina	NULL
.	NULL

Somehow	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
Christina	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
shy	NULL
of	NULL
cards	NULL
when	NULL
her	NULL
sisters	NULL
were	NULL
staying	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
at	NULL
other	NULL
times	NULL
she	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
a	NULL
game	NULL
of	NULL
cribbage	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
rubber	NULL
of	NULL
whist	NULL
heartily	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
sisters	NULL
knew	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
Battersby	NULL
again	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
refer	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
little	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
their	NULL
while	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
Battersby	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
temper	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
irritable	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
vent	NULL
it	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
nature	NULL
reserved	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
found	NULL
someone	NULL
to	NULL
cook	NULL
his	NULL
dinner	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
rather	NULL
have	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
desert	NULL
island	NULL
than	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
of	NULL
hearts	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
with	NULL
Pope	NULL
that	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
nuisance	NULL
to	NULL
mankind	NULL
is	NULL
man	NULL
"	NULL
or	NULL
words	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
effect	NULL
--	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
exception	NULL
perhaps	NULL
of	NULL
Christina	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
worse	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
when	NULL
visitors	NULL
called	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
face	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
than	NULL
anyone	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
scenes	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
expected	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
quick	NULL
too	NULL
at	NULL
introducing	NULL
the	NULL
names	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
literary	NULL
celebrities	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
established	NULL
an	NULL
all-round	NULL
reputation	NULL
which	NULL
satisfied	NULL
even	NULL
Christina	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
so	NULL
_	NULL
integer	NULL
vitae	NULL
scelerisque	NULL
purus	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
asked	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
of	NULL
Battersby	NULL
?	NULL

Who	NULL
so	NULL
fit	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
consulted	NULL
if	NULL
any	NULL
difficulty	NULL
about	NULL
parish	NULL
management	NULL
should	NULL
arise	NULL
?	NULL

Who	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
happy	NULL
mixture	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sincere	NULL
uninquiring	NULL
Christian	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
?	NULL

For	NULL
so	NULL
people	NULL
actually	NULL
called	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
admirable	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL

Certainly	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
pay	NULL
a	NULL
sum	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
forthcoming	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
appointed	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
saying	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
constitutional	NULL
timidity	NULL
rendered	NULL
him	NULL
incapable	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
overreach	NULL
when	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
remotest	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
opposition	NULL
or	NULL
publicity	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
correct	NULL
bearing	NULL
and	NULL
somewhat	NULL
stern	NULL
expression	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
protection	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
against	NULL
being	NULL
overreached	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
invariably	NULL
changed	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
whenever	NULL
money	NULL
was	NULL
introduced	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
expression	NULL
of	NULL
unutterable	NULL
horror	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
kinds	NULL
of	NULL
meanness	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sufficient	NULL
guarantee	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
business	NULL
transactions	NULL
save	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
ordinary	NULL
butcher	NULL
's	NULL
book	NULL
and	NULL
baker	NULL
's	NULL
book	NULL
description	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
tastes	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
--	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
,	NULL
simple	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
900	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
was	NULL
cheap	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
children	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
drag	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
envied	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
envied	NULL
why	NULL
then	NULL
respected	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
enviable	NULL
?	NULL

Yet	NULL
I	NULL
imagine	NULL
that	NULL
Christina	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
happier	NULL
than	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
visit	NULL
sick	NULL
parishioners	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
management	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
keeping	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
accounts	NULL
afforded	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
occupation	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
desired	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
principal	NULL
duty	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
well	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
honour	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
keep	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
temper	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
do	NULL
her	NULL
justice	NULL
she	NULL
fulfilled	NULL
this	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
uttermost	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
power	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
better	NULL
perhaps	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
frequently	NULL
assured	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
and	NULL
wisest	NULL
of	NULL
mankind	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
little	NULL
world	NULL
ever	NULL
dreamed	NULL
of	NULL
telling	NULL
him	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
long	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
any	NULL
doubt	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
temper	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
very	NULL
violent	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
care	NULL
to	NULL
humour	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
approaching	NULL
outbreak	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
early	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
easiest	NULL
plan	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
thunder	NULL
was	NULL
seldom	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Long	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
even	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
studied	NULL
his	NULL
little	NULL
ways	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
add	NULL
fuel	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
want	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
to	NULL
damp	NULL
it	NULL
judiciously	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
as	NULL
little	NULL
smoke	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
money	NULL
matters	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
scrupulousness	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
quarterly	NULL
allowance	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
pocket	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
little	NULL
charities	NULL
and	NULL
presents	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
these	NULL
last	NULL
items	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
liberal	NULL
in	NULL
proportion	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
income	NULL
;	NULL
indeed	NULL
she	NULL
dressed	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
economy	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
away	NULL
whatever	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
in	NULL
presents	NULL
or	NULL
charity	NULL
.	NULL

Oh	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
comfort	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
Theobald	NULL
to	NULL
reflect	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
on	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
rely	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
cost	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
sixpence	NULL
of	NULL
unauthorised	NULL
expenditure	NULL
!	NULL

Letting	NULL
alone	NULL
her	NULL
absolute	NULL
submission	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
perfect	NULL
coincidence	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
opinion	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
upon	NULL
every	NULL
subject	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
constant	NULL
assurances	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
everything	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
or	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
tower	NULL
of	NULL
strength	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
exactness	NULL
in	NULL
money	NULL
matters	NULL
!	NULL

As	NULL
years	NULL
went	NULL
by	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
as	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
nature	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
living	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
applauded	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
having	NULL
stuck	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
engagement	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
virtue	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
reaping	NULL
the	NULL
reward	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
when	NULL
Christina	NULL
did	NULL
outrun	NULL
her	NULL
quarterly	NULL
stipend	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
thirty	NULL
shillings	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
made	NULL
perfectly	NULL
clear	NULL
to	NULL
Theobald	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
deficiency	NULL
had	NULL
arisen	NULL
--	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
an	NULL
unusually	NULL
costly	NULL
evening	NULL
dress	NULL
bought	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
last	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL

or	NULL
somebody	NULL
's	NULL
unexpected	NULL
wedding	NULL
had	NULL
necessitated	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
handsome	NULL
present	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
quarter	NULL
's	NULL
balance	NULL
would	NULL
quite	NULL
allow	NULL

the	NULL
excess	NULL
of	NULL
expenditure	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

quarters	NULL
even	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
ten	NULL
shillings	NULL
at	NULL

time	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
after	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
married	NULL
some	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
Christina	NULL
had	NULL
somewhat	NULL
fallen	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
original	NULL
perfection	NULL
as	NULL
regards	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
gradually	NULL
in	NULL
arrear	NULL
during	NULL
many	NULL
successive	NULL
quarters	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
contracted	NULL
a	NULL
chronic	NULL
loan	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
domestic	NULL
national	NULL
debt	NULL
,	NULL
amounting	NULL
to	NULL
between	NULL
seven	NULL
and	NULL
eight	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
remonstrance	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
imperative	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
silver	NULL
wedding	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
inform	NULL
Christina	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
indebtedness	NULL
was	NULL
cancelled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
beg	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
endeavour	NULL
henceforth	NULL
to	NULL
equalise	NULL
her	NULL
expenditure	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
income	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
tears	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
and	NULL
gratitude	NULL
,	NULL
assured	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
generous	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
remainder	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL

life	NULL

she	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
shilling	NULL
behind	NULL

Christina	NULL
hated	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
no	NULL
less	NULL
cordially	NULL
than	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
and	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
nearly	NULL
everything	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
wish	NULL
for	NULL
;	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
people	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
introduce	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
changes	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
no	NULL

could	NULL
foresee	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
?	NULL

Religion	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
deeply	NULL
convinced	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
since	NULL
attained	NULL
its	NULL
final	NULL
development	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
could	NULL
it	NULL
enter	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
of	NULL
reasonable	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
conceive	NULL
any	NULL
faith	NULL
more	NULL
perfect	NULL
than	NULL
was	NULL
inculcated	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
imagine	NULL
no	NULL
position	NULL
more	NULL
honourable	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
unless	NULL
indeed	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
bishop	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

Considering	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
influence	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
impossible	NULL
that	NULL
Theobald	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
bishop	NULL
some	NULL
day	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
would	NULL
occur	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
little	NULL
flaw	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
practice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
flaw	NULL
not	NULL
indeed	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
doctrine	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
policy	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
believed	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
mistaken	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
respect	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
mean	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
bishop	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
rank	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
doing	NULL
of	NULL
Elizabeth	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
exceeding	NULL
doubtful	NULL
moral	NULL
character	NULL

and	NULL
at	NULL
heart	NULL
a	NULL
Papist	NULL

the	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
people	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
above	NULL
mere	NULL
considerations	NULL
of	NULL
worldly	NULL
dignity	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
such	NULL
things	NULL
carried	NULL
weight	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
whether	NULL
they	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
or	NULL
no	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
influence	NULL
as	NULL
plain	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Pontifex	NULL

wife	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
will	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Bishop	NULL
of	NULL
Winchester	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
be	NULL
considerable	NULL

Such	NULL
a	NULL
character	NULL
as	NULL
hers	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
fail	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
weight	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
ever	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
conspicuous	NULL
sphere	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL
influence	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
widely	NULL
felt	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
Lady	NULL
Winchester	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
Bishopess	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
sound	NULL
quite	NULL
nicely	NULL
--	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
power	NULL
for	NULL
good	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
enhanced	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
nicer	NULL
because	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
daughter	NULL

daughter	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL

a	NULL
Bishopess	NULL

indeed	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
a	NULL
Bishop	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
likely	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
were	NULL
her	NULL
thoughts	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
good	NULL
days	NULL
;	NULL
at	NULL
other	NULL
times	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
her	NULL
justice	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
doubts	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
respects	NULL
as	NULL
spiritually	NULL
minded	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL
press	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
press	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
every	NULL
enemy	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
salvation	NULL
was	NULL
surmounted	NULL
and	NULL
Satan	NULL
himself	NULL
lay	NULL
bruised	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
occasions	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
steal	NULL
a	NULL
march	NULL
over	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
contemporaries	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
off	NULL
eating	NULL
black	NULL
puddings	NULL

of	NULL
which	NULL
whenever	NULL
they	NULL

killed	NULL
a	NULL
pig	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
hitherto	NULL
partaken	NULL
freely	NULL

if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
also	NULL
careful	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
fowls	NULL
were	NULL
served	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
table	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
their	NULL
necks	NULL
wrung	NULL

only	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
their	NULL
throats	NULL
cut	NULL
and	NULL
been	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
bleed	NULL
.	NULL

St	NULL
Paul	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
Jerusalem	NULL
had	NULL
insisted	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
necessary	NULL
that	NULL
even	NULL
Gentile	NULL
converts	NULL
should	NULL
abstain	NULL
from	NULL
things	NULL
strangled	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
blood	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
joined	NULL
this	NULL
prohibition	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
vice	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
abominable	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
question	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
well	NULL
therefore	NULL
to	NULL
abstain	NULL
in	NULL
future	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
whether	NULL
any	NULL
noteworthy	NULL
spiritual	NULL
result	NULL
ensued	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
abstain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
resolve	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
stronger	NULL
,	NULL
purer	NULL
in	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
respects	NULL
more	NULL
spiritually	NULL
minded	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
felt	NULL
hitherto	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
lay	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
stress	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
settled	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
at	NULL
dinner	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
take	NULL
care	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL

black	NULL
puddings	NULL

seen	NULL

made	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL

and	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
got	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
aversion	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL

She	NULL
wished	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
were	NULL
one	NULL

more	NULL
general	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL

this	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
in	NULL

as	NULL
Lady	NULL

she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
what	NULL
as	NULL
plain	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
hopeless	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XVII	NULL
In	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
this	NULL
sorrow	NULL
was	NULL
removed	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fifth	NULL
year	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
married	NULL
life	NULL
Christina	NULL
was	NULL
safely	NULL
delivered	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sixth	NULL
of	NULL
September	NULL
1835	NULL
.	NULL

Word	NULL
was	NULL
immediately	NULL
sent	NULL
to	NULL
old	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
received	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
with	NULL
real	NULL
pleasure	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
son	NULL
John	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
had	NULL
borne	NULL
daughters	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
seriously	NULL
uneasy	NULL
lest	NULL
there	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
failure	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
male	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
descendants	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
good	NULL
news	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
doubly	NULL
welcome	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
caused	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
delight	NULL
at	NULL
Elmhurst	NULL
as	NULL
dismay	NULL
in	NULL
Woburn	NULL
Square	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
John	NULL
Pontifexes	NULL
were	NULL
then	NULL
living	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
freak	NULL
of	NULL
fortune	NULL
was	NULL
felt	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
cruel	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
impossibility	NULL
of	NULL
resenting	NULL
it	NULL
openly	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
delighted	NULL
grandfather	NULL
cared	NULL
nothing	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
John	NULL
Pontifexes	NULL
might	NULL
feel	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
wanted	NULL
a	NULL
grandson	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
grandson	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
everybody	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
to	NULL
good	NULL
ways	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
bring	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
grandsons	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
desirable	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
safe	NULL
with	NULL
fewer	NULL
than	NULL
three	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
rang	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
butler	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Gelstrap	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
solemnly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
cellar	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
Gelstrap	NULL
preceded	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
candle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
inner	NULL
vault	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
his	NULL
choicest	NULL
wines	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
passed	NULL
many	NULL
bins	NULL
:	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
1803	NULL
Port	NULL
,	NULL
1792	NULL
Imperial	NULL
Tokay	NULL
,	NULL
1800	NULL
Claret	NULL
,	NULL
1812	NULL
Sherry	NULL
,	NULL
these	NULL
and	NULL
many	NULL
others	NULL
were	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
family	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
inner	NULL
cellar	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
bin	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
appeared	NULL
empty	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
candle	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
found	NULL
to	NULL
contain	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
pint	NULL
bottle	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
's	NULL
search	NULL
.	NULL

Gelstrap	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
pondered	NULL
over	NULL
this	NULL
bottle	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
placed	NULL
there	NULL
by	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
himself	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
years	NULL
previously	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
return	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
visit	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
friend	NULL
the	NULL
celebrated	NULL
traveller	NULL
Dr	NULL
Jones	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
tablet	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
bin	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
clue	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
contents	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
one	NULL
occasion	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
master	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
his	NULL
keys	NULL
accidentally	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
sometimes	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
Gelstrap	NULL
had	NULL
submitted	NULL
the	NULL
bottle	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
tests	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
venture	NULL
upon	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
carefully	NULL
sealed	NULL
that	NULL
wisdom	NULL
remained	NULL
quite	NULL
shut	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
entrance	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
welcomed	NULL
her	NULL
most	NULL
gladly	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
indeed	NULL
from	NULL
all	NULL
other	NULL
entrances	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
nothing	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL
mystery	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
solved	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
alas	NULL
!	NULL

it	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
securing	NULL
even	NULL
a	NULL
sip	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
contents	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
removed	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL

Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
bottle	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
held	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
after	NULL
carefully	NULL
examining	NULL
the	NULL
seal	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
smiled	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
bin	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
bottle	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
catastrophe	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stumbled	NULL
over	NULL
an	NULL
empty	NULL
hamper	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fall	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
smash	NULL
of	NULL
broken	NULL
glass	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
the	NULL
cellar	NULL
floor	NULL
was	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
liquid	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
preserved	NULL
so	NULL
carefully	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
gasped	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
's	NULL
warning	NULL
to	NULL
Gelstrap	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stamped	NULL
as	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
when	NULL
Christina	NULL
had	NULL
wanted	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
order	NULL
his	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
water	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Jordan	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
furiously	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
saving	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
baptism	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
eldest	NULL
grandson	NULL
.	NULL

Damn	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
Gelstrap	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
dare	NULL
you	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
infernally	NULL
careless	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
that	NULL
hamper	NULL
littering	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
cellar	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
wonder	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sacred	NULL
stream	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
stand	NULL
upright	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
heap	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
cellar	NULL
floor	NULL
and	NULL
rebuke	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Gelstrap	NULL
told	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
servants	NULL
afterwards	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
master	NULL
's	NULL
language	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
backbone	NULL
curdle	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
"	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
flew	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
pantry	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
his	NULL
master	NULL
had	NULL
well	NULL
noted	NULL
his	NULL
absence	NULL
he	NULL
returned	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
sponge	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
basin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
sopping	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
waters	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Jordan	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
common	NULL
slop	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
filter	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
Sir	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Gelstrap	NULL
meekly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
'll	NULL
come	NULL
quite	NULL
clean	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
saw	NULL
hope	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
suggestion	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
shortly	NULL
carried	NULL
out	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
help	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
blotting	NULL
paper	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
funnel	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Eventually	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
pint	NULL
was	NULL
saved	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
held	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sufficient	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
preparations	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
visit	NULL
to	NULL
Battersby	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
ordered	NULL
goodly	NULL
hampers	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
choicest	NULL
eatables	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
selected	NULL
a	NULL
goodly	NULL
hamper	NULL
of	NULL
choice	NULL
drinkables	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
say	NULL
choice	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
choicest	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
although	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
exaltation	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
selected	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
very	NULL
best	NULL
wine	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
on	NULL
reflection	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
moderation	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
parting	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
best	NULL
water	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Jordan	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
only	NULL
send	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
second	NULL
best	NULL
wine	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Battersby	NULL
he	NULL
stayed	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
now	NULL
seldom	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
over	NULL
seventy	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
practically	NULL
retired	NULL
from	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
John	NULL
Pontifexes	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
kept	NULL
a	NULL
sharp	NULL
eye	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
discovered	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
dismay	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
interview	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
solicitors	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XVIII	NULL
For	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL

in	NULL
his	NULL

Theobald	NULL

something	NULL
right	NULL

could	NULL
look	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
meeting	NULL

father	NULL
without	NULL
alarm	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL

had	NULL
written	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
cordial	NULL
letter	NULL

announcing	NULL
his	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
standing	NULL
godfather	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

I	NULL
may	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
give	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
full	NULL

as	NULL
it	NULL
shows	NULL
the	NULL

at	NULL
his	NULL
best	NULL

It	NULL
runs	NULL

I	NULL

You	NULL

the	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
afterwards	NULL
the	NULL
writer	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
above	NULL
letter	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
appearance	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fly	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
Gildenham	NULL
to	NULL
Battersby	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
distance	NULL
of	NULL
fourteen	NULL
miles	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
Lesueur	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
box	NULL

the	NULL
driver	NULL

many	NULL

as	NULL
the	NULL
fly	NULL
could	NULL
carry	NULL
were	NULL
disposed	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
roof	NULL
and	NULL
elsewhere	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
the	NULL
John	NULL
Pontifexes	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Eliza	NULL
and	NULL
Maria	NULL

as	NULL
well	NULL

Alethea	NULL

who	NULL

by	NULL
her	NULL

special	NULL
request	NULL

was	NULL
godmother	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL

for	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
had	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
form	NULL
a	NULL
happy	NULL
family	NULL
party	NULL

so	NULL
come	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL

be	NULL
happy	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
must	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
worse	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
the	NULL
author	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
hubbub	NULL
was	NULL
actually	NULL
christened	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
proposed	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
him	NULL
George	NULL
after	NULL
old	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
strange	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
over-ruled	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
favour	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
Ernest	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
word	NULL
"	NULL
earnest	NULL
"	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
name	NULL
might	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
his	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
baptised	NULL
in	NULL
water	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Jordan	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
permanent	NULL
effect	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
's	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
influence	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
good	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
critical	NULL
periods	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
second	NULL
godfather	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
rejoiced	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL
of	NULL
meeting	NULL
Alethea	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
few	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
constant	NULL
correspondence	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
friends	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
played	NULL
together	NULL
as	NULL
children	NULL
onwards	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
grandfather	NULL
and	NULL
grandmother	NULL
severed	NULL
her	NULL
connection	NULL
with	NULL
Paleham	NULL
my	NULL
intimacy	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Pontifexes	NULL
was	NULL
kept	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
my	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
and	NULL
college	NULL
with	NULL
Theobald	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
each	NULL
time	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
I	NULL
admired	NULL
her	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
,	NULL
kindest	NULL
,	NULL
wittiest	NULL
,	NULL
most	NULL
lovable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
handsomest	NULL
woman	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
seen	NULL
.	NULL

None	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Pontifexes	NULL
were	NULL
deficient	NULL
in	NULL
good	NULL
looks	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
well-grown	NULL
shapely	NULL
family	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Alethea	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
flower	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
flock	NULL
even	NULL
as	NULL
regards	NULL
good	NULL
looks	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
in	NULL
respect	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
other	NULL
qualities	NULL
that	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
lovable	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
stock	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
intended	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
daughters	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
about	NULL
sufficient	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
been	NULL
allotted	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
sisters	NULL
getting	NULL
none	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
married	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
two	NULL
knew	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
must	NULL
suffice	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
reader	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
perfect	NULL
sympathy	NULL
and	NULL
understanding	NULL
between	NULL
us	NULL
;	NULL
we	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
neither	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
would	NULL
marry	NULL
anyone	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
times	NULL
over	NULL
;	NULL
having	NULL
said	NULL
this	NULL
much	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
say	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
point	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
no	NULL
way	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
development	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
story	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
few	NULL
years	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
difficulties	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
meeting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
keeping	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
close	NULL
correspondence	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Naturally	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
overjoyed	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
just	NULL
thirty	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
handsomer	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
lion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
party	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
seeing	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
meek	NULL
and	NULL
quite	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
eaten	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
roared	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
at	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
sight	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
tucking	NULL
his	NULL
napkin	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
rosy	NULL
old	NULL
gills	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
letting	NULL
it	NULL
fall	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
capacious	NULL
waistcoat	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
light	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
chandelier	NULL
danced	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
bump	NULL
of	NULL
benevolence	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
bald	NULL
old	NULL
head	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
star	NULL
of	NULL
Bethlehem	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
soup	NULL
was	NULL
real	NULL
turtle	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
well	NULL
pleased	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Gelstrap	NULL
stood	NULL
behind	NULL
his	NULL
master	NULL
's	NULL
chair	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
sat	NULL
next	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Theobald	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
left	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
just	NULL
opposite	NULL
her	NULL
father-in-law	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
every	NULL
opportunity	NULL
of	NULL
observing	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
ten	NULL

suddenly	NULL

helping	NULL
himself	NULL

lobster	NULL

he	NULL
flushed	NULL
crimson	NULL

a	NULL

vexation	NULL

his	NULL

poor	NULL

saw	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL

exceedingly	NULL

did	NULL
I	NULL

I	NULL

This	NULL
cut	NULL
me	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
till	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
known	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
cocks	NULL

hens	NULL
among	NULL
lobsters	NULL

but	NULL
had	NULL
vaguely	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
matrimony	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
even	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
angels	NULL

grew	NULL
up	NULL
almost	NULL
spontaneously	NULL
from	NULL

Before	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
course	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
Mr	NULL

recovered	NULL
his	NULL
temper	NULL

from	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL

the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
us	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Jordan	NULL

how	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL

what	NULL

with	NULL

Mr	NULL

you	NULL

we	NULL
each	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
pint	NULL
bottle	NULL

it	NULL
home	NULL
with	NULL
us	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
punch	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL

escape	NULL
with	NULL
mine	NULL

though	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL

I	NULL
fell	NULL

would	NULL
certainly	NULL

broken	NULL

I	NULL

And	NULL
Gelstrap	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
behind	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
!	NULL

Nothing	NULL
more	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
ruffle	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
delightful	NULL
evening	NULL

which	NULL
has	NULL
often	NULL
recurred	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
while	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
after	NULL
career	NULL

my	NULL
godson	NULL

I	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
afterwards	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
still	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
,	NULL
laid	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
attacks	NULL
of	NULL
liver	NULL
and	NULL
depression	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
becoming	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
subject	NULL

I	NULL
stayed	NULL
to	NULL
luncheon	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
was	NULL
cross	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
difficult	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
eat	NULL
nothing	NULL
--	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
appetite	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL

Christina	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
coax	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fleshy	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mutton	NULL
chop	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL

he	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
angrily	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
you	NULL
forget	NULL

my	NULL
dear	NULL

he	NULL
pushed	NULL
the	NULL

from	NULL
him	NULL

pouting	NULL

frowning	NULL

by	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL

give	NULL
her	NULL

Why	NULL

Why	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL

About	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL

a	NULL
half	NULL
afterwards	NULL
the	NULL
tables	NULL
were	NULL
turned	NULL
on	NULL
Battersby	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs	NULL
John	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
was	NULL
safely	NULL
delivered	NULL

A	NULL
year	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
later	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
George	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
was	NULL
himself	NULL
struck	NULL
down	NULL
suddenly	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
fit	NULL
of	NULL
paralysis	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
his	NULL
will	NULL
was	NULL
opened	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
an	NULL
original	NULL
bequest	NULL
of	NULL
20,000	NULL
pounds	NULL
to	NULL
Theobald	NULL
himself	NULL
(	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
sum	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
settled	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL

Christina	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
marriage	NULL
)	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
cut	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
17,500	NULL
pounds	NULL
when	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
left	NULL
"	NULL
something	NULL
"	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
"	NULL
something	NULL
"	NULL
proved	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
2500	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
accumulate	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
trustees	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
property	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
John	NULL
Pontifex	NULL

except	NULL
that	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
daughters	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
with	NULL
about	NULL
15,000	NULL
pounds	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
above	NULL
5000	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
inherited	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
father	NULL
then	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
truth	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
right	NULL
had	NULL
Theobald	NULL
to	NULL
complain	NULL
?	NULL

Certainly	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
gainers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
honour	NULL
and	NULL
glory	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bequest	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
was	NULL
virtually	NULL
being	NULL
taken	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
own	NULL
pocket	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
the	NULL
father	NULL
doubtless	NULL
argued	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
told	NULL
Theobald	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
anything	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
full	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
money	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
Theobald	NULL
chose	NULL
to	NULL
indulge	NULL
in	NULL
unwarrantable	NULL
expectations	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
affair	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
;	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
providing	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
liberally	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
take	NULL
2500	NULL
pounds	NULL
of	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
share	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
leaving	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
can	NULL
deny	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
testator	NULL
had	NULL
strict	NULL
right	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
side	NULL
;	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
the	NULL
reader	NULL
will	NULL
agree	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
considered	NULL
the	NULL
christening	NULL
dinner	NULL
so	NULL
great	NULL
a	NULL
success	NULL
if	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
before	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
had	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
lifetime	NULL
set	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
monument	NULL
in	NULL
Elmhurst	NULL
Church	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
memory	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
(	NULL
a	NULL
slab	NULL

King	NULL
George	NULL
the	NULL
Fourth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
space	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
epitaph	NULL
underneath	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
written	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
whether	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
some	NULL
friend	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
satire	NULL
was	NULL
intended	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL

the	NULL
intention	NULL

nothing	NULL

Day	NULL

found	NULL
it	NULL
hard	NULL

think	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
guile	NULL

The	NULL
epitaph	NULL
begins	NULL
by	NULL
giving	NULL
dates	NULL
of	NULL
birth	NULL

death	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
sets	NULL
out	NULL

This	NULL

we	NULL

in	NULL

that	NULL
having	NULL
lived	NULL

nearly	NULL
seventy-three	NULL

Returning	NULL

Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL

above	NULL
his	NULL
having	NULL
lived	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
prosperously	NULL

he	NULL
left	NULL
numerous	NULL

all	NULL

he	NULL

not	NULL
only	NULL
his	NULL
physical	NULL

characteristics	NULL

with	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL

also	NULL
no	NULL

are	NULL
less	NULL
easily	NULL
transmitted	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
his	NULL
pecuniary	NULL
characteristics	NULL

It	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
acquired	NULL
these	NULL

sitting	NULL

Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
did	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
kept	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL

made	NULL

money	NULL
is	NULL
like	NULL

Take	NULL
him	NULL

for	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
severe	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
my	NULL
father	NULL
was	NULL

Judge	NULL
him	NULL

there	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
fault	NULL

I	NULL

said	NULL

also	NULL
upon	NULL
Theobald	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XX	NULL
The	NULL
birth	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
opened	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
but	NULL
faintly	NULL
realised	NULL
hitherto	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL
how	NULL
great	NULL
a	NULL
nuisance	NULL
a	NULL
baby	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

Babies	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
so	NULL
suddenly	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
upset	NULL
everything	NULL
so	NULL
terribly	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
do	NULL
come	NULL
:	NULL
why	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
they	NULL
steal	NULL
in	NULL
upon	NULL
us	NULL
with	NULL
less	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
shock	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
domestic	NULL
system	NULL
?	NULL

His	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
recover	NULL
rapidly	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
confinement	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
remained	NULL
an	NULL
invalid	NULL
for	NULL
months	NULL
;	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
another	NULL
nuisance	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
expensive	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
interfered	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
amount	NULL
which	NULL
Theobald	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
by	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
income	NULL
against	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
rainy	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
provision	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
became	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
money	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
hindering	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Theorists	NULL
may	NULL
say	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
like	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
children	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
continuation	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
identity	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
generally	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
talk	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
children	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

Practical	NULL
family	NULL
men	NULL
know	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

About	NULL
twelve	NULL
months	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
birth	NULL
of	NULL
Ernest	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
,	NULL
also	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
christened	NULL
Joseph	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
twelve	NULL
months	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
was	NULL
given	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
months	NULL
before	NULL
this	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
born	NULL
Christina	NULL
paid	NULL
a	NULL
visit	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
John	NULL
Pontifexes	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
her	NULL
condition	NULL
,	NULL
passed	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Royal	NULL
Academy	NULL
exhibition	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
types	NULL
of	NULL
female	NULL
beauty	NULL
portrayed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Academicians	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

Alethea	NULL
warned	NULL
her	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
persisted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
certainly	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
plain	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
whether	NULL
the	NULL
pictures	NULL
caused	NULL
this	NULL
or	NULL
no	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
liked	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
got	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
had	NULL
they	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
oh	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
children	NULL
be	NULL
born	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
grown	NULL
up	NULL
?	NULL

If	NULL
Christina	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
birth	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
full-grown	NULL
clergymen	NULL
in	NULL
priest	NULL
's	NULL
orders	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
moderate	NULL
views	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
inclining	NULL
rather	NULL
to	NULL
Evangelicalism	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
comfortable	NULL
livings	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
respects	NULL
facsimiles	NULL
of	NULL
Theobald	NULL
himself	NULL
--	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
sense	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
or	NULL
if	NULL
people	NULL
could	NULL
buy	NULL
ready-made	NULL
children	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
shop	NULL
of	NULL
whatever	NULL
age	NULL
and	NULL
sex	NULL
they	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
always	NULL
having	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
do	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
required	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
married	NULL
to	NULL
Christina	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
quite	NULL
nicely	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
much	NULL
rather	NULL
continue	NULL
things	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
present	NULL
footing	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
married	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
pretend	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
times	NULL
were	NULL
changed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
unexceptionable	NULL
ways	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
his	NULL
dislike	NULL
apparent	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
better	NULL
if	NULL
Theobald	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
younger	NULL
days	NULL
had	NULL
kicked	NULL
more	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
encouraged	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
expect	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
implicit	NULL
obedience	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
trust	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
(	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
did	NULL
Christina	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
lenient	NULL
than	NULL
perhaps	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
danger	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
(	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
again	NULL
did	NULL
Christina	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
rather	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
too	NULL
indulgent	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
guard	NULL
against	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
duty	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
important	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
teaching	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
to	NULL
obey	NULL
its	NULL
parents	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
not	NULL
long	NULL
since	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
Eastern	NULL
traveller	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
exploring	NULL
somewhere	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
remote	NULL
parts	NULL
of	NULL
Arabia	NULL
and	NULL
Asia	NULL
Minor	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
remarkably	NULL
hardy	NULL
,	NULL
sober	NULL
,	NULL
industrious	NULL
little	NULL
Christian	NULL
community	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
health	NULL
--	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
actual	NULL
living	NULL
descendants	NULL
of	NULL
Jonadab	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
son	NULL
of	NULL
Rechab	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
European	NULL
costume	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
speaking	NULL
English	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
broken	NULL
accent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
colour	NULL
evidently	NULL
Oriental	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
begging	NULL
to	NULL
Battersby	NULL
soon	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
represented	NULL
themselves	NULL
as	NULL
belonging	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
people	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
collecting	NULL
funds	NULL
to	NULL
promote	NULL
the	NULL
conversion	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
fellow	NULL
tribesmen	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
branch	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Christian	NULL
religion	NULL
.	NULL

True	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
impostors	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
pound	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL
five	NULL
shillings	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
private	NULL
purse	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
and	NULL
got	NULL
drunk	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
village	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
Battersby	NULL
;	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
invalidate	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Eastern	NULL
traveller	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
Romans	NULL
--	NULL
whose	NULL
greatness	NULL
was	NULL
probably	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
wholesome	NULL
authority	NULL
exercised	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
over	NULL
all	NULL
its	NULL
members	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
Romans	NULL
had	NULL
even	NULL
killed	NULL
their	NULL
children	NULL
;	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
too	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
Romans	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
Christians	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
knew	NULL
no	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
practical	NULL
outcome	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
foregoing	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
conviction	NULL
in	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
in	NULL
Christina	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
their	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
training	NULL
up	NULL
their	NULL
children	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
earliest	NULL
infancy	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
signs	NULL
of	NULL
self-will	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
carefully	NULL
looked	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
plucked	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
roots	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
picked	NULL
up	NULL
this	NULL
numb	NULL
serpent	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
metaphor	NULL
and	NULL
cherished	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
bosom	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
Ernest	NULL
could	NULL
well	NULL
crawl	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
taught	NULL
to	NULL
kneel	NULL
;	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
well	NULL
speak	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
taught	NULL
to	NULL
lisp	NULL
the	NULL
Lord	NULL
's	NULL
prayer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
confession	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
taught	NULL
too	NULL
early	NULL
?	NULL

If	NULL
his	NULL
attention	NULL
flagged	NULL
or	NULL
his	NULL
memory	NULL
failed	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
ill	NULL
weed	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
grow	NULL
apace	NULL
,	NULL
unless	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
plucked	NULL
out	NULL
immediately	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
pluck	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
whip	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
shut	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cupboard	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
dock	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
pleasures	NULL
of	NULL
childhood	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
read	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
write	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
four	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
learning	NULL
Latin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
rule	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
sums	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
naturally	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
even	NULL
temper	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
doted	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
nurse	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
kittens	NULL
and	NULL
puppies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
kindness	NULL
of	NULL
allowing	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
regards	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
later	NULL
life	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
remember	NULL
no	NULL
feeling	NULL
but	NULL
fear	NULL
and	NULL
shrinking	NULL
.	NULL

Christina	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
remonstrate	NULL
with	NULL
Theobald	NULL
concerning	NULL
the	NULL
severity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tasks	NULL
imposed	NULL
upon	NULL
their	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
yet	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
continual	NULL
whippings	NULL

for	NULL
she	NULL
believed	NULL

doted	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
certainly	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
either	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
other	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
version	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
yet	NULL
been	NULL
two	NULL
parents	NULL
so	NULL
self-denying	NULL

devoted	NULL

the	NULL

their	NULL

Theobald	NULL

herself	NULL

For	NULL
Ernest	NULL

a	NULL
very	NULL
great	NULL
future	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
certain	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL

was	NULL

This	NULL
made	NULL
severity	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL

kept	NULL
pure	NULL
from	NULL
every	NULL

herself	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL

his	NULL

Oh	NULL

no	NULL

If	NULL
God	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
first-born	NULL

as	NULL
He	NULL

Abraham	NULL

but	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
unnecessary	NULL
--	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
might	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
nothing	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
baptised	NULL
in	NULL
water	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Jordan	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
her	NULL
doing	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
yet	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
sought	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
water	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
sacred	NULL
stream	NULL
was	NULL
wanted	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
sacred	NULL
infant	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
channel	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
found	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
flow	NULL
from	NULL
far	NULL
Palestine	NULL
over	NULL
land	NULL
and	NULL
sea	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
miracle	NULL
!	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
!	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
!	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Jordan	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
its	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
flowed	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
idle	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
miracle	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
miracle	NULL
was	NULL
effected	NULL
without	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
kind	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
faithful	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
unbeliever	NULL
consisted	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
former	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
miracle	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Jews	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
no	NULL
miracle	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
raising	NULL
of	NULL
Lazarus	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
feeding	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
five	NULL
thousand	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
John	NULL
Pontifexes	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
no	NULL
miracle	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Jordan	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
essence	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
miracle	NULL
lay	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
means	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
dispensed	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
adoption	NULL
of	NULL
means	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
end	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
available	NULL
without	NULL
interference	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
Dr	NULL
Jones	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
brought	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
unless	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
directed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
Theobald	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
. . .	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
insight	NULL
of	NULL
women	NULL
upon	NULL
matters	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
sort	NULL
was	NULL
deeper	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
unerring	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
filled	NULL
most	NULL
completely	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
fulness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Deity	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
why	NULL
had	NULL
they	NULL
not	NULL
treasured	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
after	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
used	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
ought	NULL
never	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
thrown	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
too	NULL
--	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
tempted	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
store	NULL
by	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
source	NULL
of	NULL
spiritual	NULL
danger	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
--	NULL
perhaps	NULL
even	NULL
of	NULL
spiritual	NULL
pride	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
sin	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
others	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
most	NULL
abhorred	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
channel	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
Jordan	NULL
had	NULL
flowed	NULL
to	NULL
Battersby	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
mattered	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
ran	NULL
in	NULL
Palestine	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

Dr	NULL
Jones	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
worldly	NULL
--	NULL
very	NULL
worldly	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
regretted	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
her	NULL
father-in-law	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
less	NULL
degree	NULL
;	NULL
spiritual	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
doubtless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
becoming	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
spiritual	NULL
continually	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
older	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
tainted	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
few	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
probably	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
whereas	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
for	NULL
Christ	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
.	NULL

_	NULL
They	NULL
_	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
worldly	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
least	NULL
Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
in	NULL
grace	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
off	NULL
eating	NULL
things	NULL
strangled	NULL
and	NULL
blood	NULL
--	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
washing	NULL
in	NULL
Jordan	NULL
as	NULL
against	NULL
Abana	NULL
and	NULL
Pharpar	NULL
,	NULL
rivers	NULL
of	NULL
Damascus	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
boy	NULL
should	NULL
never	NULL
touch	NULL
a	NULL
strangled	NULL
fowl	NULL
nor	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
pudding	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
coral	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
of	NULL
Joppa	NULL
--	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
coral	NULL
insects	NULL
on	NULL
those	NULL
coasts	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
could	NULL
easily	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
energy	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
Dr	NULL
Jones	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
etc	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
so	NULL
on	NULL
for	NULL
hours	NULL
together	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
day	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

Truly	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Theobald	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
child	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
lights	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
exceeding	NULL
great	NULL
fondness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
dreams	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
dreamed	NULL
in	NULL
sleep	NULL
were	NULL
sober	NULL
realities	NULL
in	NULL
comparison	NULL
with	NULL
those	NULL
she	NULL
indulged	NULL
in	NULL
while	NULL
awake	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
second	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
Theobald	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
already	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
teach	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
whip	NULL
him	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
teach	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
painful	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
Christina	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
child	NULL
was	NULL
puny	NULL
,	NULL
white	NULL
and	NULL
sickly	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
they	NULL
sent	NULL
continually	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
who	NULL
dosed	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
calomel	NULL
and	NULL
James	NULL
's	NULL
powder	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
anxiety	NULL
,	NULL
timidity	NULL
,	NULL
stupidity	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
impatience	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
stupid	NULL
in	NULL
little	NULL
things	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
stupid	NULL
in	NULL
little	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
stupid	NULL
also	NULL
in	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
old	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
died	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
revelation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
alteration	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
will	NULL
simultaneously	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
bequest	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
as	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
conveying	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
minds	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
testator	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
hurt	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
regards	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
himself	NULL
anyone	NULL
must	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
bequest	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
an	NULL
unmitigated	NULL
misfortune	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
leave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
independence	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
injury	NULL
which	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
inflict	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
cripple	NULL
his	NULL
energies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
deaden	NULL
his	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
active	NULL
employment	NULL
.	NULL

Many	NULL
a	NULL
youth	NULL
was	NULL
led	NULL
into	NULL
evil	NULL
courses	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
knowledge	NULL
that	NULL
on	NULL
arriving	NULL
at	NULL
majority	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
thousands	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
might	NULL
surely	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
trusted	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
their	NULL
boy	NULL
's	NULL
interests	NULL
at	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
judges	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
interests	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
twenty-one	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
:	NULL
besides	NULL
if	NULL
Jonadab	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
son	NULL
of	NULL
Rechab	NULL
's	NULL
father	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
simpler	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
Rechab	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
Rechab	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
handsome	NULL
legacies	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
grandchildren	NULL
--	NULL
why	NULL
Jonadab	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
found	NULL
those	NULL
children	NULL
so	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
deal	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
etc.	NULL
"	NULL
My	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Theobald	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
having	NULL
discussed	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL
Christina	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
twentieth	NULL
time	NULL

"	NULL
my	NULL

only	NULL
thing	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
go	NULL

pay	NULL
a	NULL

On	NULL
those	NULL

Mrs	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XXII	NULL
I	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
my	NULL
godson	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
brother	NULL
and	NULL
sister	NULL
were	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
hardly	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
grew	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
apart	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
gets	NULL
into	NULL
grooves	NULL
sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
supposed	NULL
friendship	NULL
between	NULL
myself	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Pontifexes	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
exist	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
rudimentary	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
godson	NULL
pleased	NULL
me	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
either	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
buoyancy	NULL
of	NULL
childhood	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
puny	NULL
,	NULL
sallow	NULL
little	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
liked	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
young	NULL
people	NULL

however	NULL

were	NULL
very	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
friendly	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
Ernest	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
brother	NULL
hovered	NULL
round	NULL
me	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
visits	NULL

On	NULL
this	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
was	NULL
expected	NULL

I	NULL
inquired	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
shop	NULL
near	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
buy	NULL
sweeties	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
said	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
pockets	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
finding	NULL
two	NULL
pence	NULL
halfpenny	NULL
in	NULL
small	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
I	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
youngsters	NULL
,	NULL
aged	NULL
four	NULL
and	NULL
three	NULL
,	NULL
toddled	NULL
off	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

Ere	NULL
long	NULL
they	NULL
returned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL

ca	NULL
n't	NULL
get	NULL
sweeties	NULL

all	NULL

(	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
rebuked	NULL

no	NULL

intended	NULL

;	NULL

we	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
added	NULL
the	NULL
halfpenny	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
pence	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
wanted	NULL
a	NULL
twopenny	NULL
cake	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
amused	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
solve	NULL
the	NULL
difficulty	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
Ernest	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
May	NULL
we	NULL
give	NULL
you	NULL
back	NULL

I	NULL
assented	NULL

and	NULL
they	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
of	NULL
relief	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
way	NULL
rejoicing	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
more	NULL
presents	NULL
of	NULL
pence	NULL
and	NULL
small	NULL
toys	NULL
completed	NULL
the	NULL
conquest	NULL

and	NULL
they	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
me	NULL
into	NULL
their	NULL
confidence	NULL

They	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL

I	NULL

ought	NULL

They	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL

The	NULL

remained	NULL
silent	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
seconds	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
said	NULL
"	NULL

again	NULL

I	NULL
laughed	NULL

Theobald	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
impatiently	NULL

said	NULL

then	NULL
turning	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
very	NULL
angry	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
shade	NULL
came	NULL
over	NULL
Ernest	NULL

face	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL

it	NULL

The	NULL

was	NULL
frightened	NULL

he	NULL

the	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL

The	NULL
man-servant	NULL

came	NULL

set	NULL
the	NULL

I	NULL
sat	NULL
opposite	NULL
them	NULL

watched	NULL
their	NULL
faces	NULL
as	NULL
Theobald	NULL
read	NULL
a	NULL
chapter	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Bible	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
nice	NULL
people	NULL

more	NULL
absolute	NULL
vacancy	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
saw	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
countenances	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
beings	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
began	NULL
by	NULL
reading	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
verses	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Old	NULL
Testament	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
system	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
this	NULL
occasion	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
fifteenth	NULL
chapter	NULL
of	NULL
Numbers	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
particular	NULL
bearing	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
upon	NULL
anything	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
spirit	NULL
which	NULL
breathed	NULL
throughout	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
Theobald	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
understand	NULL
better	NULL
after	NULL
hearing	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
act	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
acted	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
verses	NULL
are	NULL
as	NULL

My	NULL
thoughts	NULL
wandered	NULL
while	NULL
Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
reading	NULL
the	NULL
above	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
reverted	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
matter	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
observed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
happened	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
years	NULL
previously	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
swarm	NULL
of	NULL
bees	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
up	NULL
their	NULL
abode	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
roof	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
slates	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
multiplied	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
frequented	NULL
by	NULL
these	NULL
bees	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
were	NULL
open	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
paper	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
pattern	NULL
which	NULL
consisted	NULL
of	NULL
bunches	NULL
of	NULL
red	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
roses	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
several	NULL
bees	NULL
at	NULL
different	NULL
times	NULL
fly	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
these	NULL
bunches	NULL
and	NULL
try	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
real	NULL
flowers	NULL
;	NULL
having	NULL
tried	NULL
one	NULL
bunch	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
tried	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
nearest	NULL
the	NULL
ceiling	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
bunch	NULL
by	NULL
bunch	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
ascended	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
stopped	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
;	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
they	NULL
ascended	NULL
bunch	NULL
by	NULL
bunch	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ceiling	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
on	NULL
till	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
watching	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
prayers	NULL
being	NULL
repeated	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
week	NULL
by	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
month	NULL
by	NULL
month	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
year	NULL
by	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
nor	NULL
help	NULL
thinking	NULL
how	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
bees	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
,	NULL
bunch	NULL
by	NULL
bunch	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
ever	NULL
suspecting	NULL
that	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
associated	NULL
ideas	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
present	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
the	NULL
main	NULL
idea	NULL
be	NULL
wanting	NULL
hopelessly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
reading	NULL
we	NULL
all	NULL
knelt	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Carlo	NULL
Dolci	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Sassoferrato	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
sea	NULL
of	NULL
upturned	NULL
backs	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
buried	NULL
our	NULL
faces	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
chairs	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
noted	NULL
that	NULL
Theobald	NULL
prayed	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
"	NULL
truly	NULL
honest	NULL
and	NULL
conscientious	NULL
"	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
our	NULL
dealings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
smiled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
introduction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
truly	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
my	NULL
thoughts	NULL
ran	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bees	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
reflected	NULL
that	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
for	NULL
Theobald	NULL
that	NULL
our	NULL
prayers	NULL
were	NULL
seldom	NULL
marked	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
very	NULL
encouraging	NULL
degree	NULL
of	NULL
response	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
being	NULL
heard	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
prayed	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
might	NULL
ere	NULL
long	NULL
treat	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
treated	NULL
Ernest	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
my	NULL
thoughts	NULL
wandered	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
those	NULL
calculations	NULL
which	NULL
people	NULL
make	NULL
about	NULL
waste	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
one	NULL
can	NULL
get	NULL
done	NULL
if	NULL
one	NULL
gives	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
what	NULL
improper	NULL
suggestion	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
in	NULL
connection	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
spent	NULL
on	NULL
family	NULL
prayers	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
be	NULL
just	NULL
tolerable	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
Theobald	NULL
beginning	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
grace	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
Lord	NULL
Jesus	NULL
Christ	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
seconds	NULL
the	NULL
ceremony	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
servants	NULL
filed	NULL
out	NULL
again	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
filed	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
Christina	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
transaction	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
witness	NULL
,	NULL
imprudently	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
justify	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
cut	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
cut	NULL
Theobald	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
"	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
received	NULL
this	NULL
as	NULL
coldly	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
decently	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
my	NULL
silence	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
showed	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
disapproved	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
before	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
some	NULL
new-laid	NULL
eggs	NULL
back	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
Theobald	NULL
took	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
labourer	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
a	NULL
stone	NULL
's	NULL
throw	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Rectory	NULL
as	NULL
being	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
supply	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
reason	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
the	NULL
hens	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
eggs	NULL
were	NULL
scarce	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
cottager	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
me	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
seven	NULL
or	NULL
eight	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
proceeded	NULL
to	NULL
wrap	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
separate	NULL
pieces	NULL
of	NULL
paper	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
take	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
safely	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
operation	NULL
was	NULL
carried	NULL
on	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cottage	NULL
door	NULL

and	NULL
while	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL

The	NULL

Theobald	NULL
most	NULL
warmly	NULL

assured	NULL
him	NULL

Christina	NULL
of	NULL

delighted	NULL

gave	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL

looked	NULL

noted	NULL
much	NULL

I	NULL

the	NULL

much	NULL

Unless	NULL
for	NULL

"	NULL
One	NULL
great	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
clergymen	NULL
's	NULL
households	NULL
are	NULL
generally	NULL
unhappy	NULL

because	NULL
the	NULL
clergyman	NULL

much	NULL
at	NULL

Our	NULL

my	NULL

for	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL

We	NULL
were	NULL
some	NULL

go	NULL

the	NULL
lot	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL

then	NULL
their	NULL

them	NULL

liked	NULL

continued	NULL

I	NULL
enquired	NULL
how	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
this	NULL
discovery	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
where	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL

for	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
come	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
moment	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
know	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
babies	NULL
come	NULL
so	NULL
suddenly	NULL
;	NULL
one	NULL
goes	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
one	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
baby	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
die	NULL
of	NULL
cold	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
look-out	NULL

it	NULL

you	NULL

Yes	NULL

she	NULL
puts	NULL

off	NULL

does	NULL
not	NULL

many	NULL

you	NULL

you	NULL

not	NULL
made	NULL
any	NULL
mistake	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL

Oh	NULL

no	NULL

because	NULL
Mrs	NULL

you	NULL

called	NULL
here	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
sent	NULL

mamma	NULL

Three	NULL

four	NULL

after	NULL
the	NULL
birth	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
daughter	NULL

Christina	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
one	NULL

child	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
strong	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
married	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
presentiment	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
survive	NULL
this	NULL
last	NULL
confinement	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
accordingly	NULL
wrote	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
given	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
endorsed	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
sons	NULL
when	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
sixteen	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
reached	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
who	NULL
died	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
Christina	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
found	NULL
among	NULL
papers	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
repeatedly	NULL
and	NULL
carefully	NULL
arranged	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
seal	NULL
already	NULL
broken	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
afraid	NULL
,	NULL
shows	NULL
that	NULL
Christina	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
too	NULL
creditable	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
destroyed	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
called	NULL

How	NULL
like	NULL

solicitude	NULL

this	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL

this	NULL

appreciation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

felt	NULL
the	NULL

so	NULL
difficult	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL

very	NULL
doubtful	NULL
how	NULL

Ernest	NULL

Joey	NULL

succeed	NULL

it	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
plain	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
supposed	NULL

glance	NULL

them	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
suspicion	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
suspicion	NULL

Theobald	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
devoted	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL

why	NULL

such	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
platitude	NULL

as	NULL
almost	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
without	NULL

How	NULL
,	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
ask	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
past	NULL
five	NULL

old	NULL

trained	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL

about	NULL

how	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
lad	NULL
so	NULL
trained	NULL
should	NULL
grow	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
healthy	NULL

vigorous	NULL
development	NULL

even	NULL
though	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL

his	NULL
mother	NULL
was	NULL
undoubtedly	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
stories	NULL
?	NULL

Can	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
reader	NULL
fail	NULL
to	NULL
detect	NULL
the	NULL
coming	NULL
wrath	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
as	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
descend	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
who	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
nurtured	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
foregoing	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
often	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
Rome	NULL
does	NULL
wisely	NULL
in	NULL
not	NULL
allowing	NULL
her	NULL
priests	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
.	NULL

Certainly	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
common	NULL
observation	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
sons	NULL
of	NULL
clergymen	NULL
are	NULL
frequently	NULL
unsatisfactory	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
explanation	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
simple	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
lost	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
perhaps	NULL
be	NULL
pardoned	NULL
for	NULL
giving	NULL
it	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
clergyman	NULL
is	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
Sunday	NULL
.	NULL

Things	NULL
must	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
venial	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
week-day	NULL
classes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
paid	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
business	NULL
of	NULL
leading	NULL
a	NULL
stricter	NULL
life	NULL
than	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
his	NULL
_	NULL
raison	NULL
d'etre	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
his	NULL
parishioners	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
does	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
approve	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
contribution	NULL
towards	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
deem	NULL
a	NULL
holy	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
is	NULL
why	NULL
the	NULL
clergyman	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
vicar	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
person	NULL
whose	NULL
vicarious	NULL
goodness	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
entrusted	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
charge	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
home	NULL
is	NULL
his	NULL
castle	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
Englishman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
with	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
unnatural	NULL
tension	NULL
in	NULL
public	NULL
is	NULL
followed	NULL
by	NULL
exhaustion	NULL
when	NULL
tension	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
necessary	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
children	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
defenceless	NULL
things	NULL
he	NULL
can	NULL
reach	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
on	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
nine	NULL
cases	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
ten	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
relieve	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
clergyman	NULL
,	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
can	NULL
hardly	NULL
ever	NULL
allow	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
facts	NULL
fairly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
his	NULL
profession	NULL
to	NULL
support	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
impossible	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
an	NULL
unbiassed	NULL
examination	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
forget	NULL
that	NULL
every	NULL
clergyman	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
living	NULL
or	NULL
curacy	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
a	NULL
paid	NULL
advocate	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
barrister	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
persuade	NULL
a	NULL
jury	NULL
to	NULL
acquit	NULL
a	NULL
prisoner	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
should	NULL
listen	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
suspense	NULL
of	NULL
judgment	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
full	NULL
consideration	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
arguments	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
opposing	NULL
counsel	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
judge	NULL
does	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
trying	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

Unless	NULL
we	NULL
know	NULL
these	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
can	NULL
state	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
that	NULL
our	NULL
opponents	NULL
would	NULL
admit	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
fair	NULL
representation	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
views	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
claim	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
formed	NULL
an	NULL
opinion	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
misfortune	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
law	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
only	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
heard	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
exceptions	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
rule	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
Battersby	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
every	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
fulfil	NULL
the	NULL
duties	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
devote	NULL
themselves	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
honour	NULL
and	NULL
glory	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
honour	NULL
and	NULL
glory	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Church	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
years	NULL
without	NULL
finding	NULL
reason	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
opinions	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL
doubt	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
ever	NULL
got	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
doubting	NULL
the	NULL
wisdom	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
Church	NULL
upon	NULL
any	NULL
single	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
scent	NULL
for	NULL
possible	NULL
mischief	NULL
was	NULL
tolerably	NULL
keen	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
was	NULL
Christina	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
likely	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
either	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
detected	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
or	NULL
herself	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
faint	NULL
symptoms	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
faith	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
nipped	NULL
no	NULL
less	NULL
peremptorily	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bud	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
signs	NULL
of	NULL
self-will	NULL
in	NULL
Ernest	NULL
were	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
imagine	NULL
more	NULL
successfully	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
Theobald	NULL
considered	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
generally	NULL
considered	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
indeed	NULL
perhaps	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
exceptionally	NULL
truthful	NULL
person	NULL
;	NULL
indeed	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
generally	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
embodiment	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
virtues	NULL
which	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
respectable	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rich	NULL
respected	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
became	NULL
persuaded	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
unconsciousness	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
even	NULL
dwell	NULL
under	NULL
their	NULL
roof	NULL
without	NULL
deep	NULL
cause	NULL
for	NULL
thankfulness	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
servants	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
parishioners	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
fortunate	NULL
_	NULL
ipso	NULL
facto	NULL
_	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
theirs	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
road	NULL
to	NULL
happiness	NULL
here	NULL
or	NULL
hereafter	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
themselves	NULL
travelled	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
upon	NULL
every	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
reasonable	NULL
person	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
wants	NULL
the	NULL
gratification	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
inconvenient	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
--	NULL
Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
children	NULL
were	NULL
white	NULL
and	NULL
puny	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
suffering	NULL
from	NULL
_	NULL
home-sickness	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
starving	NULL
,	NULL
through	NULL
being	NULL
over-crammed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

Nature	NULL
came	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL

Why	NULL
should	NULL
she	NULL
?	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
leading	NULL
a	NULL

existence	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
two	NULL

accordingly	NULL

Dr	NULL

Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
slightly	NULL
at	NULL
Cambridge	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
burning	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
shining	NULL
light	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
position	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
filled	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
boyhood	NULL
upwards	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
great	NULL
genius	NULL
.	NULL

Everyone	NULL
knew	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
genius	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
applied	NULL
without	NULL
exaggeration	NULL

Had	NULL
he	NULL

taken	NULL

n't	NULL

how	NULL

among	NULL

many	NULL

perhaps	NULL
more	NULL

than	NULL
his	NULL
genius	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
biographers	NULL
have	NULL

earnestness	NULL
of	NULL

a	NULL

further	NULL

He	NULL

When	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
hardly	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
five-and-twenty	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
head-mastership	NULL
of	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
Grammar	NULL
School	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
vacant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
unhesitatingly	NULL
appointed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
result	NULL
justified	NULL
the	NULL
selection	NULL
.	NULL

Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
's	NULL
pupils	NULL
distinguished	NULL
themselves	NULL
at	NULL
whichever	NULL
University	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
moulded	NULL
their	NULL
minds	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
model	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stamped	NULL
an	NULL
impression	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
indelible	NULL
in	NULL
after	NULL
-	NULL
life	NULL
;	NULL
whatever	NULL
else	NULL
a	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
man	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
everyone	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
God-fearing	NULL
earnest	NULL
Christian	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
Liberal	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
Radical	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
politics	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
incapable	NULL
of	NULL
appreciating	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
and	NULL
loftiness	NULL
of	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
's	NULL
nature	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
such	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
alas	NULL
!	NULL

there	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
school	NULL
;	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
's	NULL
hand	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
properly	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
hand	NULL
was	NULL
against	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
theirs	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
connection	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
disliked	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
hated	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
more	NULL
especially	NULL
embodied	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
throughout	NULL
their	NULL
lives	NULL
disliked	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
reminded	NULL
them	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
minority	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
spirit	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
being	NULL
decidedly	NULL
Skinnerian	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
once	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
honour	NULL
of	NULL
playing	NULL
a	NULL
game	NULL
of	NULL
chess	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
great	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
Christmas	NULL
holidays	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Alethea	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
(	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
living	NULL
there	NULL
)	NULL
on	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
gracious	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
literature	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
lightest	NULL
kind	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
intervals	NULL
of	NULL
business	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
my	NULL
works	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
almost	NULL
exclusively	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
stage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
those	NULL
theatres	NULL
that	NULL
devoted	NULL
themselves	NULL
to	NULL
extravaganza	NULL
and	NULL
burlesque	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
many	NULL
pieces	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
description	NULL
,	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
puns	NULL
and	NULL
comic	NULL
songs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
fair	NULL
success	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
my	NULL
best	NULL
piece	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
treatment	NULL
of	NULL
English	NULL
history	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
Reformation	NULL
period	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
introduced	NULL
Cranmer	NULL
,	NULL
Sir	NULL
Thomas	NULL
More	NULL
,	NULL
Henry	NULL
the	NULL
Eighth	NULL
,	NULL
Catherine	NULL
of	NULL
Arragon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Thomas	NULL
Cromwell	NULL
(	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
youth	NULL
better	NULL
known	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
Malleus	NULL
Monachorum	NULL
_	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
them	NULL
dance	NULL
a	NULL
break-down	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
also	NULL
dramatised	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
Pilgrim	NULL
's	NULL
Progress	NULL
"	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
Christmas	NULL
Pantomime	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
important	NULL
scene	NULL
of	NULL
Vanity	NULL
Fair	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
Mr	NULL
Greatheart	NULL
,	NULL
Apollyon	NULL
,	NULL
Christiana	NULL
,	NULL
Mercy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Hopeful	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
principal	NULL
characters	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
orchestra	NULL
played	NULL
music	NULL
taken	NULL
from	NULL
Handel	NULL
's	NULL
best	NULL
known	NULL
works	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
altered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
altogether	NULL
the	NULL
tunes	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
exactly	NULL
as	NULL
Handel	NULL
left	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Greatheart	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
stout	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
red	NULL
nose	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
capacious	NULL
waistcoat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
shirt	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
huge	NULL
frill	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
.	NULL

Hopeful	NULL
was	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
mischief	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wore	NULL
the	NULL
costume	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
swell	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
period	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
cigar	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
continually	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Christiana	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
wear	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
:	NULL
indeed	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
dress	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
Stage	NULL
Manager	NULL
had	NULL
originally	NULL
proposed	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
considered	NULL
inadequate	NULL
even	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Lord	NULL
Chamberlain	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
delinquencies	NULL
upon	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
feel	NULL
convinced	NULL
of	NULL
sin	NULL
while	NULL
playing	NULL
chess	NULL
(	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
hate	NULL
)	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
of	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
historian	NULL
of	NULL
Athens	NULL
and	NULL
editor	NULL
of	NULL
Demosthenes	NULL
.	NULL

Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
,	NULL
moreover	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
pride	NULL
themselves	NULL
on	NULL
being	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
people	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
ease	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sitting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
chair	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
easily	NULL
overawed	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
schoolmaster	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
game	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
half-past	NULL
nine	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
supper	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
pieces	NULL
remaining	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
will	NULL
you	NULL
take	NULL
for	NULL
supper	NULL
,	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Skinner	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
silvery	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
answer	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
tone	NULL
of	NULL
almost	NULL
superhuman	NULL
solemnity	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Nothing	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
"	NULL
Nothing	NULL
whatever	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

By	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
come	NULL
over	NULL
me	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
I	NULL
were	NULL
nearer	NULL
the	NULL
consummation	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
yet	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
room	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
expression	NULL
came	NULL
over	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
showed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
expression	NULL
gathered	NULL
force	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
grew	NULL
darker	NULL
and	NULL
darker	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Stay	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
added	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
here	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
suspense	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
rapidly	NULL
becoming	NULL
unbearable	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Stay	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
presently	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL
of	NULL
cold	NULL
water	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
"	NULL
butter	NULL
"	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
sank	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
hardly	NULL
audible	NULL
whisper	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
of	NULL
relief	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
sentence	NULL
was	NULL
concluded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
universe	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
was	NULL
safe	NULL
.	NULL

Another	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
of	NULL
solemn	NULL
silence	NULL
finished	NULL
the	NULL
game	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Doctor	NULL
rose	NULL
briskly	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
seat	NULL
and	NULL
placed	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
supper	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Skinner	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
jauntily	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
what	NULL
are	NULL
those	NULL
mysterious-looking	NULL
objects	NULL
surrounded	NULL
by	NULL
potatoes	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Those	NULL
are	NULL
oysters	NULL
,	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Give	NULL
me	NULL
some	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
give	NULL
Overton	NULL
some	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
so	NULL
on	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
eaten	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
plate	NULL
of	NULL
oysters	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
scallop	NULL
shell	NULL
of	NULL
minced	NULL
veal	NULL
nicely	NULL
browned	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
apple	NULL
tart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
hunk	NULL
of	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
cheese	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
cloth	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
removed	NULL
and	NULL
tumblers	NULL
with	NULL
teaspoons	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
lemon	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
jug	NULL
of	NULL
boiling	NULL
water	NULL
were	NULL
placed	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
man	NULL
unbent	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
face	NULL
beamed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
what	NULL
shall	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
drink	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
persuasively	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Shall	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
brandy	NULL
and	NULL
water	NULL
?	NULL

No	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
gin	NULL
and	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

Gin	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
wholesome	NULL
liquor	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

So	NULL
gin	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
hot	NULL
and	NULL
stiff	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
can	NULL
wonder	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
or	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
but	NULL
pity	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

Was	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
head-master	NULL
of	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
School	NULL
?	NULL

To	NULL
whom	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
owed	NULL
money	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
time	NULL
?	NULL

Whose	NULL
ox	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
taken	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
ass	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
taken	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
whom	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
defrauded	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
whisper	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
breathed	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
moral	NULL
character	NULL
?	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
rich	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
honourable	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
means	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
literary	NULL
attainments	NULL
;	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
above	NULL
his	NULL
great	NULL
works	NULL
of	NULL
scholarship	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
"	NULL
Meditations	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
Epistle	NULL
and	NULL
Character	NULL
of	NULL
St	NULL
Jude	NULL
"	NULL
had	NULL
placed	NULL
him	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
popular	NULL
of	NULL
English	NULL
theologians	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
exhaustive	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
bought	NULL
it	NULL
need	NULL
ever	NULL
meditate	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
again	NULL
--	NULL
indeed	NULL
it	NULL
exhausted	NULL
all	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
5000	NULL
pounds	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
work	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
very	NULL
likely	NULL
make	NULL
another	NULL
5000	NULL
pounds	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
died	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
and	NULL
wanted	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
announce	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
pomp	NULL
and	NULL
circumstance	NULL
.	NULL

Nor	NULL
should	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
without	NULL
searching	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
deeper	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
hidden	NULL
meaning	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Those	NULL
who	NULL
searched	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
lightest	NULL
utterances	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
without	NULL
their	NULL
reward	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
find	NULL
that	NULL
"	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
"	NULL
was	NULL
Skinnerese	NULL
for	NULL
oyster-patties	NULL
and	NULL
apple	NULL
tart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
"	NULL
gin	NULL
hot	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
true	NULL
translation	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
independently	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
money	NULL
value	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
works	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
lasting	NULL
name	NULL
in	NULL
literature	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
probably	NULL
Gallio	NULL
was	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
fame	NULL
would	NULL
rest	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
treatises	NULL
on	NULL
natural	NULL
history	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
gather	NULL
from	NULL
Seneca	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
compiled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
for	NULL
aught	NULL
we	NULL
know	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
contained	NULL
a	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XXVIII	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
awful	NULL
accounts	NULL
of	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
's	NULL
temper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bullying	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
younger	NULL
boys	NULL
at	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bigger	NULL
ones	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
got	NULL
about	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
stand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
hard	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
burdens	NULL
of	NULL
whatever	NULL
kind	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
increased	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
cry	NULL
on	NULL
leaving	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
afraid	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
on	NULL
being	NULL
told	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
near	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
were	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
posted	NULL
from	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
carriage	NULL
;	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
had	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
no	NULL
railway	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
some	NULL
forty	NULL
miles	NULL
from	NULL
Battersby	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
easiest	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
seeing	NULL
him	NULL
cry	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
felt	NULL
flattered	NULL
and	NULL
caressed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
feel	NULL
very	NULL
sad	NULL
at	NULL
leaving	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
happy	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
going	NULL
among	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
good	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
dear	NULL
papa	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
;	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
deserving	NULL
of	NULL
pity	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
parting	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
painful	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
possibly	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
etc.	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
being	NULL
told	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
tears	NULL
were	NULL
for	NULL
grief	NULL
at	NULL
leaving	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
on	NULL
trust	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
investigate	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
cause	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
they	NULL
approached	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
he	NULL
pulled	NULL
himself	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
fairly	NULL
calm	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
reached	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
their	NULL
arrival	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
luncheon	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Skinner	NULL
took	NULL
Christina	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
bedrooms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
showed	NULL
her	NULL
where	NULL
her	NULL
dear	NULL
little	NULL
boy	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

Whatever	NULL
men	NULL
may	NULL
think	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
study	NULL
of	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
women	NULL
do	NULL
really	NULL
believe	NULL
the	NULL
noblest	NULL
study	NULL
for	NULL
womankind	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
engrossed	NULL
with	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Skinner	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
much	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
daresay	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Skinner	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
taking	NULL
pretty	NULL
accurate	NULL
stock	NULL
of	NULL
Christina	NULL
.	NULL

Christina	NULL
was	NULL
charmed	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
indeed	NULL
she	NULL
generally	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
any	NULL
new	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
(	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
must	NULL
we	NULL
all	NULL
)	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cross	NULL
;	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Skinner	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
imagine	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
too	NULL
many	NULL
Christinas	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
much	NULL
regeneration	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sample	NULL
now	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
her	NULL
private	NULL
opinion	NULL
echoed	NULL
the	NULL
dictum	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
well-known	NULL
head-master	NULL
who	NULL
declared	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
parents	NULL
were	NULL
fools	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
more	NULL
especially	NULL
mothers	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
smiles	NULL
and	NULL
sweetness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL
devoured	NULL
these	NULL
graciously	NULL
as	NULL
tributes	NULL
paid	NULL
more	NULL
particularly	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
mother	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
won	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
meantime	NULL
Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
were	NULL
with	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
library	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
where	NULL
new	NULL
boys	NULL
were	NULL
examined	NULL
and	NULL
old	NULL
ones	NULL
had	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
rebuke	NULL
or	NULL
chastisement	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
room	NULL
could	NULL
speak	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
an	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
blundering	NULL
and	NULL
capricious	NULL
cruelty	NULL
would	NULL
they	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
witness	NULL
to	NULL
!	NULL

Like	NULL
all	NULL
houses	NULL
,	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
's	NULL
had	NULL
its	NULL
peculiar	NULL
smell	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
case	NULL
the	NULL
prevailing	NULL
odour	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Russia	NULL
leather	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
subordinate	NULL
savour	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
chemist	NULL
's	NULL
shop	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
laboratory	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
together	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
free	NULL
chattery	NULL
and	NULL
smattery	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
words	NULL
as	NULL
"	NULL
carbonate	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
"	NULL
hyposulphite	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
"	NULL
phosphate	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
"	NULL
affinity	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
were	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
convince	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
sceptical	NULL
that	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
profound	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
chemistry	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
may	NULL
say	NULL
in	NULL
passing	NULL
that	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
had	NULL
dabbled	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
many	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
chemistry	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
small	NULL
knowledges	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
dangerous	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
Alethea	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
once	NULL
said	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
wicked	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
mind	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Bourbon	NULL
princes	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
return	NULL
from	NULL
exile	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
battle	NULL
of	NULL
Waterloo	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
their	NULL
exact	NULL
converse	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
whereas	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
nothing	NULL
and	NULL
forgotten	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
everything	NULL
and	NULL
forgotten	NULL
everything	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
this	NULL
puts	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
mind	NULL
of	NULL
another	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
wicked	NULL
sayings	NULL
about	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
harmlessness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
serpent	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
wisdom	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dove	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
's	NULL
library	NULL
;	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
chimney-piece	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Bishop	NULL
's	NULL
half	NULL
length	NULL
portrait	NULL
of	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
painted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
elder	NULL
Pickersgill	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
merit	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
to	NULL
discern	NULL
and	NULL
foster	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
pictures	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
collection	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
together	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
consummate	NULL
taste	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
largely	NULL
in	NULL
later	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hammer	NULL
at	NULL
Christie	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
long	NULL
since	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
found	NULL
to	NULL
comprise	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
latest	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
matured	NULL
works	NULL
of	NULL
Solomon	NULL
Hart	NULL
,	NULL
O'Neil	NULL
,	NULL
Charles	NULL
Landseer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
recent	NULL
Academicians	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
remember	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
thus	NULL
brought	NULL
together	NULL
and	NULL
exhibited	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
view	NULL
many	NULL
works	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
attracted	NULL
attention	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Academy	NULL
Exhibitions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
whose	NULL
ultimate	NULL
destiny	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
some	NULL
curiosity	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
prices	NULL
realised	NULL
were	NULL
disappointing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
executors	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
are	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
chance	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
unscrupulous	NULL
writer	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
well-known	NULL
weekly	NULL
paper	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
the	NULL
collection	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

Moreover	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
large	NULL
sales	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
time	NULL
before	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
last	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
panic	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
reaction	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
prices	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
ruled	NULL
lately	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
table	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
was	NULL
loaded	NULL
with	NULL
books	NULL
many	NULL
deep	NULL
;	NULL
MSS	NULL
.	NULL

of	NULL
all	NULL
kinds	NULL
were	NULL
confusedly	NULL
mixed	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
--	NULL
boys	NULL
'	NULL
exercises	NULL
,	NULL
probably	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
examination	NULL
papers	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
all	NULL
littering	NULL
untidily	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
room	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
depressing	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
slatternliness	NULL
as	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
of	NULL
erudition	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
entered	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
stumbled	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
hole	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Turkey	NULL
carpet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
dust	NULL
that	NULL
rose	NULL
showed	NULL
how	NULL
long	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
since	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
taken	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
beaten	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
fault	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Skinner	NULL
's	NULL
but	NULL
was	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
declared	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
papers	NULL
were	NULL
once	NULL
disturbed	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Near	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
green	NULL
cage	NULL
containing	NULL
a	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
turtle	NULL
doves	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
plaintive	NULL
cooing	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
melancholy	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
walls	NULL
were	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
book	NULL
shelves	NULL
from	NULL
floor	NULL
to	NULL
ceiling	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
every	NULL
shelf	NULL
the	NULL
books	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
double	NULL
rows	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
horrible	NULL

Prominent	NULL

that	NULL

any	NULL

should	NULL
have	NULL

them	NULL
too	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
fainted	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
told	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
chair	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
Theobald	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
topics	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
Hampden	NULL
Controversy	NULL
then	NULL
raging	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
discoursed	NULL
learnedly	NULL
about	NULL
"	NULL
Praemunire	NULL

;	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
talked	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
revolution	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
broken	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
Sicily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rejoiced	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Pope	NULL
had	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
allow	NULL
foreign	NULL
troops	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL

Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
masters	NULL
took	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
echoed	NULL

In	NULL
those	NULL
days	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
penny	NULL
papers	NULL
and	NULL
Theobald	NULL
only	NULL
took	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
Spectator	NULL
_	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Whig	NULL
side	NULL
in	NULL
politics	NULL
;	NULL
besides	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
Ecclesiastical	NULL
Gazette	NULL
_	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL

was	NULL
amazed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
ease	NULL
and	NULL
fluency	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
ran	NULL
from	NULL
subject	NULL
to	NULL

.	NULL

The	NULL
Pope	NULL
's	NULL
action	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Sicilian	NULL
revolution	NULL
naturally	NULL
led	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
reforms	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
Holiness	NULL
had	NULL
introduced	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
dominions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
laughed	NULL
consumedly	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
joke	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
long	NULL
since	NULL
appeared	NULL
in	NULL
_	NULL
Punch	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
that	NULL

should	NULL

because	NULL

as	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
explained	NULL

he	NULL
granted	NULL
everything	NULL
his	NULL
subjects	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

Anything	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
pun	NULL
went	NULL
straight	NULL
to	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
reforms	NULL
themselves	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
opened	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
era	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
history	NULL
of	NULL
Christendom	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
such	NULL
momentous	NULL
and	NULL
far-reaching	NULL
consequences	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
even	NULL
lead	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
reconciliation	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
Churches	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
and	NULL
Rome	NULL
.	NULL

Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
had	NULL
lately	NULL
published	NULL
a	NULL
pamphlet	NULL
upon	NULL
this	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
shown	NULL
great	NULL
learning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
attacked	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
Rome	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
which	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
promise	NULL
much	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
reconciliation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
grounded	NULL
his	NULL
attack	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
letters	NULL
A.M.D.G.	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
outside	NULL
a	NULL
Roman	NULL
Catholic	NULL
chapel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
stood	NULL
for	NULL
_	NULL
Ad	NULL
Mariam	NULL
Dei	NULL
Genetricem	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL

Could	NULL
anything	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
idolatrous	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
told	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
let	NULL
my	NULL
memory	NULL
play	NULL
me	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tricks	NULL
it	NULL
often	NULL
does	NULL
play	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
proposed	NULL
_	NULL
Ad	NULL
Mariam	NULL
Dei	NULL
Genetricem	NULL
_	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL
harmonies	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
constructed	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
bass	NULL
A.M.D.G.	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
bad	NULL
Latin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
really	NULL
harmonised	NULL
the	NULL
letters	NULL
thus	NULL
:	NULL
_	NULL
Ave	NULL
Maria	NULL
Dei	NULL
Genetrix	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
doubt	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
did	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
Latinity	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
forgotten	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
Latin	NULL
I	NULL
ever	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
said	NULL
_	NULL
Ad	NULL
Mariam	NULL
Dei	NULL
Genetricem	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
so	NULL
we	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
_	NULL
Ad	NULL
Mariam	NULL
Dei	NULL
Genetricem	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
good	NULL
enough	NULL
Latin	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
for	NULL
ecclesiastical	NULL
purposes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
reply	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
local	NULL
priest	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
was	NULL
jubilant	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
answer	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
solemnly	NULL
declared	NULL
that	NULL
A.M.D.G.	NULL
stood	NULL
for	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
dangerous	NULL
than	NULL
_	NULL
Ad	NULL
Majorem	NULL
Dei	NULL
Gloriam	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
though	NULL
this	NULL
subterfuge	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
succeed	NULL
with	NULL
any	NULL
intelligent	NULL
Englishman	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pity	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
had	NULL
selected	NULL
this	NULL
particular	NULL
point	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
attack	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
his	NULL
enemy	NULL
in	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
people	NULL
are	NULL
left	NULL
in	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
,	NULL
spectators	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
awkward	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
adversary	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
dare	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
scratch	NULL
.	NULL

Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
was	NULL
telling	NULL
Theobald	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
pamphlet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
doubt	NULL
whether	NULL
this	NULL
gentleman	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
comfortable	NULL
than	NULL
Ernest	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
bored	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
Liberalism	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ashamed	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
professed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Whig	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
reconciled	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
Rome	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
all	NULL
Roman	NULL
Catholics	NULL
turn	NULL
Protestants	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
understand	NULL
why	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
talked	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
truly	NULL
liberal	NULL
spirit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shut	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
so	NULL
sharply	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
edge	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
wondering	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
bring	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
diversion	NULL
was	NULL
created	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
discovery	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
--	NULL
doubtless	NULL
through	NULL
an	NULL
intense	NULL
but	NULL
inarticulate	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
boredom	NULL
greater	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
bear	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
highly	NULL
nervous	NULL
state	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
upset	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
excitement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Skinner	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
Christina	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
juncture	NULL

proposed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
spend	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
with	NULL
Mrs	NULL

and	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
introduced	NULL

his	NULL
young	NULL
companions	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
father	NULL

mother	NULL
now	NULL
bade	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
affectionate	NULL
farewell	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XXIX	NULL
Soon	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
Ernest	NULL
dropped	NULL
asleep	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
which	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jay	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
awake	NULL
till	NULL
dusk	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
stool	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
showed	NULL
pleasantly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
late	NULL
January	NULL
twilight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
muse	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
weak	NULL
,	NULL
feeble	NULL
,	NULL
ill	NULL
at	NULL
ease	NULL
and	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
innumerable	NULL
troubles	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
even	NULL
die	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
being	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
troubles	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
prove	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
new	NULL
ones	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
only	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Grandpapa	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
and	NULL
Grandmamma	NULL
Allaby	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
perhaps	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
than	NULL
Papa	NULL
and	NULL
Mamma	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
undoubtedly	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
really	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
more	NULL
worldly	NULL
;	NULL
moreover	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
grown-up	NULL
people	NULL
--	NULL
especially	NULL
Grandpapa	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
understand	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
grown-up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
kept	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
loving	NULL
any	NULL
grown-up	NULL
people	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
--	NULL
except	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
servants	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
indeed	NULL
been	NULL
as	NULL
nice	NULL
as	NULL
anything	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
imagine	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Heaven	NULL
he	NULL
supposed	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
complete	NULL
his	NULL
education	NULL
somewhere	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
meantime	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
were	NULL
rolling	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
muddy	NULL
roads	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
or	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
each	NULL
revolving	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
.	NULL

Times	NULL
have	NULL
changed	NULL
since	NULL
I	NULL
last	NULL
showed	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
reader	NULL
as	NULL
sitting	NULL
together	NULL
silently	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
carriage	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
except	NULL
as	NULL
regards	NULL
their	NULL
mutual	NULL
relations	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
altered	NULL
singularly	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
younger	NULL
I	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
the	NULL
Prayer	NULL
Book	NULL
was	NULL
wrong	NULL
in	NULL
requiring	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
the	NULL
General	NULL
Confession	NULL
twice	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
from	NULL
childhood	NULL
to	NULL
old	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
making	NULL
provision	NULL
for	NULL
our	NULL
not	NULL
being	NULL
quite	NULL
such	NULL
great	NULL
sinners	NULL
at	NULL
seventy	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
seven	NULL
;	NULL
granted	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
wash	NULL
like	NULL
table-cloths	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
I	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
want	NULL
rather	NULL
less	NULL
rubbing	NULL
and	NULL
scrubbing	NULL
at	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
grown	NULL
older	NULL
myself	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
has	NULL
estimated	NULL
probabilities	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pair	NULL
said	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
watched	NULL
the	NULL
fading	NULL
light	NULL
and	NULL
naked	NULL
trees	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
brown	NULL
fields	NULL
with	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
a	NULL
melancholy	NULL
cottage	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rain	NULL
that	NULL
fell	NULL
fast	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
windows	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
afternoon	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
nice	NULL
people	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL

Theobald	NULL

a	NULL

at	NULL
reflecting	NULL
how	NULL

to	NULL
post	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL

again	NULL

However	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL

so	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
sat	NULL
quietly	NULL
and	NULL
watched	NULL
the	NULL
roadside	NULL
objects	NULL
flit	NULL
by	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
greyer	NULL
and	NULL
grimmer	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
faded	NULL

Though	NULL
they	NULL
spoke	NULL
not	NULL

one	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
nearer	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL

Skinner	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
well	NULL
grounded	NULL

was	NULL
very	NULL
forward	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
presume	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
do	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
nature	NULL
is	NULL
an	NULL
idle	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
sure	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL

He	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
trouble	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
ungrateful	NULL
and	NULL
selfish	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
an	NULL
unnatural	NULL
thing	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
father	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL

but	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
son	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
sure	NULL

dislikes	NULL

He	NULL
shrinks	NULL
out	NULL

my	NULL
way	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
sees	NULL
me	NULL
coming	NULL

him	NULL

He	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
stay	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
room	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
can	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
deceitful	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
himself	NULL
away	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
deceitful	NULL

That	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
sign	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
makes	NULL
me	NULL
fear	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
sure	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
grow	NULL
up	NULL
extravagant	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
pocket-money	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
known	NULL
this	NULL

what	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
of	NULL
giving	NULL
him	NULL
pocket-money	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
all	NULL
gone	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL
buy	NULL
something	NULL

it	NULL
he	NULL

it	NULL

the	NULL
first	NULL

He	NULL
forgets	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
my	NULL
money	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL

I	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
money	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
learn	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
its	NULL
uses	NULL

not	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
may	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
squander	NULL
it	NULL
immediately	NULL

I	NULL
wish	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
music	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
interfere	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
Latin	NULL

Greek	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
stop	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
translating	NULL

half	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
'	NULL

by	NULL

What	NULL
should	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
age	NULL
know	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
Messiah	NULL
'	NULL
?	NULL

If	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
shown	NULL
half	NULL
as	NULL
many	NULL
dangerous	NULL
tendencies	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL

my	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL
very	NULL

Then	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
Egypt	NULL

the	NULL
tenth	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL

if	NULL

anything	NULL

have	NULL
been	NULL
something	NULL

If	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
desired	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
Lord	NULL
God	NULL
and	NULL
Heavenly	NULL
Father	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
yet	NULL
got	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
idea	NULL
in	NULL
connection	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
Sacrament	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
duty	NULL
towards	NULL
his	NULL
neighbour	NULL
was	NULL
another	NULL
bugbear	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
duties	NULL
towards	NULL
everybody	NULL
,	NULL
lying	NULL
in	NULL
wait	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
upon	NULL
every	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
nobody	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
duties	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
awful	NULL
and	NULL
mysterious	NULL
word	NULL
'	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL
'	NULL

What	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
mean	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
'	NULL
business	NULL
'	NULL
?	NULL

His	NULL
Papa	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
wonderfully	NULL
good	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
Mamma	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
hopeless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
awful	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
continually	NULL
telling	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
earn	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
living	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
how	NULL
--	NULL
considering	NULL
how	NULL
stupid	NULL
,	NULL
idle	NULL
,	NULL
ignorant	NULL
,	NULL
self-indulgent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
physically	NULL
puny	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
?	NULL

All	NULL
grown-up	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
clever	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
servants	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
these	NULL
were	NULL
cleverer	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

Oh	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
people	NULL
be	NULL
born	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
as	NULL
grown-up	NULL
persons	NULL
?	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Casabianca	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
examined	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
poem	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
not	NULL
long	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

'	NULL
When	NULL
only	NULL
would	NULL
he	NULL
leave	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
?	NULL

To	NULL
whom	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
call	NULL
?	NULL

Did	NULL
he	NULL
get	NULL
an	NULL
answer	NULL
?	NULL

Why	NULL
?	NULL

How	NULL
many	NULL
times	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
call	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
noblest	NULL
life	NULL
that	NULL
perished	NULL
there	NULL
?	NULL

Do	NULL
you	NULL
think	NULL
so	NULL

Why	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
think	NULL
so	NULL
?	NULL
'	NULL

And	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
Casabianca	NULL
's	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
noblest	NULL
life	NULL
that	NULL
perished	NULL
there	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
two	NULL
opinions	NULL
about	NULL
that	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
never	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
moral	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
poem	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
young	NULL
people	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
begin	NULL
too	NULL
soon	NULL
to	NULL
exercise	NULL
discretion	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
obedience	NULL
they	NULL
pay	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
Papa	NULL
and	NULL
Mamma	NULL
.	NULL

Oh	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
!	NULL

the	NULL
only	NULL
thought	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
never	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
like	NULL
Casabianca	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
Casabianca	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
despised	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
condescended	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nobody	NULL
else	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ship	NULL
worth	NULL
reckoning	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
matter	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
blown	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Hemans	NULL
knew	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
indifferent	NULL
lot	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
Casabianca	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
good-looking	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
family	NULL

"	NULL

And	NULL
thus	NULL
his	NULL
small	NULL
mind	NULL
kept	NULL
wandering	NULL
on	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
follow	NULL
it	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL

again	NULL
went	NULL
off	NULL

Next	NULL

Theobald	NULL

arose	NULL
feeling	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
tired	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL

all	NULL

What	NULL
more	NULL
could	NULL
parents	NULL
do	NULL
than	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL

"	NULL

Nothing	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
nicer	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
proper	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
really	NULL
did	NULL
seem	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
leaf	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boys	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
examinations	NULL
were	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
routine	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
half	NULL
year	NULL
began	NULL
;	NULL
Ernest	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
fears	NULL
about	NULL
being	NULL
kicked	NULL
about	NULL
and	NULL
bullied	NULL
were	NULL
exaggerated	NULL
.	NULL

Nobody	NULL
did	NULL
anything	NULL
very	NULL
dreadful	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
errands	NULL
between	NULL
certain	NULL
hours	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
elder	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
his	NULL
turn	NULL
at	NULL
greasing	NULL
the	NULL
footballs	NULL

and	NULL
so	NULL
forth	NULL

but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
spirit	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
as	NULL
regards	NULL
bullying	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
too	NULL
like	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

True	NULL
,	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
thrown	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
much	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
there	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
knowing	NULL
at	NULL
what	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
appearance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
show	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
storm	NULL
about	NULL
something	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
lion	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Bishop	NULL
of	NULL
Oxford	NULL
's	NULL
Sunday	NULL
story	NULL
--	NULL
always	NULL
liable	NULL
to	NULL
rush	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
behind	NULL
some	NULL
bush	NULL
and	NULL
devour	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
least	NULL
expected	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
called	NULL
Ernest	NULL
"	NULL
an	NULL
audacious	NULL
reptile	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
open	NULL
and	NULL
swallow	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
pronounced	NULL
Thalia	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
i.	NULL
"	NULL
And	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
thundered	NULL

"	NULL
who	NULL
never	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
false	NULL
quantity	NULL

"	NULL

Surely	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
nicer	NULL
person	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
false	NULL
quantities	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
youth	NULL
like	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL

Ernest	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
imagine	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
in	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
's	NULL
form	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
yet	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
throve	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
strange	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
seem	NULL
,	NULL
idolised	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
professed	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
in	NULL
after	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
Ernest	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
like	NULL
living	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
crater	NULL
of	NULL
Vesuvius	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Mr	NULL
Templer	NULL
's	NULL
form	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
snappish	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
downright	NULL
wicked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
crib	NULL
under	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
wonder	NULL
how	NULL
Mr	NULL
Templer	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
blind	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
supposed	NULL
Mr	NULL
Templer	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
cribbed	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
ask	NULL
himself	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
forget	NULL
his	NULL
youth	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Mr	NULL
Templer	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
could	NULL
possibly	NULL
forget	NULL
any	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jay	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
sometimes	NULL
very	NULL
alarming	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
half	NULL
year	NULL
had	NULL
commenced	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
being	NULL
some	NULL
little	NULL
extra	NULL
noise	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
rushed	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
spectacles	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
forehead	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
cap	NULL
strings	NULL
flying	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
whom	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
selected	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
hero	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
rampingest-scampingest-rackety-tackety-tow-row-roaringest	NULL
boy	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
liked	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
prayers	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL

say	NULL

"	NULL

take	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
kindly	NULL
old	NULL
soul	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

Most	NULL
boys	NULL
soon	NULL
discover	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL
noise	NULL
and	NULL
actual	NULL
danger	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
others	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
unnatural	NULL
to	NULL
menace	NULL
,	NULL
unless	NULL
they	NULL
mean	NULL
mischief	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
long	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
leave	NULL
off	NULL
taking	NULL
turkey-cocks	NULL
and	NULL
ganders	NULL
_	NULL
au	NULL
serieux	NULL

.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL
sort	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
of	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
so	NULL
gusty	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
shrink	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
sight	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
disliked	NULL
the	NULL
games	NULL
worse	NULL
even	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
squalls	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
class-room	NULL
and	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
feeble	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
filling	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
attaining	NULL
his	NULL
full	NULL
strength	NULL
till	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
later	NULL
age	NULL
than	NULL
most	NULL
boys	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
closeness	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
had	NULL
kept	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
books	NULL
in	NULL
childhood	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
in	NULL
part	NULL
also	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
tendency	NULL
towards	NULL
lateness	NULL
in	NULL
attaining	NULL
maturity	NULL
,	NULL
hereditary	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
also	NULL
of	NULL
unusual	NULL
longevity	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
thirteen	NULL
or	NULL
fourteen	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
bag	NULL
of	NULL
bones	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
upper	NULL
arms	NULL
about	NULL
as	NULL
thick	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
wrists	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
boys	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
age	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
little	NULL
chest	NULL
was	NULL
pigeon-breasted	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
strength	NULL
or	NULL
stamina	NULL
whatever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finding	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
in	NULL
physical	NULL
encounters	NULL
,	NULL
whether	NULL
undertaken	NULL
in	NULL
jest	NULL
or	NULL
earnest	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
with	NULL
boys	NULL
shorter	NULL
than	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
timidity	NULL
natural	NULL
to	NULL
childhood	NULL
increased	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
extent	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
afraid	NULL
amounted	NULL
to	NULL
cowardice	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
rendered	NULL
him	NULL
even	NULL
less	NULL
capable	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
otherwise	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
as	NULL
confidence	NULL
increases	NULL
power	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
confidence	NULL
increases	NULL
impotence	NULL

After	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
breath	NULL
knocked	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
been	NULL
well	NULL
shinned	NULL

dozen	NULL
times	NULL

scrimmages	NULL
at	NULL
football	NULL

scrimmages	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
involved	NULL
sorely	NULL
against	NULL

will	NULL

he	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
any	NULL
further	NULL
fun	NULL
in	NULL
football	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shirked	NULL
that	NULL
noble	NULL
game	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
that	NULL
got	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
trouble	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL

would	NULL
stand	NULL

shirking	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XXXI	NULL
With	NULL
the	NULL
masters	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
ere	NULL
long	NULL
in	NULL
absolute	NULL
disgrace	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
more	NULL
liberty	NULL
now	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
heretofore	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
heavy	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
watchful	NULL
eye	NULL
of	NULL
Theobald	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
path	NULL
and	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
spying	NULL
out	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
ways	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
punishment	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
copying	NULL
out	NULL
lines	NULL
of	NULL
Virgil	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
different	NULL
thing	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
savage	NULL
beatings	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
copying	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
was	NULL
often	NULL
less	NULL
trouble	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
lesson	NULL
.	NULL

Latin	NULL
and	NULL
Greek	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
which	NULL
commended	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
instinct	NULL
as	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
him	NULL
peace	NULL
even	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
;	NULL
still	NULL
less	NULL
did	NULL
they	NULL
hold	NULL
out	NULL
any	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
within	NULL
some	NULL
more	NULL
reasonable	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
deadness	NULL
inherent	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
defunct	NULL
languages	NULL
themselves	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
artificially	NULL
counteracted	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
system	NULL
of	NULL
_	NULL
bona	NULL
fide	NULL
_	NULL
rewards	NULL
for	NULL
application	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
any	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
punishments	NULL
for	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
application	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
comfortable	NULL
bribes	NULL
had	NULL
baited	NULL
the	NULL
hook	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
allure	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
pleasant	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
learning	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
or	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
treated	NULL
as	NULL
something	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
concern	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
business	NULL
with	NULL
pleasant	NULL
things	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
not	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
Ernest	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
were	NULL
put	NULL
into	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
pleasure	NULL
but	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pleasure	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
something	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
sinful	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
very	NULL
essence	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
doing	NULL
anything	NULL
we	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
apologise	NULL
and	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
very	NULL
mercifully	NULL
dealt	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
told	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
do	NULL
something	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
different	NULL

more	NULL
he	NULL
disliked	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
the	NULL
presumption	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL

.	NULL

It	NULL
never	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
presumption	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
favour	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rightness	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL

that	NULL

was	NULL
not	NULL
right	NULL
lay	NULL
with	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
disputed	NULL
its	NULL
being	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
depravity	NULL

never	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
mortal	NULL
more	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
without	NULL
cavil	NULL
whatever	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
told	NULL
by	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
authority	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL

he	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL

,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
it	NULL

for	NULL

he	NULL

nothing	NULL

at	NULL

Ernest	NULL
's	NULL

told	NULL
him	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL

he	NULL
dropped	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XXXII	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
now	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Alethea	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
perhaps	NULL
too	NULL
little	NULL
hitherto	NULL
,	NULL
considering	NULL
how	NULL
great	NULL
her	NULL
influence	NULL
upon	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL
's	NULL
destiny	NULL
proved	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
happened	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
thirty-two	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
parted	NULL
company	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
sisters	NULL
,	NULL
between	NULL
whom	NULL
and	NULL
herself	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
little	NULL
sympathy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
as	NULL
happy	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
clearer	NULL
ideas	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
setting	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
than	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
indeed	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
generally	NULL
have	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
fortune	NULL
consisted	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
5000	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
marriage	NULL
settlements	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
15,000	NULL
pounds	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
both	NULL
which	NULL
sums	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
absolute	NULL
control	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
brought	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
about	NULL
900	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
being	NULL
invested	NULL
in	NULL
none	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
soundest	NULL
securities	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
anxiety	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
income	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
rich	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
she	NULL
formed	NULL
a	NULL
scheme	NULL
of	NULL
expenditure	NULL
which	NULL
involved	NULL
an	NULL
annual	NULL
outlay	NULL
of	NULL
about	NULL
500	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
by	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
laughingly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
probably	NULL
just	NULL
succeed	NULL
in	NULL
living	NULL
comfortably	NULL
within	NULL
my	NULL
income	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

In	NULL
accordance	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
scheme	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
unfurnished	NULL
apartments	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
Gower	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
floors	NULL
were	NULL
let	NULL
out	NULL
as	NULL
offices	NULL
.	NULL

John	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Alethea	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
mind	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
business	NULL
so	NULL
plainly	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
beat	NULL
a	NULL
retreat	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
dropped	NULL
him	NULL
almost	NULL
entirely	NULL
.	NULL

Without	NULL
going	NULL
much	NULL
into	NULL
society	NULL
she	NULL
yet	NULL
became	NULL
acquainted	NULL
with	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
women	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
attained	NULL
a	NULL
position	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
literary	NULL
,	NULL
artistic	NULL
and	NULL
scientific	NULL
worlds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
singular	NULL
how	NULL
highly	NULL
her	NULL
opinion	NULL
was	NULL
valued	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
never	NULL
having	NULL
attempted	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
distinguish	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
written	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
chosen	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
seeing	NULL
others	NULL
write	NULL
and	NULL
encouraging	NULL
them	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
active	NULL
part	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
literary	NULL
people	NULL
liked	NULL
her	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
write	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
devoted	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
score	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
admirers	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
discouraged	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
railed	NULL
at	NULL
matrimony	NULL
as	NULL
women	NULL
seldom	NULL
do	NULL
unless	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
comfortable	NULL
income	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL
means	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
railed	NULL
at	NULL
man	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
railed	NULL
at	NULL
matrimony	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
living	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
fashion	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
censorious	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
complain	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
properly	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
defended	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
sex	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
condemned	NULL
most	NULL
severely	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
religion	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
think	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
nearly	NULL
a	NULL
freethinker	NULL
as	NULL
anyone	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
whose	NULL
mind	NULL
seldom	NULL
turned	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
disliked	NULL
equally	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
aired	NULL
either	NULL
religion	NULL
or	NULL
irreligion	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
once	NULL
hearing	NULL
her	NULL
press	NULL
a	NULL
late	NULL
well-known	NULL
philosopher	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
a	NULL
novel	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
pursuing	NULL
his	NULL
attacks	NULL
upon	NULL
religion	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
philosopher	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
like	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dilated	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
importance	NULL
of	NULL
showing	NULL
people	NULL
the	NULL
folly	NULL
of	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
pretended	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
smiled	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
demurely	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Have	NULL
they	NULL
not	NULL
Moses	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
prophets	NULL
?	NULL

Let	NULL
them	NULL
hear	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
a	NULL
wicked	NULL
thing	NULL
quietly	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
account	NULL
sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
my	NULL
attention	NULL
once	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
note	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
prayer-book	NULL
which	NULL
gave	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
walk	NULL
to	NULL
Emmaus	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
disciples	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
Christ	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
"	NULL
O	NULL
fools	NULL
and	NULL
slow	NULL
of	NULL
heart	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
ALL	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
prophets	NULL
have	NULL
spoken	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
all	NULL
"	NULL
being	NULL
printed	NULL
in	NULL
small	NULL
capitals	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
scarcely	NULL
on	NULL
terms	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL
John	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
kept	NULL
up	NULL
closer	NULL
relations	NULL
with	NULL
Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
paid	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
'	NULL
visit	NULL
to	NULL
Battersby	NULL
once	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

Alethea	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
like	NULL
Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
join	NULL
forces	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
(	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
two	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
hares	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
being	NULL
all	NULL
hounds	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
use	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
her	NULL
chief	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
maintaining	NULL
relations	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
keep	NULL
an	NULL
eye	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
children	NULL
and	NULL
give	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
lift	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
proved	NULL
nice	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Miss	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Battersby	NULL
in	NULL
old	NULL
times	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
beaten	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
lessons	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
lighter	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
easily	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
overworked	NULL
and	NULL
unhappy	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
guess	NULL
how	NULL
all-reaching	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
regime	NULL
under	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
lived	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
interfere	NULL
effectually	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wisely	NULL
forbore	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
too	NULL
many	NULL
enquiries	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
ever	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
living	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
roof	NULL
as	NULL
their	NULL
parents	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
ended	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
making	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
either	NULL
Joey	NULL
or	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
Ernest	NULL
as	NULL
should	NULL
enable	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
form	NULL
an	NULL
opinion	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
disposition	NULL
and	NULL
abilities	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
at	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
fourteen	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
character	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
shape	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
aunt	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
little	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
exploit	NULL
him	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
now	NULL
perhaps	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
on	NULL
some	NULL
pretext	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
good	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
Theobald	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
stock	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
nephew	NULL
under	NULL
circumstances	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
few	NULL
hours	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Accordingly	NULL
in	NULL
August	NULL
1849	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
entering	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
fourth	NULL
half	NULL
year	NULL
a	NULL
cab	NULL
drove	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
's	NULL
door	NULL
with	NULL
Miss	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
asked	NULL
and	NULL
obtained	NULL
leave	NULL
for	NULL
Ernest	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
dine	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Swan	NULL
Hotel	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
-	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
shy	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
good	NULL
nature	NULL
soon	NULL
set	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
ease	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
strongly	NULL
biassed	NULL
in	NULL
favour	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
young	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
warmed	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
his	NULL
appearance	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
prepossessing	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
hoped	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
cake	NULL
shop	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
whatever	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
him	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
premises	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
felt	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
contrasted	NULL
favourably	NULL
even	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
aunts	NULL
the	NULL
Misses	NULL
Allaby	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
sweet	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Misses	NULL
Allaby	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
poor	NULL
;	NULL
sixpence	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
what	NULL
five	NULL
shillings	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
Alethea	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
chance	NULL
had	NULL
they	NULL
against	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
put	NULL
by	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
income	NULL
twice	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
spend	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
had	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
prattle	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
snubbed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Alethea	NULL
encouraged	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
chatter	NULL
about	NULL
whatever	NULL
came	NULL
uppermost	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
trust	NULL
anyone	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
reasonably	NULL
wary	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
respect	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
sometimes	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
ever	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
wary	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
quite	NULL
dissociated	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
papa	NULL
and	NULL
mamma	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
his	NULL
instinct	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
guard	NULL
.	NULL

Little	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
great	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
issues	NULL
that	NULL
depended	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
behaviour	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
perhaps	NULL
have	NULL
played	NULL
his	NULL
part	NULL
less	NULL
successfully	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
aunt	NULL
drew	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
details	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
school	NULL
life	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
papa	NULL
and	NULL
mamma	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
approved	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
pumped	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
happy	NULL
Sunday	NULL
evenings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
Joey	NULL
and	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
quarrelled	NULL
sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
side	NULL
and	NULL
treated	NULL
everything	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
.	NULL

Like	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
mimic	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
warmed	NULL
with	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
glasses	NULL
of	NULL
sherry	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
nearly	NULL
tipsy	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
favoured	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
with	NULL

It	NULL

he	NULL

Dr	NULL

was	NULL

Ernest	NULL

before	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
sank	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
boots	NULL
in	NULL
no	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Alethea	NULL
smiled	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL

Ernest	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
checked	NULL
.	NULL

By-and-by	NULL
he	NULL
vented	NULL
a	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
small	NULL
second-hand	NULL
priggishnesses	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
caught	NULL
up	NULL
believing	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
correct	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
plain	NULL
that	NULL
even	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
early	NULL
age	NULL
Ernest	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
Ernest	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
belief	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
amusing	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
absurdity	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
aunt	NULL
judged	NULL
him	NULL
charitably	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
priggishness	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seeing	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
string	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
tongue	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
loosened	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
sherry	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
after	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
completed	NULL
the	NULL
conquest	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
then	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
passionately	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
music	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
highest	NULL
class	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hummed	NULL
or	NULL
whistled	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
pieces	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
works	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
masters	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
age	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
evident	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
purely	NULL
instinctive	NULL
,	NULL
inasmuch	NULL
as	NULL
music	NULL
received	NULL
no	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
encouragement	NULL
at	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
boy	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
as	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
music	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
picked	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
knowledge	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
organist	NULL
of	NULL
St	NULL
Michael	NULL
's	NULL
Church	NULL
who	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
practise	NULL
sometimes	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
week-day	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
organ	NULL
booming	NULL
away	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
passing	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
sneaked	NULL
inside	NULL
and	NULL
up	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
organ	NULL
loft	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
organist	NULL
became	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
familiar	NULL
visitant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
became	NULL
friends	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
which	NULL
decided	NULL
Alethea	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
taking	NULL
pains	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
likes	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
music	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
hates	NULL
Dr	NULL

This	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
fair	NULL
beginning	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
sent	NULL
him	NULL
away	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sovereign	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
(	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
hoped	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
five	NULL
shillings	NULL
)	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
her	NULL
money	NULL
's	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XXXIII	NULL
Next	NULL
day	NULL
Miss	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
thoughts	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
nephew	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
best	NULL
be	NULL
of	NULL
use	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
him	NULL
any	NULL
real	NULL
service	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
devote	NULL
herself	NULL
almost	NULL
entirely	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
living	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
live	NULL
at	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
continually	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
serious	NULL
undertaking	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
twelve	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
naturally	NULL
disliked	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
country	NULL
town	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
prudent	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
attempt	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
?	NULL

Must	NULL
not	NULL
people	NULL
take	NULL
their	NULL
chances	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
?	NULL

Can	NULL
anyone	NULL
do	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
anyone	NULL
else	NULL
unless	NULL
by	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
will	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
favour	NULL
and	NULL
dying	NULL
then	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
?	NULL

Should	NULL
not	NULL
each	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
happiness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
be	NULL
best	NULL
carried	NULL
on	NULL
if	NULL
everyone	NULL
minds	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
business	NULL
and	NULL
leaves	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
mind	NULL
theirs	NULL
?	NULL

Life	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
donkey	NULL
race	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
everyone	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
ride	NULL
his	NULL
neighbour	NULL
's	NULL
donkey	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
win	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
psalmist	NULL
long	NULL
since	NULL
formulated	NULL
a	NULL
common	NULL
experience	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
declared	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
man	NULL
may	NULL
deliver	NULL
his	NULL
brother	NULL
nor	NULL
make	NULL
agreement	NULL
unto	NULL
God	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
cost	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
redeem	NULL
their	NULL
souls	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
let	NULL
that	NULL
alone	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
these	NULL
excellent	NULL
reasons	NULL
for	NULL
letting	NULL
her	NULL
nephew	NULL
alone	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
many	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
against	NULL
them	NULL
there	NULL
pleaded	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
someone	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
younger	NULL
branches	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
family	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
become	NULL
warmly	NULL
attached	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
attach	NULL
warmly	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Over	NULL
and	NULL
above	NULL
this	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
someone	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
her	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
people	NULL
about	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
merely	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sons	NULL
and	NULL
daughters	NULL
of	NULL
brothers	NULL
and	NULL
sisters	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
liked	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
and	NULL
value	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
many	NULL
lovable	NULL
people	NULL
suffer	NULL
and	NULL
die	NULL
yearly	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
it	NULL
without	NULL
being	NULL
satisfied	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
legatees	NULL
were	NULL
square	NULL
,	NULL
lovable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
hard	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
those	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
most	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
it	NULL
genially	NULL
and	NULL
sensibly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whom	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
thus	NULL
be	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
most	NULL
happy	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
one	NULL
such	NULL
among	NULL
her	NULL
nephews	NULL
and	NULL
nieces	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
pains	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
or	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
failed	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
find	NULL
an	NULL
heir	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
related	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
blood	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
mess	NULL
of	NULL

I	NULL
shall	NULL
choose	NULL
some	NULL
nice-looking	NULL

well-dressed	NULL
screw	NULL

with	NULL
gentlemanly	NULL
manners	NULL
which	NULL
will	NULL
take	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
go	NULL

paint	NULL
Academy	NULL

as	NULL

"	NULL

As	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
will	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
troubled	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
left	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
stopped	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
father	NULL
left	NULL
me	NULL
abundantly	NULL
well	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
my	NULL
mode	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
always	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
known	NULL
uneasiness	NULL
about	NULL
money	NULL

moreover	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
especially	NULL
anxious	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
occasion	NULL
given	NULL
for	NULL
ill-natured	NULL
talk	NULL

she	NULL
knew	NULL
well	NULL

therefore	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
leaving	NULL
her	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
weaken	NULL
the	NULL
ties	NULL
that	NULL
existed	NULL
between	NULL

provided	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL

not	NULL
mind	NULL
her	NULL
talking	NULL
about	NULL

she	NULL

make	NULL
her	NULL
heir	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
understood	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
person	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
satisfied	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
having	NULL
enough	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
tempt	NULL
her	NULL
strongly	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
till	NULL
after	NULL
many	NULL
days	NULL
'	NULL
reflection	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
gravitated	NULL
towards	NULL
actually	NULL
doing	NULL

with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
break	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
daily	NULL
ways	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
would	NULL
entail	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
some	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
certainly	NULL
it	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
broach	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
guessed	NULL
how	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
arranged	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
at	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
live	NULL
there	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
years	NULL

As	NULL
a	NULL
compromise	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
objections	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
arranged	NULL
that	NULL

should	NULL
keep	NULL
her	NULL
rooms	NULL

Gower	NULL

and	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL

a	NULL
week	NULL

of	NULL
course	NULL

she	NULL
would	NULL
leave	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
holidays	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
unless	NULL
it	NULL
proved	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
success	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
should	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL

character	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
then	NULL
act	NULL
as	NULL
circumstances	NULL
might	NULL
determine	NULL

The	NULL
pretext	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
forward	NULL
ostensibly	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
doctor	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
after	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
recommended	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
purity	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
air	NULL

and	NULL
its	NULL
easy	NULL
access	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
London	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
railway	NULL
had	NULL
reached	NULL
it	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
anxious	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL
and	NULL
sister	NULL
any	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
complain	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
on	NULL
seeing	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
nephew	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
anxious	NULL

false	NULL
hopes	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
kind	NULL
in	NULL

boy	NULL
's	NULL

Having	NULL
settled	NULL
how	NULL
everything	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL

meant	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL

Michaelmas	NULL

mentioned	NULL

casually	NULL

that	NULL
one	NULL

Theobald	NULL

loved	NULL

therefore	NULL

taking	NULL

trouble	NULL
about	NULL

her	NULL

The	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
Alethea	NULL
seeing	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
serious	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

Christina	NULL
smelt	NULL
mischief	NULL
from	NULL
afar	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
indeed	NULL
she	NULL
often	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

Alethea	NULL
was	NULL
worldly	NULL

that	NULL

Theobald	NULL

In	NULL
her	NULL

Theobald	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL

knew	NULL
how	NULL

were	NULL
taken	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
anxiety	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL

welfare	NULL

Alethea	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
this	NULL
handsome	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Christina	NULL
had	NULL
wanted	NULL
something	NULL
better	NULL

stronger	NULL

she	NULL

Theobald	NULL

The	NULL
least	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
satisfied	NULL
Christina	NULL

not	NULL
feel	NULL
easy	NULL
that	NULL
an	NULL

not	NULL
grow	NULL
up	NULL
between	NULL

neither	NULL

Theobald	NULL
wanted	NULL

Miss	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
soon	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL

she	NULL
saw	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
like	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
well	NULL
shaped	NULL

unusually	NULL
devoid	NULL
of	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
fair	NULL
share	NULL

this	NULL
in	NULL
after	NULL
life	NULL

it	NULL
came	NULL
much	NULL
later	NULL

him	NULL

other	NULL
boys	NULL

and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
writing	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
little	NULL
skeleton	NULL

wanted	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
develop	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
and	NULL
chest	NULL
without	NULL
knocking	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL

he	NULL
gathered	NULL
from	NULL
what	NULL

said	NULL

this	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
rose	NULL

the	NULL

she	NULL
could	NULL

desired	NULL

wanted	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL

said	NULL
Theobald	NULL

which	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
hesitate	NULL

that	NULL

too	NULL
young	NULL

things	NULL

the	NULL
exercise	NULL

hammering	NULL

proved	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
had	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL

something	NULL
that	NULL
should	NULL
exercise	NULL

the	NULL

time	NULL

Ernest	NULL

pleasure	NULL

looked	NULL
quite	NULL

one	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
months	NULL
earlier	NULL

His	NULL
inner	NULL
self	NULL
never	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
humbug	NULL

as	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
about	NULL
Latin	NULL

Making	NULL
stools	NULL

drawers	NULL
was	NULL

living	NULL

after	NULL
Christmas	NULL
there	NULL
loomed	NULL
the	NULL

always	NULL

him	NULL

she	NULL

wonders	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
many	NULL
a	NULL
storm	NULL
yet	NULL
to	NULL
weather	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
fairly	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
supremely	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
was	NULL
happy	NULL
and	NULL
grateful	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
happiness	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
improvement	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
unrepressed	NULL
affection	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
became	NULL
fonder	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
many	NULL
faults	NULL
and	NULL
almost	NULL
incredible	NULL
foolishnesses	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
very	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
whatever	NULL
cause	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
became	NULL
strengthened	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
determination	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
parents	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
son	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
nephew	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
still	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
will	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XXXV	NULL
All	NULL
went	NULL
well	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
half	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
spent	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
holidays	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
also	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
I	NULL
spent	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
staying	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Swan	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
heard	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
my	NULL
godson	NULL
in	NULL
whom	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
took	NULL
less	NULL
interest	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
took	NULL
more	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
stage	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
than	NULL
in	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
nuisance	NULL
for	NULL
engrossing	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
's	NULL
attention	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
taking	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
from	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
organ	NULL
was	NULL
begun	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
fair	NULL
progress	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
two	NULL
months	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
half	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
happier	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
struggling	NULL
upwards	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
best	NULL
boys	NULL
took	NULL
more	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
consorted	NULL
less	NULL
with	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
led	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
mischief	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
Miss	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
undo	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
surroundings	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
.	NULL

Much	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
feared	NULL
and	NULL
disliked	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
(	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
still	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
caught	NULL
much	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
kinder	NULL
Ernest	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
modelled	NULL
himself	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
entirely	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ere	NULL
long	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
have	NULL
become	NULL
as	NULL
thorough	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
prig	NULL
as	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
easily	NULL
been	NULL
found	NULL
.	NULL

Fortunately	NULL
his	NULL
temper	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
not	NULL
frightened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
horizon	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
cross	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
whim	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
amiable	NULL
,	NULL
good-natured	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
awful	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
of	NULL
anyone	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
also	NULL
inherited	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
love	NULL
of	NULL
building	NULL
castles	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
called	NULL
--	NULL
her	NULL
vanity	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
showing	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
provided	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
attract	NULL
attention	NULL
,	NULL
cared	NULL
little	NULL
from	NULL
whom	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
caught	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
parrot-like	NULL
,	NULL
whatever	NULL
jargon	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
elders	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
correct	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
aired	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
season	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
season	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
was	NULL
old	NULL
enough	NULL
and	NULL
wise	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
men	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
rule	NULL
begin	NULL
to	NULL
develop	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
pleased	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
receptiveness	NULL
and	NULL
reproductiveness	NULL
than	NULL
alarmed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
he	NULL
caught	NULL
and	NULL
reproduced	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
attached	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
trusted	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
conceit	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
profound	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
fits	NULL
of	NULL
self-abasement	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
extreme	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
exaltation	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
impulsiveness	NULL
and	NULL
sanguine	NULL
trustfulness	NULL
in	NULL
anyone	NULL
who	NULL
smiled	NULL
pleasantly	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
indeed	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
absolutely	NULL
unkind	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
more	NULL
anxious	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
point	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
character	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
clearly	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
himself	NULL
rudely	NULL
undeceived	NULL
many	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
oft	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
learn	NULL
to	NULL
distinguish	NULL
friend	NULL
from	NULL
foe	NULL
within	NULL
reasonable	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
perception	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
which	NULL
led	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
action	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
soon	NULL
called	NULL
upon	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
health	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
part	NULL
excellent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
serious	NULL
illness	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
soon	NULL
after	NULL
Easter	NULL
1850	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
awoke	NULL
feeling	NULL
seriously	NULL
unwell	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
some	NULL
little	NULL
time	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
fever	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
days	NULL
the	NULL
precautions	NULL
that	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
spread	NULL
of	NULL
infection	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
understood	NULL
as	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
nobody	NULL
did	NULL
anything	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
it	NULL
became	NULL
plain	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
an	NULL
attack	NULL
of	NULL
typhoid	NULL
fever	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
dangerously	NULL
ill	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
this	NULL
she	NULL
sent	NULL
off	NULL
a	NULL
messenger	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
desired	NULL
him	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
without	NULL
her	NULL
lawyer	NULL
and	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
arrived	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
summoned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
still	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
delirium	NULL
:	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
cheery	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
received	NULL
us	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
danger	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
explained	NULL
her	NULL
wishes	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
reference	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
nephew	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
repeated	NULL
the	NULL
substance	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
already	NULL
referred	NULL
to	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
main	NULL
source	NULL
of	NULL
uneasiness	NULL
concerning	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
begged	NULL
me	NULL
by	NULL
our	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
close	NULL
intimacy	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
suddenness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
danger	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
powerlessness	NULL
to	NULL
avert	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
undertake	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
well	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
died	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
an	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
and	NULL
invidious	NULL
trust	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
bulk	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
money	NULL
ostensibly	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
reality	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
nephew	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
hold	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
trust	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
twenty-eight	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
neither	NULL
he	NULL
nor	NULL
anyone	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
her	NULL
lawyer	NULL
and	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
anything	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
leave	NULL
5000	NULL
pounds	NULL
in	NULL
other	NULL
legacies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
15,000	NULL
pounds	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
twenty-eight	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
accumulated	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
30,000	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Sell	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
debentures	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
now	NULL
is	NULL

and	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
Midland	NULL
Ordinary	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
him	NULL
make	NULL
his	NULL
mistakes	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
his	NULL
grandfather	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
no	NULL
prophet	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
even	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
take	NULL
that	NULL
boy	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
things	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
neighbours	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
will	NULL
get	NULL
no	NULL
help	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
forgive	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
good	NULL
luck	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
outright	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
daresay	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
wrong	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
lose	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
or	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
get	NULL
from	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Supposing	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
bankrupt	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
twenty-eight	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
mine	NULL
absolutely	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
trust	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
hand	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
in	NULL
due	NULL
time	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
continued	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
mistaken	NULL

the	NULL
worst	NULL
that	NULL

it	NULL

it	NULL

unhappy	NULL

the	NULL

of	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
begged	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
2000	NULL
pounds	NULL
in	NULL
return	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
trouble	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
in	NULL
taking	NULL
charge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
's	NULL
estate	NULL

and	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
testatrix	NULL
's	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
him	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
young	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
remaining	NULL
3000	NULL
pounds	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
in	NULL
legacies	NULL
and	NULL
annuities	NULL
to	NULL
friends	NULL
and	NULL
servants	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
vain	NULL
both	NULL
her	NULL
lawyer	NULL
and	NULL
myself	NULL
remonstrated	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
unusual	NULL
and	NULL
hazardous	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
arrangement	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
sensible	NULL
people	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
sanguine	NULL
view	NULL
concerning	NULL
human	NULL
nature	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
Courts	NULL
of	NULL
Chancery	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
everything	NULL
that	NULL
anyone	NULL
else	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
admitted	NULL
everything	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
urged	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
time	NULL
was	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
would	NULL
induce	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
her	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
nephew	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
an	NULL
unusually	NULL
foolish	NULL
will	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
an	NULL
unusually	NULL
foolish	NULL
boy	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
smiled	NULL
quite	NULL
merrily	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
sally	NULL
.	NULL

Like	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
stubborn	NULL
when	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL

So	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
wished	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
provision	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
for	NULL
either	NULL
my	NULL
death	NULL

Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
--	NULL
Miss	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
had	NULL
settled	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL

neither	NULL

and	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
ill	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
details	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL

anxious	NULL

moreover	NULL

to	NULL
sign	NULL
her	NULL

still	NULL
able	NULL

that	NULL

practically	NULL
no	NULL

to	NULL

she	NULL
told	NULL
us	NULL

one	NULL

all	NULL
came	NULL
post-haste	NULL

Roughborough	NULL

Before	NULL
they	NULL
arrived	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
lady	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
delirious	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL

peace	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
half	NULL
glad	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
recovered	NULL
consciousness	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
these	NULL
people	NULL
all	NULL
their	NULL
lives	NULL

as	NULL
none	NULL
can	NULL
know	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
but	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
played	NULL
together	NULL
as	NULL
children	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
--	NULL
perhaps	NULL
Theobald	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
--	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
a	NULL
burden	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
mistress	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
displeased	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
coming	NULL
one	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
to	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
inquiring	NULL
whether	NULL
their	NULL
sister	NULL
had	NULL
recovered	NULL
consciousness	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
known	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
on	NULL
being	NULL
taken	NULL
ill	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
remained	NULL
at	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
own	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
angered	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
mingled	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
suspicion	NULL
,	NULL
defiance	NULL
and	NULL
inquisitiveness	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
regarded	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
Theobald	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
have	NULL
cut	NULL
me	NULL
downright	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
believed	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
something	NULL
they	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
some	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
learning	NULL
from	NULL
me	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
plain	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
way	NULL
concerned	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
making	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
will	NULL
.	NULL

None	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
suspected	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
ostensible	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
they	NULL
feared	NULL
Miss	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
money	NULL
for	NULL
public	NULL
uses	NULL
.	NULL

John	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
blandest	NULL
manner	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
fancied	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
leaving	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
college	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
relief	NULL
of	NULL
dramatic	NULL
authors	NULL
in	NULL
distress	NULL
;	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
I	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
rejoinder	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
his	NULL
suspicions	NULL
were	NULL
deepened	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
Miss	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
's	NULL
solicitor	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
and	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
brothers	NULL
and	NULL
sisters	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
money	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
unnaturally	NULL
furious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
each	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
or	NULL
her	NULL
separate	NULL
home	NULL
without	NULL
attending	NULL
the	NULL
funeral	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
paying	NULL
any	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
kindest	NULL
thing	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
by	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
behaviour	NULL
made	NULL
me	NULL
so	NULL
angry	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
became	NULL
almost	NULL
reconciled	NULL
to	NULL
Alethea	NULL
's	NULL
will	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
pleasure	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
anger	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
aroused	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
will	NULL
keenly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
placed	NULL
by	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
others	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
most	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
having	NULL
saddled	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
heavy	NULL
responsibility	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
escape	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
let	NULL
things	NULL
take	NULL
their	NULL
course	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
had	NULL
expressed	NULL
a	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
buried	NULL
at	NULL
Paleham	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
I	NULL
therefore	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
thither	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
Paleham	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
father	NULL
some	NULL
six	NULL
years	NULL
earlier	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
shrunk	NULL
from	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
though	NULL
my	NULL
sister	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
my	NULL
home	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
strangers	NULL
;	NULL
to	NULL
ring	NULL
ceremoniously	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
bell	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
yet	NULL
pulled	NULL
except	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
in	NULL
jest	NULL
;	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
garden	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
childhood	NULL
gathered	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
a	NULL
nosegay	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
after	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
reached	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
estate	NULL
;	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL
bereft	NULL
of	NULL
every	NULL
familiar	NULL
feature	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
so	NULL
unfamiliar	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
familiarity	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
there	NULL
been	NULL
any	NULL
sufficient	NULL
reason	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
should	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
have	NULL
found	NULL
them	NULL
much	NULL
worse	NULL
in	NULL
anticipation	NULL
than	NULL
in	NULL
reality	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
no	NULL
special	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Paleham	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
hitherto	NULL
avoided	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
going	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
necessity	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
confess	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
felt	NULL
more	NULL
subdued	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
on	NULL
arriving	NULL
there	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
playmate	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
childhood	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
more	NULL
changed	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
railway	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
brand	NULL
new	NULL
yellow	NULL
brick	NULL
station	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
site	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
Mr	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
's	NULL
cottage	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
carpenter	NULL
's	NULL
shop	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
standing	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
saw	NULL
many	NULL
faces	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
six	NULL
years	NULL
they	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
grown	NULL
wonderfully	NULL
older	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
old	NULL
were	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
were	NULL
getting	NULL
very	NULL
old	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
stead	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
felt	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
changeling	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fairy	NULL
story	NULL
who	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
seven	NULL
years	NULL
'	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

Everyone	NULL
seemed	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
given	NULL
them	NULL
particular	NULL
cause	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
everyone	NULL
who	NULL
remembered	NULL
old	NULL
Mr	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
spoke	NULL
warmly	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
pleased	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
granddaughter	NULL
's	NULL
wishing	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
laid	NULL
near	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Entering	NULL
the	NULL
churchyard	NULL
and	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
twilight	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
gusty	NULL
cloudy	NULL
evening	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
close	NULL
beside	NULL
old	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
's	NULL
grave	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
chosen	NULL
for	NULL
Alethea	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
many	NULL
times	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
lie	NULL
there	NULL
henceforth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
must	NULL
surely	NULL
lie	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
such	NULL
another	NULL
place	NULL
though	NULL
when	NULL
and	NULL
where	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
romped	NULL
over	NULL
this	NULL
very	NULL
spot	NULL
as	NULL
childish	NULL
lovers	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
morning	NULL
I	NULL
followed	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
grave	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
due	NULL
course	NULL
set	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
plain	NULL
upright	NULL
slab	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
memory	NULL
as	NULL
like	NULL
as	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
those	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
graves	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
grandmother	NULL
and	NULL
grandfather	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
dates	NULL
and	NULL
places	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
birth	NULL
and	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
added	NULL
nothing	NULL
except	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
stone	NULL
was	NULL
set	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
and	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Knowing	NULL
how	NULL
fond	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
of	NULL
music	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
half	NULL
inclined	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
inscribe	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
bars	NULL
of	NULL
music	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
any	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
suitable	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
disliked	NULL
anything	NULL
singular	NULL
in	NULL
connection	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
tombstone	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XXXVII	NULL
If	NULL
Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL
well	NULL
pleased	NULL
when	NULL
Miss	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
first	NULL
took	NULL
Ernest	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
less	NULL
so	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
connection	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
was	NULL
interrupted	NULL
so	NULL
prematurely	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
said	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
sure	NULL
from	NULL
what	NULL
their	NULL
sister	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
Ernest	NULL
her	NULL
heir	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
them	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
hint	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
effect	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
indeed	NULL
gave	NULL
Ernest	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
which	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
given	NULL
shortly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
Theobald	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
himself	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
trifle	NULL
light	NULL
as	NULL
air	NULL
would	NULL
forthwith	NULL
assume	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
whatever	NULL
form	NULL
was	NULL
most	NULL
convenient	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
even	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
their	NULL
minds	NULL
what	NULL
Alethea	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
money	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
being	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
already	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
likely	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
heir	NULL
over	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
heads	NULL
without	NULL
their	NULL
having	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
a	NULL
life	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bequest	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
soon	NULL
thrown	NULL
obstacles	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
further	NULL
intimacy	NULL
between	NULL
aunt	NULL
and	NULL
nephew	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
bar	NULL
their	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
feeling	NULL
aggrieved	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
neither	NULL
they	NULL
nor	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
anything	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
profess	NULL
disappointment	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
boy	NULL
's	NULL
behalf	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL
proud	NULL
to	NULL
admit	NULL
upon	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
amiable	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
disappointed	NULL
under	NULL
these	NULL
circumstances	NULL
.	NULL

Christina	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
will	NULL
was	NULL
simply	NULL
fraudulent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
upset	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
Theobald	NULL
went	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
Lord	NULL
Chancellor	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
full	NULL
court	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
chambers	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
explain	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
matter	NULL
;	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
even	NULL
better	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
herself	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
dare	NULL
not	NULL
trust	NULL
myself	NULL
to	NULL
describe	NULL
the	NULL
reverie	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
this	NULL
last	NULL
idea	NULL
gave	NULL
rise	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
Theobald	NULL
died	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Lord	NULL
Chancellor	NULL
(	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
widower	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
earlier	NULL
)	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
an	NULL
offer	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
firmly	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
ungratefully	NULL
declined	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
continue	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL

at	NULL
this	NULL
point	NULL
the	NULL
cook	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL

saying	NULL
the	NULL
butcher	NULL
had	NULL
called	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
she	NULL
please	NULL
to	NULL
order	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
Theobald	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
bequest	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Christina	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
wronged	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
at	NULL
Alethea	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
mean	NULL
of	NULL
people	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
to	NULL
inflict	NULL
an	NULL
injury	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
sort	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
shirk	NULL

those	NULL
whom	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL

I	NULL

But	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doubtful	NULL

for	NULL
when	NULL
people	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
great	NULL

all	NULL

them	NULL

another	NULL
place	NULL

the	NULL
idea	NULL
never	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
entered	NULL
his	NULL

One	NULL

angry	NULL

avenge	NULL
himself	NULL

Theobald	NULL

long	NULL

her	NULL
illness	NULL
being	NULL
infectious	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
after	NULL
its	NULL
nature	NULL
was	NULL
known	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
myself	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
of	NULL
Theobald	NULL

nor	NULL
think	NULL
enough	NULL
about	NULL
my	NULL
godson	NULL
to	NULL
guess	NULL
what	NULL
might	NULL
easily	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
state	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
till	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
afterwards	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
letter	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pocket	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
portfolio	NULL
which	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
used	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
other	NULL
old	NULL
letters	NULL
and	NULL
school	NULL
documents	NULL
were	NULL
collected	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
used	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
book	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
begin	NULL
to	NULL
rise	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
rebellion	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
recognised	NULL
as	NULL
righteous	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
openly	NULL
avow	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
serious	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
feared	NULL
,	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
legacy	NULL
his	NULL
grandfather	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
only	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
mistake	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
keep	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
half	NULL
year	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
listless	NULL
and	NULL
unhappy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
schoolfellows	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
prone	NULL
to	NULL
idealise	NULL
everyone	NULL
into	NULL
being	NULL
his	NULL
superior	NULL
except	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
obviously	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
beneath	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
held	NULL
himself	NULL
much	NULL
too	NULL
cheap	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
without	NULL
that	NULL
physical	NULL
strength	NULL
and	NULL
vigour	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
coveted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
also	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
shirked	NULL
his	NULL
lessons	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
without	NULL
anything	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
deserve	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
quality	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
naturally	NULL
bad	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
for	NULL
whom	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
place	NULL
for	NULL
repentance	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
sought	NULL
it	NULL
even	NULL
with	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
shrank	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
whom	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
boyish	NULL
way	NULL
he	NULL
idolised	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
suspecting	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
capacities	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL
as	NULL
high	NULL
as	NULL
theirs	NULL
though	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
in	NULL
more	NULL
with	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
reputed	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
baser	NULL
sort	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
be	NULL
upon	NULL
equal	NULL
terms	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
half	NULL
year	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
dropped	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
estate	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
raised	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
's	NULL
stay	NULL
at	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
dejection	NULL
,	NULL
varied	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
bursts	NULL
of	NULL
conceit	NULL
rivalling	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
resumed	NULL
its	NULL
sway	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
hall	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
moral	NULL
landslip	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
escape	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
never	NULL
laugh	NULL
?	NULL

Do	NULL
you	NULL
always	NULL
look	NULL
so	NULL
preternaturally	NULL
grave	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
doctor	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
unkind	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
turned	NULL
crimson	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
escaped	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
place	NULL
only	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
church	NULL
of	NULL
St	NULL
Michael	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
friend	NULL
the	NULL
organist	NULL
was	NULL
practising	NULL
.	NULL

About	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
cheap	NULL
editions	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
oratorios	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
appear	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
got	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
published	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
sometimes	NULL
sell	NULL
a	NULL
school-book	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
second-hand	NULL
dealer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
buy	NULL
a	NULL
number	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Messiah	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Creation	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
or	NULL
"	NULL
Elijah	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
proceeds	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
simply	NULL
cheating	NULL
his	NULL
papa	NULL
and	NULL
mamma	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
falling	NULL
low	NULL
again	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
the	NULL
music	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Sallust	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
whatever	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
the	NULL
organist	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
his	NULL
keys	NULL
with	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
play	NULL
by	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
lock	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
organ	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
back	NULL
for	NULL
calling	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
other	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
his	NULL
friend	NULL
was	NULL
playing	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
wander	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
monuments	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
stained	NULL

both	NULL

at	NULL
once	NULL

Once	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
rector	NULL
got	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
watching	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
window	NULL

which	NULL
the	NULL
rector	NULL

--	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
supposed	NULL

Albert	NULL
Durer	NULL

He	NULL
questioned	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finding	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
music	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL

over	NULL

"	NULL

I	NULL
knew	NULL

when	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL

young	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

That	NULL
made	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Dr	NULL
Burney	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
at	NULL
Chester	NULL
,	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
break	NULL
bounds	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
watch	NULL
Handel	NULL
smoking	NULL
his	NULL
pipe	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Exchange	NULL

house	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
Handel	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
seen	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
were	NULL
oases	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
desert	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
rule	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
looked	NULL
thin	NULL
and	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
secret	NULL
which	NULL
depressed	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
blame	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
rose	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
higher	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
fell	NULL
ever	NULL
into	NULL
deeper	NULL
and	NULL
deeper	NULL
disgrace	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
masters	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
gain	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
opinion	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
boys	NULL
about	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
persuaded	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
assuredly	NULL
never	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
secret	NULL
weighing	NULL
upon	NULL
their	NULL
minds	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
Ernest	NULL
felt	NULL
so	NULL
keenly	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
care	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
who	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
idolised	NULL
some	NULL
who	NULL
kept	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
distance	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
pretty	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
boys	NULL
everywhere	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
things	NULL
reached	NULL
a	NULL
crisis	NULL
,	NULL
below	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
half	NULL
year	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
Ernest	NULL
brought	NULL
back	NULL
a	NULL
document	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
portmanteau	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Theobald	NULL
stigmatised	NULL
as	NULL
"	NULL
infamous	NULL
and	NULL
outrageous	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
need	NULL
hardly	NULL
say	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
alluding	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
school	NULL
bill	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
document	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
a	NULL
source	NULL
of	NULL
anxiety	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
into	NULL
with	NULL
scrupulous	NULL
care	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
cross-examined	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
sometimes	NULL
"	NULL
write	NULL
in	NULL
"	NULL
for	NULL
articles	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
education	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
portfolio	NULL

a	NULL

sell	NULL

out	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
money	NULL

probably	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
either	NULL
music	NULL

These	NULL
frauds	NULL
were	NULL
sometimes	NULL

Ernest	NULL
thought	NULL

in	NULL
imminent	NULL
danger	NULL

it	NULL

a	NULL
load	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
breast	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
cross-examination	NULL
was	NULL
safely	NULL
over	NULL

Theobald	NULL

about	NULL
the	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XXXVIII	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
in	NULL
disgrace	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
holidays	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
an	NULL
incident	NULL
soon	NULL
occurred	NULL
which	NULL
led	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
delinquencies	NULL
compared	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
previous	NULL
sins	NULL
were	NULL
venial	NULL
.	NULL

Among	NULL
the	NULL
servants	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Rectory	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
remarkably	NULL
pretty	NULL
girl	NULL
named	NULL
Ellen	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
Devonshire	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
daughter	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fisherman	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
drowned	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
mother	NULL
set	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
shop	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
where	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
living	NULL
.	NULL

Ellen	NULL
remained	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
fourteen	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
first	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
service	NULL
.	NULL

Four	NULL
years	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
eighteen	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
grown	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
passed	NULL
for	NULL
twenty	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
strongly	NULL
recommended	NULL
to	NULL
Christina	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
in	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
housemaid	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
about	NULL
twelve	NULL
months	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
remarkably	NULL
pretty	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
the	NULL
perfection	NULL
of	NULL
health	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
temper	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
serene	NULL
expression	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
which	NULL
captivated	NULL
almost	NULL
all	NULL
who	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
matters	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
gone	NULL
well	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
always	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
no	NULL
conceivable	NULL
combination	NULL
of	NULL
circumstances	NULL
could	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
long	NULL
together	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
temper	NULL
either	NULL
with	NULL
herself	NULL
or	NULL
with	NULL
anyone	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
complexion	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
high	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
grey	NULL
and	NULL
beautifully	NULL
shaped	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
were	NULL
full	NULL
and	NULL
restful	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
Egyptian	NULL
Sphinx-like	NULL
character	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
learned	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
Devonshire	NULL
I	NULL
fancied	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
strain	NULL
of	NULL
far	NULL
away	NULL
Egyptian	NULL
blood	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
not	NULL
what	NULL
foundation	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Egyptians	NULL
made	NULL
settlements	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
coast	NULL
of	NULL
Devonshire	NULL
and	NULL
Cornwall	NULL
long	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
Romans	NULL
conquered	NULL
Britain	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
rich	NULL
brown	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
figure	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
height	NULL
--	NULL
perfect	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
erring	NULL
if	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
robustness	NULL
.	NULL

Altogether	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
girls	NULL
about	NULL
whom	NULL
one	NULL
is	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
wonder	NULL
how	NULL
they	NULL
can	NULL
remain	NULL
unmarried	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
longer	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
face	NULL
(	NULL
as	NULL
indeed	NULL
faces	NULL
generally	NULL
are	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
I	NULL
grant	NULL
they	NULL
lie	NULL
sometimes	NULL
)	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fair	NULL
index	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
disposition	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
good	NULL
nature	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
everyone	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
excluding	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
even	NULL
Theobald	NULL
himself	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Christina	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
warmest	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
twice	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
prepare	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
confirmation	NULL
(	NULL
for	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
accident	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
confirmed	NULL
)	NULL
by	NULL
explaining	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
geography	NULL
of	NULL
Palestine	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
routes	NULL
taken	NULL
by	NULL
St	NULL
Paul	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
various	NULL
journeys	NULL
in	NULL
Asia	NULL
Minor	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Bishop	NULL
Treadwell	NULL
did	NULL
actually	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Battersby	NULL
and	NULL
hold	NULL
a	NULL
confirmation	NULL
there	NULL
(	NULL
Christina	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
wish	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
slept	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
grand	NULL
dinner	NULL
party	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
him	NULL
"	NULL
My	NULL
lord	NULL
"	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
struck	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
pretty	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
modest	NULL
demeanour	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
laid	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
Christina	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
replied	NULL
that	NULL
Ellen	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
servants	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
bishop	NULL
seemed	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
or	NULL
chose	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
pleased	NULL
that	NULL
so	NULL
pretty	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
found	NULL
so	NULL
exceptionally	NULL
good	NULL
a	NULL
situation	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
early	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
holidays	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
play	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
before	NULL
breakfast	NULL
without	NULL
disturbing	NULL
his	NULL
papa	NULL
and	NULL
mamma	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
being	NULL
disturbed	NULL
by	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Ellen	NULL
would	NULL
generally	NULL
be	NULL
there	NULL
sweeping	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
floor	NULL
and	NULL
dusting	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
playing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
friends	NULL
with	NULL
most	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
soon	NULL
became	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
rule	NULL
sensitive	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
charms	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fair	NULL
sex	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
hardly	NULL
been	NULL
thrown	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
any	NULL
women	NULL
except	NULL
his	NULL
Aunts	NULL
Allaby	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Alethea	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jay	NULL
;	NULL
sometimes	NULL
also	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Miss	NULL
Skinners	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
sink	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
on	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
shyness	NULL
had	NULL
worn	NULL
off	NULL
with	NULL
Ellen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
fast	NULL
friends	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
for	NULL
very	NULL
long	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
his	NULL
affection	NULL
though	NULL
hearty	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
Platonic	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
innocent	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
deplorably	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
even	NULL
say	NULL
guiltily	NULL
--	NULL
innocent	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
preference	NULL
was	NULL
based	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
Ellen	NULL
never	NULL
scolded	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
smiling	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
tempered	NULL
;	NULL
besides	NULL
she	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
him	NULL
play	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
additional	NULL
zest	NULL
in	NULL
playing	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
morning	NULL
access	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
was	NULL
indeed	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
distinct	NULL
advantage	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
holidays	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
piano	NULL
except	NULL
quasi	NULL
-	NULL
surreptitiously	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pearsall	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
music-seller	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
returning	NULL
this	NULL
midsummer	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
shocked	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
his	NULL
favourite	NULL
looking	NULL
pale	NULL
and	NULL
ill	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
her	NULL
good	NULL
spirits	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
roses	NULL
had	NULL
fled	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
cheek	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
decline	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
unhappy	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
health	NULL
was	NULL
failing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
herself	NULL
not	NULL
long	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

Christina	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
noticed	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
often	NULL
remarked	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
those	NULL
very	NULL
fresh-coloured	NULL
,	NULL
healthy-looking	NULL
girls	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
to	NULL
break	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
calomel	NULL
and	NULL
James	NULL
's	NULL
powders	NULL
repeatedly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
show	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
Dr	NULL
Martin	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
next	NULL
comes	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Very	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Theobald	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
next	NULL
time	NULL
Dr	NULL
Martin	NULL
came	NULL
Ellen	NULL
was	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

Dr	NULL
Martin	NULL
soon	NULL
discovered	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
apparent	NULL
to	NULL
Christina	NULL
herself	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
conceive	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
ailment	NULL
in	NULL
connection	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
servant	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
roof	NULL
as	NULL
Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
herself	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
purity	NULL
of	NULL
whose	NULL
married	NULL
life	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
preserved	NULL
all	NULL
unmarried	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
came	NULL
near	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
any	NULL
taint	NULL
of	NULL
mischief	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
months	NULL
more	NULL
Ellen	NULL
would	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
Christina	NULL
's	NULL
natural	NULL
good	NULL
nature	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
prompted	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
deal	NULL
as	NULL
leniently	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
panic-stricken	NULL
lest	NULL
any	NULL
mercy	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
part	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
construed	NULL
into	NULL
toleration	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
partial	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
so	NULL
great	NULL
a	NULL
sin	NULL
;	NULL
hereon	NULL
she	NULL
dashed	NULL
off	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
Ellen	NULL
her	NULL
wages	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pack	NULL
her	NULL
off	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
instant	NULL
bag	NULL
and	NULL
baggage	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
which	NULL
purity	NULL
had	NULL
more	NULL
especially	NULL
and	NULL
particularly	NULL
singled	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL
abiding	NULL
city	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fearful	NULL
contamination	NULL
which	NULL
Ellen	NULL
's	NULL
continued	NULL
presence	NULL
even	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
would	NULL
occasion	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
hesitate	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
--	NULL
horrid	NULL
thought	NULL
!	NULL

--	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
partner	NULL
of	NULL
Ellen	NULL
's	NULL
guilt	NULL
?	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
darling	NULL
Ernest	NULL
?	NULL

Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
a	NULL
big	NULL
boy	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
excuse	NULL
any	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
for	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
fancy	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
behind	NULL
no	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
age	NULL
in	NULL
appreciation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
charms	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
nice-looking	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
innocent	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mind	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
oh	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
guilty	NULL
!	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
mere	NULL
cowardice	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
--	NULL
her	NULL
hope	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Lord	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
cheerfully	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
suffering	NULL
He	NULL
might	NULL
think	NULL
fit	NULL
to	NULL
lay	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
either	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
or	NULL
girl	NULL
--	NULL
this	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
less	NULL
clear	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
resemble	NULL
Theobald	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Resemblance	NULL
,	NULL
whether	NULL
of	NULL
body	NULL
or	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
generally	NULL
leaped	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
generation	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
guilt	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
parents	NULL
must	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
shared	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
innocent	NULL
offspring	NULL
of	NULL
shame	NULL
--	NULL
oh	NULL
!	NULL

no	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
. . .	NULL
She	NULL
was	NULL
off	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
reveries	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
child	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
act	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
consecrated	NULL
Archbishop	NULL
of	NULL
Canterbury	NULL
when	NULL
Theobald	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
visit	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
parish	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
told	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shocking	NULL
discovery	NULL
.	NULL

Christina	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
half	NULL
angry	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
blame	NULL
was	NULL
laid	NULL
upon	NULL
other	NULL
shoulders	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
easily	NULL
consoled	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
back	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
double	NULL
reflection	NULL
,	NULL
firstly	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
son	NULL
was	NULL
pure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
secondly	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
sure	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
religious	NULL
convictions	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
held	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
agreed	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
time	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
lost	NULL
in	NULL
paying	NULL
Ellen	NULL
her	NULL
wages	NULL
and	NULL
packing	NULL
her	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
two	NULL
hours	NULL
after	NULL
Dr	NULL
Martin	NULL
had	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
Ellen	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
beside	NULL
John	NULL
the	NULL
coachman	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
muffled	NULL
up	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
,	NULL
weeping	NULL
bitterly	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
driven	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
.	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XXXIX	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
out	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
yard	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Rectory	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
spinney	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
Ellen	NULL
's	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
being	NULL
put	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Ellen	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
then	NULL
saw	NULL
get	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
hidden	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
plainly	NULL
who	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dismissed	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
as	NULL
improbable	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
back-kitchen	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
cook	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
peeling	NULL
the	NULL
potatoes	NULL
for	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
crying	NULL
bitterly	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
distressed	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
the	NULL
cook	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
gone	NULL
off	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pony	NULL
carriage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
why	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
cook	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Ellen	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
earthly	NULL
power	NULL
should	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
cross	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
why	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
away	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
Ernest	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
_	NULL
au	NULL
pied	NULL
de	NULL
la	NULL
lettre	NULL
_	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
questions	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
after	NULL
extorting	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
solemn	NULL
promises	NULL
of	NULL
secrecy	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
took	NULL
Ernest	NULL
some	NULL
minutes	NULL
to	NULL
arrive	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
understood	NULL
them	NULL
he	NULL
leaned	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
pump	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
stood	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
-	NULL
kitchen	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
mingled	NULL
his	NULL
tears	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
cook	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
his	NULL
blood	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
boil	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
much	NULL
otherwise	NULL
than	NULL
they	NULL
actually	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
might	NULL
perhaps	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
less	NULL
precipitate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
quiet	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
easy	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
would	NULL
it	NULL
have	NULL
mended	NULL
things	NULL
very	NULL
materially	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bitter	NULL
fact	NULL
remains	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
does	NULL
certain	NULL
things	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
do	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
peril	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
matter	NULL
how	NULL
young	NULL
and	NULL
pretty	NULL
she	NULL
is	NULL
nor	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
temptation	NULL
she	NULL
has	NULL
succumbed	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
there	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
no	NULL
help	NULL
found	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
gathered	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
cook	NULL
,	NULL
namely	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
favourite	NULL
,	NULL
Ellen	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
turned	NULL
adrift	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
pounds	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
pocket	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
where	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
what	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
hang	NULL
or	NULL
drown	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
implicitly	NULL
believed	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
greater	NULL
promptitude	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
shown	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
reckoned	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
two	NULL
shillings	NULL
and	NULL
threepence	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
command	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
knife	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
sell	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
shilling	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
silver	NULL
watch	NULL
his	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Alethea	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
shortly	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
died	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
carriage	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
gone	NULL
now	NULL
a	NULL
full	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
some	NULL
distance	NULL
ahead	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
his	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
short	NULL
cuts	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
perhaps	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
off	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL
just	NULL
past	NULL
the	NULL
Rectory	NULL
paddock	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
very	NULL
small	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
road	NULL
which	NULL
showed	NULL
perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
popular	NULL
amusements	NULL
at	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
institution	NULL
called	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
hounds	NULL

--	NULL
more	NULL
commonly	NULL
known	NULL
elsewhere	NULL
as	NULL
"	NULL
hare	NULL
and	NULL
hounds	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
case	NULL
the	NULL
hare	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
boys	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
called	NULL
foxes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
boys	NULL
are	NULL
so	NULL
particular	NULL
about	NULL
correctness	NULL
of	NULL
nomenclature	NULL

;	NULL
these	NULL
were	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
hounds	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
muscular	NULL
strength	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
here	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
jostling	NULL
up	NULL
against	NULL
boys	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
neither	NULL
older	NULL
nor	NULL
taller	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
yet	NULL
more	NULL
robustly	NULL
built	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
mere	NULL
endurance	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
good	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
carpentering	NULL
was	NULL
stopped	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
naturally	NULL
taken	NULL
to	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
hounds	NULL
"	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
favourite	NULL
amusement	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
lungs	NULL
thus	NULL
exercised	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
developed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
run	NULL
of	NULL
six	NULL
or	NULL
seven	NULL
miles	NULL
across	NULL
country	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
despair	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
help	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
short	NULL
cuts	NULL
of	NULL
overtaking	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
of	NULL
catching	NULL
Ellen	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
left	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
ran	NULL
and	NULL
ran	NULL
and	NULL
ran	NULL
till	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
wind	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
second	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
breathe	NULL
more	NULL
easily	NULL
.	NULL

Never	NULL
with	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
hounds	NULL
"	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
run	NULL
so	NULL
fast	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
so	NULL
few	NULL
breaks	NULL
as	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
efforts	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
help	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
short	NULL
cuts	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
catch	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
John	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
running	NULL
and	NULL
making	NULL
signs	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
to	NULL
stop	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
about	NULL
five	NULL
miles	NULL
from	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
done	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
crimson	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
exertion	NULL
;	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
dust	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
trousers	NULL
and	NULL
coat	NULL
sleeves	NULL
a	NULL
trifle	NULL
short	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
cut	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
figure	NULL
enough	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thrust	NULL
on	NULL
Ellen	NULL
his	NULL
watch	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
knife	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
money	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
he	NULL
implored	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
those	NULL
dreadful	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
threatened	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
sake	NULL
if	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
reason	NULL
.	NULL

Ellen	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
hear	NULL
of	NULL
taking	NULL
anything	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
coachman	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
north	NULL
country	NULL
,	NULL
sided	NULL
with	NULL
Ernest	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Take	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
lass	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
kindly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
take	NULL
what	NULL
thou	NULL
canst	NULL

Ernest	NULL
here	NULL

he	NULL

therefore	NULL

him	NULL
give	NULL
thee	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL

"	NULL

Ellen	NULL
did	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
told	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
parted	NULL
with	NULL
many	NULL
tears	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
last	NULL
words	NULL
being	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
never	NULL
forget	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
meet	NULL
again	NULL
hereafter	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
repay	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Ernest	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
field	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
roadside	NULL
,	NULL
flung	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hedge	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
should	NULL
pass	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL
return	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
and	NULL
pick	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
beat	NULL
.	NULL

Thoughts	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
force	NULL
now	NULL
came	NULL
more	NULL
strongly	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
one	NULL
mess	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
into	NULL
half-a-dozen	NULL
messes	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
place	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
late	NULL
for	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
offences	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
mercy	NULL
.	NULL

Also	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
danger	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
only	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
sooner	NULL
or	NULL
later	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
possessed	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
watch	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
dear	NULL
aunt	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL

pray	NULL

had	NULL
he	NULL
done	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
how	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
lost	NULL
it	NULL

The	NULL
reader	NULL
will	NULL
know	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
straight	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
questioned	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
fancy	NULL
the	NULL
consternation	NULL
which	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
announcement	NULL

the	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
instinct	NULL

him	NULL

who	NULL

it	NULL

carefully	NULL

it	NULL

it	NULL
can	NULL

dispensed	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
simplest	NULL
course	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
the	NULL
watch	NULL

and	NULL
was	NULL
late	NULL
for	NULL
dinner	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
looking	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
walk	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
the	NULL
line	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
fields	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
actually	NULL
taken	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
being	NULL
very	NULL
hot	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
coat	NULL
and	NULL
waistcoat	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
carrying	NULL
them	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
his	NULL
watch	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
knife	NULL
had	NULL
dropped	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
nearly	NULL
home	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
loss	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
run	NULL
back	NULL
as	NULL
fast	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
line	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
followed	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
;	NULL
seeing	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
coming	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
let	NULL
it	NULL
pick	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
bring	NULL
him	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
covered	NULL
everything	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
running	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
still	NULL
showed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
running	NULL
hard	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
question	NULL
was	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
seen	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
Rectory	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL

the	NULL

for	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
hours	NULL

so	NULL
before	NULL
Ellen	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL

and	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
happy	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL

not	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL

for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
out	NULL
except	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
'	NULL
interview	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
cook	NULL

His	NULL
father	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
parish	NULL

his	NULL
mother	NULL
had	NULL
certainly	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
across	NULL
him	NULL

his	NULL
brother	NULL

sister	NULL
had	NULL
also	NULL
been	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
depend	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
cook	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
servants	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
coachman	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL

this	NULL
;	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
coachman	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XL	NULL
When	NULL
Ernest	NULL
got	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
sneaked	NULL
in	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
angriest	NULL
tones	NULL
,	NULL
inquiring	NULL
whether	NULL
Master	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
returned	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
Jack	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
Jack	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Bean	NULL
Stalk	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
oven	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
hidden	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
ogre	NULL
ask	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
what	NULL
young	NULL
children	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
supper	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
much	NULL
courage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
event	NULL
proved	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
not	NULL
less	NULL
courage	NULL
than	NULL
discretion	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
bull	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
horns	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
announced	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
as	NULL
having	NULL
just	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
after	NULL
having	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
terrible	NULL
misfortune	NULL
.	NULL

Little	NULL
by	NULL
little	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
his	NULL
story	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
Theobald	NULL
stormed	NULL
somewhat	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
"	NULL
incredible	NULL
folly	NULL
and	NULL
carelessness	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
off	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
expected	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL
had	NULL
indeed	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
been	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
connect	NULL
his	NULL
absence	NULL
from	NULL
dinner	NULL
with	NULL
Ellen	NULL
's	NULL
dismissal	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
on	NULL
finding	NULL
it	NULL
clear	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Theobald	NULL
said	NULL
--	NULL
everything	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
clear	NULL
with	NULL
Theobald	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
therefore	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
acquitted	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
account	NULL
for	NULL
once	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
stain	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
character	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
temper	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
stocks	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
rising	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
this	NULL
or	NULL
twenty	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
whatever	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
scold	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
look	NULL
exhausted	NULL
and	NULL
believing	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
much	NULL
grieved	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
watch	NULL
,	NULL
Theobald	NULL
actually	NULL
prescribed	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL
of	NULL
wine	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
strange	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
choke	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
see	NULL
things	NULL
more	NULL
cheerfully	NULL
than	NULL
was	NULL
usual	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
night	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
his	NULL
prayers	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
inserted	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
paragraphs	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
discovered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
things	NULL
might	NULL
go	NULL
well	NULL
with	NULL
Ellen	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
anxious	NULL
and	NULL
ill	NULL
at	NULL
ease	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
guilty	NULL
conscience	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
score	NULL
of	NULL
weak	NULL
places	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
story	NULL
,	NULL
through	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
detection	NULL
might	NULL
even	NULL
yet	NULL
easily	NULL
enter	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
days	NULL
afterwards	NULL
he	NULL
fled	NULL
when	NULL
no	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
pursuing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
trembled	NULL
each	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
calling	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
causes	NULL
of	NULL
anxiety	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
stand	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
endeavours	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
cheerful	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
was	NULL
preying	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
son	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
innocent	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Ellen	NULL
matter	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
interesting	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
as	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
pale-faced	NULL
,	NULL
heavy-eyed	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
kindest	NULL
manner	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
sit	NULL
down	NULL
by	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
will	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
quiet	NULL
confidential	NULL
talk	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
will	NULL
we	NULL
not	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
went	NULL
mechanically	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
.	NULL

Whenever	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
wanted	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
confidential	NULL
talk	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
she	NULL
always	NULL
selected	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
suitable	NULL
ground	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
open	NULL
her	NULL
campaign	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
mothers	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
fathers	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
case	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
was	NULL
particularly	NULL
well	NULL
adapted	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
strategic	NULL
purpose	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
an	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
one	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
high	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
mattress	NULL
,	NULL
bolsters	NULL
and	NULL
cushions	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
safely	NULL
penned	NULL
into	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
deep	NULL
corners	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
dentist	NULL
's	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
too	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
again	NULL

Here	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
pull	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
this	NULL
should	NULL
seem	NULL
desirable	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
fit	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
bury	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
cushion	NULL
and	NULL
abandon	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
agony	NULL
of	NULL
grief	NULL
which	NULL
seldom	NULL
failed	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
effect	NULL

None	NULL

so	NULL
easily	NULL
adopted	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
usual	NULL
seat	NULL

the	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL

the	NULL

so	NULL
well	NULL

her	NULL

from	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL

that	NULL
this	NULL

going	NULL

he	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
place	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
lamb	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
and	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
reach	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

his	NULL

taking	NULL

she	NULL

him	NULL

Ernest	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
stand	NULL
being	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
:	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
still	NULL
believed	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
point	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
tether	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
played	NULL
the	NULL

him	NULL
times	NULL
without	NULL

Over	NULL

over	NULL
again	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
wheedled	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL

and	NULL
afterwards	NULL
got	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
horrible	NULL
scrape	NULL
by	NULL
telling	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
to	NULL
Theobald	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
remonstrated	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
upon	NULL
these	NULL
occasions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
how	NULL
disastrous	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
confidences	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Christina	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
joined	NULL
issue	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
showed	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
clearest	NULL
possible	NULL
manner	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
each	NULL
case	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
reasonably	NULL
complain	NULL
.	NULL

Generally	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
conscience	NULL
that	NULL
forbade	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
against	NULL
this	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
appeal	NULL

for	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
all	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
the	NULL
dictates	NULL

our	NULL
conscience	NULL

Ernest	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
recite	NULL
a	NULL
hymn	NULL
about	NULL
conscience	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
pay	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
voice	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
soon	NULL

"	NULL

When	NULL
a	NULL

once	NULL

disrespectfully	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL

it	NULL
is	NULL
practically	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
between	NULL
him	NULL

her	NULL

Ernest	NULL
through	NULL
sheer	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
habit	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL

and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
return	NULL

the	NULL

ideas	NULL

was	NULL
still	NULL
so	NULL
moved	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
siren	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
yearn	NULL
to	NULL
sail	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
fling	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
other	NULL
associated	NULL
ideas	NULL
that	NULL
returned	NULL
also	NULL

the	NULL

bones	NULL
of	NULL
too	NULL
many	NULL

were	NULL
lying	NULL
whitening	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
hung	NULL

looked	NULL
sheepish	NULL

kept	NULL

he	NULL
held	NULL

I	NULL

more	NULL

rather	NULL

turned	NULL

off	NULL

But	NULL
Ernest	NULL
cut	NULL
this	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
short	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
shorter	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
if	NULL
Christina	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
say	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
extricating	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
mamma	NULL
's	NULL
embrace	NULL
and	NULL
showing	NULL
a	NULL
clean	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
heels	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
purlieus	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
(	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
at	NULL
ease	NULL
)	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
calling	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
his	NULL
guilty	NULL
conscience	NULL
rose	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
has	NULL
found	NULL
all	NULL
out	NULL
now	NULL

"	NULL
it	NULL
cried	NULL

he	NULL

going	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
only	NULL
wanted	NULL
the	NULL
key	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cellaret	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Ernest	NULL
slunk	NULL
off	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
coppice	NULL
or	NULL
spinney	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
Rectory	NULL
paddock	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
consoled	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pipe	NULL
of	NULL
tobacco	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wood	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
sun	NULL
streaming	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
pipe	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
forgot	NULL
his	NULL
cares	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
interval	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
rest	NULL
without	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
verily	NULL
believe	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
insupportable	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
lost	NULL
property	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
reward	NULL
was	NULL
offered	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
wandered	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
path	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
lark	NULL
's	NULL
nest	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looking	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
watch	NULL
and	NULL
purse	NULL
on	NULL
Battersby	NULL
piewipes	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
like	NULL
looking	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
needle	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
bundle	NULL
of	NULL
hay	NULL
:	NULL
besides	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
found	NULL
and	NULL
taken	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
tramp	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
magpie	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
many	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
or	NULL
ten	NULL
days	NULL
the	NULL
search	NULL
was	NULL
discontinued	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
fact	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
faced	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
another	NULL
watch	NULL
,	NULL
another	NULL
knife	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
sum	NULL
of	NULL
pocket	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
should	NULL
pay	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
cost	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
watch	NULL
;	NULL
this	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
easy	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
deducted	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
money	NULL
in	NULL
half-yearly	NULL
instalments	NULL
extending	NULL
over	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
own	NULL
interests	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
well	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
watch	NULL
should	NULL
cost	NULL
as	NULL
little	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
a	NULL
second-hand	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
bought	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
laid	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
plate	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
surprise	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
holidays	NULL
were	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL
town	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
then	NULL
find	NULL
some	NULL
second-hand	NULL
watch	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
answer	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
Theobald	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
furnished	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
list	NULL
of	NULL
household	NULL
commissions	NULL
,	NULL
among	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
purchase	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
watch	NULL
for	NULL
Ernest	NULL
.	NULL

Those	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
always	NULL
happy	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
away	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
whole	NULL
day	NULL
certain	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
easy	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
God	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
his	NULL
prayers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Altogether	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
had	NULL
proved	NULL
an	NULL
unusually	NULL
tranquil	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
alas	NULL
!	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
close	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
fickle	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
lived	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
more	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
breed	NULL
a	NULL
storm	NULL
than	NULL
after	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
interval	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XLI	NULL
Long	NULL
before	NULL
Ernest	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
his	NULL
ill-divining	NULL
soul	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
sin	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL

of	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
ever	NULL
sends	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
members	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
intentions	NULL
are	NULL
honourable	NULL
?	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
reached	NULL
it	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
empty	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
called	NULL
away	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
unexpectedly	NULL
upon	NULL
some	NULL
parish	NULL
business	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
suspense	NULL
as	NULL
people	NULL
are	NULL
in	NULL
after	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
ushered	NULL
into	NULL
their	NULL
dentist	NULL
's	NULL
ante-room	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
worst	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
here	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
his	NULL
Latin	NULL
and	NULL
Greek	NULL
lessons	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
smell	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
particular	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
polish	NULL
or	NULL
varnish	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
used	NULL
in	NULL
polishing	NULL
the	NULL
furniture	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
neither	NULL
I	NULL
nor	NULL
Ernest	NULL
can	NULL
even	NULL
now	NULL
come	NULL
within	NULL
range	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
smell	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
varnish	NULL
without	NULL
our	NULL
hearts	NULL
failing	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

Over	NULL
the	NULL
chimney-piece	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
veritable	NULL
old	NULL
master	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
original	NULL
pictures	NULL
which	NULL
Mr	NULL
George	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
from	NULL
Italy	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
Salvator	NULL
Rosa	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
bought	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
bargain	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
subject	NULL
was	NULL
Elijah	NULL
or	NULL
Elisha	NULL
(	NULL
whichever	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
)	NULL
being	NULL
fed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
ravens	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
ravens	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
upper	NULL
right	NULL
-	NULL
hand	NULL
corner	NULL
with	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
meat	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
beaks	NULL
and	NULL
claws	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
prophet	NULL
in	NULL
question	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
left-hand	NULL
corner	NULL
looking	NULL
longingly	NULL
up	NULL
towards	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
small	NULL
boy	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
constant	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
regret	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
food	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
ravens	NULL
carried	NULL
never	NULL
actually	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
prophet	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
the	NULL
limitation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
painter	NULL
's	NULL
art	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wanted	NULL
the	NULL
meat	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
prophet	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
brought	NULL
into	NULL
direct	NULL
contact	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
help	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
steps	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
left	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
clambered	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
picture	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
traced	NULL
a	NULL
greasy	NULL
line	NULL
right	NULL
across	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
ravens	NULL
to	NULL
Elisha	NULL
's	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
more	NULL
comfortable	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
drifting	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
youthful	NULL
escapade	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL

and	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
second	NULL
Theobald	NULL

Theobald	NULL

I	NULL

several	NULL

I	NULL

what	NULL

condone	NULL
all	NULL

one	NULL
of	NULL

own	NULL

Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
bravest	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL

could	NULL
easily	NULL
have	NULL
collared	NULL
the	NULL
wretch	NULL

turned	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL

how	NULL
far	NULL
more	NULL
dignified	NULL

how	NULL
far	NULL
nobler	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL

How	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
novel	NULL

upon	NULL
the	NULL
stage	NULL

for	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
stage	NULL

a	NULL

immoral	NULL

yet	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
doubtless	NULL
some	NULL
plays	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
improving	NULL
spectacles	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
fancy	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
house	NULL
hushed	NULL
with	NULL
excitement	NULL
at	NULL
hearing	NULL
John	NULL
's	NULL

hardly	NULL
breathing	NULL
by	NULL
reason	NULL

their	NULL
interest	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
actor	NULL

it	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL

it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
buzzed	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL

Ernest	NULL
the	NULL

already	NULL

deepened	NULL

she	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL

At	NULL
present	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
strong	NULL
position	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
official	NULL
purity	NULL
was	NULL
firmly	NULL
established	NULL

but	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

time	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
shown	NULL
himself	NULL
so	NULL
susceptible	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
fuse	NULL
two	NULL
contradictory	NULL
impressions	NULL
concerning	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
idea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
consider	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
Joseph	NULL

Don	NULL
Juan	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
wanted	NULL

her	NULL
vanity	NULL

possession	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL

the	NULL
son	NULL
himself	NULL

naught	NULL

No	NULL

if	NULL
John	NULL

Ernest	NULL

to	NULL

inflicted	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL

Theobald	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XLII	NULL
About	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
school	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
again	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
restore	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
watch	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
deduct	NULL
the	NULL
sum	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
paid	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
shillings	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
dispute	NULL
the	NULL
ownership	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
watch	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
undoubtedly	NULL
given	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Ellen	NULL
--	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
payments	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
extend	NULL
over	NULL
two	NULL
half	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
therefore	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
this	NULL
half	NULL
year	NULL
with	NULL
only	NULL
five	NULL
shillings	NULL
'	NULL
pocket	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
more	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
earn	NULL
more	NULL
merit	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
careful	NULL
about	NULL
money	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
pattern	NULL
boy	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Now	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
sovereign	NULL
which	NULL
must	NULL
last	NULL
me	NULL
fifteen	NULL
weeks	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
spend	NULL
exactly	NULL
one	NULL
shilling	NULL
and	NULL
fourpence	NULL
in	NULL
each	NULL
week	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
spend	NULL
exactly	NULL
one	NULL
and	NULL
fourpence	NULL
in	NULL
each	NULL
week	NULL
accordingly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
ran	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
at	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
rate	NULL
as	NULL
other	NULL
boys	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
pretty	NULL
well	NULL
cleaned	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
into	NULL
debt	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
in	NULL
debt	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
repaying	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
without	NULL
luxuries	NULL
.	NULL

Immediately	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
any	NULL
money	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
pay	NULL
his	NULL
debts	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
any	NULL
over	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
spend	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
seldom	NULL
was	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
begin	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
tick	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
finance	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
based	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
supposition	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
school	NULL
with	NULL
1	NULL
pound	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
owed	NULL
say	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
fifteen	NULL
shillings	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
five	NULL
shillings	NULL
for	NULL
sundry	NULL
school	NULL
subscriptions	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
these	NULL
were	NULL
paid	NULL
the	NULL
weekly	NULL
allowance	NULL
of	NULL
sixpence	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
boy	NULL
in	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
merit	NULL
money	NULL
(	NULL
which	NULL
this	NULL
half	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
resolved	NULL
should	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
sum	NULL
)	NULL
and	NULL
renewed	NULL
credit	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
carry	NULL
him	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
half	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sudden	NULL
failure	NULL
of	NULL
15	NULL
/	NULL
-	NULL
was	NULL
disastrous	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL
's	NULL
scheme	NULL
of	NULL
finance	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
face	NULL
betrayed	NULL
his	NULL
emotions	NULL
so	NULL
clearly	NULL
that	NULL
Theobald	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
"	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
_	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
_	NULL
without	NULL
days	NULL
and	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
falsehood	NULL
"	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
reached	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
melancholy	NULL
fact	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
long	NULL
in	NULL
coming	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
namely	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
wretched	NULL
Ernest	NULL
added	NULL
debt	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
vices	NULL
of	NULL
idleness	NULL
,	NULL
falsehood	NULL
and	NULL
possibly	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
impossible	NULL
--	NULL
immorality	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
into	NULL
debt	NULL
?	NULL

Did	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
boys	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
?	NULL

Ernest	NULL
reluctantly	NULL
admitted	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
what	NULL
shops	NULL
did	NULL
they	NULL
get	NULL
into	NULL
debt	NULL
?	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
asking	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
Ernest	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
!	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
soon	NULL

second	NULL

the	NULL
forbearance	NULL

tenderest-hearted	NULL

before	NULL

him	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
fine	NULL

what	NULL
was	NULL
Ernest	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL

No	NULL

Ernest	NULL

he	NULL

not	NULL

he	NULL

He	NULL

the	NULL

Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
resolved	NULL
that	NULL

should	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
it	NULL

take	NULL
him	NULL

without	NULL

so	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL

which	NULL
went	NULL
with	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
's	NULL
half-yearly	NULL
bills	NULL
was	NULL
brought	NULL
out	NULL

the	NULL
most	NULL
secret	NULL
character	NULL

was	NULL
gone	NULL
through	NULL
_	NULL
seriatim	NULL
_	NULL
by	NULL
Mr	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
power	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
information	NULL
concerning	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
preceding	NULL
Sunday	NULL
preached	NULL
a	NULL
less	NULL
feeble	NULL
sermon	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
commonly	NULL
preached	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
horrors	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Inquisition	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
matter	NULL
how	NULL
awful	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
depravity	NULL
revealed	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
never	NULL
flinched	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
probed	NULL
and	NULL
probed	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
reaching	NULL
subjects	NULL
more	NULL
delicate	NULL
than	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
yet	NULL
touched	NULL
upon	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
unconscious	NULL
self	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
resistance	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
conscious	NULL
self	NULL
was	NULL
unequal	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
tumbling	NULL
him	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fit	NULL
of	NULL
fainting	NULL
.	NULL

Dr	NULL
Martin	NULL
was	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL
and	NULL
pronounced	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
seriously	NULL
unwell	NULL
;	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
prescribed	NULL
absolute	NULL
rest	NULL
and	NULL
absence	NULL
from	NULL
nervous	NULL
excitement	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
the	NULL
anxious	NULL
parents	NULL
were	NULL
unwillingly	NULL
compelled	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
content	NULL
with	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
already	NULL
--	NULL
being	NULL
frightened	NULL
into	NULL
leading	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
life	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
short	NULL
remainder	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
holidays	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
idle	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Satan	NULL
can	NULL
find	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
mischief	NULL
for	NULL
busy	NULL
hands	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
idle	NULL
ones	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
sent	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
job	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
Battersby	NULL
which	NULL
Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL
undertook	NULL
immediately	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
pity	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
reasoned	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
should	NULL
leave	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
there	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
another	NULL
school	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
and	NULL
Theobald	NULL
were	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
old	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
to	NULL
offend	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
these	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
valid	NULL
reasons	NULL
for	NULL
not	NULL
removing	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
proper	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
warn	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
confidentially	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
furnish	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
school	NULL
list	NULL
annotated	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
remarks	NULL
extracted	NULL
from	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
appended	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
perfection	NULL
of	NULL
neatness	NULL
;	NULL
while	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
was	NULL
ill	NULL
upstairs	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
copied	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
list	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
throw	NULL
his	NULL
comments	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
tabular	NULL
form	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
assumed	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
shape	NULL
--	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
changed	NULL

names	NULL

justice	NULL

Ernest	NULL

Dr	NULL

would	NULL
be	NULL
bound	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XLIII	NULL
So	NULL
important	NULL
did	NULL
Theobald	NULL
consider	NULL
this	NULL
matter	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
special	NULL
journey	NULL
to	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
half	NULL
year	NULL
began	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
relief	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
though	NULL
his	NULL
destination	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
mentioned	NULL
,	NULL
Ernest	NULL
guessed	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
this	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
considers	NULL
his	NULL
conduct	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
crisis	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
serious	NULL
laches	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
--	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
can	NULL
never	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
without	NULL
shame	NULL
and	NULL
indignation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
says	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
run	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
what	NULL
good	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
caught	NULL
,	NULL
brought	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
examined	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
earlier	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
boy	NULL
of	NULL
barely	NULL
sixteen	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
stand	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
moral	NULL
pressure	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
always	NULL
oppressed	NULL
him	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
can	NULL
cope	NULL
physically	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
powerful	NULL
full-grown	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

True	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
may	NULL
allow	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
killed	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
yield	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
being	NULL
so	NULL
morbidly	NULL
heroic	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
close	NULL
round	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
cowardice	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
little	NULL
else	NULL
than	NULL
suicide	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
universally	NULL
condemned	NULL
as	NULL
cowardly	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
re-assembling	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
it	NULL
became	NULL
apparent	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
wrong	NULL
.	NULL

Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
much	NULL
pomp	NULL
excommunicated	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Cross	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jones	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
declaring	NULL
their	NULL
shops	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
bounds	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
street	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Swan	NULL
and	NULL
Bottle	NULL
"	NULL
stood	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
forbidden	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
vices	NULL
of	NULL
drinking	NULL
and	NULL
smoking	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
clearly	NULL
aimed	NULL
at	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
before	NULL
prayers	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
spoke	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
impressive	NULL
words	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
abominable	NULL
sin	NULL
of	NULL
using	NULL
bad	NULL
language	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
feelings	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
imagined	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
daily	NULL
punishments	NULL
were	NULL
read	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
been	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
offended	NULL

Ernest	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
was	NULL

hemmed	NULL

it	NULL

hardly	NULL
possible	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL

This	NULL
unparalleled	NULL
list	NULL
of	NULL
punishments	NULL
inflicted	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
half	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
intended	NULL

the	NULL
ensuing	NULL
Christmas	NULL
holidays	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
connected	NULL
with	NULL
any	NULL
specified	NULL
offence	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
required	NULL
no	NULL
great	NULL
penetration	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
to	NULL
connect	NULL
Ernest	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
putting	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Cross	NULL
's	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jones	NULL
's	NULL

Great	NULL
indeed	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
indignation	NULL
about	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Cross	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
known	NULL
,	NULL
remembered	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
boy	NULL
only	NULL
just	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
jackets	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
doubtless	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
have	NULL
many	NULL
a	NULL
sausage	NULL
and	NULL
mashed	NULL
potatoes	NULL
upon	NULL
deferred	NULL
payment	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
head	NULL
boys	NULL
assembled	NULL
in	NULL
conclave	NULL
to	NULL
consider	NULL
what	NULL
steps	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
hardly	NULL
had	NULL
they	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
before	NULL
Ernest	NULL
knocked	NULL
timidly	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
head-room	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
bull	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
horns	NULL
by	NULL
explaining	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
bring	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
clean	NULL
breast	NULL
of	NULL
everything	NULL
except	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
list	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
remarks	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
about	NULL
each	NULL
boy	NULL
's	NULL
character	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
infamy	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
own	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
his	NULL
counsel	NULL
concerning	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Fortunately	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
safe	NULL
in	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
,	NULL
pedant	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
pedant	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
still	NULL
just	NULL
sense	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
on	NULL
Theobald	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
list	NULL
.	NULL

Whether	NULL
he	NULL
resented	NULL
being	NULL
told	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
characters	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
dreaded	NULL
a	NULL
scandal	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
handed	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
list	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
expended	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
pains	NULL
,	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
had	NULL
cut	NULL
him	NULL
uncommonly	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
then	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
suavity	NULL
than	NULL
was	NULL
usual	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
committed	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
flames	NULL
before	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
own	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
got	NULL
off	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
boys	NULL
easier	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
expected	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
admitted	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
offence	NULL
,	NULL
heinous	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
committed	NULL
under	NULL
extenuating	NULL
circumstances	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
frankness	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
culprit	NULL
had	NULL
confessed	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
evidently	NULL
unfeigned	NULL
remorse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fury	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
was	NULL
pursuing	NULL
him	NULL
tended	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
reaction	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
favour	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
sinned	NULL
against	NULL
than	NULL
sinning	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
half	NULL
year	NULL
wore	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
spirits	NULL
gradually	NULL
revived	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
attacked	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fits	NULL
of	NULL
self-abasement	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
degree	NULL
consoled	NULL
by	NULL
having	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
even	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
supposed	NULL
so	NULL
immaculate	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

About	NULL
the	NULL
fifth	NULL
of	NULL
November	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
school	NULL
custom	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
common	NULL
not	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
and	NULL
burn	NULL
somebody	NULL
in	NULL
effigy	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
compromise	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
fireworks	NULL
and	NULL
Guy	NULL
Fawkes	NULL
festivities	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
year	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
's	NULL
governor	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
victim	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
though	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
exercised	NULL
in	NULL
mind	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
sufficient	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
holding	NULL
aloof	NULL
from	NULL
proceedings	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
justly	NULL
remarked	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
any	NULL
harm	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
so	NULL
happened	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
bishop	NULL
had	NULL
held	NULL
a	NULL
confirmation	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
fifth	NULL
of	NULL
November	NULL
.	NULL

Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
liked	NULL
the	NULL
selection	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
bishop	NULL
was	NULL
pressed	NULL
by	NULL
many	NULL
engagements	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
compelled	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
arrangement	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
then	NULL
stood	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
among	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
confirmed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
deeply	NULL
impressed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
solemn	NULL
importance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ceremony	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
huge	NULL
old	NULL
bishop	NULL
drawing	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
knelt	NULL
in	NULL
chapel	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
breathe	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
apparition	NULL
paused	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
laid	NULL
its	NULL
hands	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
frightened	NULL
almost	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wits	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
turning	NULL
points	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Ernest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
could	NULL
resemble	NULL
only	NULL
very	NULL
faintly	NULL
the	NULL
Ernest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
happened	NULL
at	NULL
about	NULL
noon	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
o'clock	NULL
dinner-hour	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
confirmation	NULL
had	NULL
worn	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
forego	NULL
his	NULL
annual	NULL
amusement	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
bonfire	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
valiant	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
image	NULL
was	NULL
actually	NULL
produced	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
burnt	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
frightened	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
thing	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
paper	NULL
,	NULL
calico	NULL
and	NULL
straw	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
christened	NULL
it	NULL
The	NULL
Rev.	NULL
Theobald	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
revulsion	NULL
of	NULL
feeling	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
being	NULL
carried	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
bonfire	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
his	NULL
ground	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
when	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
felt	NULL
none	NULL
the	NULL
worse	NULL
for	NULL
having	NULL
assisted	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
ceremony	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
prompted	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
boyish	NULL
love	NULL
of	NULL
mischief	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
by	NULL
rancour	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
unprecedented	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
treated	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
even	NULL
ventured	NULL
to	NULL
suggest	NULL
that	NULL
Theobald	NULL
should	NULL
interfere	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
protection	NULL
and	NULL
reminded	NULL
him	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
enough	NULL
of	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
burning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
list	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
rebuff	NULL
which	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
encourage	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
meddle	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
internal	NULL
economics	NULL
of	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
therefore	NULL
replied	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
either	NULL
remove	NULL
Ernest	NULL
from	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
altogether	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
reasons	NULL
be	NULL
undesirable	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
trust	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
discretion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
master	NULL
as	NULL
regards	NULL
the	NULL
treatment	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
think	NULL
best	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
pupils	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
said	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
still	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
discreditable	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
allowed	NULL
any	NULL
confession	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
wrung	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
press	NULL
the	NULL
promised	NULL
amnesty	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Mother	NULL
Cross	NULL
row	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
long	NULL
styled	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
remarkable	NULL
phenomenon	NULL
was	NULL
witnessed	NULL
at	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
mean	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
boys	NULL
under	NULL
certain	NULL
conditions	NULL
doing	NULL
errands	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
juniors	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
head	NULL
boys	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
bounds	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Cross	NULL
's	NULL
whenever	NULL
they	NULL
liked	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
actually	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
themselves	NULL
go-betweens	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
get	NULL
anything	NULL
from	NULL
either	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Cross	NULL
's	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Jones	NULL
's	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL

By	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XLIV	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
spare	NULL
the	NULL
reader	NULL
more	NULL
details	NULL
about	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL
's	NULL
school	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
rose	NULL
,	NULL
always	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
's	NULL
form	NULL

and	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL

so	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
was	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
praepostors	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
rose	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
upper	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
rather	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
leave	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
rarely	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
construe	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
exercises	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
pretty	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
tacit	NULL
,	NULL
unconscious	NULL
obstinacy	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
effected	NULL
more	NULL
even	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
bold	NULL
sallies	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL

would	NULL

To	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
his	NULL
career	NULL

position	NULL

was	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL

Only	NULL
once	NULL
in	NULL

of	NULL
his	NULL

did	NULL
he	NULL
get	NULL
praise	NULL

for	NULL

this	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
treasured	NULL

example	NULL
of	NULL
guarded	NULL
approval	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL

but	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
seconds	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
humorous	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
misfortunes	NULL
presented	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
smiled	NULL
half	NULL
reproachfully	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
merrily	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
thinking	NULL
how	NULL
little	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
really	NULL
mattered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
small	NULL
were	NULL
his	NULL
hardships	NULL
as	NULL
compared	NULL
with	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
most	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
looking	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
and	NULL
smiling	NULL
dreamily	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
helped	NULL
to	NULL
burn	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
in	NULL
effigy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
look	NULL
grew	NULL
merrier	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
broke	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
laugh	NULL
.	NULL

Exactly	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
veil	NULL
of	NULL
cloud	NULL
parted	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
_	NULL
terra	NULL
firma	NULL
_	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
breaking	NULL
forth	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sunshine	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
watched	NULL
attentively	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
fellow-traveller	NULL
opposite	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
elderly	NULL
gentleman	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
iron-grey	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL

said	NULL
he	NULL

good-naturedly	NULL

"	NULL
you	NULL

The	NULL

said	NULL
not	NULL
another	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
unfolded	NULL
his	NULL
_	NULL
Times	NULL
_	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
blushed	NULL
crimson	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL

they	NULL
eyed	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
from	NULL
time	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XLV	NULL
Some	NULL
people	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
school	NULL
days	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
happiest	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
lives	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
always	NULL
look	NULL
with	NULL
suspicion	NULL
upon	NULL
those	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
hear	NULL
saying	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
hard	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
one	NULL
is	NULL
happy	NULL
or	NULL
unhappy	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
harder	NULL
to	NULL
compare	NULL
the	NULL
relative	NULL
happiness	NULL
or	NULL
unhappiness	NULL
of	NULL
different	NULL
times	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
life	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
that	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
fairly	NULL
happy	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
distinctly	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
miserable	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
with	NULL
Ernest	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
since	NULL
about	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
happy	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
happier	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
place	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
consciously	NULL
and	NULL
continuously	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
can	NULL
any	NULL
boy	NULL
fail	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
an	NULL
ecstasy	NULL
of	NULL
pleasure	NULL
on	NULL
first	NULL
finding	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
rooms	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
knows	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
few	NULL
years	NULL
are	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
castle	NULL
?	NULL

Here	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
compelled	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
comfortable	NULL
place	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
ensconced	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
because	NULL
papa	NULL
or	NULL
mamma	NULL
happens	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
give	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
most	NULL
cosy	NULL
chair	NULL
here	NULL
is	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
share	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
interfere	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
doing	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
likes	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
smoking	NULL
included	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
looked	NULL
out	NULL
both	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
front	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
blank	NULL
dead	NULL
wall	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
still	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
paradise	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
then	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
view	NULL
is	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
quiet	NULL
grassy	NULL
court	NULL
or	NULL
cloister	NULL
or	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
rooms	NULL
at	NULL
Oxford	NULL
and	NULL
Cambridge	NULL

Theobald	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
fellow	NULL
and	NULL
tutor	NULL
of	NULL
Emmanuel	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
college	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
entered	NULL
Ernest	NULL
--	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
obtain	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
tutor	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
preference	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
choice	NULL
of	NULL
rooms	NULL
;	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
pleasant	NULL
ones	NULL

looking	NULL
out	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
grassy	NULL
court	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
bounded	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Fellows	NULL

Theobald	NULL
accompanied	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
best	NULL
while	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
liked	NULL
the	NULL
jaunt	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
pride	NULL
in	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
full-blown	NULL
son	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
University	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
reflected	NULL
rays	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
splendour	NULL
were	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
fall	NULL
upon	NULL
Ernest	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
"	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
hope	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL

that	NULL

turn	NULL

left	NULL

--	NULL
this	NULL

Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
having	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
dine	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Fellows	NULL
'	NULL
table	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
colleges	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
invitation	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
friend	NULL
of	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
there	NULL
made	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
with	NULL
sundry	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
things	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
names	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
new	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
ate	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
indeed	NULL
receiving	NULL
a	NULL
liberal	NULL
education	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
came	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Emmanuel	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
new	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
came	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
gates	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
safe	NULL
into	NULL
college	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
alone	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
latch-key	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
dated	NULL
many	NULL
days	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
unclouded	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
very	NULL
happy	NULL
ones	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
need	NULL
not	NULL
however	NULL
describe	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
steady-going	NULL
undergraduate	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
told	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
score	NULL
of	NULL
novels	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
tell	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
of	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
schoolfellows	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
as	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
these	NULL
he	NULL
continued	NULL
on	NULL
friendly	NULL
terms	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
college	NULL
career	NULL
.	NULL

Other	NULL
schoolfellows	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
his	NULL
seniors	NULL
;	NULL
these	NULL
called	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thus	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
favourable	NULL
_	NULL
entree	NULL
_	NULL
into	NULL
college	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
straightforwardness	NULL
of	NULL
character	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
stamped	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
love	NULL
of	NULL
humour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
temper	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
easily	NULL
appeased	NULL
than	NULL
ruffled	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
awkwardness	NULL
and	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
_	NULL
savoir	NULL
faire	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
soon	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
not	NULL
unpopular	NULL
member	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
set	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
neither	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
becoming	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
aspiring	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
leader	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
admitted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
leaders	NULL
as	NULL
among	NULL
their	NULL
nearer	NULL
hangers-on	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
ambition	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
not	NULL
one	NULL
particle	NULL
;	NULL
greatness	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
indeed	NULL
superiority	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
off	NULL
and	NULL
incomprehensible	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
connecting	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
never	NULL
crossed	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
escape	NULL
the	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
himself	NULL
_	NULL
en	NULL
rapport	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
conceived	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
triumphed	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
about	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
degree	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
good	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
quiet	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
dream	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
fellowship	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
tried	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
so	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
briefness	NULL
indeed	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
present	NULL
happiness	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
last	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
now	NULL
seriously	NULL
troubled	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
less	NULL
to	NULL
attend	NULL
to	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
growing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
got	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
more	NULL
free	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
to	NULL
reading	NULL
fairly	NULL
well	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
told	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
natural	NULL
instinct	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
are	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
as	NULL
those	NULL
in	NULL
authority	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
intention	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
was	NULL
(	NULL
for	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
fellowship	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
good	NULL
degree	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
tutorship	NULL
or	NULL
mastership	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
school	NULL
preparatory	NULL
to	NULL
taking	NULL
orders	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
twenty-one	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
thing	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL

rector	NULL
of	NULL

live	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
mastership	NULL
or	NULL
tutorship	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
living	NULL
fell	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
buy	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
living	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sum	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
grandfather	NULL
's	NULL
legacy	NULL
now	NULL
amounted	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
serious	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
deductions	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL

money	NULL
had	NULL
accumulated	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
about	NULL
five	NULL
thousand	NULL
pounds	NULL

had	NULL
only	NULL
talked	NULL
about	NULL

order	NULL
to	NULL
stimulate	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
to	NULL
exertion	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL

by	NULL
making	NULL
him	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL

his	NULL
only	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
escaping	NULL

--	NULL
or	NULL
perhaps	NULL
from	NULL
pure	NULL
love	NULL

When	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
living	NULL
of	NULL
600	NULL

700	NULL

a	NULL
year	NULL

these	NULL

shrank	NULL
from	NULL
on	NULL
behalf	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
boy	NULL

would	NULL
be	NULL
thrown	NULL
among	NULL
companions	NULL

familiarised	NULL
with	NULL
details	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
sully	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
stand	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
"	NULL
only	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
fall	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
ordination	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
which	NULL
Theobald	NULL
knew	NULL

understood	NULL

indeed	NULL
the	NULL

road	NULL
about	NULL

knew	NULL
anything	NULL
at	NULL

so	NULL
not	NULL
unnaturally	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
for	NULL
Ernest	NULL

The	NULL
foregoing	NULL

been	NULL
instilled	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL
from	NULL
earliest	NULL
boyhood	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
instilled	NULL
into	NULL
Theobald	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
result	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
conviction	NULL
,	NULL
namely	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
way	NULL
off	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
supposed	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
duty	NULL
of	NULL
reading	NULL
hard	NULL

taking	NULL
as	NULL
good	NULL
a	NULL
degree	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL

this	NULL
was	NULL
plain	NULL
enough	NULL

so	NULL
he	NULL
set	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL

as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL

steadily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
surprise	NULL
of	NULL
everyone	NULL
as	NULL

himself	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
college	NULL

still	NULL
a	NULL

in	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
hardly	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
Theobald	NULL
stuck	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL

believing	NULL
the	NULL

I	NULL

Ernest	NULL

then	NULL
lived	NULL
penuriously	NULL

the	NULL

those	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
got	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL

5000	NULL

and	NULL
became	NULL
independent	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
15	NULL

20	NULL
pounds	NULL
served	NULL
to	NULL
cover	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
unauthorised	NULL
expenditure	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
joined	NULL
the	NULL
boat	NULL

and	NULL
was	NULL
constant	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
attendance	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
boats	NULL

He	NULL
still	NULL
smoked	NULL

never	NULL
took	NULL
more	NULL
wine	NULL

beer	NULL
than	NULL
was	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL

perhaps	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

soberly	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
conclude	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
that	NULL
Aristophanes	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tragedians	NULL

yet	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
will	NULL
deny	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
keen	NULL

witty	NULL

outspoken	NULL
writer	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
good	NULL
a	NULL
judge	NULL
of	NULL
literary	NULL

and	NULL
as	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
any	NULL
beauties	NULL
that	NULL

contained	NULL
as	NULL
nine-tenths	NULL

at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL

of	NULL
ourselves	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
moreover	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
understanding	NULL
the	NULL
standpoint	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
tragedians	NULL
expected	NULL
their	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
judged	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
conclusion	NULL
?	NULL

Briefly	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
else	NULL
than	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
fraud	NULL
or	NULL
something	NULL
very	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL

For	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
part	NULL
I	NULL
cordially	NULL
agree	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
free	NULL
to	NULL
confess	NULL
that	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
exception	NULL
perhaps	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Psalms	NULL
of	NULL
David	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
no	NULL
writings	NULL
which	NULL
seem	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
to	NULL
deserve	NULL
their	NULL
reputation	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
particularly	NULL
mind	NULL
my	NULL
sisters	NULL
reading	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
take	NULL
good	NULL
care	NULL
never	NULL

read	NULL
them	NULL
myself	NULL

"	NULL

This	NULL
last	NULL
bit	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
Psalms	NULL
was	NULL
awful	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
fight	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
editor	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
whether	NULL
or	NULL
no	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
himself	NULL
was	NULL
frightened	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
heard	NULL
someone	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Psalms	NULL
were	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
very	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
more	NULL
closely	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
told	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
be	NULL
two	NULL
opinions	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
caught	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
remark	NULL
and	NULL
reproduced	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
concluding	NULL
that	NULL
these	NULL
psalms	NULL
had	NULL
probably	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
written	NULL
by	NULL
David	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
in	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
by	NULL
mistake	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
essay	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
Psalms	NULL
,	NULL
created	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
sensation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
received	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
friends	NULL
praised	NULL
it	NULL
more	NULL
highly	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
deserved	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
himself	NULL
very	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
show	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
tether	NULL
;	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
one	NULL
idea	NULL
(	NULL
I	NULL
feel	NULL
sure	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
caught	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
another	NULL
thing	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
cursed	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
reputation	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
much	NULL
bigger	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
consciousness	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
keep	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
many	NULL
days	NULL
were	NULL
over	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
unfortunate	NULL
essay	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
elephant	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
feed	NULL
by	NULL
hurrying	NULL
into	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
frantic	NULL
attempts	NULL
to	NULL
cap	NULL
his	NULL
triumph	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
imagined	NULL
,	NULL
these	NULL
attempts	NULL
were	NULL
failures	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
and	NULL
observed	NULL
,	NULL
another	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
kind	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
occur	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
some	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
development	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
would	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
turn	NULL
suggest	NULL
still	NULL
further	NULL
ones	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
worst	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
ideas	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
hunting	NULL
expressly	NULL
after	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
them	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
study	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
one	NULL
is	NULL
fond	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
note	NULL
down	NULL
whatever	NULL
crosses	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
in	NULL
reference	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
either	NULL
during	NULL
study	NULL
or	NULL
relaxation	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
note-book	NULL
kept	NULL
always	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
waistcoat	NULL
pocket	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
has	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
this	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
taught	NULL
at	NULL
schools	NULL
and	NULL
universities	NULL
.	NULL

Nor	NULL
yet	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
ideas	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
living	NULL
beings	NULL
in	NULL
whose	NULL
minds	NULL
they	NULL
arise	NULL
,	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
begotten	NULL
by	NULL
parents	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
unlike	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
original	NULL
still	NULL
differing	NULL
but	NULL
slightly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
parents	NULL
that	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
rise	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Life	NULL
is	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
fugue	NULL
,	NULL
everything	NULL
must	NULL
grow	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
nothing	NULL
new	NULL
.	NULL

Nor	NULL
,	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
hard	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
where	NULL
one	NULL
idea	NULL
ends	NULL
and	NULL
another	NULL
begins	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
yet	NULL
how	NULL
closely	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
paralleled	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
difficulty	NULL
of	NULL
saying	NULL
where	NULL
a	NULL
life	NULL
begins	NULL
or	NULL
ends	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
an	NULL
action	NULL
or	NULL
indeed	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
being	NULL
an	NULL
unity	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
infinite	NULL
multitude	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
infinite	NULL
multitude	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
unity	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
ideas	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
clever	NULL
people	NULL
's	NULL
heads	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
spontaneous	NULL
germination	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
parentage	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
thoughts	NULL
of	NULL
others	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
observation	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
genius	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
well	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
none	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
fine	NULL
frenzied	NULL
thing	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
very	NULL
long	NULL
before	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
of	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
handed	NULL
him	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
amounted	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
5000	NULL
pounds	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
invested	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
in	NULL
5	NULL
per	NULL
cent	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
therefore	NULL
an	NULL
income	NULL
of	NULL
250	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
realise	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
(	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
realise	NULL
nothing	NULL
so	NULL
foreign	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
experience	NULL
)	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
independent	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
till	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
afterwards	NULL
;	NULL
nor	NULL
did	NULL
Theobald	NULL
make	NULL
any	NULL
difference	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
manner	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
strong	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
hold	NULL
which	NULL
habit	NULL
and	NULL
association	NULL
held	NULL
over	NULL
both	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
considered	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
as	NULL
good	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
to	NULL
dictate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
as	NULL
little	NULL
right	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
to	NULL
gainsay	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
year	NULL
at	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
he	NULL
overworked	NULL
himself	NULL
through	NULL
this	NULL
very	NULL
blind	NULL
deference	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
wishes	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
poll	NULL
degree	NULL
except	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
laid	NULL
such	NULL
stress	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
taking	NULL
honours	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
became	NULL
so	NULL
ill	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
doubtful	NULL
how	NULL
far	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
in	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
degree	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
list	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
was	NULL
found	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
placed	NULL
higher	NULL
than	NULL
either	NULL
he	NULL
or	NULL
anyone	NULL
else	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
senior	NULL
optimes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
class	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Classical	NULL
Tripos	NULL
.	NULL

Ill	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
Theobald	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
go	NULL
over	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
examination	NULL
papers	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
reproduce	NULL
as	NULL
nearly	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
the	NULL
replies	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
little	NULL
kick	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
deep	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
groove	NULL
into	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
while	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
he	NULL
spent	NULL
several	NULL
hours	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
continuing	NULL
his	NULL
classical	NULL
and	NULL
mathematical	NULL
studies	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
taken	NULL
his	NULL
degree	NULL
.	NULL

Up	NULL
to	NULL

how	NULL
small	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
any	NULL
difficulties	NULL

he	NULL
not	NULL
unnaturally	NULL
enquired	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL

way	NULL

That	NULL

my	NULL

rejoined	NULL

"	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL

fitted	NULL

either	NULL

nature	NULL

I	NULL
might	NULL
easily	NULL
unsettle	NULL
your	NULL

able	NULL

settle	NULL
it	NULL
again	NULL

Oh	NULL

no	NULL

Such	NULL
questions	NULL
are	NULL
far	NULL
better	NULL
avoided	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL

papa	NULL
wished	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL

that	NULL
there	NULL

The	NULL
conversation	NULL
ended	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
subject	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
know	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
mother	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
all	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
--	NULL
unless	NULL
he	NULL
actually	NULL
did	NULL
know	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
supposed	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
some	NULL
difficulties	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
scholar	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
learned	NULL
man	NULL

was	NULL
probably	NULL
quite	NULL
right	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
need	NULL
not	NULL
trouble	NULL
himself	NULL
more	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
little	NULL
impression	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
make	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
till	NULL
long	NULL
afterwards	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
happening	NULL

remember	NULL
it	NULL

he	NULL
saw	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
sleight	NULL
of	NULL
hand	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
practised	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
satisfied	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
their	NULL
duty	NULL
by	NULL
opening	NULL
their	NULL
son	NULL

the	NULL
difficulties	NULL

assent	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
for	NULL
rejoicing	NULL
that	NULL

though	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
put	NULL
so	NULL
fully	NULL

candidly	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL

he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
them	NULL
serious	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL

a	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
person	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
just	NULL
show	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
old	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
jolly	NULL
old	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
a	NULL
regular	NULL
old	NULL
brick	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
Ernest	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
fault	NULL
all	NULL
through	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
behave	NULL
very	NULL
nicely	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
delighted	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
side	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
against	NULL
Ernest	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
if	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
Battersby	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
enjoy	NULL
his	NULL
visit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
therefore	NULL
pleased	NULL
that	NULL
Theobald	NULL
should	NULL
behave	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
in	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
moral	NULL
support	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
painful	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
familiar	NULL
friends	NULL
go	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
enemy	NULL
's	NULL
camp	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
no	NULL
matter	NULL
how	NULL
well	NULL
we	NULL
may	NULL
know	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
--	NULL
how	NULL
clearly	NULL
we	NULL
may	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
patch	NULL
of	NULL
colour	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
example	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
red	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
shakes	NULL
us	NULL
and	NULL
knocks	NULL
us	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
another	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
half	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
green	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
generally	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
impatient	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
visit	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
formed	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
earlier	NULL
part	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
visitor	NULL
had	NULL
carried	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
never	NULL
discussed	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
with	NULL
Ernest	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Christina	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
let	NULL
them	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
Christina	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
,	NULL
persistent	NULL
way	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
come	NULL
he	NULL
behaved	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
civilly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
whereas	NULL
Christina	NULL
did	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
half	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
and	NULL
half	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
stay	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
managed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
cost	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
money	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
their	NULL
coming	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
tearing	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
pieces	NULL
and	NULL
flinging	NULL
the	NULL
bits	NULL
over	NULL
Ernest	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
enough	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
worst	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
proved	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

Boys	NULL
and	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
are	NULL
violent	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
affections	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
seldom	NULL
very	NULL
constant	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
get	NULL
older	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
really	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
friend	NULL
they	NULL
want	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
earlier	NULL
essays	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
are	NULL
simply	NULL
learning	NULL
to	NULL
judge	NULL
character	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
no	NULL
exception	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
rule	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
swans	NULL
had	NULL
one	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
proved	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
geese	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
estimation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
almost	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
judge	NULL
of	NULL
character	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
assumed	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
certainty	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
young	NULL
swan	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
declared	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
ugliest	NULL
and	NULL
worst	NULL
goose	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
yet	NULL
seen	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
suspected	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
were	NULL
wanted	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
view	NULL
to	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
understood	NULL
that	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
perhaps	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
fancy	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
?	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
any	NULL
deliberate	NULL
malice	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
arrangement	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
awoke	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
meant	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
any	NULL
friend	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
to	NULL
Battersby	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
silly	NULL
young	NULL
mind	NULL
almost	NULL
dishonest	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
your	NULL
friend	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
when	NULL
all	NULL
you	NULL
really	NULL
meant	NULL
was	NULL
"	NULL
Please	NULL
,	NULL
marry	NULL
my	NULL
sister	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
obtain	NULL
money	NULL
under	NULL
false	NULL
pretences	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
another	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
her	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
young	NULL
women	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
circle	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
clever	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
are	NULL
either	NULL
very	NULL
pretty	NULL
or	NULL
very	NULL
clever	NULL
or	NULL
very	NULL
sweet	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
may	NULL
take	NULL
their	NULL
choice	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
category	NULL
they	NULL
will	NULL
go	NULL
in	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
go	NULL
in	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
hopeless	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
and	NULL
pass	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
off	NULL
as	NULL
either	NULL
pretty	NULL
or	NULL
sweet	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
she	NULL
became	NULL
clever	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
remaining	NULL
alternative	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
never	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
particular	NULL
branch	NULL
of	NULL
study	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
showed	NULL
her	NULL
talent	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
neither	NULL
play	NULL
nor	NULL
sing	NULL
nor	NULL
draw	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
so	NULL
astute	NULL
are	NULL
women	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
and	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
really	NULL
did	NULL
persuade	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
something	NULL
more	NULL
akin	NULL
to	NULL
true	NULL
genius	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
member	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
friends	NULL
whom	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
inveigled	NULL
into	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
inveigle	NULL
had	NULL
shown	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
struck	NULL
with	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
's	NULL
commanding	NULL
powers	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
them	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
rapidity	NULL
and	NULL
completeness	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
Christina	NULL
had	NULL
dismissed	NULL
them	NULL
one	NULL
after	NULL
another	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
wanted	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
Towneley	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
this	NULL
coming	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
impossible	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
Towneley	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

Towneley	NULL
belonged	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
exclusive	NULL
sets	NULL
in	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
popular	NULL
man	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
undergraduates	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
big	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
handsome	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
the	NULL
handsomest	NULL
man	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
ever	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
or	NULL
ever	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
lively	NULL
and	NULL
agreeable	NULL
countenance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
good	NULL
at	NULL
cricket	NULL
and	NULL
boating	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
good-natured	NULL
,	NULL
singularly	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
conceit	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
clever	NULL
but	NULL
very	NULL
sensible	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
lastly	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
drowned	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
overturning	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
boat	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
their	NULL
only	NULL
child	NULL
and	NULL
heir	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
finest	NULL
estates	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
South	NULL

Fortune	NULL
every	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
does	NULL
things	NULL
handsomely	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
;	NULL
Towneley	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
fancy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
universal	NULL
verdict	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
case	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
chosen	NULL
wisely	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
Towneley	NULL
as	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
University	NULL
(	NULL
except	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
dons	NULL
)	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
mark	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
being	NULL
very	NULL
susceptible	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
liked	NULL
Towneley	NULL
even	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
most	NULL
people	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
it	NULL
never	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
entered	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
liked	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
ended	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
accident	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
last	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
names	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
crews	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
scratch	NULL
fours	NULL
were	NULL
drawn	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
coxswain	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
crew	NULL
,	NULL
among	NULL
whom	NULL
was	NULL
none	NULL
other	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
especial	NULL
hero	NULL
Towneley	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
others	NULL
were	NULL
ordinary	NULL
mortals	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
row	NULL
fairly	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
crew	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
frightened	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wits	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
met	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
Towneley	NULL
no	NULL
less	NULL
remarkable	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
entire	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
like	NULL
"	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
setting	NULL
those	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
across	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
ease	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
outward	NULL
accomplishments	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
difference	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
between	NULL
Towneley	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
easier	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
Ernest	NULL
worshipped	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
scratch	NULL
fours	NULL
being	NULL
ended	NULL
the	NULL
connection	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Towneley	NULL
never	NULL
passed	NULL
Ernest	NULL
thenceforward	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
nod	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
good-natured	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
an	NULL
evil	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
mentioned	NULL
Towneley	NULL
's	NULL
name	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
?	NULL

Here	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
plaguing	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
Towneley	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Battersby	NULL
and	NULL
marry	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
remotest	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
Towneley	NULL
's	NULL
marrying	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
an	NULL
odious	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
implored	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
himself	NULL
while	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
yet	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
prayed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
"	NULL
truly	NULL
honest	NULL
and	NULL
conscientious	NULL
"	NULL
for	NULL
as	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
as	NULL
Christina	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
conceal	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
led	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
difficulties	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
might	NULL
feel	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
being	NULL
ordained	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
misgivings	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
diversion	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
settled	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
afterwards	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
escaping	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
slow	NULL
to	NULL
avail	NULL
himself	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL

who	NULL
were	NULL
also	NULL

about	NULL

Badcock	NULL
of	NULL
St	NULL

's	NULL

and	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
a	NULL

who	NULL
might	NULL

them	NULL

in	NULL
Badcock	NULL

on	NULL
a	NULL

Badcock	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
notorious	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
Simeonites	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
only	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
ugly	NULL
,	NULL
dirty	NULL
,	NULL
ill-dressed	NULL
,	NULL
bumptious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
way	NULL
objectionable	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
deformed	NULL
and	NULL
waddled	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
won	NULL
a	NULL
nick-name	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
only	NULL
reproduce	NULL
by	NULL
calling	NULL
it	NULL
"	NULL
Here	NULL
's	NULL
my	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
's	NULL
my	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
parts	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
emphasised	NULL
themselves	NULL
demonstratively	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
fly	NULL
off	NULL
in	NULL
different	NULL
directions	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
extreme	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
chord	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
augmented	NULL
sixth	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
every	NULL
step	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
guessed	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
receipt	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
circular	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
an	NULL
almost	NULL
paralysing	NULL
effect	NULL
on	NULL
those	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
addressed	NULL
,	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
astonishment	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
occasioned	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
certainly	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
daring	NULL
surprise	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
like	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
deformed	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
Badcock	NULL
was	NULL
forward	NULL
and	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
check	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pushing	NULL
fellow	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
for	NULL
carrying	NULL
war	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
enemy	NULL
's	NULL
quarters	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
consulted	NULL
.	NULL

Moved	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
now	NULL
preparing	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
clergymen	NULL
they	NULL
ought	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
so	NULL
stiffly	NULL
on	NULL
social	NULL
dignity	NULL
as	NULL
heretofore	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
also	NULL
perhaps	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
private	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
preacher	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
much	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
lips	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
decided	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
the	NULL
invitation	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
appointed	NULL
time	NULL
came	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
confusion	NULL
and	NULL
self-abasement	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
whom	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
hitherto	NULL
as	NULL
from	NULL
an	NULL
immeasurable	NULL
height	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
nothing	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
them	NULL
believe	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
earlier	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
ever	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
on	NULL
speaking	NULL
terms	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Hawke	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
different-looking	NULL
person	NULL
from	NULL
Badcock	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
remarkably	NULL
handsome	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
thinness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
too	NULL
great	NULL
firmness	NULL
and	NULL
inflexibility	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
features	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
like	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
Leonardo	NULL
da	NULL
Vinci	NULL
;	NULL
moreover	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
kempt	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
in	NULL
vigorous	NULL
health	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
ruddy	NULL
countenance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
extremely	NULL
courteous	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
paid	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
Badcock	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
highly	NULL
.	NULL

Altogether	NULL
our	NULL
young	NULL
friends	NULL
were	NULL
taken	NULL
aback	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
smaller	NULL
beer	NULL
of	NULL
themselves	NULL
and	NULL
larger	NULL
of	NULL
Badcock	NULL
than	NULL
was	NULL
agreeable	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
Adam	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
alive	NULL
within	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
well-known	NULL
"	NULL
Sims	NULL
"	NULL
from	NULL
St	NULL
John	NULL
's	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
colleges	NULL
were	NULL
present	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
swamp	NULL
the	NULL
Ernest	NULL
set	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
brevity	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
call	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
preliminary	NULL
conversation	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
offend	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
business	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
began	NULL
by	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hawke	NULL
's	NULL
standing	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saying	NULL
"	NULL
Let	NULL
us	NULL
pray	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
Ernest	NULL
set	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
they	NULL
knelt	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
repeated	NULL
the	NULL
Lord	NULL
's	NULL
Prayer	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
others	NULL
after	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hawke	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
delivered	NULL
them	NULL
remarkably	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
all	NULL
had	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hawke	NULL
addressed	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
speaking	NULL
without	NULL
notes	NULL
and	NULL
taking	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
text	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Saul	NULL
,	NULL
Saul	NULL

persecutest	NULL

"	NULL

Whether	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hawke	NULL
's	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
impressive	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
well-known	NULL

or	NULL
whether	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
each	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Ernest	NULL
set	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
a	NULL
persecutor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Sims	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
felt	NULL
instinctively	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Sims	NULL
"	NULL
were	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
Christians	NULL

any	NULL

the	NULL

went	NULL
home	NULL

the	NULL
consciences	NULL
of	NULL
Ernest	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
yet	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hawke	NULL
had	NULL
stopped	NULL
here	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
almost	NULL
said	NULL
enough	NULL
;	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
scanned	NULL
the	NULL
faces	NULL
turned	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
minded	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
his	NULL
sermon	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
before	NULL
beginning	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
reconsidered	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
proceeded	NULL
as	NULL
follows	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
sermon	NULL
in	NULL
full	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
typical	NULL
one	NULL

will	NULL
explain	NULL

were	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
hearts	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
pensively	NULL
home	NULL
through	NULL
moonlit	NULL
courts	NULL
and	NULL
cloisters	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
passed	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
Simeonites	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
Ernest	NULL
set	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL

been	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL

a	NULL
good	NULL

elated	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
results	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
friends	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
University	NULL
eleven	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
actually	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
Badcock	NULL
's	NULL
rooms	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
slunk	NULL
off	NULL
on	NULL
saying	NULL
good-night	NULL
as	NULL
meekly	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
small	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
scored	NULL
a	NULL
success	NULL
like	NULL
this	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
L	NULL
Ernest	NULL
felt	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
turning	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
for	NULL
Christ	NULL
--	NULL
even	NULL
his	NULL
tobacco	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
gathered	NULL
together	NULL
his	NULL
pipes	NULL
and	NULL
pouches	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
locked	NULL
them	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
portmanteau	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
sight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
burn	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
someone	NULL
might	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
who	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
smoke	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
abridge	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
liberty	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
smoking	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
sin	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
hard	NULL
on	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
breakfast	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
his	NULL
rooms	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
named	NULL
Dawson	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hawke	NULL
's	NULL
hearers	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
preceding	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
reading	NULL
for	NULL
ordination	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
forthcoming	NULL
Ember	NULL
Weeks	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
only	NULL
four	NULL
months	NULL
distant	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
always	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
serious	NULL
turn	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
so	NULL
for	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
taste	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
times	NULL
had	NULL
changed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Dawson	NULL
's	NULL
undoubted	NULL
sincerity	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
render	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
fitting	NULL
counsellor	NULL
for	NULL
Ernest	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
court	NULL
of	NULL
John	NULL
's	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
Dawson	NULL
's	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
Badcock	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
greeted	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
deference	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
advance	NULL
was	NULL
received	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
ecstatic	NULL
gleams	NULL
which	NULL
shone	NULL
occasionally	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
Badcock	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
reminded	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
Robespierre	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
recognised	NULL
the	NULL
unrest	NULL
and	NULL
self-seekingness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
formulate	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
disliked	NULL
Badcock	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
profit	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
spiritual	NULL
benefits	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
civil	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
civil	NULL
he	NULL
therefore	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

Badcock	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hawke	NULL
had	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
immediately	NULL
his	NULL
discourse	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
before	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
enquired	NULL
particularly	NULL
who	NULL
Ernest	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
others	NULL
were	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
each	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
friends	NULL
was	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
particularly	NULL
enquired	NULL
after	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
vanity	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
son	NULL
--	NULL
was	NULL
tickled	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
again	NULL
presented	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
for	NULL
whose	NULL
benefit	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hawke	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sent	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Badcock	NULL
's	NULL
manner	NULL
which	NULL
conveyed	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
say	NULL
more	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
enjoined	NULL
to	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
reaching	NULL
Dawson	NULL
's	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
his	NULL
friend	NULL
in	NULL
raptures	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
discourse	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
preceding	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

Hardly	NULL
less	NULL
delighted	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
produced	NULL
on	NULL
Ernest	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
known	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
round	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sure	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
hardly	NULL
expected	NULL
the	NULL
conversion	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
sudden	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
said	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
so	NULL
clearly	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
get	NULL
ordained	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
curacy	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
from	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
earlier	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
grief	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Dawson	NULL
applauded	NULL
this	NULL
determination	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
arranged	NULL
that	NULL
as	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
weak	NULL
brother	NULL
,	NULL
Dawson	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spiritual	NULL
tow	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
strengthen	NULL
and	NULL
confirm	NULL
his	NULL
faith	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
offensive	NULL
and	NULL
defensive	NULL
alliance	NULL
therefore	NULL
was	NULL
struck	NULL
up	NULL
between	NULL
this	NULL
pair	NULL
(	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
reality	NULL
singularly	NULL
ill	NULL
assorted	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
master	NULL
the	NULL
books	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
Bishop	NULL
would	NULL
examine	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Others	NULL
gradually	NULL
joined	NULL
them	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
formed	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
set	NULL
or	NULL
church	NULL
(	NULL
for	NULL
these	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
things	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hawke	NULL
's	NULL
sermon	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
wearing	NULL
off	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
became	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
marked	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
friends	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
urge	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
develop	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
indeed	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
--	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
religious	NULL
enthusiast	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
one	NULL
matter	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
openly	NULL
backslide	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
above	NULL
,	NULL
locked	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
pipes	NULL
and	NULL
tobacco	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
tempted	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
day	NULL
long	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hawke	NULL
's	NULL
sermon	NULL
he	NULL
let	NULL
them	NULL
lie	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
portmanteau	NULL
bravely	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
difficult	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
smoking	NULL
till	NULL
after	NULL
hall	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
hall	NULL
this	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
smoke	NULL
till	NULL
chapel	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
chapel	NULL
in	NULL
self-defence	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
returned	NULL
he	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
common	NULL
sense	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
provided	NULL
tobacco	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
injure	NULL
his	NULL
health	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
really	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
stood	NULL
much	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
footing	NULL
as	NULL
tea	NULL
or	NULL
coffee	NULL
.	NULL

Tobacco	NULL
had	NULL
nowhere	NULL
been	NULL
forbidden	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Bible	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
been	NULL
discovered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
probably	NULL
only	NULL
escaped	NULL
proscription	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
reason	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
can	NULL
conceive	NULL
of	NULL
St	NULL
Paul	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
our	NULL
Lord	NULL
Himself	NULL
as	NULL
drinking	NULL
a	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
we	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
imagine	NULL
either	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
smoking	NULL
a	NULL
cigarette	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
churchwarden	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
deny	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
admitted	NULL
that	NULL
Paul	NULL
would	NULL
almost	NULL
certainly	NULL
have	NULL
condemned	NULL
tobacco	NULL
in	NULL
good	NULL
round	NULL
terms	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
existence	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
then	NULL
taking	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
mean	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Apostle	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
not	NULL
having	NULL
actually	NULL
forbidden	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
God	NULL
knew	NULL
Paul	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
forbidden	NULL
smoking	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
purposely	NULL
arranged	NULL
the	NULL
discovery	NULL
of	NULL
tobacco	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
period	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
Paul	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
living	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
might	NULL
seem	NULL
rather	NULL
hard	NULL
on	NULL
Paul	NULL
,	NULL
considering	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
for	NULL
Christianity	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
other	NULL
ways	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
reflections	NULL
satisfied	NULL
Ernest	NULL
that	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
smoke	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
sneaked	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
portmanteau	NULL
and	NULL
brought	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
pipes	NULL
and	NULL
tobacco	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
moderation	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
virtue	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
he	NULL
smoked	NULL
immoderately	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pity	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bragged	NULL
to	NULL
Dawson	NULL
about	NULL
giving	NULL
up	NULL
smoking	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pipes	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
be	NULL
kept	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cupboard	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
in	NULL
other	NULL
and	NULL
easier	NULL
respects	NULL
Ernest	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
proved	NULL
his	NULL
steadfastness	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
steal	NULL
out	NULL
again	NULL
little	NULL
by	NULL
little	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
now	NULL
wrote	NULL
home	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
couched	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
vein	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
ordinary	NULL
ones	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
letters	NULL
were	NULL
usually	NULL
all	NULL
common	NULL
form	NULL
and	NULL
padding	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
already	NULL
explained	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
wrote	NULL
about	NULL
anything	NULL
that	NULL
really	NULL
interested	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
always	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
every	NULL
fresh	NULL
answer	NULL
being	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
lopping	NULL
off	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hydra	NULL
's	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
giving	NULL
birth	NULL
to	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
new	NULL
questions	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
invariably	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
result	NULL
,	NULL
namely	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
something	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
ought	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
doing	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
proposed	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
departure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
thousandth	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
concluded	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
would	NULL
approve	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
interested	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
more	NULL
sympathetically	NULL
than	NULL
heretofore	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
therefore	NULL
wrote	NULL
a	NULL
gushing	NULL
impulsive	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
afforded	NULL
much	NULL
amusement	NULL
to	NULL
myself	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
too	NULL
long	NULL
for	NULL
reproduction	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
passage	NULL
ran	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
now	NULL
going	NULL
towards	NULL
Christ	NULL

the	NULL
greater	NULL

I	NULL
fear	NULL

away	NULL
from	NULL
Him	NULL
;	NULL
we	NULL
must	NULL
pray	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
may	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
peace	NULL

Ernest	NULL
covered	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
for	NULL
shame	NULL

he	NULL

This	NULL

during	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
prepared	NULL

the	NULL
almost	NULL
contempt	NULL

Ernest	NULL
now	NULL
regarded	NULL

doctrines	NULL

he	NULL
hated	NULL

as	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
rule	NULL

he	NULL
always	NULL

people	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL
agree	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
troublesome	NULL
to	NULL
deal	NULL
with	NULL
:	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
set	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
knowing	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
;	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
let	NULL
alone	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
leaned	NULL
towards	NULL
them	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
High	NULL
Church	NULL
party	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
neighbouring	NULL
clergy	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
influence	NULL
,	NULL
directly	NULL
or	NULL
indirectly	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Oxford	NULL
movement	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
earlier	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
surprising	NULL
how	NULL
many	NULL
practices	NULL
he	NULL
now	NULL
tolerated	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
youth	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
considered	NULL
Popish	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
therefore	NULL
which	NULL
way	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
in	NULL
Church	NULL
matters	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
setting	NULL
himself	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
opportunity	NULL
for	NULL
telling	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
favourable	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
embraced	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
slow	NULL
to	NULL
embrace	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
annoyed	NULL
and	NULL
surprised	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
been	NULL
wanting	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
religious	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
?	NULL

Now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
so	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
not	NULL
satisfied	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
prophet	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
honour	NULL
save	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
country	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
lately	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
until	NULL
lately	NULL
--	NULL
getting	NULL
into	NULL
an	NULL
odious	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
turning	NULL
proverbs	NULL
upside	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
country	NULL
is	NULL
sometimes	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
honour	NULL
save	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
prophet	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
laughed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
felt	NULL
more	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hawke	NULL
's	NULL
sermon	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Long	NULL
Vacation	NULL
of	NULL
1858	NULL
--	NULL
none	NULL
too	NULL
soon	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
in	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Voluntary	NULL
Theological	NULL
Examination	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
bishops	NULL
were	NULL
now	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
insist	NULL
upon	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
imagined	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
reading	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
storing	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
knowledge	NULL

would	NULL
best	NULL
fit	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL

In	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
cramming	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
pass	NULL

In	NULL
due	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
pass	NULL
--	NULL
creditably	NULL

and	NULL
was	NULL
ordained	NULL
Deacon	NULL
with	NULL
half-a-dozen	NULL
others	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
autumn	NULL
of	NULL
1858	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
just	NULL
twenty-three	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LI	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
ordained	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
curacy	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
central	NULL
parts	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hardly	NULL
knew	NULL
anything	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
instincts	NULL
drew	NULL
him	NULL
thither	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ordained	NULL
he	NULL
entered	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
duties	NULL
--	NULL
feeling	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
boxed	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
with	NULL
Christina	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
marriage	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
were	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
happiness	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
four	NULL
years	NULL
at	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
extinguished	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
appalled	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
irrevocable	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
step	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
now	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
much	NULL
too	NULL
hurriedly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
most	NULL
charitable	NULL
excuse	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
make	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
vagaries	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
now	NULL
be	NULL
my	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
chronicle	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
shock	NULL
of	NULL
change	NULL
consequent	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
becoming	NULL
suddenly	NULL
religious	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
ordained	NULL
and	NULL
leaving	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
thrown	NULL
him	NULL
off	NULL
an	NULL
equilibrium	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
yet	NULL
little	NULL
supported	NULL
by	NULL
experience	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
therefore	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
unstable	NULL
.	NULL

Everyone	NULL
has	NULL
a	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
bad	NULL
work	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
off	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
better	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
lasting	NULL

man	NULL

ultimate	NULL
good	NULL
work	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
sure	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL

and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
long	NULL
one	NULL

which	NULL
there	NULL
seems	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL

We	NULL
must	NULL
all	NULL
sow	NULL
our	NULL
spiritual	NULL

oats	NULL

The	NULL
fault	NULL
I	NULL
feel	NULL
personally	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
godson	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
wild	NULL
oats	NULL
to	NULL
sow	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
tame	NULL
and	NULL
uninteresting	NULL
crop	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
humour	NULL
and	NULL
tendency	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
till	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
months	NULL
previously	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
showing	NULL
fair	NULL
promise	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
nipped	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
late	NULL
frost	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
his	NULL
earlier	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
taking	NULL
on	NULL
trust	NULL
everything	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
those	NULL
in	NULL
authority	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
following	NULL
everything	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bitter	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
matter	NULL
how	NULL
preposterous	NULL
,	NULL
returned	NULL
with	NULL
redoubled	NULL
strength	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
expected	NULL
from	NULL
anyone	NULL
placed	NULL
as	NULL
Ernest	NULL
now	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
antecedents	NULL
are	NULL
remembered	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
surprised	NULL
and	NULL
disappointed	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
cooler-headed	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
friends	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
well	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
ability	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
himself	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
religion	NULL
was	NULL
incompatible	NULL
with	NULL
half	NULL
measures	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
with	NULL
compromise	NULL
.	NULL

Circumstances	NULL
had	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
being	NULL
ordained	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sorry	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
through	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
therefore	NULL
set	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
expected	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
act	NULL
accordingly	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
rector	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
moderate	NULL
High	NULL
Churchman	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
very	NULL
pronounced	NULL
views	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
elderly	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
too	NULL
many	NULL
curates	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
long	NULL
since	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
connection	NULL
between	NULL
rector	NULL
and	NULL
curate	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
between	NULL
employer	NULL
and	NULL
employed	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
other	NULL
walk	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
two	NULL
curates	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
junior	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
senior	NULL
curate	NULL
was	NULL
named	NULL
Pryer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
this	NULL
gentleman	NULL
made	NULL
advances	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
presently	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
Ernest	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
forlorn	NULL
state	NULL
was	NULL
delighted	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Pryer	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
twenty-eight	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
Eton	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
Oxford	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
generally	NULL
for	NULL
good-looking	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
only	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
once	NULL
for	NULL
about	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
thought	NULL
him	NULL
odious	NULL
both	NULL
in	NULL
manners	NULL
and	NULL
appearance	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
caught	NULL
me	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
quoted	NULL
Shakespeare	NULL
for	NULL
lack	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
fill	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
sentence	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
nature	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
world	NULL
kin	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ah	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Pryer	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
bold	NULL
,	NULL
brazen	NULL
way	NULL
which	NULL
displeased	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
unnatural	NULL
makes	NULL
it	NULL
more	NULL
kindred	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
me	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
bore	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
two	NULL
straws	NULL
whether	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
shocked	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

Naturally	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
this	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
anticipating	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
till	NULL
Ernest	NULL

three	NULL

I	NULL
happened	NULL

meet	NULL
his	NULL
fellow-curate	NULL

I	NULL
must	NULL
deal	NULL
here	NULL
rather	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
he	NULL
produced	NULL
upon	NULL
my	NULL
godson	NULL
than	NULL
upon	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
being	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
generally	NULL
considered	NULL
good-looking	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
faultless	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
get-up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
altogether	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
man	NULL
whom	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
in	NULL
by	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
style	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
dress	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
High	NULL
Church	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
acquaintances	NULL
were	NULL
exclusively	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
extreme	NULL
High	NULL
Church	NULL
party	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
his	NULL
views	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
background	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
rector	NULL
's	NULL
presence	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
gentleman	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
askance	NULL
on	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
Pryer	NULL
's	NULL

,	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
such	NULL
ground	NULL
of	NULL
complaint	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
sever	NULL
the	NULL
connection	NULL
.	NULL

Pryer	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
popular	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pulpit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
take	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
probable	NULL
that	NULL
many	NULL
worse	NULL
curates	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Pryer	NULL
called	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
were	NULL
alone	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
eyed	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
penetrating	NULL
glance	NULL
and	NULL
seemed	NULL
not	NULL
dissatisfied	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
say	NULL
here	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
improved	NULL
in	NULL
personal	NULL
appearance	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
genial	NULL
treatment	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
received	NULL
at	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
.	NULL

Pryer	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
approved	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
to	NULL
treat	NULL
him	NULL
civilly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
immediately	NULL
won	NULL
by	NULL
anyone	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
long	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
High	NULL
Church	NULL
party	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
Rome	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
for	NULL
themselves	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
snipe-like	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
flight	NULL
.	NULL

Pryer	NULL
introduced	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
several	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
young	NULL
clergymen	NULL
,	NULL
belonging	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
highest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
High	NULL
Church	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
they	NULL
resembled	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
when	NULL
among	NULL
themselves	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
shock	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
ere	NULL
long	NULL
a	NULL
still	NULL
greater	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
that	NULL
certain	NULL
thoughts	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
warred	NULL
against	NULL
as	NULL
fatal	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
imagined	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
lose	NULL
once	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
on	NULL
ordination	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
as	NULL
troublesome	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
also	NULL
saw	NULL
plainly	NULL
enough	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
who	NULL
formed	NULL
the	NULL
circle	NULL
of	NULL
Pryer	NULL
's	NULL
friends	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
unhappy	NULL
predicament	NULL
as	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
deplorable	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
way	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
get	NULL
married	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
any	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
rather	NULL
die	NULL
than	NULL
marry	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL
's	NULL
main	NULL
objects	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
succeeded	NULL
that	NULL
women	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
mysterious	NULL
,	NULL
inscrutable	NULL
objects	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
tolerated	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sought	NULL
out	NULL
or	NULL
encouraged	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
man	NULL
loving	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
being	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
supposed	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
professed	NULL
such	NULL
sentiments	NULL
were	NULL
liars	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
hoped	NULL
against	NULL
hope	NULL
too	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
ask	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
listen	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
married	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
broached	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
Pryer	NULL

and	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL

Why	NULL

my	NULL

you	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

deal	NULL

do	NULL

he	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
a	NULL

her	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL

a	NULL
forlorn	NULL

failure	NULL

therefore	NULL

almost	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LIII	NULL
The	NULL

impression	NULL
upon	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL

If	NULL

taken	NULL
a	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
struck	NULL

and	NULL
as	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
fling	NULL
off	NULL
what	NULL
Pryer	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
now	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
aside	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
heard	NULL
from	NULL
anyone	NULL
except	NULL
Pryer	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hawke	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
Pryer	NULL
had	NULL
everything	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

Embryo	NULL
minds	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL

a	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
strange	NULL
metamorphoses	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
adopt	NULL
their	NULL
final	NULL
shape	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
wondered	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
Roman	NULL
Catholic	NULL

should	NULL
have	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
stages	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
first	NULL
a	NULL
Methodist	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL

a	NULL

thinker	NULL

than	NULL
that	NULL

man	NULL

at	NULL
some	NULL

have	NULL

a	NULL

cell	NULL

on	NULL

Embryos	NULL
think	NULL
with	NULL
each	NULL

their	NULL
development	NULL

they	NULL
have	NULL

What	NULL
we	NULL
call	NULL
death	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
shock	NULL
great	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
destroy	NULL
our	NULL
power	NULL
to	NULL
recognise	NULL
a	NULL
past	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
present	NULL
as	NULL
resembling	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
making	NULL
us	NULL
consider	NULL
the	NULL
points	NULL
of	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL
our	NULL
present	NULL
and	NULL
our	NULL
past	NULL
greater	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
points	NULL
of	NULL
resemblance	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
can	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
call	NULL
the	NULL
former	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
proper	NULL
sense	NULL
a	NULL
continuation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

find	NULL
it	NULL
less	NULL

for	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL

them	NULL

At	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL

pretty	NULL
well	NULL
abreast	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL

and	NULL
rather	NULL
chuckle	NULL
at	NULL
seeing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
already	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
modify	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
views	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
most	NULL
strongly	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
first	NULL
knew	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

however	NULL

he	NULL

I	NULL
proposed	NULL

therefore	NULL

a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Pryer	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
fell	NULL
in	NULL
eagerly	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
proposal	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL

carrying	NULL

out	NULL

that	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
set	NULL
on	NULL
foot	NULL

movement	NULL
somewhat	NULL
analogous	NULL

For	NULL
this	NULL

I	NULL
see	NULL
nothing	NULL

the	NULL

if	NULL

The	NULL

we	NULL
want	NULL

10,000	NULL

so	NULL
Pryer	NULL
says	NULL

before	NULL
we	NULL

start	NULL

when	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
fairly	NULL

live	NULL

draw	NULL
a	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL

all	NULL

nearly	NULL

whether	NULL
I	NULL
invest	NULL

Still	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL

see	NULL
my	NULL
way	NULL

as	NULL
much	NULL

as	NULL
I	NULL

Pryer	NULL
suggests	NULL
that	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
can	NULL

more	NULL
now	NULL
we	NULL

Pryer	NULL
knows	NULL
several	NULL

make	NULL

Pryer	NULL
says	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
soon	NULL
learn	NULL

he	NULL
thinks	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
shown	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
talent	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
direction	NULL

and	NULL
under	NULL
proper	NULL
auspices	NULL
should	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
man	NULL

Others	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL

not	NULL
I	NULL

must	NULL
decide	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL

a	NULL
man	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
gives	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL

though	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
about	NULL
having	NULL
more	NULL
money	NULL

my	NULL
own	NULL

I	NULL
care	NULL
about	NULL

very	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
by	NULL
saving	NULL
souls	NULL
from	NULL
such	NULL
horrible	NULL

hereafter	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
succeeds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
really	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
hinder	NULL
it	NULL

it	NULL
is	NULL
hardly	NULL
possible	NULL

exaggerate	NULL
its	NULL

the	NULL
proportions	NULL

it	NULL
may	NULL
ultimately	NULL
assume	NULL

Again	NULL
I	NULL
asked	NULL
Ernest	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
minded	NULL
my	NULL
printing	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
winced	NULL
,	NULL

said	NULL

I	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
reader	NULL
see	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
how	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
in	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL

Very	NULL
well	NULL

keep	NULL

I	NULL
continue	NULL
turning	NULL
over	NULL
my	NULL

was	NULL
sure	NULL

something	NULL
unusual	NULL

went	NULL

that	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL

idea	NULL

Christina	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
restrain	NULL
herself	NULL
when	NULL
on	NULL
sounding	NULL
her	NULL
clerical	NULL
neighbours	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
them	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
applaud	NULL
her	NULL
son	NULL
for	NULL
conduct	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
idealised	NULL
into	NULL
something	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
self-denying	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
really	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
like	NULL
his	NULL
living	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
unaristocratic	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
get	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
newspapers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
great	NULL
people	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
cheap	NULL
;	NULL
down	NULL
among	NULL
these	NULL
poor	NULL
people	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
live	NULL
for	NULL
next	NULL

nothing	NULL

might	NULL
put	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL

As	NULL

there	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
few	NULL

none	NULL

This	NULL
argument	NULL
about	NULL
cheapness	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
most	NULL
successfully	NULL
met	NULL
Theobald	NULL

who	NULL
grumbled	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
sympathy	NULL
with	NULL

When	NULL
Christina	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
cheap	NULL
he	NULL
replied	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
Ernest	NULL
himself	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
confirm	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
opinion	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL

been	NULL
growing	NULL

came	NULL

had	NULL

not	NULL
very	NULL
long	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
new	NULL
rooms	NULL

I	NULL
liked	NULL

except	NULL

the	NULL
common	NULL
bond	NULL
of	NULL
music	NULL

never	NULL
either	NULL

afterwards	NULL

I	NULL
fear	NULL

called	NULL
herself	NULL
"	NULL

wore	NULL

ring	NULL

spoke	NULL

should	NULL

been	NULL

did	NULL

like	NULL

to	NULL
be	NULL

best	NULL
behaviour	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
butter	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
melt	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
remembered	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
yesterday	NULL
and	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
and	NULL
Tuesday	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
more	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
Sunday	NULL
itself	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
kitten	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
pins	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
toes	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
Alethea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
fast	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
accumulating	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
use	NULL
it	NULL
probably	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
last	NULL
ways	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
Miss	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
sympathised	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
annoyed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
always	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
to	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
mess	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
as	NULL
great	NULL
a	NULL
mess	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
perhaps	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
like	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
behaved	NULL
quite	NULL
nicely	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
own	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
fault	NULL
was	NULL
mine	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
drew	NULL
towards	NULL
dangerous	NULL
subjects	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
aggressor	NULL

presuming	NULL

suppose	NULL
upon	NULL
my	NULL
age	NULL

long	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL

giving	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
myself	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
exasperating	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
point	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

Grant	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
premises	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
conclusions	NULL
were	NULL
sound	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
could	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
ordained	NULL

join	NULL

him	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
premises	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL

have	NULL
done	NULL

had	NULL
had	NULL

The	NULL
result	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
beat	NULL
a	NULL
retreat	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
liked	NULL
Ernest	NULL

and	NULL
was	NULL
vexed	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL

at	NULL
a	NULL

I	NULL
talked	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
with	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
way	NULL
out	NULL

She	NULL

I	NULL

reckoned	NULL

the	NULL

her	NULL

been	NULL
loosened	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
Ernest	NULL
would	NULL
die	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
too	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
so	NULL
sad	NULL
"	NULL
just	NULL
like	NULL
young	NULL
Watkins	NULL

died	NULL
a	NULL

They	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL

I	NULL
met	NULL

it	NULL

So	NULL
they	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL

they	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL

him	NULL

he	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL

n't	NULL

"	NULL
Here	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
on	NULL
an	NULL
errand	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
neighbour	NULL
and	NULL
interrupted	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
form	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL
where	NULL
or	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
ended	NULL
her	NULL
discourse	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
seized	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
before	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
five	NULL
shillings	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
write	NULL
down	NULL
my	NULL
address	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
frightened	NULL
by	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
her	NULL
lodger	NULL
grew	NULL
worse	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

Weeks	NULL
went	NULL
by	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
done	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
absolved	NULL
from	NULL
doing	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
Ernest	NULL
alone	NULL
as	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
only	NULL
bore	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
been	NULL
ordained	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
over	NULL
four	NULL
months	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
these	NULL
months	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
brought	NULL
happiness	NULL
or	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
expected	NULL
perhaps	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
pretty	NULL
much	NULL
what	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
country	NULL
clergyman	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
formed	NULL
an	NULL
ideal	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
regards	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
town	NULL
clergyman	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
feeble	NULL
tentative	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
realise	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
somehow	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
it	NULL
always	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
escape	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
lived	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
proved	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
mistaken	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
indeed	NULL
visit	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
tame	NULL
pets	NULL
whom	NULL
his	NULL
rector	NULL
desired	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
next	NULL
door	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
plumber	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
Chesterfield	NULL
;	NULL
an	NULL
aged	NULL
lady	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
Gover	NULL
,	NULL
blind	NULL
and	NULL
bed-ridden	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
munched	NULL
and	NULL
munched	NULL
her	NULL
feeble	NULL
old	NULL
toothless	NULL
jaws	NULL
as	NULL
Ernest	NULL
spoke	NULL
or	NULL
read	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
Mr	NULL
Brookes	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
rag	NULL
and	NULL
bottle	NULL
merchant	NULL
in	NULL
Birdsey	NULL

Rents	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL

of	NULL
dropsy	NULL

and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
others	NULL

What	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
plumber	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
flattered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
liked	NULL
fooling	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
into	NULL
wasting	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
by	NULL
scratching	NULL
his	NULL
ears	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Gover	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
old	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
wanted	NULL
money	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
and	NULL
meek	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Ernest	NULL
got	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
shilling	NULL
from	NULL
Lady	NULL
Anne	NULL
Jones	NULL
's	NULL
bequest	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
"	NULL
small	NULL
but	NULL
seasonable	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
munched	NULL
and	NULL
munched	NULL
in	NULL
gratitude	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
sometimes	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
money	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
says	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
do	NULL
else	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
smallest	NULL
use	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL

Nothing	NULL
indeed	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
giving	NULL
occasional	NULL
half-crowns	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Gover	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
regenerating	NULL
the	NULL
universe	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
wanted	NULL
nothing	NULL
short	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
joint	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
feeling	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
cursed	NULL
spite	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
born	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
it	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
person	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
wanted	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
job	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
eager	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
exactly	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
with	NULL
Mr	NULL
Chesterfield	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Gover	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
promise	NULL
great	NULL
developments	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
poor	NULL
Mr	NULL
Brookes	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
suffered	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
terribly	NULL
indeed	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
sometimes	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
and	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
serious-minded	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
death	NULL
frightened	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
frighten	NULL
anyone	NULL
who	NULL
believes	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
most	NULL
secret	NULL
thoughts	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
shortly	NULL
exposed	NULL
in	NULL
public	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
read	NULL
Ernest	NULL
the	NULL
description	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
visit	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Thompson	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
coloured	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
just	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Brookes	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Ernest	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
visits	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
comforting	NULL
Mr	NULL
Brookes	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
fear	NULL
death	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
how	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

Even	NULL
Pryer	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
curate	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
personally	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
hundred	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
parish	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
outside	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
houses	NULL
of	NULL
very	NULL
few	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
ever	NULL
visited	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
Pryer	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
objection	NULL
on	NULL
principle	NULL
to	NULL
house	NULL
visitations	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
a	NULL
drop	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
were	NULL
those	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
Pryer	NULL
were	NULL
brought	NULL
into	NULL
direct	NULL
communication	NULL
in	NULL
comparison	NULL
with	NULL
those	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
reach	NULL
and	NULL
move	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
produce	NULL
much	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
way	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
between	NULL
fifteen	NULL
and	NULL
twenty	NULL
thousand	NULL
poor	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
parish	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
merest	NULL
fraction	NULL
ever	NULL
attended	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
worship	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
few	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
dissenting	NULL
chapels	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
were	NULL
Roman	NULL
Catholics	NULL
;	NULL
by	NULL
far	NULL
the	NULL

however	NULL

were	NULL
practically	NULL
infidels	NULL

if	NULL
not	NULL
actively	NULL
hostile	NULL

at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
indifferent	NULL

many	NULL
were	NULL
avowed	NULL
Atheists	NULL

admirers	NULL
of	NULL
Tom	NULL
Paine	NULL

of	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
now	NULL
heard	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
met	NULL
and	NULL
conversed	NULL
with	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
he	NULL
really	NULL
doing	NULL
everything	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
other	NULL
young	NULL
clergymen	NULL
did	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
answer	NULL
which	NULL
Jesus	NULL

was	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL

why	NULL

the	NULL
Pharisees	NULL
themselves	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
probability	NULL
did	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
Pharisees	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
do	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
highways	NULL
and	NULL
byways	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
compel	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
he	NULL
doing	NULL
this	NULL
?	NULL

Or	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
they	NULL
rather	NULL
compelling	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
out	NULL
--	NULL
outside	NULL
their	NULL
doors	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
uneasy	NULL
feeling	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
ere	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
unless	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
a	NULL
sharp	NULL
look	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
drift	NULL
into	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
sham	NULL
.	NULL

True	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
changed	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
endow	NULL
the	NULL
College	NULL
for	NULL
Spiritual	NULL

In	NULL

it	NULL

much	NULL
higher	NULL
in	NULL
value	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
sell	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
tremendous	NULL
profit	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
unfortunately	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
higher	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
immediately	NULL
after	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
obstinately	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
settlements	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
frightened	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
an	NULL
article	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
newspaper	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
said	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
ever	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
lower	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
contrary	NULL
to	NULL
Pryer	NULL
's	NULL
advice	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
selling	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
500	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
hardly	NULL
sold	NULL
when	NULL
up	NULL
went	NULL
the	NULL
shares	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
how	NULL
foolish	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
wise	NULL
Pryer	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
if	NULL
Pryer	NULL
's	NULL
advice	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
followed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
500	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
losing	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
himself	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
live	NULL
and	NULL
learn	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Pryer	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
mistake	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
some	NULL
shares	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
shares	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
delightfully	NULL
for	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
happy	NULL
time	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
lost	NULL
500	NULL
pounds	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
recovered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
cleared	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bargain	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
feverish	NULL
anxiety	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
miserable	NULL
six	NULL
weeks	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
500	NULL
pounds	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
lost	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
being	NULL
repaid	NULL
with	NULL
interest	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
sell	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
sure	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
profit	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Pryer	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
hear	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
ever	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
higher	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
showed	NULL
Ernest	NULL
an	NULL
article	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
newspaper	NULL
which	NULL
proved	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
was	NULL
reasonable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
go	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
then	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
saw	NULL
first	NULL
his	NULL
clear	NULL
profit	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
500	NULL
pounds	NULL
loss	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
recovered	NULL
,	NULL
slipped	NULL
away	NULL
by	NULL
falls	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
lost	NULL
200	NULL
pounds	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
a	NULL
newspaper	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
these	NULL
shares	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
rubbish	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
imposed	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
public	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
could	NULL
stand	NULL
it	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
sold	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
again	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
against	NULL
Pryer	NULL
's	NULL
advice	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
shortly	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
Pryer	NULL
scored	NULL
off	NULL
Ernest	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
vicissitudes	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
anxious	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
health	NULL
was	NULL
affected	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
arranged	NULL
therefore	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
know	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

Pryer	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
business	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
relieved	NULL
Ernest	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
trouble	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
investments	NULL
themselves	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Pryer	NULL
justly	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
must	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL
heart	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
hopes	NULL
to	NULL
succeed	NULL
in	NULL
buying	NULL
and	NULL
selling	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
Stock	NULL
Exchange	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seeing	NULL
Ernest	NULL
nervous	NULL
made	NULL
Pryer	NULL
nervous	NULL
too	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
drifted	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
into	NULL
Pryer	NULL
's	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Pryer	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
curacy	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
allowance	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
of	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
old	NULL
friends	NULL
got	NULL
an	NULL
inkling	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
letters	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
their	NULL
utmost	NULL
to	NULL
dissuade	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
infatuated	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
lover	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
and	NULL
twenty	NULL
.	NULL

Finding	NULL
that	NULL
these	NULL
friends	NULL
disapproved	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
dropped	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
bored	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
egotism	NULL
and	NULL
high-flown	NULL
ideas	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
sorry	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
speculations	NULL
--	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
hardly	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
anything	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
so	NULL
good	NULL
a	NULL
cause	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
called	NULL
speculation	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
Battersby	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
urged	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
next	NULL
presentation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
brought	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
promising	NULL
ones	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
notice	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
objections	NULL
and	NULL
excuses	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
always	NULL
promising	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
desired	NULL
very	NULL
shortly	NULL
.	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LVI	NULL
By	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
subtle	NULL
,	NULL
indefinable	NULL
_	NULL
malaise	NULL
_	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
once	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
young	NULL
foal	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
some	NULL
most	NULL
objectionable	NULL
refuse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
its	NULL
mind	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
good	NULL
or	NULL
no	NULL
.	NULL

Clearly	NULL
it	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
told	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
its	NULL
mother	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
set	NULL
it	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
told	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
eating	NULL
was	NULL
filth	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
foal	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
recognised	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
told	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
foal	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
settle	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
for	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
its	NULL
mind	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
liked	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
or	NULL
no	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
assistance	NULL
from	NULL
without	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
by	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
wasting	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
trouble	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
look	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
mother	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
saved	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
wort	NULL
will	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
ferment	NULL
of	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
will	NULL
ferment	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
quickly	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
yeast	NULL
be	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
knowing	NULL
what	NULL
gives	NULL
us	NULL
pleasure	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
all	NULL
like	NULL
wort	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
unaided	NULL
from	NULL
without	NULL
can	NULL
only	NULL
ferment	NULL
slowly	NULL
and	NULL
toilsomely	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
unhappy	NULL
hero	NULL
about	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
foal	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
much	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
foal	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
if	NULL
its	NULL
mother	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
grown-up	NULL
horses	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
had	NULL
vowed	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
eating	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
excellent	NULL
and	NULL
nutritious	NULL
food	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
anywhere	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
knew	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
ventured	NULL
to	NULL
admit	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
hopelessly	NULL
wrong	NULL
tack	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
occur	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
blunder	NULL
anywhere	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
less	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
occur	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
and	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
blunder	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
daily	NULL
more	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
_	NULL
malaise	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
daily	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
ripe	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
explosion	NULL
should	NULL
a	NULL
spark	NULL
fall	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
begin	NULL
to	NULL
loom	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
vagueness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
instinctively	NULL
turned	NULL
as	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
seize	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
saving	NULL
very	NULL
few	NULL
souls	NULL
,	NULL
whereas	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
thousands	NULL
and	NULL
thousands	NULL
being	NULL
lost	NULL
hourly	NULL
all	NULL
around	NULL
him	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
energy	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hawke	NULL
's	NULL
might	NULL
save	NULL
.	NULL

Day	NULL
after	NULL
day	NULL
went	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
doing	NULL
?	NULL

Standing	NULL
on	NULL
professional	NULL
_	NULL
etiquette	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
praying	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
shares	NULL
might	NULL
go	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
money	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
enable	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
regenerate	NULL
the	NULL
universe	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
meantime	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
dying	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
many	NULL
souls	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
doomed	NULL
to	NULL
endless	NULL
ages	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
frightful	NULL
torments	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
bring	NULL
his	NULL
spiritual	NULL
pathology	NULL
engine	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
?	NULL

Why	NULL
might	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
stand	NULL
and	NULL
preach	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
Dissenters	NULL
doing	NULL
sometimes	NULL
in	NULL
Lincoln	NULL
's	NULL
Inn	NULL
Fields	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
thoroughfares	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
say	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hawke	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Hawke	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
poor	NULL
creature	NULL
in	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Low	NULL
Churchman	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
above	NULL
learning	NULL
from	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
surely	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
affect	NULL
his	NULL
hearers	NULL
as	NULL
powerfully	NULL
as	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hawke	NULL
had	NULL
affected	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
courage	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
people	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
preaching	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
squares	NULL
sometimes	NULL
drew	NULL
large	NULL
audiences	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
preach	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
they	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
broached	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
Pryer	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
treated	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
something	NULL
too	NULL
outrageous	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
even	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
more	NULL
tend	NULL
to	NULL
lower	NULL
the	NULL
dignity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
clergy	NULL
and	NULL
bring	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
into	NULL
contempt	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
manner	NULL
was	NULL
brusque	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
rude	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
ventured	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
mild	NULL
dissent	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
admitted	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
something	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
Wesley	NULL
and	NULL
Whitfield	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
that	NULL
great	NULL
movement	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
kindled	NULL
religious	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
minds	NULL
of	NULL
hundreds	NULL
of	NULL
thousands	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
standing	NULL
on	NULL
dignity	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
because	NULL
Wesley	NULL
and	NULL
Whitfield	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
won	NULL
men	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
them	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
lost	NULL
.	NULL

Pryer	NULL
eyed	NULL
Ernest	NULL
searchingly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
pause	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL

you	NULL
are	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL

very	NULL
right	NULL

I	NULL
agree	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
heartily	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL

but	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL

a	NULL
way	NULL
which	NULL

there	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LVII	NULL
He	NULL
had	NULL
hardly	NULL
parted	NULL
from	NULL
Pryer	NULL
before	NULL
there	NULL
occurred	NULL
another	NULL
incident	NULL
which	NULL
strengthened	NULL
his	NULL
discontent	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
shown	NULL
,	NULL
among	NULL
a	NULL
gang	NULL
of	NULL
spiritual	NULL
thieves	NULL
or	NULL
coiners	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
basest	NULL
metal	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
without	NULL
his	NULL
finding	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
childish	NULL
and	NULL
inexperienced	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ways	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
but	NULL
those	NULL
back	NULL
eddies	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
schools	NULL
and	NULL
universities	NULL
.	NULL

Among	NULL
the	NULL
bad	NULL
threepenny	NULL
pieces	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
passed	NULL
off	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
for	NULL
small	NULL
hourly	NULL
disbursement	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
remark	NULL
that	NULL
poor	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
much	NULL
nicer	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
richer	NULL
and	NULL
better	NULL
educated	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
now	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
travelled	NULL
third	NULL
class	NULL
not	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
cheaper	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
in	NULL
third	NULL
class	NULL
carriages	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
pleasanter	NULL
and	NULL
better	NULL
behaved	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
attended	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
evening	NULL
classes	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
pronounced	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
intelligent	NULL
and	NULL
better	NULL
ordered	NULL
generally	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
average	NULL
run	NULL
of	NULL
Oxford	NULL
and	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

Our	NULL
foolish	NULL
young	NULL
friend	NULL
having	NULL
heard	NULL
Pryer	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
effect	NULL
,	NULL
caught	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
and	NULL
reproduced	NULL
it	NULL
_	NULL
more	NULL
suo	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
should	NULL
he	NULL
see	NULL
coming	NULL
along	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
street	NULL
not	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
persons	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
Towneley	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
as	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
spirits	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
possible	NULL
even	NULL
handsomer	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
.	NULL

Much	NULL
as	NULL
Ernest	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
shrinking	NULL
from	NULL
speaking	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
endeavouring	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
him	NULL
without	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
when	NULL
Towneley	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
stopped	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
pleased	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
confused	NULL
at	NULL
being	NULL
seen	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
recovered	NULL
himself	NULL
so	NULL
soon	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
hardly	NULL
noticed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
plunged	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
kindly	NULL
remarks	NULL
about	NULL
old	NULL
times	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
quailed	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
Towneley	NULL
's	NULL
eye	NULL
wander	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
white	NULL
necktie	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
reckoned	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rather	NULL
disapprovingly	NULL
reckoned	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
parson	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
merest	NULL
passing	NULL
shade	NULL
upon	NULL
Towneley	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Towneley	NULL
said	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
common	NULL
form	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
profession	NULL
as	NULL
being	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
most	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
interest	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
confused	NULL
and	NULL
shy	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
lack	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
his	NULL
little	NULL
threepenny-bit	NULL
about	NULL
poor	NULL
people	NULL
being	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL
.	NULL

Towneley	NULL
took	NULL
this	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
and	NULL
nodded	NULL
assent	NULL
,	NULL
whereon	NULL
Ernest	NULL
imprudently	NULL
went	NULL
further	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
like	NULL
poor	NULL
people	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
yourself	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Towneley	NULL
gave	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
a	NULL
comical	NULL
but	NULL
good-natured	NULL
screw	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
quietly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
slowly	NULL
and	NULL
decidedly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
escaped	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
with	NULL
Ernest	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
usual	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
entered	NULL
none	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
upon	NULL
another	NULL
reaction	NULL
.	NULL

Towneley	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
taken	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
threepenny-bit	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
returned	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
see	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
one	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
Pryer	NULL
?	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
some	NULL
poor	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
always	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
scales	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
suddenly	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
nicer	NULL
for	NULL
being	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
upper	NULL
and	NULL
lower	NULL
classes	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
gulf	NULL
which	NULL
amounted	NULL
practically	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
impassable	NULL
barrier	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
evening	NULL
he	NULL
reflected	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Towneley	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
No	NULL
"	NULL
had	NULL
applied	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
remark	NULL
about	NULL
poor	NULL
people	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
scheme	NULL
and	NULL
scope	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
recently	NULL
adopted	NULL
ideas	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
Pryer	NULL
must	NULL
surely	NULL
be	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
wrong	NULL
track	NULL
.	NULL

Towneley	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
argued	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
one	NULL
word	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shortest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
language	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fit	NULL
state	NULL
for	NULL
inoculation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
minute	NULL
particle	NULL
of	NULL
virus	NULL
set	NULL
about	NULL
working	NULL
immediately	NULL
.	NULL

Which	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
now	NULL
think	NULL
was	NULL
most	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
juster	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whom	NULL
would	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
imitate	NULL
,	NULL
Towneley	NULL
or	NULL
Pryer	NULL
?	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
returned	NULL
answer	NULL
to	NULL
itself	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
's	NULL
hesitation	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
faces	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
like	NULL
Towneley	NULL
were	NULL
open	NULL
and	NULL
kindly	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
at	NULL
ease	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
set	NULL
all	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
ease	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
faces	NULL
of	NULL
Pryer	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
tacitly	NULL
rebuked	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
Towneley	NULL
?	NULL

Was	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
Christian	NULL
?	NULL

Certainly	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
how	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
be	NULL
himself	NULL
wrong	NULL
in	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
act	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
faith	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
Towneley	NULL
held	NULL
in	NULL
common	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
lead	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
,	NULL
unobtrusive	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
self-devotion	NULL
,	NULL
whereas	NULL
Towneley	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
comfortably	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
nice	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
nice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
such	NULL
men	NULL
as	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
Pryer	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
nice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
dejection	NULL
came	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
came	NULL
an	NULL
even	NULL
worse	NULL
reflection	NULL
;	NULL
how	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
among	NULL
material	NULL
thieves	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
spiritual	NULL
ones	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
now	NULL
into	NULL
Pryer	NULL
's	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
Pryer	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
cash	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
impatient	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
questioned	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
done	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
principal	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
understanding	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
stick	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
Pryer	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
throw	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
College	NULL
of	NULL
Spiritual	NULL
Pathology	NULL
altogether	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
cowed	NULL
into	NULL
acquiescence	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
cajoled	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
humour	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Pryer	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
further	NULL
questions	NULL
would	NULL
look	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
doubted	NULL
Pryer	NULL
's	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
too	NULL
far	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
recede	NULL
in	NULL
decency	NULL
or	NULL
honour	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
was	NULL
riding	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
trouble	NULL
unnecessarily	NULL
.	NULL

Pryer	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
impatient	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
admirable	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
would	NULL
doubtless	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
some	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
comforted	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
regards	NULL
this	NULL
last	NULL
source	NULL
of	NULL
anxiety	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
regards	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
saved	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
Samaritan	NULL
must	NULL
hurry	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
somewhere	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
whence	NULL
.	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LVIII	NULL
Next	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
stronger	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evil	NULL
one	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
parley	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
thoughts	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
chosen	NULL
his	NULL
profession	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
persevere	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
unhappy	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
probably	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
giving	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
for	NULL
Christ	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
him	NULL
see	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
shed	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
path	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
discovery	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
like	NULL
poor	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
must	NULL
lie	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
men	NULL
as	NULL
Towneley	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
kind	NULL
and	NULL
considerate	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
well	NULL
enough	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
on	NULL
condition	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
preach	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
manage	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
let	NULL
Pryer	NULL
sneer	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
more	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
try	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
bringing	NULL
Christ	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
seek	NULL
Christ	NULL
of	NULL
themselves	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
begin	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
then	NULL
should	NULL
he	NULL
take	NULL
first	NULL
?	NULL

Surely	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
begin	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
tailor	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
immediately	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
desirable	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
most	NULL
in	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
conversion	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
also	NULL
because	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
once	NULL
converted	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
beat	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
at	NULL
two	NULL
o'clock	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
much	NULL
pleasanter	NULL
in	NULL
consequence	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
therefore	NULL
go	NULL
upstairs	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
talk	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
well	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
up	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
plan	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
campaign	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
therefore	NULL
reflected	NULL
over	NULL
some	NULL
pretty	NULL
conversations	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
very	NULL
nicely	NULL
if	NULL
Mr	NULL
Holt	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
kind	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
answers	NULL
proposed	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
proper	NULL
places	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
hulking	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
savage	NULL
temper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
admit	NULL
that	NULL
unforeseen	NULL
developments	NULL
might	NULL
arise	NULL
to	NULL
disconcert	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
takes	NULL
nine	NULL
tailors	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Ernest	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
nine	NULL
Ernests	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
Mr	NULL
Holt	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
if	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
Ernest	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
tailor	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
violent	NULL
and	NULL
abusive	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL

Mr	NULL
Holt	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
lodgings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
undisturbed	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
legal	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
a	NULL
moral	NULL
right	NULL
?	NULL

Ernest	NULL
thought	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
considering	NULL
his	NULL
mode	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
put	NULL
this	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
violent	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
should	NULL
he	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL

Paul	NULL
had	NULL
fought	NULL
with	NULL
wild	NULL
beasts	NULL
at	NULL
Ephesus	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
must	NULL
indeed	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
awful	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
perhaps	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
wild	NULL
wild	NULL
beasts	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
rabbit	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
canary	NULL
are	NULL
wild	NULL
beasts	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
formidable	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
wild	NULL
beasts	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
stand	NULL
no	NULL
chance	NULL
against	NULL
St	NULL
Paul	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
inspired	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
miracle	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
wild	NULL
beasts	NULL
escaped	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
that	NULL
St	NULL
Paul	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
Ernest	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
begin	NULL
to	NULL
convert	NULL
Mr	NULL
Holt	NULL
by	NULL
fighting	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Holt	NULL
screaming	NULL
"	NULL
murder	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
cowered	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
clothes	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
,	NULL
expecting	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
blood	NULL
dripping	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
ceiling	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
floor	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
imagination	NULL
translated	NULL
every	NULL
sound	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
pat	NULL
,	NULL
pat	NULL
,	NULL
pat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
dropping	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
counterpane	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
gone	NULL
upstairs	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
and	NULL
rescue	NULL
poor	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Holt	NULL
.	NULL

Happily	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
proved	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Holt	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
usual	NULL
health	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
despair	NULL
about	NULL
hitting	NULL
on	NULL
any	NULL
good	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
opening	NULL
up	NULL
spiritual	NULL
communication	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
neighbour	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
perhaps	NULL
begin	NULL
by	NULL
going	NULL
upstairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
knocking	NULL
very	NULL
gently	NULL
at	NULL
Mr	NULL
Holt	NULL
's	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
then	NULL
resign	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
guidance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Holy	NULL
Spirit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
act	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
another	NULL
name	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Holy	NULL
Spirit	NULL
,	NULL
suggested	NULL
.	NULL

Triply	NULL
armed	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
reflection	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
mounted	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
quite	NULL
jauntily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
knock	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
Holt	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
inside	NULL
swearing	NULL
savagely	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
pause	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
whether	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
auspicious	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
pausing	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Holt	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
someone	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
,	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
offensive	NULL
movement	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
or	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
directed	NULL
at	NULL
Ernest	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
altogether	NULL
so	NULL
ugly	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
instantaneous	NULL
and	NULL
unequivocal	NULL
revelation	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Holy	NULL
Spirit	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
continue	NULL
his	NULL
journey	NULL
upstairs	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
intended	NULL
arresting	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
Mr	NULL
Holt	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
begin	NULL
by	NULL
converting	NULL
Mr	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Baxter	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Methodists	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
floor	NULL
front	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
good	NULL
people	NULL
received	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
open	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
quite	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
convert	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
Methodism	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
by	NULL
discovering	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
convert	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
Methodism	NULL
beyond	NULL
its	NULL
name	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Baxter	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Wesleyans	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
vigorous	NULL
system	NULL
of	NULL
Church	NULL
discipline	NULL
(	NULL
which	NULL
worked	NULL
admirably	NULL
in	NULL
practice	NULL
)	NULL
it	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
John	NULL
Wesley	NULL
had	NULL
anticipated	NULL
the	NULL
spiritual	NULL
engine	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
Pryer	NULL
were	NULL
preparing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
caught	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
spiritual	NULL
Tartar	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
certainly	NULL
explain	NULL
to	NULL
Pryer	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Wesleyans	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
system	NULL
of	NULL
Church	NULL
discipline	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
important	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Baxter	NULL
advised	NULL
Ernest	NULL
on	NULL
no	NULL
account	NULL
to	NULL
meddle	NULL
with	NULL
Mr	NULL
Holt	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
relieved	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
advice	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL
arose	NULL
of	NULL
touching	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
pat	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
them	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ingratiate	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
dared	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
sturdy	NULL
youngsters	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
even	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
ready	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
tongues	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
knew	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
ages	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
indeed	NULL
be	NULL
almost	NULL
better	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
millstone	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
hanged	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
cast	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
offend	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
Holts	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
try	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
offend	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
perhaps	NULL
an	NULL
occasional	NULL
penny	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
might	NULL
square	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
instant	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
season	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
season	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
St	NULL
Paul	NULL
's	NULL
injunction	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
,	NULL
end	NULL
in	NULL
failure	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Baxter	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
bad	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Emily	NULL
Snow	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
lodged	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
floor	NULL
back	NULL
next	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Holt	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
story	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
the	NULL
landlady	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
doubtless	NULL
be	NULL
only	NULL
too	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
ministrations	NULL
or	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
gentleman	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
governess	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ballet	NULL
at	NULL
Drury	NULL
Lane	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
besides	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
bad	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Baxter	NULL
was	NULL
landlady	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
she	NULL
indeed	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Maitland	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
room	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Baxter	NULL
's	NULL
own	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
and	NULL
respectable	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
appearance	NULL
;	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Baxter	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
known	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
goings	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
quarter	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
bless	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
waters	NULL
run	NULL
deep	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
these	NULL
girls	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
alike	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
as	NULL
bad	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
kinds	NULL
of	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
knew	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
pay	NULL
much	NULL
heed	NULL
to	NULL
these	NULL
aspersions	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Baxter	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
many	NULL
blind	NULL
sides	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
warned	NULL
him	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Baxter	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
lip	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
awful	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
women	NULL
were	NULL
always	NULL
jealous	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
certainly	NULL
these	NULL
young	NULL
women	NULL
were	NULL
more	NULL
attractive	NULL
than	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Baxter	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
jealousy	NULL
was	NULL
probably	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
maligned	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
objection	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
making	NULL
their	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
maligned	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
ministrations	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
reclaim	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
intention	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
dissuade	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
seeing	NULL
him	NULL
resolute	NULL
,	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL

prevent	NULL
her	NULL

his	NULL

She	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

Mrs	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LIX	NULL
Before	NULL
going	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
to	NULL
convert	NULL
the	NULL
tinker	NULL
Ernest	NULL
ran	NULL
hurriedly	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
analysis	NULL
of	NULL

put	NULL
into	NULL

pocket	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
descended	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
rotten	NULL
old	NULL
stairs	NULL
and	NULL
knocked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
tinker	NULL
's	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Shaw	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
civil	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
throng	NULL
just	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
Ernest	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mind	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
hammering	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
glad	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
talk	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL

Our	NULL
hero	NULL
,	NULL
assenting	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL

Mr	NULL

very	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
what	NULL

masterpiece	NULL

and	NULL
cogency	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Mr	NULL
Shaw	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sly	NULL
twinkle	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
willing	NULL
and	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
prove	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL

be	NULL
equally	NULL
able	NULL

willing	NULL

that	NULL
what	NULL

if	NULL
it	NULL
suited	NULL
his	NULL
purpose	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
taken	NULL
aback	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
clever	NULL
people	NULL
of	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
simple	NULL
rejoinder	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
answer	NULL
is	NULL
easy	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
develop	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
reason	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
hen	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
developed	NULL
webbed	NULL
feet	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
Evolution	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
know	NULL
anything	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
principle	NULL
that	NULL
underlies	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
continued	NULL
Mr	NULL
Shaw	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
these	NULL
writers	NULL
all	NULL

their	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL
more	NULL

You	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
another	NULL
facer	NULL

Ernest	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
stammer	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
endeavoured	NULL
to	NULL
examine	NULL
these	NULL
questions	NULL
as	NULL
carefully	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

Mr	NULL

"	NULL
you	NULL

Ernest	NULL
expressed	NULL
his	NULL
readiness	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
questioned	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
tinker	NULL

"	NULL
give	NULL
me	NULL
the	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
sorry	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
mixed	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
four	NULL
accounts	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
deplorable	NULL
manner	NULL

he	NULL
even	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
angel	NULL

down	NULL

roll	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
stone	NULL
and	NULL
sit	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
confusion	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
tinker	NULL
first	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
book	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
many	NULL
inaccuracies	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
verified	NULL
his	NULL
criticisms	NULL
by	NULL
referring	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
New	NULL

itself	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL

said	NULL
Mr	NULL

good	NULL
naturedly	NULL

I	NULL

you	NULL

some	NULL

Now	NULL
go	NULL

Till	NULL
then	NULL

Sir	NULL

I	NULL
must	NULL
wish	NULL
you	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
morning	NULL

Ernest	NULL
retreated	NULL
abashed	NULL

An	NULL
hour	NULL
sufficed	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
perform	NULL
the	NULL
task	NULL
enjoined	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
Mr	NULL
Shaw	NULL

and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
that	NULL
hour	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
No	NULL

no	NULL

no	NULL

"	NULL
which	NULL
still	NULL
sounded	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
ears	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
Towneley	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
ringing	NULL
up	NULL
more	NULL
loudly	NULL
still	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
pages	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Bible	NULL
itself	NULL

and	NULL
in	NULL
respect	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
important	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
events	NULL

are	NULL
recorded	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL

Surely	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
first	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
attempt	NULL
at	NULL
more	NULL
promiscuous	NULL
visiting	NULL

at	NULL
carrying	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
principles	NULL
more	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
unfruitful	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
talk	NULL
with	NULL
Pryer	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
therefore	NULL
got	NULL
his	NULL
lunch	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Pryer	NULL
's	NULL
lodgings	NULL
.	NULL

Pryer	NULL
not	NULL
being	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL

he	NULL
lounged	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
British	NULL
Museum	NULL
Reading	NULL
Room	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
recently	NULL
opened	NULL

sent	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL

which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
yet	NULL
seen	NULL

and	NULL
spent	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
in	NULL
reading	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
Pryer	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
Mr	NULL
Shaw	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
temper	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
rarely	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
behaved	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
which	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
bode	NULL
well	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
harmony	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
College	NULL
of	NULL
Spiritual	NULL
Pathology	NULL
would	NULL
work	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
been	NULL
founded	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
almost	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
complete	NULL
moral	NULL
ascendency	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
creature	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
too	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
reflect	NULL
upon	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL
's	NULL
folly	NULL
and	NULL
inexperience	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
in	NULL
excuse	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
which	NULL
Pryer	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
faith	NULL
in	NULL
Pryer	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL
great	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
shaken	NULL
down	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
weakened	NULL
lately	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
fought	NULL
hard	NULL
against	NULL
allowing	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
any	NULL
third	NULL
person	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
connection	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
might	NULL
end	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
snipe-like	NULL
changes	NULL
of	NULL
flight	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
quick	NULL
in	NULL
making	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
intimacy	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
was	NULL
apparently	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
horrid	NULL
money	NULL
business	NULL
(	NULL
so	NULL
said	NULL
Ernest	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
)	NULL
that	NULL
caused	NULL
any	NULL
unpleasantness	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
Pryer	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
too	NULL
nervous	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
stand	NULL
over	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
like	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
received	NULL
a	NULL
shock	NULL
by	NULL
reason	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
Mr	NULL
Shaw	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Vestiges	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
stunned	NULL
to	NULL
realise	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
each	NULL
case	NULL
the	NULL
momentum	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
habits	NULL
carried	NULL
him	NULL
forward	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
direction	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
therefore	NULL
called	NULL
on	NULL
Pryer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
spent	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
visiting	NULL
among	NULL
his	NULL
neighbours	NULL
;	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
Pryer	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
red	NULL
rag	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
bull	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
only	NULL
talked	NULL
in	NULL
much	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
vein	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
proposed	NULL
College	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
lamentable	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
spiritual	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
characteristic	NULL
of	NULL
modern	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
kindred	NULL
matters	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
concluded	NULL
by	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
he	NULL
feared	NULL
Pryer	NULL
was	NULL
indeed	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
As	NULL
regards	NULL
the	NULL
laity	NULL

said	NULL
Pryer	NULL

"	NULL
nothing	NULL

Pryer	NULL
's	NULL
manner	NULL
was	NULL
strange	NULL
throughout	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
thinking	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
eyes	NULL
wandered	NULL
curiously	NULL
over	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
noticed	NULL
them	NULL
wander	NULL
before	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
were	NULL
about	NULL
Church	NULL
discipline	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
somehow	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
the	NULL
discipline	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
knack	NULL
of	NULL
dropping	NULL
out	NULL
after	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
emphatically	NULL
declared	NULL
to	NULL
apply	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
laity	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
clergy	NULL
:	NULL
once	NULL
indeed	NULL
Pryer	NULL
had	NULL
pettishly	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL

bother	NULL
the	NULL
College	NULL

As	NULL
regards	NULL
the	NULL
clergy	NULL
,	NULL
glimpses	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
large	NULL
cloven	NULL
hoof	NULL
kept	NULL
peeping	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
saintly	NULL
robe	NULL
of	NULL
Pryer	NULL
's	NULL
conversation	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
theoretically	NULL
perfect	NULL
,	NULL
practical	NULL
peccadilloes	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
peccadaccios	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
of	NULL
less	NULL
importance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
restless	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
wanting	NULL
to	NULL
approach	NULL
a	NULL
subject	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
venture	NULL
to	NULL
touch	NULL
upon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
kept	NULL
harping	NULL
(	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
this	NULL
about	NULL
every	NULL
third	NULL
day	NULL
)	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
wretched	NULL
lack	NULL
of	NULL
definition	NULL
concerning	NULL
the	NULL
limits	NULL
of	NULL
vice	NULL
and	NULL
virtue	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
vices	NULL
wanted	NULL
regulating	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
prohibiting	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
dwelt	NULL
also	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
advantages	NULL
of	NULL
complete	NULL
unreserve	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hinted	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
mysteries	NULL
into	NULL
which	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
been	NULL
initiated	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
enlighten	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
strong	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

Pryer	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
been	NULL
like	NULL
this	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
never	NULL
so	NULL
nearly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
point	NULL
--	NULL
though	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
fully	NULL
understand	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
inquietude	NULL
was	NULL
communicating	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
ere	NULL
long	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
Pryer	NULL
could	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
was	NULL
abruptly	NULL
interrupted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
appearance	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
visitor	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
shall	NULL
never	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
ended	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
last	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
ever	NULL
saw	NULL
Pryer	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
Pryer	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
break	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
some	NULL
bad	NULL
news	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
speculations	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LX	NULL
Ernest	NULL
now	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
occupied	NULL
himself	NULL
till	NULL
luncheon	NULL
with	NULL
studying	NULL
Dean	NULL
Alford	NULL
's	NULL
notes	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
Evangelistic	NULL
records	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Resurrection	NULL
,	NULL
doing	NULL
as	NULL
Mr	NULL
Shaw	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
not	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
accurate	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
whether	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
accurate	NULL
or	NULL
no	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
which	NULL
result	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
arrive	NULL
at	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
resolved	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
reach	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
Dean	NULL
Alford	NULL
's	NULL
notes	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
them	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
namely	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
yet	NULL
had	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
bringing	NULL
the	NULL
four	NULL
accounts	NULL
into	NULL
tolerable	NULL
harmony	NULL
with	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Dean	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
no	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
succeeding	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
predecessors	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
recommended	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
story	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
on	NULL
trust	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
prepared	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
his	NULL
luncheon	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
walk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
at	NULL
half	NULL
past	NULL
six	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
dinner	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
steak	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
pint	NULL
of	NULL
stout	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Snow	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
happy	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
about	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
's	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
disconcerted	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
unsettled	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
convert	NULL
anyone	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
reflected	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sudden	NULL
shock	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
opinions	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
irresistibly	NULL
drawn	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
the	NULL
visit	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
nothing	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
look	NULL
well	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
known	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
ought	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
too	NULL
great	NULL
a	NULL
hurry	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
his	NULL
opinions	NULL
on	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
evidence	NULL
for	NULL
Christ	NULL
's	NULL
Resurrection	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
--	NULL
besides	NULL
he	NULL
need	NULL
not	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Snow	NULL
about	NULL
this	NULL
subject	NULL
to	NULL
-	NULL
day	NULL
--	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL
?	NULL

Ernest	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
fast	NULL
and	NULL
fiercely	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
inward	NULL
monitor	NULL
warned	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Snow	NULL
's	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
should	NULL
he	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL

Fly	NULL
,	NULL
fly	NULL
,	NULL
fly	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
safety	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
would	NULL
Christ	NULL
have	NULL
fled	NULL
?	NULL

Even	NULL
though	NULL
Christ	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
died	NULL
and	NULL
risen	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
question	NULL
that	NULL
He	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
model	NULL
whose	NULL
example	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
.	NULL

Christ	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
fled	NULL
from	NULL
Miss	NULL
Snow	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
He	NULL
went	NULL
about	NULL
more	NULL
especially	NULL
with	NULL
prostitutes	NULL
and	NULL
disreputable	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
business	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
true	NULL
Christian	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
righteous	NULL
but	NULL
sinners	NULL
to	NULL
repentance	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
inconvenient	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
his	NULL
lodgings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
ask	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
Miss	NULL
Snow	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Maitland	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

Where	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
the	NULL
line	NULL
?	NULL

Who	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
just	NULL
good	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
house	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
just	NULL
not	NULL
good	NULL
enough	NULL
?	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
were	NULL
these	NULL
poor	NULL
girls	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
?	NULL

Was	NULL
he	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
house	NULL
to	NULL
house	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
place	NULL
to	NULL
lie	NULL
in	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
absurd	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
Miss	NULL
Snow	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
try	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
induce	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
her	NULL
present	NULL
mode	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
temptation	NULL
becoming	NULL
too	NULL
strong	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
fly	NULL
then	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
upstairs	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
Bible	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
consuming	NULL
fire	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
Miss	NULL
Snow	NULL
looking	NULL
very	NULL
pretty	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
neatly	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
demurely	NULL
,	NULL
furnished	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
an	NULL
illuminated	NULL
text	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pinned	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
fireplace	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
pleased	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
mechanically	NULL
placed	NULL
his	NULL
Bible	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
opened	NULL
a	NULL
timid	NULL
conversation	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
deep	NULL
in	NULL
blushes	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
hurried	NULL
step	NULL
came	NULL
bounding	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
over	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
gravity	NULL
had	NULL
little	NULL
power	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
saying	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
come	NULL
before	NULL
my	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Towneley	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
face	NULL
dropped	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
caught	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
Ernest	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL

you	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
!	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
my	NULL
word	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
describe	NULL
the	NULL
hurried	NULL
explanations	NULL
that	NULL
passed	NULL
quickly	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
--	NULL
enough	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
blushing	NULL
more	NULL
scarlet	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
slunk	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
Bible	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
deeply	NULL
humiliated	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
contrasted	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
Towneley	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
staircase	NULL
leading	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
room	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
Towneley	NULL
's	NULL
hearty	NULL
laugh	NULL
through	NULL
Miss	NULL
Snow	NULL
's	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cursed	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
born	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
it	NULL
flashed	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
Miss	NULL
Snow	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
see	NULL
Miss	NULL
Maitland	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
well	NULL
enough	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Bible	NULL

he	NULL
pushed	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
fell	NULL
over	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
kicked	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL

him	NULL

his	NULL
christening	NULL

street	NULL
door	NULL

and	NULL
yet	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
?	NULL

Mr	NULL
Holt	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
bodily	NULL
fear	NULL
;	NULL
Mr	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Baxter	NULL
had	NULL
nearly	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
Methodist	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
Mr	NULL
Shaw	NULL
had	NULL
undermined	NULL
his	NULL
faith	NULL

Resurrection	NULL
;	NULL
Miss	NULL
Snow	NULL

ruined	NULL

would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
accident	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
moral	NULL
character	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Miss	NULL
Maitland	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
his	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
ruin	NULL
hers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
damaged	NULL
himself	NULL
gravely	NULL
and	NULL
irretrievably	NULL
in	NULL
consequence	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
lodger	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
harm	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
bellows	NULL
'	NULL
mender	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
visited	NULL
.	NULL

Other	NULL
young	NULL
clergymen	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
greater	NULL
fools	NULL
in	NULL
many	NULL
respects	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
these	NULL
scrapes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
developed	NULL
an	NULL
aptitude	NULL
for	NULL
mischief	NULL
almost	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
ordained	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
preach	NULL
without	NULL
making	NULL
some	NULL
horrid	NULL
_	NULL
faux	NULL
pas	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
preached	NULL
one	NULL
Sunday	NULL
morning	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
Bishop	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
Rector	NULL
's	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
sermon	NULL
turn	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
what	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
little	NULL
cake	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
widow	NULL
of	NULL
Zarephath	NULL
had	NULL
intended	NULL
making	NULL
when	NULL
Elijah	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
gathering	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
sticks	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
demonstrated	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
seed	NULL
cake	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sermon	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
very	NULL
amusing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
pass	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
of	NULL
faces	NULL
underneath	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Bishop	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
angry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL
a	NULL
severe	NULL
reprimand	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
vestry	NULL
after	NULL
service	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
excuse	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
preaching	NULL
_	NULL
ex	NULL
tempore	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
particular	NULL
point	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
actually	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pulpit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
then	NULL
been	NULL
carried	NULL
away	NULL
by	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Another	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
preached	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
barren	NULL
fig-tree	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
described	NULL
the	NULL
hopes	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
owner	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
watched	NULL
the	NULL
delicate	NULL
blossom	NULL
unfold	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
give	NULL
promise	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
beautiful	NULL
fruit	NULL
in	NULL
autumn	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
received	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
botanical	NULL
member	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
congregation	NULL
who	NULL
explained	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
inasmuch	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
fig	NULL
produces	NULL
its	NULL
fruit	NULL
first	NULL
and	NULL
blossoms	NULL
inside	NULL
the	NULL
fruit	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
nearly	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
flower	NULL
is	NULL
perceptible	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
ordinary	NULL
observer	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
accident	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
scientist	NULL
or	NULL
an	NULL
inspired	NULL
writer	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
excuse	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
make	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
young	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
four	NULL
and	NULL
twenty	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
mind	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
body	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
for	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
slow	NULL
grower	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
far	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
moreover	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
education	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
an	NULL
attempt	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
blinkers	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
gouge	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
out	NULL
altogether	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
story	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
transpired	NULL
afterwards	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Maitland	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
giving	NULL
Ernest	NULL
in	NULL
charge	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
ran	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
running	NULL
away	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
frightened	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
almost	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
person	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
ran	NULL
against	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
policeman	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
serious	NULL
turn	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
gain	NULL
a	NULL
reputation	NULL
for	NULL
activity	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stopped	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
questioned	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
frightened	NULL
her	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
Miss	NULL
Maitland	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
giving	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL
in	NULL
charge	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
another	NULL
constable	NULL
.	NULL

Towneley	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
in	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
policeman	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
disturbance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
going	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
while	NULL
Miss	NULL
Maitland	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
doors	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
lying	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
stunned	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
moral	NULL
precipice	NULL
over	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
fallen	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
thing	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
take	NULL
action	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
policemen	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
action	NULL
became	NULL
impossible	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
Ernest	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
wanted	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Towneley	NULL
soon	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
do	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
bid	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
selected	NULL
myself	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
named	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Writes	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
stage	NULL
,	NULL
does	NULL
he	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Towneley	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Does	NULL
he	NULL
write	NULL
comedy	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Ernest	NULL
thought	NULL
Towneley	NULL
meant	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
tragedy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
I	NULL
wrote	NULL
burlesque	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Towneley	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
will	NULL
do	NULL
famously	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
on	NULL
second	NULL
thoughts	NULL
he	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
with	NULL
Ernest	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
police	NULL
court	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
sent	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
hurried	NULL
so	NULL
fast	NULL
to	NULL
fetch	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
's	NULL
being	NULL
still	NULL
cold	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
"	NULL
giving	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
expressed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
streams	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
poor	NULL
old	NULL
wretch	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
cab	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
Towneley	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
some	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
very	NULL
serious	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
anything	NULL
so	NULL
deplorable	NULL
as	NULL
what	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
actually	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
jumping	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
socket	NULL
and	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
ever	NULL
since	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
got	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
cab	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
police	NULL
station	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
talked	NULL
without	NULL
ceasing	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
neighbours	NULL
do	NULL
say	NULL
cruel	NULL
things	NULL
about	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL

no	NULL

him	NULL

Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
never	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL

'	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL

Oh	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
anyone	NULL
's	NULL
back	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
perhaps	NULL
my	NULL
Rose	NULL
might	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
better	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
set	NULL
her	NULL

dust	NULL
him	NULL

clean	NULL
him	NULL

he	NULL
never	NULL

the	NULL

The	NULL
father	NULL
was	NULL
furious	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
hear	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
intercession	NULL
on	NULL
Towneley	NULL
's	NULL
part	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Dissenter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
scandal	NULL
against	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
;	NULL
Towneley	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
unsuccessful	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
Towneley	NULL
--	NULL
who	NULL
regarded	NULL
Ernest	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
drowning	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
picked	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
somehow	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
if	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
irrespective	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
called	NULL
on	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
known	NULL
attorneys	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
greatly	NULL
pleased	NULL
with	NULL
Towneley	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
mean	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
's	NULL
money	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
years	NULL
'	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
therefore	NULL
then	NULL
be	NULL
rich	NULL
.	NULL

Towneley	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
before	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
knowledge	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
imparted	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
class	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
therefore	NULL
a	NULL
greater	NULL
claim	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
good	NULL
offices	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Ernest	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
gratitude	NULL
was	NULL
greater	NULL
than	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
expressed	NULL
in	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
can	NULL
call	NULL
to	NULL
mind	NULL
many	NULL
moments	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
well	NULL
pass	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
happiest	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
night	NULL
stands	NULL
clearly	NULL
out	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
painful	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
ever	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
so	NULL
kind	NULL
and	NULL
considerate	NULL
was	NULL
Towneley	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
bearable	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
wishes	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
neither	NULL
Towneley	NULL
nor	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
beyond	NULL
giving	NULL
our	NULL
moral	NULL
support	NULL
.	NULL

Our	NULL
attorney	NULL
told	NULL
us	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
magistrate	NULL
before	NULL
whom	NULL
Ernest	NULL
would	NULL
appear	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
severe	NULL
on	NULL
cases	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
description	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ask	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
remand	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
no	NULL
defence	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
will	NULL
call	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
's	NULL
rector	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
two	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
as	NULL
witnesses	NULL
for	NULL
previous	NULL
good	NULL
character	NULL

These	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
us	NULL
then	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
profound	NULL
apology	NULL
and	NULL
beg	NULL
the	NULL
magistrate	NULL
to	NULL
deal	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
summarily	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
sending	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
trial	NULL

If	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
get	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
believe	NULL
me	NULL

your	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXII	NULL
This	NULL
advice	NULL
,	NULL
besides	NULL
being	NULL
obviously	NULL
sensible	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
end	NULL
in	NULL
saving	NULL
Ernest	NULL
both	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
suspense	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
hesitation	NULL
in	NULL
adopting	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
case	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
on	NULL
about	NULL
eleven	NULL
o'clock	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
we	NULL
got	NULL
it	NULL
adjourned	NULL
till	NULL
three	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
Ernest	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
his	NULL
affairs	NULL
as	NULL
straight	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
execute	NULL
a	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
attorney	NULL
enabling	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
act	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
think	NULL
fit	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
prison	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
all	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
about	NULL
Pryer	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
College	NULL
of	NULL
Spiritual	NULL
Pathology	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
even	NULL
greater	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
clean	NULL
breast	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
telling	NULL
us	NULL
about	NULL
Miss	NULL
Maitland	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
us	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
upshot	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
actually	NULL
handed	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
Pryer	NULL
every	NULL
halfpenny	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
then	NULL
possessed	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
security	NULL
than	NULL
Pryer	NULL
's	NULL
I.O.U.	NULL
's	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
amount	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
still	NULL
declining	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
Pryer	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
guilty	NULL
of	NULL
dishonourable	NULL
conduct	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
becoming	NULL
alive	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
folly	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
doing	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
still	NULL
made	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
recovering	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
property	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
Pryer	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
sell	NULL
.	NULL

Towneley	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
were	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
opinion	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
we	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
what	NULL
we	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
dreary	NULL
work	NULL
waiting	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
amid	NULL
such	NULL
unfamiliar	NULL
and	NULL
depressing	NULL
surroundings	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
thought	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
Psalmist	NULL
had	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
with	NULL
quiet	NULL
irony	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
One	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
thy	NULL
courts	NULL
is	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
thousand	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
utter	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
similar	NULL
sentiment	NULL
in	NULL
respect	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Courts	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Towneley	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
were	NULL
compelled	NULL
to	NULL
loiter	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
three	NULL
o'clock	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
round	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
court	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
reserved	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
public	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
prisoner	NULL
's	NULL
dock	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
collected	NULL
himself	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
he	NULL
recognised	NULL
the	NULL
magistrate	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
leaving	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
great	NULL
grief	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
too	NULL
was	NULL
recognised	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Ottery	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
our	NULL
attorney	NULL
's	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
line	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
proposed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
called	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
witnesses	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
rector	NULL
,	NULL
Towneley	NULL
and	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
threw	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
mercy	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
magistrate	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
concluded	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
magistrate	NULL
spoke	NULL
as	NULL
follows	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Ernest	NULL
Pontifex	NULL

one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
painful	NULL
cases	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
ever	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
deal	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
singularly	NULL
favoured	NULL
in	NULL
your	NULL
parentage	NULL
and	NULL
education	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
before	NULL
you	NULL
the	NULL
example	NULL
of	NULL
blameless	NULL
parents	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
doubtless	NULL
instilled	NULL
into	NULL
you	NULL
from	NULL
childhood	NULL
the	NULL
enormity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
offence	NULL
which	NULL
by	NULL
your	NULL
own	NULL
confession	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
committed	NULL

You	NULL
were	NULL
sent	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
public	NULL
schools	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
likely	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
healthy	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
school	NULL
as	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
across	NULL
contaminating	NULL
influences	NULL

you	NULL
were	NULL
probably	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
say	NULL
certainly	NULL

impressed	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
heinousness	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
depart	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
strictest	NULL

until	NULL
such	NULL
time	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
entered	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
matrimony	NULL

At	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
shielded	NULL
from	NULL
impurity	NULL
by	NULL
every	NULL
obstacle	NULL

virtuous	NULL

vigilant	NULL
authorities	NULL
could	NULL
devise	NULL

and	NULL
even	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
obstacles	NULL
been	NULL
fewer	NULL
,	NULL
your	NULL
parents	NULL
probably	NULL
took	NULL
care	NULL
that	NULL

means	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL

of	NULL
your	NULL
throwing	NULL

away	NULL
upon	NULL
abandoned	NULL

At	NULL
night	NULL
proctors	NULL
patrolled	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
and	NULL
dogged	NULL
your	NULL
steps	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL

into	NULL
any	NULL

the	NULL

that	NULL
was	NULL
neither	NULL

We	NULL
obtained	NULL

before	NULL

where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
serve	NULL

found	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
thankful	NULL
to	NULL

been	NULL
summarily	NULL
dealt	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL
hardly	NULL

plight	NULL

out	NULL

go	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
America	NULL

We	NULL
left	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXIII	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
my	NULL
solicitor	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
Theobald	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
run	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
therefore	NULL
proposed	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
asking	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
me	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hinting	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
bring	NULL
bad	NULL
news	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL

I	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
my	NULL
letter	NULL

than	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
hours	NULL
before	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL

thought	NULL
the	NULL
short	NULL
interval	NULL
of	NULL
suspense	NULL
might	NULL
break	NULL
the	NULL
shock	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL

had	NULL
remembered	NULL
years	NULL

real	NULL
for	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
ignorance	NULL
and	NULL
stupidity	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
deliberate	NULL
malice	NULL
;	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
of	NULL
lying	NULL
and	NULL
self-laudatory	NULL
hallucination	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
brought	NULL
up	NULL
;	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
readiness	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
had	NULL
shown	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
anything	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
good	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
affection	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
parents	NULL
,	NULL
unless	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
much	NULL
mistaken	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
died	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
killed	NULL
anew	NULL

again	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
spring	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
had	NULL
rested	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
sentenced	NULL
Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL
to	NULL
mental	NULL
suffering	NULL
even	NULL
more	NULL
severe	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
fall	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
own	NULL
childhood	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
dreadful	NULL
old	NULL
George	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
John	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
John	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
two	NULL
sisters	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
again	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Christina	NULL
's	NULL
long	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
hope	NULL
deferred	NULL
that	NULL
maketh	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
sick	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
married	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
led	NULL
at	NULL
Crampsford	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
surroundings	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
both	NULL
lived	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
wonder	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
misfortunes	NULL
so	NULL
persistent	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
followed	NULL
by	NULL
even	NULL
graver	NULL
retribution	NULL
.	NULL

Poor	NULL
people	NULL
!	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
their	NULL
ignorance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
from	NULL
themselves	NULL
by	NULL
calling	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
pursuit	NULL
of	NULL
heavenly	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
shutting	NULL
their	NULL
eyes	NULL
to	NULL
anything	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
give	NULL
them	NULL
trouble	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
son	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
born	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
shut	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
also	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
practicable	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
could	NULL
blame	NULL
them	NULL
?	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
chapter	NULL
and	NULL
verse	NULL
for	NULL
everything	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
either	NULL
done	NULL
or	NULL
left	NULL
undone	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
better	NULL
thumbed	NULL
precedent	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
what	NULL
respect	NULL
had	NULL
they	NULL
differed	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
neighbours	NULL
?	NULL

How	NULL
did	NULL
their	NULL
household	NULL
differ	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
clergyman	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
sort	NULL
from	NULL
one	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
?	NULL

Why	NULL
then	NULL
should	NULL
it	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
tower	NULL
of	NULL
Siloam	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
?	NULL

Surely	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
tower	NULL
of	NULL
Siloam	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
naught	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
stood	NULL
under	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
system	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
fault	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
had	NULL
but	NULL
known	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
are	NULL
therein	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
little	NULL
harm	NULL
to	NULL
anyone	NULL
.	NULL

Selfish	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
so	NULL
than	NULL
may	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
be	NULL
pardoned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
was	NULL
hopeless	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
use	NULL
their	NULL
even	NULL
entering	NULL
into	NULL
their	NULL
mothers	NULL
'	NULL
wombs	NULL
and	NULL
being	NULL
born	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
must	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
be	NULL
born	NULL
again	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
born	NULL
again	NULL
each	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
mother	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
ancestry	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
generations	NULL
before	NULL
their	NULL
minds	NULL
could	NULL
become	NULL
supple	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
anew	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
humour	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
died	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
thankful	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
got	NULL
my	NULL
letter	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
met	NULL
me	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
nearest	NULL
to	NULL
Battersby	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
walked	NULL
back	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
towards	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
house	NULL
I	NULL
broke	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
gently	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
pretended	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
great	NULL
measure	NULL
a	NULL
mistake	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
though	NULL
Ernest	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
intentions	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
resisted	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
meant	NULL
going	NULL
anything	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
length	NULL
which	NULL
Miss	NULL
Maitland	NULL
supposed	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
said	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
appearances	NULL
were	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
dared	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
up	NULL
this	NULL
defence	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
magistrate	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
about	NULL
its	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
true	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
acted	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
readier	NULL
and	NULL
acuter	NULL
moral	NULL
sense	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
credit	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
have	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
promptly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
never	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
write	NULL
either	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
;	NULL
we	NULL
know	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
such	NULL
person	NULL
.	NULL

Tell	NULL
him	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
day	NULL
forward	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
born	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
father	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
idolised	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
selfishness	NULL
and	NULL
ingratitude	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
return	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
ever	NULL
had	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
my	NULL
hope	NULL
henceforth	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
remaining	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
how	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
fellow	NULL
curate	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hinted	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
very	NULL
likely	NULL
be	NULL
penniless	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
nearly	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
leaving	NULL
prison	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
displeased	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
added	NULL
soon	NULL
afterwards	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
If	NULL
this	NULL
proves	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
through	NULL
you	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL
paid	NULL

but	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL

thank	NULL
me	NULL

say	NULL
that	NULL

up	NULL

communication	NULL

with	NULL

myself	NULL

he	NULL
shall	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
penny	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL

"	NULL

Knowing	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
determined	NULL
on	NULL
violating	NULL
Miss	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
's	NULL
instructions	NULL
should	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
arise	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
Ernest	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
any	NULL
the	NULL
worse	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
complete	NULL
estrangement	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
acquiesced	NULL
more	NULL
readily	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
proposed	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
gentleman	NULL
may	NULL

Thinking	NULL
it	NULL
better	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL

I	NULL
left	NULL
Theobald	NULL
near	NULL

walked	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL

On	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
pleased	NULL
to	NULL
reflect	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL

had	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
hopes	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL

due	NULL

postnatal	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXIV	NULL
After	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sentenced	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
cells	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
van	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
Coldbath	NULL
Fields	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
serve	NULL
his	NULL
term	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
too	NULL
stunned	NULL
and	NULL
dazed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
suddenness	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
events	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
twenty-four	NULL
hours	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
realise	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
great	NULL
chasm	NULL
had	NULL
opened	NULL
between	NULL
his	NULL
past	NULL
and	NULL
future	NULL
;	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
he	NULL
breathed	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
pulse	NULL
beat	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
and	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
prostrated	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
blow	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
prostrated	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
from	NULL
many	NULL
smaller	NULL
laches	NULL
far	NULL
more	NULL
acutely	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
his	NULL
disgrace	NULL
would	NULL
inflict	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
how	NULL
readily	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
have	NULL
fallen	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
present	NULL
plight	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
break	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
must	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
headache	NULL
coming	NULL
on	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
forenoon	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
pulse	NULL
quickened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
suddenly	NULL
became	NULL
intense	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
walk	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
van	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
its	NULL
motion	NULL
insupportable	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
reaching	NULL
the	NULL
prison	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
ill	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
without	NULL
assistance	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
corridor	NULL
or	NULL
gallery	NULL
where	NULL
prisoners	NULL
are	NULL
marshalled	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
arrival	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
prison	NULL
warder	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
suppose	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
shamming	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
gaol-bird	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
therefore	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
this	NULL
gentleman	NULL
arrived	NULL
,	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
declared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
suffering	NULL
from	NULL
an	NULL
incipient	NULL
attack	NULL
of	NULL
brain	NULL
fever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
infirmary	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
he	NULL
hovered	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
two	NULL
months	NULL
between	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
in	NULL
full	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
reason	NULL
and	NULL
often	NULL
delirious	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
contrary	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
expectation	NULL
of	NULL
both	NULL
doctor	NULL
and	NULL
nurse	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
slowly	NULL
to	NULL
recover	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
nearly	NULL
drowned	NULL
,	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
consciousness	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
painful	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
lay	NULL
helpless	NULL
and	NULL
feeble	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
refinement	NULL
of	NULL
cruelty	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
died	NULL
once	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
delirium	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
still	NULL
most	NULL
likely	NULL
recover	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
sink	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
later	NULL
on	NULL
from	NULL
shame	NULL
and	NULL
sorrow	NULL
;	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
from	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
mended	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
so	NULL
slowly	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
realise	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
regained	NULL
consciousness	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
nurse	NULL
who	NULL
tended	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
some	NULL
little	NULL
rallying	NULL
sally	NULL
which	NULL
amused	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
laughed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
clapped	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
spark	NULL
of	NULL
hope	NULL
was	NULL
kindled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
he	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
.	NULL

Almost	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
less	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
horrors	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
meeting	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
worst	NULL
pain	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
behalf	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
again	NULL
face	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
still	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
thing	NULL
both	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
them	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
sever	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
them	NULL
completely	NULL
,	NULL
take	NULL
whatever	NULL
money	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
recover	NULL
from	NULL
Pryer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
uttermost	NULL
parts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
never	NULL
meet	NULL
anyone	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
or	NULL
college	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
start	NULL
afresh	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
gold	NULL
fields	NULL
in	NULL
California	NULL
or	NULL
Australia	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
such	NULL
wonderful	NULL
accounts	NULL
were	NULL
then	NULL
heard	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
even	NULL
make	NULL
his	NULL
fortune	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
return	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
hence	NULL
,	NULL
unknown	NULL
to	NULL
everyone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
live	NULL
at	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
built	NULL
these	NULL
castles	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
spark	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
flame	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
longed	NULL
for	NULL
health	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
freedom	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
sentence	NULL
had	NULL
expired	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
far	NULL
distant	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
things	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
shape	NULL
themselves	NULL
more	NULL
definitely	NULL
.	NULL

Whatever	NULL
happened	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
practically	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
found	NULL
another	NULL
curacy	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
minded	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
minded	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hated	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
leading	NULL
ever	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
for	NULL
orders	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
argue	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
simply	NULL
he	NULL
loathed	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
dwelt	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
becoming	NULL
a	NULL
layman	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
disgraced	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
rejoiced	NULL
at	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
befallen	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
blessing	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
very	NULL
imprisonment	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
seemed	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
unspeakable	NULL
misfortune	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
shock	NULL
of	NULL
so	NULL
great	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
surroundings	NULL
had	NULL
accelerated	NULL
changes	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
opinions	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
cocoons	NULL
of	NULL
silkworms	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
sent	NULL
in	NULL
baskets	NULL
by	NULL
rail	NULL
,	NULL
hatch	NULL
before	NULL
their	NULL
time	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
novelty	NULL
of	NULL
heat	NULL
and	NULL
jolting	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
however	NULL
this	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
belief	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
stories	NULL
concerning	NULL
the	NULL
Death	NULL
,	NULL
Resurrection	NULL
and	NULL
Ascension	NULL
of	NULL
Jesus	NULL
Christ	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hence	NULL
his	NULL
faith	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
Christian	NULL
miracles	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
dropped	NULL
off	NULL
him	NULL
once	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
investigation	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
in	NULL
consequence	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Shaw	NULL
's	NULL
rebuke	NULL
,	NULL
hurried	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
impression	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
New	NULL
Testament	NULL
his	NULL
chief	NULL
study	NULL
,	NULL
going	NULL
through	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
spirit	NULL
which	NULL
Mr	NULL
Shaw	NULL
had	NULL
desired	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
wished	NULL
neither	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
nor	NULL
disbelieve	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
cared	NULL
only	NULL
about	NULL
finding	NULL
out	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
or	NULL
no	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
more	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
spirit	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
the	NULL
balance	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
lie	NULL
in	NULL
favour	NULL
of	NULL
unbelief	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
further	NULL
doubt	NULL
became	NULL
impossible	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
plainly	NULL
enough	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
whatever	NULL
else	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
that	NULL
Christ	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
,	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
life	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
been	NULL
carried	NULL
from	NULL
earth	NULL
through	NULL
clouds	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
heavens	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
now	NULL
be	NULL
accepted	NULL
by	NULL
unbiassed	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
so	NULL
soon	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
one	NULL
way	NULL
or	NULL
another	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
him	NULL
sooner	NULL
or	NULL
later	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
it	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
hoodwinked	NULL
by	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
paid	NULL
for	NULL
hoodwinking	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
should	NULL
he	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
present	NULL
discovery	NULL
till	NULL
years	NULL
later	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
deeply	NULL
committed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
?	NULL

Should	NULL
he	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
courage	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
would	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
probably	NULL
have	NULL
evolved	NULL
some	NULL
excellent	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
continuing	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
hitherto	NULL
?	NULL

Should	NULL
he	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
courage	NULL
to	NULL
break	NULL
away	NULL
even	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
present	NULL
curacy	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
whether	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
thankful	NULL
for	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
shown	NULL
his	NULL
error	NULL
or	NULL
for	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
caught	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
twisted	NULL
round	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
err	NULL
farther	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
having	NULL
discovered	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
price	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
boon	NULL
was	NULL
light	NULL
as	NULL
compared	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
boon	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
is	NULL
too	NULL
heavy	NULL
a	NULL
price	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
for	NULL
having	NULL
duty	NULL
made	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
clear	NULL
and	NULL
easy	NULL
of	NULL
fulfilment	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
very	NULL
difficult	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
sorry	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sorry	NULL
for	NULL
Miss	NULL
Maitland	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
sorry	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
puzzled	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
hated	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
till	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
particularly	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
anyone	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
actually	NULL
hated	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
answered	NULL
no	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
people	NULL
almost	NULL
always	NULL
want	NULL
something	NULL
external	NULL
to	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
reveal	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
likes	NULL
and	NULL
dislikes	NULL
.	NULL

Our	NULL
most	NULL
assured	NULL
likings	NULL
have	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
part	NULL
been	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
neither	NULL
by	NULL
introspection	NULL
nor	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
process	NULL
of	NULL
conscious	NULL
reasoning	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
bounding	NULL
forth	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
to	NULL
welcome	NULL
the	NULL
gospel	NULL
proclaimed	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
by	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
hear	NULL
some	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
such	NULL
and	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
is	NULL
thus	NULL
or	NULL
thus	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
that	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
laid	NULL
within	NULL
us	NULL

but	NULL
whose	NULL
presence	NULL
we	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL

flashes	NULL
into	NULL
consciousness	NULL
and	NULL
perception	NULL

Only	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
bounded	NULL
forth	NULL
to	NULL
welcome	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hawke	NULL
's	NULL

he	NULL

now	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
full	NULL
cry	NULL

how	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
be	NULL

that	NULL
his	NULL
present	NULL
state	NULL

mind	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
lasting	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
previous	NULL
ones	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
certain	NULL

he	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL

he	NULL
were	NULL
now	NULL
on	NULL
firmer	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL

no	NULL

how	NULL

his	NULL

he	NULL

act	NULL

them	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
reason	NULL

them	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
impossible	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
reflected	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL

this	NULL

if	NULL

Pryer	NULL

Pryer	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL

assimilating	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
months	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL

a	NULL

should	NULL

himself	NULL

The	NULL

him	NULL

greater	NULL

his	NULL

the	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXV	NULL
As	NULL
he	NULL
lay	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
day	NULL
slowly	NULL
recovering	NULL
he	NULL
woke	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
which	NULL
most	NULL
men	NULL
arrive	NULL
at	NULL
sooner	NULL
or	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL
few	NULL
care	NULL
two	NULL
straws	NULL
about	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
have	NULL
any	NULL
confidence	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
righter	NULL

better	NULL

believe	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL

what	NULL
is	NULL
untrue	NULL

even	NULL
though	NULL
belief	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
untruth	NULL
may	NULL
seem	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
sight	NULL
most	NULL
expedient	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
these	NULL
few	NULL
who	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
anything	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
are	NULL
simply	NULL
unbelievers	NULL
in	NULL
disguise	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
these	NULL
last	NULL
are	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
have	NULL
numbers	NULL

he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL

The	NULL
conclusion	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL

how	NULL
clear	NULL
a	NULL
logic	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL

arrived	NULL
at	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
alternative	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
our	NULL
criterion	NULL
of	NULL
truth	NULL
--	NULL
i.e.	NULL
that	NULL
truth	NULL
is	NULL
what	NULL
commends	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
majority	NULL
of	NULL
sensible	NULL
and	NULL
successful	NULL
people	NULL
--	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
infallible	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rule	NULL
is	NULL
sound	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
covers	NULL
by	NULL
far	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
cases	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
has	NULL
its	NULL
exceptions	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
were	NULL
they	NULL
?	NULL

Ah	NULL
!	NULL

that	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
difficult	NULL
matter	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rules	NULL
which	NULL
governed	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
sometimes	NULL
so	NULL
subtle	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
mistakes	NULL
always	NULL
had	NULL
and	NULL
always	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
this	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
reduce	NULL
life	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
exact	NULL
science	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
rough	NULL
and	NULL
ready	NULL
rule-of-thumb	NULL
test	NULL
of	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
rules	NULL
as	NULL
regards	NULL
exceptions	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
mastered	NULL
without	NULL
much	NULL
trouble	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
residue	NULL
of	NULL
cases	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
decision	NULL
was	NULL
difficult	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
difficult	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
follow	NULL
his	NULL
instinct	NULL
than	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
decide	NULL
them	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
process	NULL
of	NULL
reasoning	NULL
.	NULL

Instinct	NULL
then	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
ultimate	NULL
court	NULL
of	NULL
appeal	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
instinct	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
mode	NULL
of	NULL
faith	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evidence	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
not	NULL
actually	NULL
seen	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
so	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL
returned	NULL
almost	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
started	NULL
originally	NULL
,	NULL
namely	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
just	NULL
shall	NULL
live	NULL
by	NULL
faith	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
just	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
reasonable	NULL
people	NULL
--	NULL
do	NULL
as	NULL
regards	NULL
those	NULL
daily	NULL
affairs	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
which	NULL
most	NULL
concern	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
settle	NULL
smaller	NULL
matters	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
exercise	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
deliberation	NULL
.	NULL

More	NULL
important	NULL
ones	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
cure	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
bodies	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
bodies	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
whom	NULL
they	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
investment	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
extrication	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
affairs	NULL
from	NULL
any	NULL
serious	NULL
mess	NULL
--	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
they	NULL
generally	NULL
entrust	NULL
to	NULL
others	NULL
of	NULL
whose	NULL
capacity	NULL
they	NULL
know	NULL
little	NULL
save	NULL
from	NULL
general	NULL
report	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
act	NULL
therefore	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
strength	NULL
of	NULL
faith	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
knowledge	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
nation	NULL
entrusts	NULL
the	NULL
welfare	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
fleet	NULL
and	NULL
naval	NULL
defences	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
First	NULL
Lord	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Admiralty	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
sailor	NULL
can	NULL
know	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
these	NULL
matters	NULL
except	NULL
by	NULL
acts	NULL
of	NULL
faith	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
about	NULL
faith	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
reason	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
ultima	NULL
ratio	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
Euclid	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
laid	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
little	NULL
open	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
charge	NULL
of	NULL
credulity	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
writer	NULL
who	NULL
ever	NULL
lived	NULL
,	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
beyond	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
has	NULL
no	NULL
demonstrable	NULL
first	NULL
premise	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
requires	NULL
postulates	NULL
and	NULL
axioms	NULL
which	NULL
transcend	NULL
demonstration	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
superstructure	NULL
indeed	NULL
is	NULL
demonstration	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
ground	NULL
is	NULL
faith	NULL
.	NULL

Nor	NULL
again	NULL
can	NULL
he	NULL
get	NULL
further	NULL
than	NULL
telling	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
persists	NULL
in	NULL
differing	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
says	NULL
"	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
absurd	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
declines	NULL
to	NULL
discuss	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
further	NULL
.	NULL

Faith	NULL
and	NULL
authority	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
prove	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
anyone	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
By	NULL
faith	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL

then	NULL

"	NULL
asked	NULL
Ernest	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL

He	NULL

how	NULL

Looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

from	NULL
a	NULL

he	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

It	NULL
lay	NULL

him	NULL

the	NULL

The	NULL

perhaps	NULL
best	NULL
in	NULL
theory	NULL

in	NULL

the	NULL
Archbishop	NULL

Canterbury	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
sufficiently	NULL

of	NULL
Christian	NULL

tried	NULL
to	NULL
raise	NULL
a	NULL
discussion	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Hughes	NULL
had	NULL

very	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL

,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL

had	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
issue	NULL
lay	NULL

Mr	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL

authority	NULL

many	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXVI	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
convalescent	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
in	NULL
prison	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
not	NULL
strong	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
infirmary	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
beyond	NULL
all	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
relapse	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
with	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hughes	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
future	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
expressed	NULL
his	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
emigrating	NULL
to	NULL
Australia	NULL
or	NULL
New	NULL
Zealand	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
recover	NULL
from	NULL
Pryer	NULL
.	NULL

Whenever	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hughes	NULL
looked	NULL
grave	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
chaplain	NULL
wanted	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
profession	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
disapproved	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
evident	NULL
anxiety	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
to	NULL
something	NULL
else	NULL
;	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hughes	NULL
point	NULL
blank	NULL
why	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
disapproved	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
emigrating	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Hughes	NULL
endeavoured	NULL
to	NULL
evade	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
put	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
chaplain	NULL
's	NULL
manner	NULL
which	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
Ernest	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
alarmed	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
begged	NULL
him	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
suspense	NULL
;	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
hesitation	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hughes	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
strong	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
broke	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
as	NULL
gently	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
money	NULL
had	NULL
disappeared	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
my	NULL
return	NULL
from	NULL
Battersby	NULL
I	NULL
called	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
solicitor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
told	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
Pryer	NULL
,	NULL
requiring	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
refund	NULL
the	NULL
monies	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
his	NULL
I.O.U.	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

Pryer	NULL
replied	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
orders	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
broker	NULL
to	NULL
close	NULL
his	NULL
operations	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
unfortunately	NULL
had	NULL
resulted	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
in	NULL
heavy	NULL
loss	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
balance	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
paid	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
solicitor	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
settling	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
distant	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
heard	NULL
nothing	NULL
from	NULL
Pryer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
lodgings	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
few	NULL
effects	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
from	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
seen	NULL
since	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
from	NULL
Ernest	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
broker	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
employed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
Pryer	NULL
had	NULL
closed	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
accounts	NULL
for	NULL
cash	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sentenced	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
received	NULL
2315	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
remained	NULL
of	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
original	NULL
5000	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
decamped	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
had	NULL
we	NULL
enough	NULL
clue	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
whereabouts	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
any	NULL
steps	NULL
to	NULL
recover	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
consider	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
as	NULL
lost	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
may	NULL
say	NULL
here	NULL
that	NULL
neither	NULL
I	NULL
nor	NULL
Ernest	NULL
ever	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
Pryer	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
have	NULL
any	NULL
idea	NULL
what	NULL
became	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
placed	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
difficult	NULL
position	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
years	NULL
Ernest	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
many	NULL
times	NULL
over	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
money	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
feared	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
supposed	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
stand	NULL
when	NULL
coupled	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
other	NULL
misfortunes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
prison	NULL
authorities	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
address	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
in	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
pocket	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
communicated	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
concerning	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
's	NULL
illness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
supposed	NULL
my	NULL
godson	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
good	NULL
health	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
just	NULL
twenty-four	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
prison	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
followed	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
's	NULL
instructions	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
battle	NULL
with	NULL
fortune	NULL
for	NULL
another	NULL
four	NULL
years	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
question	NULL
before	NULL
me	NULL
was	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
run	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
risk	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
whether	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
extent	NULL
transgress	NULL
my	NULL
instructions	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
my	NULL
doing	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
Miss	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
wished	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
sum	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
recovered	NULL
from	NULL
Pryer	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
my	NULL
godson	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
an	NULL
older	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
fixed	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
definite	NULL
groove	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
very	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
commonly	NULL
unformed	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
age	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
,	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
illness	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
dared	NULL
to	NULL
lay	NULL
any	NULL
heavier	NULL
burden	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
already	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
being	NULL
uneasy	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
health	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
roughing	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
experience	NULL
concerning	NULL
the	NULL
importance	NULL
of	NULL
not	NULL
playing	NULL
tricks	NULL
with	NULL
money	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
harm	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
I	NULL
decided	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
a	NULL
sharp	NULL
eye	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
prison	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
splash	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
deep	NULL
water	NULL
as	NULL
best	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
till	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
swim	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
sink	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
case	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
swimming	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
eight-and-twenty	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
prepare	NULL
him	NULL
gradually	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
fortune	NULL
that	NULL
awaited	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
hurry	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rescue	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
I	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
Pryer	NULL
had	NULL
absconded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
100	NULL
pounds	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
prison	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
then	NULL
waited	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
effect	NULL
these	NULL
tidings	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
expecting	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
an	NULL
answer	NULL
for	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
told	NULL
on	NULL
enquiry	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
letter	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
received	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
prisoner	NULL
till	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
in	NULL
gaol	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
also	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
Pryer	NULL
's	NULL
disappearance	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
my	NULL
letter	NULL
arrived	NULL
the	NULL
governor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
gaol	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
importance	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
relaxed	NULL
the	NULL
rules	NULL
if	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
state	NULL
had	NULL
allowed	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
illness	NULL
prevented	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
governor	NULL
left	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
chaplain	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
to	NULL
break	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
thought	NULL
him	NULL
strong	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
meantime	NULL
I	NULL
received	NULL
a	NULL
formal	NULL
official	NULL
document	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
letter	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
received	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
communicated	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
prisoner	NULL
in	NULL
due	NULL
course	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
simply	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
mistake	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
clerk	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
informed	NULL
of	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
illness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
till	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
desire	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
chaplin	NULL
had	NULL
broken	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
substance	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
terribly	NULL
shocked	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
ignorance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
prevented	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
seeing	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL
extent	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mischief	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
serious	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
meant	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
reality	NULL
,	NULL
money	NULL
losses	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
hardest	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
by	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
are	NULL
old	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
comprehend	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
man	NULL
can	NULL
stand	NULL
being	NULL
told	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
submit	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
severe	NULL
surgical	NULL
operation	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
some	NULL
disease	NULL
which	NULL
will	NULL
shortly	NULL
kill	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
cripple	NULL
or	NULL
blind	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL

then	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
most	NULL
serious	NULL

a	NULL
man	NULL

suffer	NULL
are	NULL
those	NULL
affecting	NULL
money	NULL

health	NULL

reputation	NULL

Loss	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
is	NULL
far	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
comes	NULL
ill-health	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
reputation	NULL
;	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
reputation	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
third	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL

if	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
keeps	NULL
health	NULL

money	NULL
unimpaired	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
generally	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
reputation	NULL
is	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
breaches	NULL
of	NULL
parvenu	NULL
conventions	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL

violations	NULL

those	NULL
older	NULL

canons	NULL
whose	NULL
authority	NULL
is	NULL
unquestionable	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
case	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
may	NULL
grow	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
reputation	NULL
as	NULL
easily	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
lobster	NULL
grows	NULL

claw	NULL

if	NULL
he	NULL
have	NULL
health	NULL

may	NULL
thrive	NULL
in	NULL
great	NULL
peace	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
reputation	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
chance	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
lost	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
shall	NULL
still	NULL
be	NULL
young	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
uprooting	NULL
and	NULL
transplanting	NULL
without	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
temporary	NULL
derangement	NULL

and	NULL
this	NULL
I	NULL
believed	NULL
my	NULL
godson	NULL
still	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL
prison	NULL
rules	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
receive	NULL
and	NULL
send	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
gaol	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
might	NULL
also	NULL
receive	NULL
one	NULL
visit	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
received	NULL
my	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
asked	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
changed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
so	NULL
feeble	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
exertion	NULL
of	NULL
coming	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
infirmary	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
cell	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
agitation	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
me	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
quite	NULL
broke	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
pained	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
state	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
breaking	NULL
my	NULL
instructions	NULL
then	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
contented	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
assuring	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
prison	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL

what	NULL
money	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
necessary	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
easier	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
I	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
death	NULL
-	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
desired	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
sort	NULL
should	NULL
an	NULL
emergency	NULL
arise	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
only	NULL
be	NULL
taking	NULL
what	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
100	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
never	NULL

I	NULL
said	NULL

he	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXVII	NULL
As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
Ernest	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
to	NULL
upon	NULL
leaving	NULL
prison	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
dreams	NULL
about	NULL
emigrating	NULL
and	NULL
farming	NULL
must	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
incapable	NULL
of	NULL
working	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
plough	NULL
or	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
axe	NULL
for	NULL
long	NULL
together	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
for	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
that	NULL
resolved	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
part	NULL
once	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
parents	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
going	NULL
abroad	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
kept	NULL
up	NULL
relations	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL
far	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
interfere	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
would	NULL
object	NULL
to	NULL
being	NULL
cut	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
appear	NULL
kind	NULL
and	NULL
forgiving	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
also	NULL
dislike	NULL
having	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
power	NULL
to	NULL
plague	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
also	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
that	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
ran	NULL
in	NULL
harness	NULL
together	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
always	NULL
pulling	NULL
one	NULL
way	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
drop	NULL
the	NULL
gentleman	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
ranks	NULL
,	NULL
beginning	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
lowest	NULL
rung	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ladder	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
know	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
disgrace	NULL
or	NULL
mind	NULL
it	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
know	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
would	NULL
wish	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
clutch	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fag-end	NULL
of	NULL
gentility	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
starvation	NULL
salary	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
advancement	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
enough	NULL
in	NULL
Ashpit	NULL
Place	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
tailor	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
drink	NULL
and	NULL
attended	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
earn	NULL
more	NULL
money	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
clerk	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
curate	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
much	NULL
less	NULL
expense	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
show	NULL
was	NULL
required	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
tailor	NULL
also	NULL
had	NULL
more	NULL
liberty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
rising	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
resolved	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
fall	NULL
still	NULL
lower	NULL
--	NULL
promptly	NULL
,	NULL
gracefully	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
rising	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
cling	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
skirts	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
respectability	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
permit	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
exist	NULL
on	NULL
sufferance	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
pay	NULL
an	NULL
utterly	NULL
extortionate	NULL
price	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
article	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
better	NULL
without	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
result	NULL
more	NULL
quickly	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
otherwise	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
through	NULL
remembering	NULL
something	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
heard	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
say	NULL
about	NULL
"	NULL
kissing	NULL
the	NULL
soil	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

This	NULL
had	NULL
impressed	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
stuck	NULL
by	NULL
him	NULL
perhaps	NULL
by	NULL
reason	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
brevity	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
later	NULL
on	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
Hercules	NULL

Antaeus	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
few	NULL
ancient	NULL
fables	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
hold	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
chiefest	NULL
debt	NULL
to	NULL
classical	NULL
literature	NULL

His	NULL
aunt	NULL
had	NULL
wanted	NULL
him	NULL

learn	NULL
carpentering	NULL

as	NULL
a	NULL

the	NULL

that	NULL

He	NULL
rejoiced	NULL
now	NULL

therefore	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
imprisonment	NULL

which	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
more	NULL
easy	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
his	NULL
truest	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
lasting	NULL
interests	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
times	NULL
he	NULL
wavered	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
weep	NULL
and	NULL
think	NULL
sadly	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL

or	NULL
how	NULL
perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
even	NULL
fall	NULL
ill	NULL
and	NULL
die	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
blame	NULL
would	NULL
rest	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
these	NULL
times	NULL
his	NULL
resolution	NULL
was	NULL
near	NULL
breaking	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
I	NULL
applauded	NULL
his	NULL
design	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
within	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
bade	NULL
him	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL

mother	NULL
's	NULL
faces	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL

grew	NULL
louder	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
persistent	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
cut	NULL
himself	NULL
adrift	NULL
from	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
would	NULL
hamper	NULL
him	NULL

when	NULL
so	NULL
small	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL
was	NULL
wanted	NULL

his	NULL
dream	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL

was	NULL
idle	NULL

what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
in	NULL
comparison	NULL
with	NULL
jeopardy	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
still	NULL
felt	NULL
deeply	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
his	NULL
disgrace	NULL
had	NULL
inflicted	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
stronger	NULL

and	NULL
reflected	NULL
that	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
run	NULL
his	NULL
chance	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
for	NULL
parents	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
run	NULL
theirs	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
son	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
nearly	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
conclusion	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
received	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
decision	NULL
final	NULL

If	NULL
the	NULL
prison	NULL

had	NULL
been	NULL
interpreted	NULL
strictly	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
this	NULL
letter	NULL
for	NULL
another	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
heard	NULL
from	NULL
me	NULL

the	NULL

a	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXVIII	NULL
When	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
over	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
prison	NULL
meditations	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
conclusions	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
drawn	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
occurs	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
reality	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
wanting	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
last	NULL
thing	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
entered	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
wanting	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
mean	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
for	NULL
Christ	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
giving	NULL
them	NULL
up	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
they	NULL
hindered	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pursuit	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
truest	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
lasting	NULL
happiness	NULL
.	NULL

Granted	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
this	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
Christ	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
is	NULL
Christ	NULL
if	NULL
He	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
this	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
who	NULL
takes	NULL
the	NULL
highest	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
self-respecting	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
welfare	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
power	NULL
to	NULL
conceive	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
adheres	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
conventionality	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
Christian	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
knows	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
calls	NULL
himself	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
rose	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
a	NULL
rose	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
name	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
if	NULL
circumstances	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
more	NULL
easy	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
most	NULL
men	NULL
?	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
luck	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
's	NULL
luck	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
other	NULL
duties	NULL
made	NULL
easy	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
by	NULL
accident	NULL
of	NULL
birth	NULL
.	NULL

Surely	NULL
if	NULL
people	NULL
are	NULL
born	NULL
rich	NULL
or	NULL
handsome	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
good	NULL
fortune	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
will	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
man	NULL
has	NULL
no	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
born	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
constitution	NULL
than	NULL
another	NULL
;	NULL
others	NULL
again	NULL
will	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
luck	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
righteous	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
veneration	NULL
.	NULL

Both	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
daresay	NULL
,	NULL
can	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
whichever	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
right	NULL
surely	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
luck	NULL
of	NULL
finding	NULL
a	NULL
duty	NULL
made	NULL
easier	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bad	NULL
fortune	NULL
of	NULL
falling	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
scrape	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
prison	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
man	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sneered	NULL
at	NULL
for	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
trump	NULL
card	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sneered	NULL
at	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
plays	NULL
his	NULL
trump	NULL
card	NULL
badly	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
question	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
ever	NULL
much	NULL
harder	NULL
for	NULL
anyone	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
for	NULL
Christ	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
Ernest	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
relations	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
parties	NULL
will	NULL
have	NULL
almost	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
severely	NULL
strained	NULL
before	NULL
it	NULL
comes	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
doubt	NULL
whether	NULL
anyone	NULL
was	NULL
ever	NULL
yet	NULL
required	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
those	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
tenderly	NULL
attached	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
conscience	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
have	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
tenderly	NULL
attached	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
long	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
called	NULL
upon	NULL
to	NULL
break	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
differences	NULL
of	NULL
opinion	NULL
concerning	NULL
any	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
vital	NULL
importance	NULL
spring	NULL
from	NULL
differences	NULL
of	NULL
constitution	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
these	NULL
will	NULL
already	NULL
have	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
other	NULL
disagreement	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
giving	NULL
up	NULL
"	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
comes	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
like	NULL
giving	NULL
up	NULL
an	NULL
aching	NULL
but	NULL
very	NULL
loose	NULL
and	NULL
hollow	NULL
tooth	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
whom	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
required	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
Christ	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
really	NULL
painful	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
wrench	NULL
in	NULL
earnest	NULL
.	NULL

Happily	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
matter	NULL
how	NULL
light	NULL
the	NULL
task	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
demanded	NULL
from	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
enough	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
we	NULL
reap	NULL
our	NULL
reward	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
Herculean	NULL
labour	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
Ernest	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
tailor	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
over	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
chaplain	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
earn	NULL
his	NULL
six	NULL
or	NULL
seven	NULL
shillings	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
prison	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
the	NULL
trade	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
remainder	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
term	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
strong	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
fit	NULL
for	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
infirmary	NULL
sooner	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
otherwise	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
and	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
tailor	NULL
's	NULL
shop	NULL
,	NULL
overjoyed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thoughts	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
confident	NULL
of	NULL
rising	NULL
some	NULL
day	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
firm	NULL
foothold	NULL
to	NULL
start	NULL
from	NULL
.	NULL

Everyone	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
belong	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
are	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
criminal	NULL
classes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finding	NULL
him	NULL
eager	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
trouble	NULL
always	NULL
treated	NULL
him	NULL
kindly	NULL
and	NULL
almost	NULL
respectfully	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
irksome	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
far	NULL
more	NULL
pleasant	NULL
than	NULL
making	NULL
Latin	NULL
and	NULL
Greek	NULL
verses	NULL
at	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
rather	NULL
be	NULL
here	NULL
in	NULL
prison	NULL
than	NULL
at	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
again	NULL
--	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
at	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
trouble	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ever	NULL
in	NULL
danger	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
into	NULL
was	NULL
through	NULL
exchanging	NULL
words	NULL
or	NULL
looks	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
decent-looking	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fellow-prisoners	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
forbidden	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
missed	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
breaking	NULL
the	NULL
rules	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
respect	NULL
.	NULL

Any	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
ability	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
would	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
make	NULL
rapid	NULL
progress	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
prison	NULL
the	NULL
warder	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
good	NULL
a	NULL
tailor	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
'	NULL
apprenticeship	NULL
as	NULL
many	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
twelve	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
before	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
praised	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
teachers	NULL
.	NULL

Each	NULL
day	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
stronger	NULL
in	NULL
health	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
surroundings	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
some	NULL
fresh	NULL
advantage	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
advantage	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
aimed	NULL
at	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
almost	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
marvelled	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
good	NULL
fortune	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
ordered	NULL
things	NULL
so	NULL
greatly	NULL
better	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
ordered	NULL
them	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
having	NULL
lived	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
in	NULL
Ashpit	NULL
Place	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
in	NULL
point	NULL
.	NULL

Things	NULL
were	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
others	NULL
like	NULL
him	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
impossible	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
as	NULL
Towneley	NULL
were	NULL
told	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
live	NULL
henceforth	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
like	NULL
those	NULL
in	NULL
Ashpit	NULL
Place	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
stand	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
stood	NULL
it	NULL
himself	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
there	NULL
of	NULL
compulsion	NULL
through	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
away	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
minute	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
;	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
familiar	NULL
with	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
Ashpit	NULL
Place	NULL
he	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
minded	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
live	NULL
gladly	NULL
in	NULL
lower	NULL
parts	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
pay	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
from	NULL
no	NULL
prudence	NULL
or	NULL
forethought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
served	NULL
this	NULL
apprenticeship	NULL
to	NULL
life	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
trying	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
feeble	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
thorough	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
thorough	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
thing	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
_	NULL
fiasco	NULL
_	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
puny	NULL
effort	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
genuine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
behold	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hour	NULL
of	NULL
need	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
reward	NULL
far	NULL
richer	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
deserved	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
faced	NULL
becoming	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
poor	NULL
unless	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
bridge	NULL
to	NULL
conduct	NULL
him	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
unwittingly	NULL
in	NULL
Ashpit	NULL
Place	NULL
.	NULL

True	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
drawbacks	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
particular	NULL
house	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
chosen	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
need	NULL
not	NULL
live	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
where	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Mr	NULL
Holt	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
be	NULL
tied	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
profession	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
hated	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
neither	NULL
screams	NULL
nor	NULL
scripture	NULL
readings	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
happy	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
garret	NULL
at	NULL
three	NULL
shillings	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
Miss	NULL
Maitland	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
further	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
work	NULL
together	NULL
for	NULL
good	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
love	NULL
God	NULL
;	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
imperfectly	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
try	NULL
hard	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
noble	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
Handel	NULL
's	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Great	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
yet	NULL
but	NULL
darkly	NULL
known	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
his	NULL
faith	NULL
in	NULL
Christianity	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
faith	NULL
in	NULL
something	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
what	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
something	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
but	NULL
darkly	NULL
known	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
right	NULL
right	NULL
and	NULL
wrong	NULL
wrong	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
faith	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
grew	NULL
stronger	NULL
and	NULL
stronger	NULL
daily	NULL
.	NULL

Again	NULL
there	NULL
crossed	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
thoughts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
and	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
its	NULL
vent	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
same	NULL
instinct	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
led	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
nearest	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
lay	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
with	NULL
any	NULL
clearness	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
assistance	NULL
here	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Australian	NULL
gold	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
among	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
it	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
abounded	NULL
all	NULL
around	NULL
them	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
There	NULL
is	NULL
gold	NULL
everywhere	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
inwardly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
to	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
look	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Might	NULL
not	NULL
his	NULL
opportunity	NULL
be	NULL
close	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
carefully	NULL
enough	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
immediate	NULL
surroundings	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Could	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
turn	NULL
his	NULL
having	NULL
lost	NULL
all	NULL
into	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL
?	NULL

long	NULL
time	NULL

not	NULL

but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
else	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
its	NULL
flight	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
these	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
mean	NULL
the	NULL

Who	NULL
could	NULL
hurt	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
hurt	NULL
already	NULL
?	NULL

Let	NULL
him	NULL
but	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
earn	NULL
his	NULL
bread	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
venture	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
a	NULL
happier	NULL
place	NULL
for	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
young	NULL
and	NULL
loveable	NULL
.	NULL

Herein	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
comfort	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
almost	NULL
wished	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
his	NULL
reputation	NULL
even	NULL
more	NULL
completely	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
life	NULL
which	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
lose	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
lost	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
find	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
courage	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
for	NULL
Christ	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
Christ	NULL
had	NULL
mercifully	NULL
taken	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lo	NULL
!	NULL

it	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
all	NULL
were	NULL
found	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
went	NULL
slowly	NULL
by	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
Christianity	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
denial	NULL
of	NULL
Christianity	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
met	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
extremes	NULL
do	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fight	NULL
about	NULL
names	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
about	NULL
things	NULL
;	NULL
practically	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
Rome	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
freethinker	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
ideal	NULL
standard	NULL
and	NULL
meet	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
gentleman	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
perfect	NULL
saint	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
perfect	NULL
gentleman	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
matters	NULL
little	NULL
what	NULL
profession	NULL
,	NULL
whether	NULL
of	NULL
religion	NULL
or	NULL
irreligion	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
may	NULL
make	NULL
,	NULL
provided	NULL
only	NULL
he	NULL
follows	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
charitable	NULL
inconsistency	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
insisting	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bitter	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
uncompromisingness	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
dogma	NULL
is	NULL
held	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dogma	NULL
or	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
dogma	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
danger	NULL
lies	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
crowning	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
edifice	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
here	NULL
he	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
molest	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
Pope	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Archbishop	NULL
of	NULL
Canterbury	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
hopped	NULL
about	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
picked	NULL
crumbs	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
without	NULL
running	NULL
risk	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
a	NULL
sly	NULL
sprinkle	NULL
of	NULL
salt	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
wary	NULL
prelate	NULL
himself	NULL
might	NULL
perhaps	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
opinion	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
robins	NULL
and	NULL
thrushes	NULL
that	NULL
hop	NULL
about	NULL
our	NULL
lawns	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
needlessly	NULL
distrustful	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
that	NULL
throws	NULL
them	NULL
out	NULL
crumbs	NULL
of	NULL
bread	NULL
in	NULL
winter	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
Archbishop	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
helped	NULL
to	NULL
arrive	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
foregoing	NULL
conclusion	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
event	NULL
which	NULL
almost	NULL
thrust	NULL
inconsistency	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
infirmary	NULL
the	NULL
chaplain	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
cell	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
prisoner	NULL
who	NULL
played	NULL
the	NULL
organ	NULL
in	NULL
chapel	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
finished	NULL
his	NULL
sentence	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
prison	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
therefore	NULL
offered	NULL
the	NULL
post	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
he	NULL
already	NULL
knew	NULL
played	NULL
the	NULL
organ	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
in	NULL
doubt	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
right	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
assist	NULL
at	NULL
religious	NULL
services	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
actually	NULL
compelled	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
pleasure	NULL
of	NULL
playing	NULL
the	NULL
organ	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
privileges	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
post	NULL
involved	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
see	NULL
excellent	NULL
reasons	NULL
for	NULL
not	NULL
riding	NULL
consistency	NULL
to	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
once	NULL
introduced	NULL
an	NULL
element	NULL
of	NULL
inconsistency	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
system	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
far	NULL
too	NULL
consistent	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
inconsistent	NULL
consistently	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
lapsed	NULL
ere	NULL
long	NULL
into	NULL
an	NULL
amiable	NULL
indifferentism	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
outward	NULL
appearance	NULL
differed	NULL
but	NULL
little	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
indifferentism	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hawke	NULL
had	NULL
aroused	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
becoming	NULL
organist	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
saved	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
treadmill	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
unfit	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
put	NULL
to	NULL
in	NULL
due	NULL
course	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
stronger	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
escaped	NULL
the	NULL
tailor	NULL
's	NULL
shop	NULL
altogether	NULL
and	NULL
done	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
comparatively	NULL
light	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
attending	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
chaplain	NULL
's	NULL
rooms	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
tailoring	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
therefore	NULL
take	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
offer	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
allowed	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
hours	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
for	NULL
practice	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
his	NULL
prison	NULL
life	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
monotonous	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
remaining	NULL
two	NULL
months	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
sentence	NULL
slipped	NULL
by	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
rapidly	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
free	NULL

a	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXIX	NULL
In	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
sever	NULL
the	NULL
connection	NULL
between	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL
once	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
reckoned	NULL
without	NULL

Theobald	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL

in	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
wished	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
nearer	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
Antipodes	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
entirely	NULL
breaking	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
well	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
shrewd	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
Ernest	NULL
would	NULL
wish	NULL
himself	NULL

and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
reason	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL

keep	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
connection	NULL

not	NULL
involve	NULL
Ernest	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
approached	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
prison	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL

consulted	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
course	NULL

"	NULL

After	NULL

the	NULL
plan	NULL
they	NULL
decided	NULL
on	NULL
adopting	NULL

having	NULL
so	NULL
decided	NULL

Theobald	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
governor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
gaol	NULL
asking	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
admitted	NULL
inside	NULL
the	NULL
gaol	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
Ernest	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
sentence	NULL

He	NULL
received	NULL
answer	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
affirmative	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
left	NULL
Battersby	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
prison	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
reckoned	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
surprised	NULL
on	NULL
being	NULL
told	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
before	NULL
nine	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
receiving	NULL
room	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
prison	NULL
as	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
visitors	NULL
waiting	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
fell	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
guessed	NULL
who	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
screwed	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
courage	NULL
and	NULL
hastened	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
receiving	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
,	NULL
sure	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
standing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
nearest	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
people	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
regarded	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
dangerous	NULL
enemies	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
fly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
wavered	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
lost	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
mother	NULL
was	NULL
crying	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
sprang	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
him	NULL

clasped	NULL
him	NULL

her	NULL

"	NULL

my	NULL

Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
white	NULL

a	NULL
sheet	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL

He	NULL
let	NULL
his	NULL

embrace	NULL
him	NULL

then	NULL
withdrawing	NULL
himself	NULL
stood	NULL
silently	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL

the	NULL

this	NULL

By	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
prison	NULL

in	NULL
another	NULL

was	NULL
at	NULL
liberty	NULL

After	NULL
he	NULL

got	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL

out	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
his	NULL

the	NULL

leant	NULL

it	NULL
for	NULL
support	NULL

wept	NULL

Giving	NULL
up	NULL

Ernest	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
stay	NULL
long	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL

for	NULL
he	NULL
feared	NULL
each	NULL

that	NULL

come	NULL
out	NULL

He	NULL
pulled	NULL

the	NULL
labyrinth	NULL

small	NULL
streets	NULL

out	NULL

of	NULL
him	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
crossed	NULL
his	NULL

--	NULL
not	NULL
perhaps	NULL
very	NULL
heroically	NULL

dramatically	NULL

then	NULL
it	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
scrambled	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL

was	NULL
out	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL

Already	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
gladly	NULL

,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL

it	NULL
mattered	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL

Inclined	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
very	NULL
great	NULL
allowances	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL

he	NULL

their	NULL

themselves	NULL

him	NULL
without	NULL

at	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL

the	NULL

already	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
fit	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mean	NULL
advantage	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
realise	NULL
more	NULL
fully	NULL

ever	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
one	NULL

lay	NULL
in	NULL
separating	NULL

The	NULL
morning	NULL

the	NULL

themselves	NULL

for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL
30th	NULL

wore	NULL
the	NULL

entered	NULL
prison	NULL

dressed	NULL

the	NULL
months	NULL

had	NULL
passed	NULL

seemed	NULL
to	NULL
drop	NULL
out	NULL

life	NULL

and	NULL
so	NULL
powerfully	NULL
did	NULL
association	NULL
carry	NULL
him	NULL
away	NULL

finding	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
dress	NULL

in	NULL

he	NULL
felt	NULL
dragged	NULL
back	NULL

his	NULL
old	NULL
self	NULL

as	NULL
though	NULL
his	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
of	NULL
prison	NULL
life	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL
from	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
waking	NULL

take	NULL
things	NULL
up	NULL

he	NULL

left	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL

unchanged	NULL
surroundings	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
unchanged	NULL

him	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
changed	NULL
part	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL

upon	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
everything	NULL
seem	NULL
almost	NULL

though	NULL
he	NULL

never	NULL

any	NULL

his	NULL

was	NULL
now	NULL

In	NULL
quiet	NULL
,	NULL
uneventful	NULL
lives	NULL
the	NULL
changes	NULL
internal	NULL

external	NULL
are	NULL
so	NULL
small	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
little	NULL

no	NULL

the	NULL

fusion	NULL

accommodation	NULL

in	NULL

there	NULL

also	NULL
great	NULL

power	NULL

in	NULL
others	NULL
great	NULL

little	NULL
accommodating	NULL

A	NULL
life	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
successful	NULL

not	NULL
according	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL

accommodation	NULL

equal	NULL

unequal	NULL

the	NULL
strain	NULL

adjusting	NULL
internal	NULL

external	NULL
changes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
trouble	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
we	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
driven	NULL
to	NULL
admit	NULL
the	NULL
unity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
universe	NULL
so	NULL
completely	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
compelled	NULL
to	NULL
deny	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
either	NULL
an	NULL
external	NULL
or	NULL
an	NULL
internal	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
must	NULL
see	NULL
everything	NULL
both	NULL
as	NULL
external	NULL

internal	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
subject	NULL

object	NULL
--	NULL
external	NULL
and	NULL
internal	NULL
--	NULL
being	NULL
unified	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
everything	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
will	NULL
knock	NULL
our	NULL
whole	NULL
system	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
every	NULL
system	NULL
has	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
knocked	NULL
over	NULL
by	NULL
something	NULL
.	NULL

Much	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
way	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
difficulty	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
in	NULL
for	NULL
separation	NULL
between	NULL
internal	NULL

external	NULL
--	NULL
subject	NULL
and	NULL
object	NULL
--	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
find	NULL
this	NULL
convenient	NULL

and	NULL
unity	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
find	NULL
unity	NULL

This	NULL
is	NULL
illogical	NULL

but	NULL
extremes	NULL
are	NULL
alone	NULL

they	NULL
are	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
faith	NULL

not	NULL

the	NULL
supreme	NULL
arbiter	NULL

They	NULL
say	NULL
all	NULL
roads	NULL
lead	NULL

and	NULL
all	NULL

that	NULL
I	NULL

either	NULL

some	NULL

else	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
already	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL

that	NULL

that	NULL
is	NULL

get	NULL

they	NULL

interpret	NULL
it	NULL
most	NULL
conveniently	NULL
without	NULL
asking	NULL
too	NULL
many	NULL
questions	NULL
for	NULL
conscience	NULL

Take	NULL
any	NULL
fact	NULL

and	NULL
reason	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bitter	NULL

it	NULL

But	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
story	NULL

When	NULL
Ernest	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
grimy	NULL
,	NULL
sullen	NULL
walls	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
prison	NULL
filling	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
paused	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
hemmed	NULL
in	NULL

bolts	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
somewhere	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL

had	NULL

his	NULL
escape	NULL
by	NULL
cutting	NULL
up	NULL

could	NULL

however	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

easily	NULL
daunted	NULL

felt	NULL

if	NULL
the	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
upon	NULL
Eyre	NULL
Street	NULL

walked	NULL
down	NULL
Leather	NULL
Lane	NULL
into	NULL
Holborn	NULL

Each	NULL

he	NULL
took	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
face	NULL

object	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL

helped	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL

before	NULL
his	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL

make	NULL
him	NULL

bear	NULL
no	NULL

He	NULL
passed	NULL
down	NULL
Fetter	NULL
Lane	NULL

Fleet	NULL

so	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Temple	NULL

to	NULL

I	NULL

just	NULL
returned	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL

him	NULL

wanted	NULL

with	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

Being	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
anticipated	NULL
no	NULL
trouble	NULL
in	NULL
getting	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
hear	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
utmost	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
assent	NULL
to	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
my	NULL
guest	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
set	NULL
about	NULL
doing	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
much	NULL
agitated	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
grew	NULL
better	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
ate	NULL
a	NULL
breakfast	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
prison	NULL
fare	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
comfortable	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
pleased	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
delight	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
fireplace	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
fire	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
easy	NULL
chairs	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
Times	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
cat	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
red	NULL
geraniums	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
coffee	NULL
,	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
,	NULL
sausages	NULL
,	NULL
marmalade	NULL
,	NULL
etc	NULL
.	NULL

Everything	NULL
was	NULL
pregnant	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
exquisite	NULL
pleasure	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
plane	NULL
trees	NULL
were	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
leaf	NULL
still	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
rising	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
breakfast	NULL
table	NULL
to	NULL
admire	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
never	NULL
till	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
known	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
really	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
ate	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
,	NULL
laughed	NULL
and	NULL
cried	NULL
by	NULL
turns	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
emotion	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
neither	NULL
forget	NULL
nor	NULL
describe	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
how	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
had	NULL
lain	NULL
in	NULL
wait	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
prison	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
furious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
applauded	NULL
him	NULL
heartily	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
grateful	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

Other	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
comfort	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
someone	NULL
who	NULL
saw	NULL
things	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
them	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
differed	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
opinion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
seeing	NULL
things	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
for	NULL
doing	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
kind	NULL
office	NULL
by	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Cordially	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
disliked	NULL
Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
hopeless	NULL
minority	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
opinion	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
formed	NULL
concerning	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
someone	NULL
who	NULL
agreed	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
an	NULL
awful	NULL
moment	NULL
for	NULL
both	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
knock	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
visitor	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
postman	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
heard	NULL
at	NULL
my	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Goodness	NULL
gracious	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
why	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
we	NULL
sport	NULL
the	NULL
oak	NULL
?	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
your	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
surely	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
hardly	NULL
come	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
day	NULL
!	NULL

Go	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
bedroom	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
sure	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
both	NULL
Theobald	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
refuse	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
version	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
agreed	NULL
substantially	NULL
with	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

Christina	NULL
cried	NULL
bitterly	NULL
--	NULL
Theobald	NULL
stormed	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
about	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
assured	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
faintest	NULL
conception	NULL
where	NULL
their	NULL
son	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
dismissed	NULL
them	NULL
both	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
saw	NULL
they	NULL
looked	NULL
suspiciously	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
manifest	NULL
signs	NULL
that	NULL
someone	NULL
was	NULL
breakfasting	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
parted	NULL
from	NULL
me	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
defiantly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
poor	NULL
Ernest	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
frightened	NULL
and	NULL
upset	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
voices	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
enemy	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
gaining	NULL
over	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
sported	NULL
the	NULL
oak	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
before	NULL
long	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
recover	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
breakfast	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
discussed	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
away	NULL
his	NULL
wardrobe	NULL
and	NULL
books	NULL
from	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
his	NULL
furniture	NULL
,	NULL
pictures	NULL
and	NULL
piano	NULL
,	NULL
giving	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
furnished	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
lieu	NULL
of	NULL
charge	NULL
for	NULL
taking	NULL
care	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
furniture	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
Ernest	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
wardrobe	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
suit	NULL
of	NULL
clothes	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
ordained	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
improvement	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
personal	NULL
appearance	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
finances	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
ten	NULL
pounds	NULL
from	NULL
Pryer	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
apprehended	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
between	NULL
seven	NULL
and	NULL
eight	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
purse	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
prison	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
money	NULL
was	NULL
restored	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
leaving	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
paid	NULL
cash	NULL
for	NULL
whatever	NULL
he	NULL
bought	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
deducted	NULL
for	NULL
debts	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
books	NULL
and	NULL
furniture	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
100	NULL
pounds	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
chosen	NULL
to	NULL
emigrate	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
both	NULL
Ernest	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
(	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
brought	NULL
me	NULL
round	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
opinion	NULL
)	NULL
agreed	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
decline	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
of	NULL
as	NULL
belonging	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
proposed	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
taking	NULL
an	NULL
unfurnished	NULL
top	NULL
back	NULL
attic	NULL
in	NULL
as	NULL
quiet	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
,	NULL
say	NULL
at	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
shillings	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looking	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
work	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
tailor	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
much	NULL
mattered	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
pretty	NULL
sure	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
ere	NULL
long	NULL
find	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
suited	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
start	NULL
with	NULL
anything	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
difficulty	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
him	NULL
started	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
enough	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
clothes	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
organs	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
tailor	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
put	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
tailor	NULL
's	NULL
shop	NULL
and	NULL
guided	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
by	NULL
someone	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
and	NULL
where	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
spent	NULL
in	NULL
looking	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
soon	NULL
found	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
familiarising	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
liberty	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
I	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Olympic	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
Robson	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
acting	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
burlesque	NULL
on	NULL
Macbeth	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Keeley	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
rightly	NULL
,	NULL
taking	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
Lady	NULL
Macbeth	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
murder	NULL
,	NULL
Macbeth	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
kill	NULL
Duncan	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
his	NULL
boots	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
landing	NULL
.	NULL

Lady	NULL
Macbeth	NULL
put	NULL
a	NULL
stop	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
hesitation	NULL
by	NULL
whipping	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
arm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
carrying	NULL
him	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
stage	NULL
,	NULL
kicking	NULL
and	NULL
screaming	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
laughed	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
cried	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
rot	NULL
Shakespeare	NULL
is	NULL
after	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
,	NULL
involuntarily	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
remembered	NULL
his	NULL
essay	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Greek	NULL
tragedians	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
I	NULL
_	NULL
epris	NULL
_	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
set	NULL
about	NULL
looking	NULL
for	NULL
employment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
till	NULL
about	NULL
five	NULL
o'clock	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
success	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
same	NULL
thing	NULL
happened	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

Wherever	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
invariably	NULL
refused	NULL
and	NULL
often	NULL
ordered	NULL
point	NULL
blank	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
expression	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
frightened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rescue	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
many	NULL
enquiries	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
told	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
story	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
line	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
very	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
strike	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fishmonger	NULL
in	NULL
Leather	NULL
Lane	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
a	NULL
bloater	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
casually	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
from	NULL
curiosity	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
interested	NULL
motive	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

the	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXXI	NULL
It	NULL
seems	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
patrolling	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
nights	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
in	NULL
search	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
knowing	NULL
better	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
than	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
reality	NULL
so	NULL
easily	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
highly	NULL
educated	NULL
scholar	NULL
like	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
this	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
scared	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
saw	NULL
lions	NULL
where	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
none	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
shocked	NULL
and	NULL
frightened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
night	NULL
after	NULL
night	NULL
his	NULL
courage	NULL
had	NULL
failed	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
lodgings	NULL
in	NULL
Laystall	NULL
Street	NULL
without	NULL
accomplishing	NULL
his	NULL
errand	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
taken	NULL
me	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
confidence	NULL
upon	NULL
this	NULL
matter	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
enquired	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evenings	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
concluded	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
painful	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
call	NULL
on	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
anyone	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
walking	NULL
moodily	NULL
from	NULL
seven	NULL
till	NULL
about	NULL
nine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
straight	NULL
to	NULL
Ashpit	NULL
Place	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
mother	NULL
confessor	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
without	NULL

Of	NULL
all	NULL

that	NULL

performed	NULL
by	NULL
mortal	NULL

there	NULL

none	NULL

now	NULL
proposed	NULL

Miss	NULL
Jupp	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
easy	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL

open	NULL
his	NULL
grief	NULL

her	NULL
;	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
coaxed	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL

where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL

the	NULL
fates	NULL

against	NULL

the	NULL

postponed	NULL
_	NULL
sine	NULL

_	NULL

for	NULL

determination	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL

gone	NULL

a	NULL

Mrs	NULL

a	NULL

many	NULL

when	NULL
she	NULL
started	NULL
back	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
movement	NULL
that	NULL
aroused	NULL
his	NULL
curiosity	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
hardly	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL

but	NULL
being	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
followed	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
hurried	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
turning	NULL
round	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
none	NULL
other	NULL

Ellen	NULL

the	NULL
housemaid	NULL

heard	NULL
of	NULL

was	NULL
turning	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
contempt	NULL

Brave	NULL
as	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
resolutions	NULL
about	NULL
facing	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL

you	NULL
too	NULL

he	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
crying	NULL
bitterly	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL

passionately	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

said	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
three	NULL

four	NULL
days	NULL

six	NULL
months	NULL

labour	NULL

"	NULL

Ellen	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL

but	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL

'	NULL
!	NULL

Master	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
dried	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
ice	NULL
was	NULL
broken	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
Ellen	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
prison	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
merely	NULL
saying	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
prison	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
feel	NULL
more	NULL
at	NULL
ease	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
her	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
classes	NULL
of	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
prison	NULL
and	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
as	NULL
fellow-creatures	NULL

more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
Christians	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
few	NULL
exceptions	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
regarded	NULL
with	NULL
suspicion	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
wholly	NULL
unmingled	NULL
with	NULL
contempt	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Ernest	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by-and-by	NULL
she	NULL
believed	NULL

"	NULL
Master	NULL
Ernest	NULL

said	NULL
she	NULL

after	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
talked	NULL

a	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL

indignant	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL

Her	NULL
only	NULL
recollection	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
quarrelled	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL

she	NULL
assumed	NULL

The	NULL

soon	NULL
afterwards	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL

up	NULL
Fetter	NULL

Ellen	NULL
had	NULL

hard	NULL

since	NULL
she	NULL

left	NULL
Battersby	NULL

but	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
little	NULL
trace	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL

Ernest	NULL
saw	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
fresh-looking	NULL
smiling	NULL
face	NULL

the	NULL
dimpled	NULL
cheek	NULL

the	NULL

lovely	NULL
sphinx-like	NULL
lips	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
remembered	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL

At	NULL
nineteen	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
much	NULL
younger	NULL
;	NULL
indeed	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
hardly	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
when	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
last	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
much	NULL
greater	NULL
experience	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
possessed	NULL
to	NULL
suspect	NULL
how	NULL
completely	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
estate	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
never	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
condition	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
wardrobe	NULL
was	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
ardent	NULL
spirits	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
first	NULL

she	NULL

five	NULL
or	NULL
six	NULL
times	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
gaol	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL

He	NULL
ascribed	NULL
the	NULL
poverty	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
attire	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
attempts	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
herself	NULL
respectable	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Ellen	NULL
during	NULL
supper	NULL
had	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
alluded	NULL
to	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
charmed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
declared	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
pint	NULL
of	NULL
beer	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
tipsy	NULL

had	NULL
only	NULL

a	NULL

To	NULL
him	NULL
she	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
easy	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
up	NULL
Fetter	NULL
Lane	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
towards	NULL
Laystall	NULL

he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wonderful	NULL
goodness	NULL

God	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
throwing	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL

him	NULL

he	NULL
might	NULL

never	NULL

for	NULL
a	NULL

accident	NULL

When	NULL

get	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
that	NULL

being	NULL
specially	NULL

the	NULL

Ellen	NULL
would	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL

not	NULL

more	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXXII	NULL
Ernest	NULL
told	NULL
Ellen	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
difficulty	NULL
about	NULL
finding	NULL
employment	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
what	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
shop	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Ellen	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
shop	NULL
yourself	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Ernest	NULL
asked	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
this	NULL
would	NULL
cost	NULL
.	NULL

Ellen	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
small	NULL
street	NULL
,	NULL
say	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Elephant	NULL
and	NULL
Castle	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
for	NULL
17s	NULL
.	NULL

or	NULL
18s	NULL
.	NULL

a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
top	NULL
floors	NULL
for	NULL
10s.	NULL
,	NULL
keeping	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
parlour	NULL
and	NULL
shop	NULL
for	NULL
themselves	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
raise	NULL
five	NULL
or	NULL
six	NULL
pounds	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
some	NULL
second-hand	NULL
clothes	NULL
to	NULL
stock	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
mend	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
clean	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
's	NULL
clothes	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
mend	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
orders	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
could	NULL
soon	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
business	NULL
of	NULL
2	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL
who	NULL
began	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
moved	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
shop	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
5	NULL
or	NULL
6	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
Ellen	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
buying	NULL
and	NULL
selling	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
light	NULL
indeed	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
his	NULL
5000	NULL
pounds	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
ever	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
later	NULL
on	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bargain	NULL
.	NULL

Ellen	NULL
seemed	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
good	NULL
genius	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
rashers	NULL
of	NULL
bacon	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
breakfast	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
cooked	NULL
them	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
nicely	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
laid	NULL
breakfast	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
coffee	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
nice	NULL
brown	NULL
toast	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
cook	NULL
and	NULL
housemaid	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
given	NULL
himself	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
he	NULL
suddenly	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
someone	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
only	NULL
had	NULL
Ellen	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
earn	NULL
a	NULL
living	NULL
when	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
except	NULL
himself	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
advise	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
here	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
pretty	NULL
and	NULL
smiling	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
after	NULL
even	NULL
his	NULL
comforts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
restoring	NULL
him	NULL
practically	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
respects	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
much	NULL
cared	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
putting	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
already	NULL
liked	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
wonder	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
radiant	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
his	NULL
plans	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
telling	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hesitated	NULL
,	NULL
blushed	NULL
,	NULL
hummed	NULL
and	NULL
hawed	NULL
.	NULL

Misgivings	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
cross	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
his	NULL
story	NULL
to	NULL
someone	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
slur	NULL
things	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
helped	NULL
him	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
bad	NULL
places	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
questioned	NULL
him	NULL
till	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
pretty	NULL
nearly	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
story	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
it	NULL
above	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
hope	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
show	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
angry	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
like	NULL
Ernest	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
attached	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
married	NULL
without	NULL
hating	NULL
his	NULL
intended	NULL
instinctively	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
observed	NULL
that	NULL
most	NULL
bachelors	NULL
feel	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
generally	NULL
at	NULL
some	NULL
pains	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
because	NULL
we	NULL
know	NULL
we	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
married	NULL
ourselves	NULL
.	NULL

Ordinarily	NULL
we	NULL
say	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
delighted	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
case	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
I	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL
to	NULL
conceal	NULL
my	NULL
vexation	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
much	NULL
promise	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
heir	NULL
also	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
a	NULL
handsome	NULL
fortune	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
fling	NULL
himself	NULL
away	NULL
upon	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
as	NULL
Ellen	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
too	NULL
provoking	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
so	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
unexpectedness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
affair	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
begged	NULL
him	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
Ellen	NULL
yet	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
longer	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
hear	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
his	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
given	NULL
it	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
give	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
hitherto	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
upon	NULL
most	NULL
matters	NULL
singularly	NULL
docile	NULL
and	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
manage	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
point	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
nothing	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
recent	NULL
victory	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
had	NULL
increased	NULL
his	NULL
strength	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
nowhere	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
true	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
would	NULL
only	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
bent	NULL
on	NULL
having	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
way	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
with	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
money	NULL
why	NULL
should	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
please	NULL
himself	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
urge	NULL
went	NULL
for	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
believed	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
an	NULL
artisan	NULL
or	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

Really	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
standpoint	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
very	NULL
outrageous	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
and	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
Ellen	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
of	NULL
respectable	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
borne	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
universally	NULL
liked	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
,	NULL
smart	NULL
,	NULL
hard-working	NULL
girl	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
pretty	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
they	NULL
met	NULL
again	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
behaviour	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
modesty	NULL
and	NULL
demureness	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
wonder	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
should	NULL
fail	NULL
to	NULL
realise	NULL
the	NULL
changes	NULL
that	NULL
eight	NULL
years	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
worked	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
against	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
bankrupt	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
squeamish	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
Ellen	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
only	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
prospects	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
reality	NULL
no	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
anything	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
imprudent	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
Ernest	NULL
proposed	NULL
than	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
marriages	NULL
that	NULL
take	NULL
place	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
inevitable	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
wished	NULL
my	NULL
young	NULL
friend	NULL
good	NULL
fortune	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
whatever	NULL
money	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
start	NULL
his	NULL
shop	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sufficient	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thanked	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
asked	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
kind	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
do	NULL
all	NULL
my	NULL
mending	NULL
and	NULL
repairing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
him	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
like	NULL
orders	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
reflections	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
even	NULL
more	NULL
angry	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
frank	NULL
,	NULL
boyish	NULL
face	NULL
had	NULL
beamed	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
happiness	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
rarely	NULL
visited	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Except	NULL
at	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
hardly	NULL
known	NULL
what	NULL
happiness	NULL
meant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
there	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
clouded	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
for	NULL
whom	NULL
wisdom	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
entrances	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
shut	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
enough	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
observed	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
impossible	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
helped	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Whether	NULL
I	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
animals	NULL
often	NULL
do	NULL
want	NULL
help	NULL
upon	NULL
matters	NULL
about	NULL
which	NULL
anyone	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
_	NULL
a	NULL
priori	NULL
_	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
difficulty	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
would	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
seal	NULL
would	NULL
want	NULL
no	NULL
teaching	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
swim	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
yet	NULL
a	NULL
bird	NULL
to	NULL
fly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
practice	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
seal	NULL
drowns	NULL
if	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
depth	NULL
before	NULL
its	NULL
parents	NULL
have	NULL
taught	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
swim	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
hawk	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
taught	NULL
to	NULL
fly	NULL
before	NULL
it	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
grant	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
tendency	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
times	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
exaggerate	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
which	NULL
teaching	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
teach	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
most	NULL
matters	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
neglected	NULL
others	NULL
in	NULL
respect	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
sensible	NULL
teaching	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
no	NULL
harm	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
fashion	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
young	NULL
people	NULL
must	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
things	NULL
for	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
they	NULL
probably	NULL
would	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
fair	NULL
play	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
extent	NULL
of	NULL
not	NULL
having	NULL
obstacles	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
they	NULL
seldom	NULL
have	NULL
fair	NULL
play	NULL
;	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
rule	NULL
they	NULL
meet	NULL
with	NULL
foul	NULL
play	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
foul	NULL
play	NULL
from	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
live	NULL
by	NULL
selling	NULL
them	NULL
stones	NULL
made	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
variety	NULL
of	NULL
shapes	NULL
and	NULL
sizes	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
form	NULL
a	NULL
tolerable	NULL
imitation	NULL
of	NULL
bread	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
are	NULL
lucky	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
with	NULL
few	NULL
obstacles	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
are	NULL
plucky	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
over-ride	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
cases	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
people	NULL
are	NULL
saved	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
saved	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
by	NULL
fire	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
Ellen	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
shop	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
south	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Thames	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Elephant	NULL
and	NULL
Castle	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
almost	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
rising	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
one	NULL
o'clock	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
several	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
selection	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
before	NULL
night	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
their	NULL
choice	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
brought	NULL
Ellen	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
well	NULL
refuse	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
laid	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
shillings	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
wardrobe	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
neatly	NULL
dressed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
very	NULL
pretty	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
good	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
be	NULL
surprised	NULL
at	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
infatuation	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
circumstances	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
were	NULL
taken	NULL
into	NULL
consideration	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
we	NULL
hated	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
instinctively	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
moment	NULL
we	NULL
set	NULL
eyes	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
we	NULL
each	NULL
told	NULL
Ernest	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
most	NULL
favourably	NULL
impressed	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
empty	NULL
house	NULL
is	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
stray	NULL
dog	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
body	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
life	NULL
has	NULL
departed	NULL
.	NULL

Decay	NULL
sets	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
mould	NULL
and	NULL
wind	NULL
and	NULL
weather	NULL
would	NULL
spare	NULL
,	NULL
street	NULL
boys	NULL
commonly	NULL
destroy	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
shop	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
untenanted	NULL
state	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dirty	NULL
unsavoury	NULL
place	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
house	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
run	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
jerry-builder	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
constitution	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
stamina	NULL
whatever	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
being	NULL
kept	NULL
warm	NULL
and	NULL
quiet	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
remain	NULL
in	NULL
health	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
months	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
empty	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
weeks	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
cats	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
in	NULL
by	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
had	NULL
broken	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
by	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
parlour	NULL
floor	NULL
was	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
stones	NULL
and	NULL
dirt	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
area	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dead	NULL
dog	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
killed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
and	NULL
been	NULL
thrown	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
unprotected	NULL
place	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
smell	NULL
throughout	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
bugs	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
rats	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
cats	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
drains	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
compound	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
four	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
determine	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sashes	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
fit	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
flimsy	NULL
doors	NULL
hung	NULL
badly	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
skirting	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
in	NULL
several	NULL
places	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
holes	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
locks	NULL
were	NULL
loose	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
paper	NULL
was	NULL
torn	NULL
and	NULL
dirty	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
were	NULL
weak	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
treads	NULL
give	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Over	NULL
and	NULL
above	NULL
these	NULL
drawbacks	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
ill	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
reason	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
wife	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
occupant	NULL
had	NULL
hanged	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
many	NULL
weeks	NULL
previously	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
set	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
bloater	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
round	NULL
of	NULL
toast	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
then	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
shortly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
kitchen	NULL
and	NULL
hanged	NULL
herself	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
kept	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
empty	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
excellent	NULL
position	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
corner	NULL
shop	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
last	NULL
tenant	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
immediately	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
inquest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
owner	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
done	NULL
up	NULL
then	NULL
people	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
tragedy	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
enacted	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
combination	NULL
of	NULL
bad	NULL
condition	NULL
and	NULL
bad	NULL
fame	NULL
had	NULL
hindered	NULL
many	NULL
from	NULL
taking	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
like	NULL
Ellen	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
great	NULL
business	NULL
capabilities	NULL
.	NULL

Almost	NULL
anything	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
sold	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
second-hand	NULL
clothes	NULL
shop	NULL
in	NULL
close	NULL
proximity	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
everything	NULL
combined	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
favour	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
its	NULL
filthy	NULL
state	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
reputation	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
rather	NULL
die	NULL
than	NULL
live	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
awful	NULL
place	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
living	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Temple	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
five	NULL
and	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
lodging	NULL
in	NULL
Laystall	NULL
Street	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
prison	NULL
;	NULL
before	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
Ashpit	NULL
Place	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
house	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
terrors	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
provided	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
it	NULL
done	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
difficulty	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
landlord	NULL
was	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
respect	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
ended	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
finding	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
everything	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
wanted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
lease	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
for	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
rental	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
paid	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
occupant	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
then	NULL
sublet	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
taking	NULL
care	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
put	NULL
more	NULL
efficiently	NULL
into	NULL
repair	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
landlord	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
week	NULL
later	NULL
I	NULL
called	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
everything	NULL
so	NULL
completely	NULL
transformed	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
hardly	NULL
have	NULL
recognised	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
ceilings	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
whitewashed	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL
papered	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
broken	NULL
glass	NULL
hacked	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
reinstated	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
defective	NULL
wood-work	NULL
renewed	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
sashes	NULL
,	NULL
cupboards	NULL
and	NULL
doors	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
painted	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
drains	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
overhauled	NULL
,	NULL
everything	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL
now	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
cheerful	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
forbidding	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
last	NULL
seen	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
the	NULL
repairs	NULL
were	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
cleaned	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
down	NULL
before	NULL
leaving	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Ellen	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
it	NULL
another	NULL
scrub	NULL
from	NULL
top	NULL
to	NULL
bottom	NULL
herself	NULL
after	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
clean	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
pin	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
almost	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
seventh	NULL
heaven	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
my	NULL
doing	NULL
and	NULL
Ellen	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
a	NULL
counter	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
fittings	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
now	NULL
remained	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
some	NULL
stock	NULL
and	NULL
set	NULL
them	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
sale	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
begin	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
by	NULL
selling	NULL
his	NULL
clerical	NULL
wardrobe	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
was	NULL
intended	NULL
especially	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sale	NULL
of	NULL
second-hand	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
Ellen	NULL
said	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
sell	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
books	NULL
too	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
a	NULL
beginning	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
by	NULL
selling	NULL
the	NULL
books	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
and	NULL
college	NULL
at	NULL
about	NULL
one	NULL
shilling	NULL
a	NULL
volume	NULL
,	NULL
taking	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
learned	NULL
more	NULL
that	NULL
proved	NULL
of	NULL
practical	NULL
use	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
through	NULL
stocking	NULL
his	NULL
books	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
bench	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
shop	NULL
and	NULL
selling	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
from	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
study	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bestowed	NULL
upon	NULL
their	NULL
contents	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
enquiries	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
and	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
taught	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
sell	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
;	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
made	NULL
ever	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
beginning	NULL
with	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
to	NULL
attending	NULL
book	NULL
sales	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
clothes	NULL
sales	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ere	NULL
long	NULL
this	NULL
branch	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
business	NULL
became	NULL
no	NULL
less	NULL
important	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
tailoring	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
exclusively	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
called	NULL
upon	NULL
to	NULL
remain	NULL
a	NULL
tradesman	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
anticipating	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
contribution	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
stipulation	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
sink	NULL
the	NULL
gentleman	NULL
completely	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
such	NULL
time	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
work	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
up	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
lived	NULL
with	NULL
Ellen	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
back	NULL
parlour	NULL
and	NULL
kitchen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
let	NULL
out	NULL
both	NULL
the	NULL
upper	NULL
floors	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
original	NULL
programme	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
himself	NULL
adrift	NULL
from	NULL
music	NULL
,	NULL
letters	NULL
and	NULL
polite	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
feared	NULL
that	NULL
unless	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
den	NULL
into	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
retire	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
ere	NULL
long	NULL
become	NULL
the	NULL
tradesman	NULL
and	NULL
nothing	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
therefore	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
taking	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
floor	NULL
front	NULL
and	NULL
back	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
furnishing	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
left	NULL
at	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
bought	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
sum	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
them	NULL
moved	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
present	NULL
abode	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
's	NULL
to	NULL
arrange	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Ernest	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
Ashpit	NULL
Place	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
half	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
furniture	NULL
sold	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
;	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
faults	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
old	NULL
woman	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
honest	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
Pryer	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
all	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
run	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
hated	NULL
Pryer	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
knew	NULL
anyone	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
as	NULL
white-livered	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
Pryer	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
n't	NULL
got	NULL
an	NULL
upright	NULL
vein	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
whole	NULL
body	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
breakfasting	NULL
with	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
morning	NULL
after	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL
shadow	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
he	NULL
carried	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
doing	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
please	NULL
him	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

First	NULL
I	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
them	NULL
eggs	NULL
and	NULL
bacon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
fish	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
else	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
fish	NULL
is	NULL
dearer	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
German	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
rose	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
I	NULL
tried	NULL
sausages	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
they	NULL
hit	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
worse	NULL
even	NULL
than	NULL
German	NULL
;	NULL
oh	NULL
!	NULL

how	NULL
I	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
wander	NULL
my	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
fret	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
inwardly	NULL
and	NULL
cry	NULL
for	NULL
hours	NULL

and	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL

it	NULL

she	NULL
continued	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL

Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL

play	NULL

there	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
played	NULL
it	NULL
once	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL

In	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
the	NULL
furniture	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
Ernest	NULL

In	NULL

greatly	NULL
to	NULL

was	NULL
no	NULL

about	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
through	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
again	NULL
if	NULL
necessary	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Ellen	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
reputation	NULL
--	NULL
considering	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
Ellen	NULL
and	NULL
me	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
finished	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
remained	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
some	NULL
stock	NULL
and	NULL
begin	NULL
selling	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
stole	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
castle	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
floor	NULL
front	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
lit	NULL
his	NULL
pipe	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
played	NULL
Handel	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
set	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
and	NULL
write	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
sermons	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
theological	NULL
works	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
compose	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
;	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
them	NULL
consume	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
another	NULL
incubus	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
pieces	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
undergraduate	NULL
life	NULL
at	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
them	NULL
about	NULL
and	NULL
re-write	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
worked	NULL
quietly	NULL
at	NULL
these	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
clock	NULL
strike	NULL
ten	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
happy	NULL
but	NULL
supremely	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
Ellen	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
Debenham	NULL
's	NULL
auction	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
surveyed	NULL
the	NULL
lots	NULL
of	NULL
clothes	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
hung	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
auction	NULL
room	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
viewed	NULL
.	NULL

Ellen	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
sufficient	NULL
experience	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
about	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
each	NULL
lot	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
fetch	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
overhauled	NULL
lot	NULL
after	NULL
lot	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
valued	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
short	NULL
time	NULL
Ernest	NULL
himself	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
fair	NULL
idea	NULL
what	NULL
each	NULL
lot	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
valued	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
lots	NULL
running	NULL
at	NULL
prices	NULL
about	NULL
which	NULL
Ellen	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
hurt	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
them	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
disliking	NULL
this	NULL
work	NULL
or	NULL
finding	NULL
it	NULL
tedious	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL
anything	NULL
which	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
overtax	NULL
his	NULL
physical	NULL
strength	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
held	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
bringing	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

Ellen	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
buy	NULL
anything	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
sale	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
see	NULL
one	NULL
sale	NULL
first	NULL
and	NULL
watch	NULL
how	NULL
prices	NULL
actually	NULL
went	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
at	NULL
twelve	NULL
o'clock	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
sale	NULL
began	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
lots	NULL
sold	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
Ellen	NULL
had	NULL
marked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
sale	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
bid	NULL
with	NULL
safety	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
actually	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
.	NULL

Knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
sort	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
easily	NULL
acquired	NULL
by	NULL
anyone	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
_	NULL
bona	NULL
fide	NULL
_	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Ellen	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
at	NULL
auctions	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
.	NULL

Private	NULL
dealing	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
best	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
example	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
cast-off	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
my	NULL
laundress	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
connection	NULL
with	NULL
other	NULL
laundresses	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
trifle	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
for	NULL
whatever	NULL
clothes	NULL
their	NULL
masters	NULL
might	NULL
give	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
profit	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
sold	NULL
their	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
sell	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
flinched	NULL
at	NULL
nothing	NULL
;	NULL
perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
flinched	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
idea	NULL
how	NULL
_	NULL
outre	NULL
_	NULL
his	NULL
proceedings	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
ignorance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
ruined	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
till	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
happy	NULL
irony	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
cure	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
some	NULL
malignant	NULL
fairy	NULL
had	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
curse	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
respect	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
overdone	NULL
her	NULL
malice	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
anything	NULL
strange	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
only	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
must	NULL
provide	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
possible	NULL
family	NULL
.	NULL

More	NULL
than	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
some	NULL
leisure	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
read	NULL
and	NULL
write	NULL
and	NULL
keep	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
music	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
anyone	NULL
would	NULL
show	NULL
him	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
much	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
well	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
week	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
found	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
clear	NULL
profit	NULL
of	NULL
3	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
this	NULL
had	NULL
increased	NULL
to	NULL
4	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
New	NULL
Year	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
profit	NULL
of	NULL
5	NULL
pounds	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
been	NULL
married	NULL
some	NULL
two	NULL
months	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
stuck	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
original	NULL
plan	NULL
of	NULL
marrying	NULL
Ellen	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
legally	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
date	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
delayed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
abode	NULL
from	NULL
Laystall	NULL
Street	NULL
to	NULL
Blackfriars	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
day	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
250	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
times	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
affluence	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
profit	NULL
of	NULL
5	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
maintained	NULL
steadily	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
place	NULL
him	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
income	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
feed	NULL
two	NULL
mouths	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
his	NULL
expenses	NULL
in	NULL
other	NULL
ways	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
curtailed	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
changed	NULL
social	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
income	NULL
was	NULL
practically	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
twelvemonth	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
next	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
increase	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
by	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

Prosperity	NULL
depends	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
all	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
great	NULL
measure	NULL
upon	NULL
energy	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
sense	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
also	NULL
depends	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
upon	NULL
pure	NULL
luck	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
connections	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
tangle	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
more	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
exist	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
trace	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
reputation	NULL
as	NULL
being	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
rising	NULL
one	NULL

and	NULL
yet	NULL
may	NULL
become	NULL
suddenly	NULL
eclipsed	NULL
by	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL
so	NULL
promising	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
fever	NULL

may	NULL
divert	NULL
the	NULL
stream	NULL
of	NULL
business	NULL

or	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL

attract	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
certainly	NULL
known	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
better	NULL

to	NULL

more	NULL

is	NULL

everybody	NULL

chance	NULL

Luck	NULL

certainly	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL
hitherto	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
him	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
protection	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
prospered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
no	NULL
sooner	NULL
bought	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
shop	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
sold	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
profit	NULL
of	NULL
from	NULL
thirty	NULL
to	NULL
fifty	NULL
per	NULL
cent	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
learned	NULL
book-keeping	NULL

watched	NULL
his	NULL
accounts	NULL
carefully	NULL
,	NULL
following	NULL
up	NULL
any	NULL
success	NULL
immediately	NULL

he	NULL
began	NULL

as	NULL
books	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXXIII	NULL
Ellen	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
capitally	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
disparity	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
great	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
neither	NULL
did	NULL
Ellen	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
elevated	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
did	NULL
Ernest	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
elevate	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
interests	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
serve	NULL
in	NULL
common	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
antecedents	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
each	NULL
was	NULL
familiar	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
excellent	NULL
tempers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

Ellen	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
jealous	NULL
at	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
preferring	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
floor	NULL
front	NULL
where	NULL
I	NULL
occasionally	NULL
visited	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
somehow	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
generally	NULL
found	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
occupy	NULL
her	NULL
down	NULL
below	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
tact	NULL
also	NULL
to	NULL
encourage	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
evening	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
caring	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
too	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
suited	NULL
Ernest	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
happier	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
married	NULL
life	NULL
than	NULL
people	NULL
generally	NULL
are	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
painful	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
sometimes	NULL
accidentally	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
soon	NULL
passed	NULL
;	NULL
either	NULL
they	NULL
cut	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
he	NULL
cut	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
nice	NULL
being	NULL
cut	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
became	NULL
rather	NULL
pleasant	NULL
than	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
ahead	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
cared	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
what	NULL
people	NULL
might	NULL
say	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
antecedents	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
ordeal	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
painful	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
moral	NULL
and	NULL
intellectual	NULL
constitution	NULL
are	NULL
naturally	NULL
sound	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
nothing	NULL
which	NULL
will	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
strength	NULL
of	NULL
character	NULL
as	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
well	NULL
cut	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
easy	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
his	NULL
expenditure	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
tastes	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
luxurious	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
liked	NULL
theatres	NULL
,	NULL
outings	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
Sunday	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tobacco	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
much	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
writing	NULL
and	NULL
music	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
run	NULL
of	NULL
concerts	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
worshipped	NULL
Handel	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
Offenbach	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
airs	NULL
that	NULL
went	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
nothing	NULL
between	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
extremes	NULL
.	NULL

Music	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
cost	NULL
him	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
theatres	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
Ellen	NULL
as	NULL
many	NULL
orders	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
these	NULL
cost	NULL
them	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Sunday	NULL
outings	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
item	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
shilling	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
return	NULL
ticket	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
place	NULL
far	NULL
enough	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
town	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
walk	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
thorough	NULL
change	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Ellen	NULL
went	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
few	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
friends	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
sometimes	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
hit	NULL
it	NULL
off	NULL
perhaps	NULL
too	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
sensible	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
suited	NULL
Ernest	NULL
so	NULL
exactly	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
readily	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
suspect	NULL
dangers	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
apparent	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
treated	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
kept	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
all	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
chief	NULL
pleasures	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
writing	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
carries	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
sketch	NULL
book	NULL
and	NULL
is	NULL
continually	NULL
jotting	NULL
down	NULL
sketches	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
the	NULL
artistic	NULL
instinct	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
things	NULL
may	NULL
hinder	NULL
his	NULL
due	NULL
development	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
instinct	NULL
is	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
literary	NULL
instinct	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
known	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
keeping	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
note-book	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
waistcoat	NULL
pocket	NULL
,	NULL
into	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
jots	NULL
down	NULL
anything	NULL
that	NULL
strikes	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
any	NULL
good	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
hears	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
reference	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
passage	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
thinks	NULL
will	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
useful	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
note-book	NULL
always	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
the	NULL
practice	NULL
without	NULL
anyone	NULL
's	NULL
having	NULL
suggested	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
notes	NULL
he	NULL
copied	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
time	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
accumulated	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
driven	NULL
into	NULL
indexing	NULL
approximately	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
along	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
literary	NULL
instinct	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
his	NULL
notes	NULL
I	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
hope	NULL
great	NULL
things	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
disappointed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
kept	NULL
back	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
subjects	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
generally	NULL
metaphysical	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
vain	NULL
I	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
him	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
these	NULL
to	NULL
matters	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
greater	NULL
interest	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
public	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
begged	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
at	NULL
some	NULL
pretty	NULL
,	NULL
graceful	NULL
,	NULL
little	NULL
story	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
whatever	NULL
people	NULL
knew	NULL
and	NULL
liked	NULL
best	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
immediately	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
treatise	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
the	NULL
grounds	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
all	NULL
belief	NULL
rested	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
are	NULL
stirring	NULL
mud	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
or	NULL
poking	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
sleeping	NULL
dog	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
are	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
people	NULL
resume	NULL
consciousness	NULL
about	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
sensible	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
already	NULL
passed	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
unconscious	NULL
stage	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
men	NULL
whom	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
disturb	NULL
are	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
fancy	NULL
,	NULL
behind	NULL
you	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
you	NULL
who	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
lagger	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
they	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
engaged	NULL
on	NULL
an	NULL
essay	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
famous	NULL
_	NULL
quod	NULL
semper	NULL

quod	NULL
ubique	NULL
,	NULL
quod	NULL
ab	NULL
omnibus	NULL
_	NULL
of	NULL
St	NULL
Vincent	NULL
de	NULL
Lerins	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
provoking	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
showed	NULL
himself	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
better	NULL
things	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
liked	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
at	NULL
work	NULL
upon	NULL
my	NULL
burlesque	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
Impatient	NULL
Griselda	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
sometimes	NULL
at	NULL
my	NULL
wits	NULL
'	NULL
end	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
business	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
situation	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
me	NULL
many	NULL
suggestions	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
marked	NULL
by	NULL
excellent	NULL
good	NULL
sense	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
prevail	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
philosophy	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
choice	NULL
of	NULL
subjects	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
approve	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
continually	NULL
studying	NULL
scientific	NULL
and	NULL
metaphysical	NULL
writers	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
either	NULL
finding	NULL
or	NULL
making	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
philosopher	NULL
's	NULL
stone	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shape	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
system	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
all	NULL
fours	NULL
under	NULL
all	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
liable	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
upset	NULL
at	NULL
every	NULL
touch	NULL
and	NULL
turn	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
every	NULL
system	NULL
yet	NULL
promulgated	NULL
has	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
kept	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
pursuit	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
will-o	NULL
'	NULL
-	NULL
the-wisp	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
gave	NULL
up	NULL
hope	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
set	NULL
him	NULL
down	NULL
as	NULL
another	NULL
fly	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
caught	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
paper	NULL
daubed	NULL
over	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
sticky	NULL
stuff	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
merit	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
sweet	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
surprise	NULL
he	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
declared	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
satisfied	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
supposed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
hit	NULL
upon	NULL
some	NULL
new	NULL
"	NULL
Lo	NULL
,	NULL
here	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

when	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
relief	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
concluded	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
system	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
perfectly	NULL
upon	NULL
all	NULL
fours	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
inasmuch	NULL
as	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
behind	NULL
Bishop	NULL
Berkeley	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
therefore	NULL
no	NULL
absolutely	NULL
incontrovertible	NULL
first	NULL
premise	NULL
could	NULL
ever	NULL
be	NULL
laid	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
found	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
pleased	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
perfect	NULL
system	NULL
imaginable	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
which	NULL
way	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
whether	NULL
a	NULL
system	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
possible	NULL
then	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
system	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
system	NULL
based	NULL
on	NULL
absolute	NULL
certainty	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
contented	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
vague	NULL
idea	NULL
who	NULL
Bishop	NULL
Berkeley	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
was	NULL
thankful	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
having	NULL
defended	NULL
us	NULL
from	NULL
an	NULL
incontrovertible	NULL
first	NULL
premise	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
afraid	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
words	NULL
implying	NULL
that	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
trouble	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
which	NULL
sensible	NULL
people	NULL
reach	NULL
without	NULL
bothering	NULL
their	NULL
brains	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
born	NULL
sensible	NULL

A	NULL
child	NULL
of	NULL
ordinary	NULL
powers	NULL
learns	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
at	NULL

year	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
old	NULL
without	NULL
knowing	NULL
much	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL

failing	NULL

powers	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
learn	NULL
laboriously	NULL
than	NULL
never	NULL
learn	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
sorry	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
stronger	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
was	NULL
my	NULL
only	NULL
chance	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
so	NULL
meek	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
vexed	NULL
with	NULL
myself	NULL
for	NULL
having	NULL
said	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
especially	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
remembered	NULL
his	NULL
bringing-up	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
doubtless	NULL
done	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
impair	NULL
his	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
common-sense	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
continued	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
now	NULL

The	NULL
people	NULL
like	NULL

who	NULL
know	NULL

is	NULL
worth	NULL
knowing	NULL

can	NULL

He	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
stuck	NULL
to	NULL
science	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
turning	NULL
to	NULL
literature	NULL
proper	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
hoped	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
confined	NULL
himself	NULL
henceforth	NULL
to	NULL
enquiries	NULL
on	NULL
specific	NULL
subjects	NULL
concerning	NULL
which	NULL
an	NULL
increase	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
knowledge	NULL

as	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL

was	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
infinite	NULL
vexation	NULL
of	NULL
spirit	NULL
,	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
conclusion	NULL
which	NULL
cut	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
roots	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
knowledge	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
settled	NULL
contentedly	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
pursuit	NULL
of	NULL
knowledge	NULL

has	NULL
pursued	NULL
it	NULL
ever	NULL

into	NULL

this	NULL

anticipating	NULL

may	NULL
perhaps	NULL
also	NULL
convey	NULL
a	NULL
wrong	NULL
impression	NULL

for	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
outset	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
occasionally	NULL
turn	NULL
his	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXXIV	NULL
About	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
set	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
shop	NULL
his	NULL
prosperity	NULL
had	NULL
reached	NULL
its	NULL
climax	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
even	NULL
then	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
ahead	NULL
no	NULL
less	NULL
fast	NULL
than	NULL
heretofore	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
doubt	NULL
not	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
success	NULL
or	NULL
non-success	NULL
had	NULL
depended	NULL
upon	NULL
himself	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

Unfortunately	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
person	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
reckoned	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
attend	NULL
some	NULL
sales	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
perfectly	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
in	NULL
good	NULL
spirits	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looking	NULL
very	NULL
pretty	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
sitting	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
chair	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
parlour	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
sobbing	NULL
and	NULL
crying	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
would	NULL
break	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
frightened	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
pretended	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
customer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
threatened	NULL
her	NULL
unless	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
some	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
herself	NULL
from	NULL
violence	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
hysterics	NULL
ever	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
story	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
speech	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
incoherent	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
knew	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thinking	NULL
this	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
doctor	NULL
if	NULL
Ellen	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
begged	NULL
him	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

Anyone	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
experience	NULL
of	NULL
drunken	NULL
people	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
--	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
drunkenness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
habitual	NULL
drunkard	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
shows	NULL
itself	NULL
very	NULL
differently	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
gets	NULL
drunk	NULL
only	NULL
once	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
could	NULL
drink	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
even	NULL
crossed	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
she	NULL
always	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
fuss	NULL
about	NULL
taking	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
beer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
touched	NULL
spirits	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
about	NULL
hysterics	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
about	NULL
drunkenness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
women	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
mothers	NULL
were	NULL
liable	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
easily	NULL
upset	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
often	NULL
rather	NULL
flighty	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
greatly	NULL
surprised	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
settled	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
by	NULL
registering	NULL
the	NULL
discovery	NULL
that	NULL
being	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
father	NULL
has	NULL
its	NULL
troublesome	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
its	NULL
pleasant	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
great	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
Ellen	NULL
's	NULL
life	NULL
consequent	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
meeting	NULL
Ernest	NULL
and	NULL
getting	NULL
married	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
actually	NULL
sobered	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
shaking	NULL
her	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
ways	NULL
.	NULL

Drunkenness	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
habit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
habit	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
surroundings	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
completely	NULL
change	NULL
the	NULL
surroundings	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
sometimes	NULL
get	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
drunkenness	NULL
altogether	NULL
.	NULL

Ellen	NULL
had	NULL
intended	NULL
remaining	NULL
always	NULL
sober	NULL
henceforward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
having	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
a	NULL
steady	NULL
fit	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
believed	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
cured	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
she	NULL
perhaps	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
acquaintances	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
new	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
lose	NULL
its	NULL
newness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
acquaintances	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
present	NULL
surroundings	NULL
became	NULL
more	NULL
like	NULL
her	NULL
past	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
like	NULL
her	NULL
past	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
she	NULL
only	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
tipsy	NULL
and	NULL
struggled	NULL
against	NULL
a	NULL
relapse	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
use	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
soon	NULL
lost	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
to	NULL
fight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
her	NULL
object	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
and	NULL
keep	NULL
sober	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
gin	NULL
without	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
finding	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
the	NULL
hysterics	NULL
continued	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
still	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
being	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
worse	NULL
her	NULL
attacks	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
devoted	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
insisted	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
doctor	NULL
should	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
doctor	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
took	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
except	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
guarded	NULL
way	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
the	NULL
hints	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
thrown	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
too	NULL
downright	NULL
and	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
quick	NULL
at	NULL
taking	NULL
hints	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
sort	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hoped	NULL
that	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
confinement	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
regain	NULL
her	NULL
health	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
thought	NULL
save	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
spare	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
till	NULL
that	NULL
happy	NULL
time	NULL
should	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
mornings	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
generally	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
as	NULL
Ernest	NULL
remained	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
buying	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
return	NULL
would	NULL
generally	NULL
find	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
another	NULL
attack	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
times	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
laugh	NULL
and	NULL
cry	NULL
for	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
others	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
lie	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
semi-comatose	NULL
state	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
find	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
neglected	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
household	NULL
left	NULL
undone	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
granted	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
course	NULL
when	NULL
women	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
mothers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Ellen	NULL
's	NULL
share	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
shoulders	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
and	NULL
drudged	NULL
away	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
murmur	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
vague	NULL
way	NULL
more	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
in	NULL
Ashpit	NULL
Place	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
lose	NULL
the	NULL
buoyancy	NULL
of	NULL
spirits	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
another	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
married	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
household	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
cooking	NULL
,	NULL
cleaning	NULL
up	NULL
slops	NULL
,	NULL
bed-making	NULL
and	NULL
fire-lighting	NULL
ere	NULL
long	NULL
devolved	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
business	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
prospered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
buy	NULL
as	NULL
hitherto	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Ellen	NULL
seemed	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
sell	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
sold	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fact	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
sold	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
kept	NULL
back	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
proceeds	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
gin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
this	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
till	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
unsuspecting	NULL
Ernest	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
telling	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
sold	NULL
better	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
safe	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
back	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
amount	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
money	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
plea	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
longing	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
or	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
perhaps	NULL
irreparably	NULL
damage	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
if	NULL
her	NULL
longing	NULL
was	NULL
denied	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
seemed	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
reasonable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
unavoidable	NULL
,	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
Ernest	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
confinement	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
however	NULL
would	NULL
then	NULL
come	NULL
right	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXXV	NULL
In	NULL
the	NULL
month	NULL
of	NULL
September	NULL
1860	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
born	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
proud	NULL
and	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
birth	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
alarming	NULL
talk	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
Ellen	NULL
sobered	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
really	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
his	NULL
hopes	NULL
were	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
fulfilled	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
expenses	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
confinement	NULL
were	NULL
heavy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
trench	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
savings	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
about	NULL
soon	NULL
recouping	NULL
this	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
Ellen	NULL
was	NULL
herself	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
indeed	NULL
his	NULL
business	NULL
did	NULL
revive	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
interruption	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
prosperity	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
way	NULL
broken	NULL
the	NULL
spell	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
luck	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
attended	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
outset	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
sanguine	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
worked	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
day	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
music	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
reading	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
writing	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
Sunday	NULL
outings	NULL
were	NULL
put	NULL
a	NULL
stop	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
floor	NULL
being	NULL
let	NULL
to	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
lost	NULL
his	NULL
citadel	NULL
there	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
seldom	NULL
used	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Ellen	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
consequence	NULL
,	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
upon	NULL
Ellen	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
months	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
born	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
my	NULL
unhappy	NULL
hero	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
more	NULL
hopeful	NULL
and	NULL
therefore	NULL
better	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
his	NULL
burdens	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
returned	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
sale	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
Ellen	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
hysterical	NULL
condition	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
again	NULL
with	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
still	NULL
believed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
troubles	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
preceding	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
began	NULL
again	NULL
then	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
grew	NULL
worse	NULL
and	NULL
worse	NULL
continually	NULL
.	NULL

Money	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Ellen	NULL
cheated	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
keeping	NULL
it	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dealing	NULL
improperly	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
goods	NULL
he	NULL
bought	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
before	NULL
on	NULL
pretexts	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
inhuman	NULL
to	NULL
inquire	NULL
into	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
story	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
feature	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
inherited	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
punctuality	NULL
and	NULL
exactness	NULL
as	NULL
regards	NULL
money	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
having	NULL
expenses	NULL
sprung	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
which	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
foreseen	NULL
might	NULL
and	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
bills	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
things	NULL
ordered	NULL
by	NULL
Ellen	NULL
without	NULL
his	NULL
knowledge	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
awful	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
Ernest	NULL
turned	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
remonstrated	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
having	NULL
bought	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
having	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
moneys	NULL
being	NULL
owing	NULL
--	NULL
Ellen	NULL
met	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
hysteria	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
scene	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
pretty	NULL
well	NULL
forgotten	NULL
the	NULL
hard	NULL
times	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
resources	NULL
and	NULL
reproached	NULL
him	NULL
downright	NULL
with	NULL
having	NULL
married	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
scales	NULL
fell	NULL
from	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL

Towneley	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

no	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
woke	NULL
up	NULL
once	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
mistake	NULL
in	NULL
marrying	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
touch	NULL
had	NULL
again	NULL
come	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
revealed	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
upstairs	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
disused	NULL
citadel	NULL
,	NULL
flung	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
arm-chair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
covered	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
still	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
drank	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
trust	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
dream	NULL
of	NULL
happiness	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
saved	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
by	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
saved	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
what	NULL
could	NULL
now	NULL
save	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
marriage	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
mistake	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
in	NULL
wedding	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
times	NULL
worse	NULL
results	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
learnt	NULL
nothing	NULL
by	NULL
experience	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
Esau	NULL
--	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
wretches	NULL
whose	NULL
hearts	NULL
the	NULL
Lord	NULL
had	NULL
hardened	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
ears	NULL
,	NULL
heard	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
eyes	NULL
saw	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
should	NULL
find	NULL
no	NULL
place	NULL
for	NULL
repentance	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
sought	NULL
it	NULL
even	NULL
with	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
ways	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
singleness	NULL
of	NULL
heart	NULL
?	NULL

To	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
extent	NULL
,	NULL
yes	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
thorough	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
for	NULL
God	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
little	NULL
as	NULL
compared	NULL
with	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
and	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
punished	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
God	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
taskmaster	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
continually	NULL
pouncing	NULL
out	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
unhappy	NULL
creatures	NULL
from	NULL
ambuscades	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
marrying	NULL
Ellen	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
a	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
sin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
moral	NULL
and	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
his	NULL
antecedents	NULL
and	NULL
surroundings	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
natural	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
frightful	NULL
position	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
his	NULL
morality	NULL
landed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Could	NULL
any	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
immorality	NULL
have	NULL
placed	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
worse	NULL
one	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
morality	NULL
worth	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
brought	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
peace	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
anyone	NULL
have	NULL
reasonable	NULL
certainty	NULL
that	NULL
marriage	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
moral	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
following	NULL
a	NULL
devil	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
disguised	NULL
itself	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
angel	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
if	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
ground	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
might	NULL
rest	NULL
the	NULL
sole	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
foot	NULL
and	NULL
tread	NULL
in	NULL
reasonable	NULL
safety	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
too	NULL
young	NULL
to	NULL
reach	NULL
the	NULL
answer	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
On	NULL
common	NULL
sense	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
answer	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
unworthy	NULL
of	NULL
anyone	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
ideal	NULL
standard	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
this	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
plain	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
done	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
thus	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
time	NULL
a	NULL
gleam	NULL
of	NULL
sunshine	NULL
and	NULL
hope	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
obscured	NULL
immediately	NULL
--	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
prison	NULL
was	NULL
happier	NULL
than	NULL
this	NULL
!	NULL

There	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
money	NULL
anxieties	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
these	NULL
were	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
weigh	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
their	NULL
horrors	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
happier	NULL
even	NULL
now	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
Roughborough	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
now	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
outlook	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
gloomy	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
so	NULL
hopeless	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
only	NULL
too	NULL
gladly	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
and	NULL
died	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arm-chair	NULL
once	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
musing	NULL
thus	NULL
and	NULL
looking	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
wreck	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
hopes	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
well	NULL
enough	NULL
that	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL

Ellen	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
never	NULL
rise	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
dreamed	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
noise	NULL
below	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
a	NULL
neighbour	NULL
ran	NULL
upstairs	NULL
and	NULL
entered	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
hurriedly	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL

down	NULL

found	NULL
his	NULL

Ellen	NULL
had	NULL

he	NULL

Ernest	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
believe	NULL
his	NULL
ears	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
more	NULL
quiet	NULL

he	NULL
went	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
house	NULL
hard	NULL
by	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
enquiries	NULL

the	NULL

The	NULL

my	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL

came	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
money	NULL

but	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
his	NULL
miserable	NULL
story	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
wrong	NULL

had	NULL
suspected	NULL
pretty	NULL
shrewdly	NULL
what	NULL

matter	NULL

course	NULL
I	NULL

nothing	NULL

Ernest	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
growing	NULL
apart	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
vexed	NULL
at	NULL

he	NULL
knew	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
vexed	NULL

my	NULL

are	NULL
also	NULL

the	NULL

The	NULL
rift	NULL

its	NULL
appearance	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
marriage	NULL
of	NULL
either	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
fast	NULL
widening	NULL

it	NULL
no	NULL

into	NULL
the	NULL

In	NULL
fact	NULL

him	NULL

a	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

mind	NULL
this	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
lie	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
seldom	NULL
come	NULL
near	NULL
me	NULL
till	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
evening	NULL
late	NULL
in	NULL
1860	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
on	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
woebegone	NULL
face	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
his	NULL
troubles	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
liked	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
I	NULL
forgave	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL

was	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
interested	NULL

him	NULL

There	NULL
is	NULL
nothing	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
bachelor	NULL
likes	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
married	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
wishes	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
got	NULL
married	NULL
--	NULL
especially	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
is	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
extreme	NULL
one	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
need	NULL
not	NULL
pretend	NULL
to	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
matters	NULL
will	NULL
come	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
encourage	NULL
his	NULL
young	NULL
friend	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
myself	NULL
in	NULL
favour	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
separation	NULL

and	NULL
said	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
Ellen	NULL
an	NULL
allowance	NULL
myself	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
intending	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL

Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
money	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
hear	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
Ellen	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
reform	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hated	NULL
it	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
try	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
finding	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
very	NULL
obstinate	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
acquiesce	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
with	NULL
little	NULL
confidence	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
vexed	NULL
at	NULL
seeing	NULL
him	NULL
waste	NULL
himself	NULL
upon	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
barren	NULL
task	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
him	NULL
burdensome	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
afraid	NULL
I	NULL
showed	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
again	NULL
avoided	NULL
me	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
months	NULL
I	NULL
hardly	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Ellen	NULL
remained	NULL
very	NULL
ill	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
gradually	NULL
recovered	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
hardly	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
danger	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
recovered	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
another	NULL
attack	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
certainly	NULL
die	NULL
;	NULL
this	NULL
so	NULL
frightened	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
pledge	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
more	NULL
hopeful	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sober	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
married	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
quick	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
to	NULL
forget	NULL
pain	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Ellen	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
forgive	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
knowing	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
watch	NULL
to	NULL
shield	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
temptation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
his	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
uneasiness	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
burden	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
union	NULL
with	NULL
respectability	NULL
grow	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
heavy	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
back	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
longingly	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
lawless	NULL
freedom	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
led	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
met	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
dwell	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
story	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
months	NULL
of	NULL
1861	NULL
she	NULL
kept	NULL
straight	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
fling	NULL
of	NULL
dissipation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
together	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
made	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
having	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
pledge	NULL
,	NULL
tamed	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
shop	NULL
went	NULL
fairly	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
enabled	NULL
Ernest	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
ends	NULL
meet	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
and	NULL
summer	NULL
of	NULL
1861	NULL
he	NULL
even	NULL
put	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
money	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
autumn	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
was	NULL
confined	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
fine	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
everyone	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
soon	NULL
recovered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
breathe	NULL
freely	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
almost	NULL
sanguine	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
of	NULL
warning	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
storm	NULL
broke	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
returned	NULL
one	NULL
afternoon	NULL
about	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
lying	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
insensible	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
hopeless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
visibly	NULL
down	NULL
hill	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
knocked	NULL
about	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
luck	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
too	NULL
long	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wear	NULL
and	NULL
tear	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
not	NULL
actually	NULL
ill	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
overworked	NULL
,	NULL
below	NULL
par	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
unfit	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
further	NULL
burden	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
struggled	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
finding	NULL
this	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
facts	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
strong	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Again	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
on	NULL
me	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
the	NULL
crisis	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
sorry	NULL
for	NULL
Ellen	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
complete	NULL
separation	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
chance	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
after	NULL
this	NULL
last	NULL
outbreak	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
unwilling	NULL
to	NULL
consent	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
talked	NULL
nonsense	NULL
about	NULL
dying	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
post	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Each	NULL
time	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
gloom	NULL
had	NULL
settled	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
deeply	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
about	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
_	NULL
coup	NULL
de	NULL
main	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
bribing	NULL
Ellen	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
somebody	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
matters	NULL
settled	NULL
themselves	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
anticipated	NULL
.	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXXVI	NULL
The	NULL
winter	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
trying	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
paid	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
by	NULL
selling	NULL
his	NULL
piano	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
link	NULL
that	NULL
connected	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
earlier	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
sink	NULL
once	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
shop-keeper	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
however	NULL
low	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
sink	NULL
his	NULL
pain	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
last	NULL
much	NULL
longer	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
simply	NULL
die	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hated	NULL
Ellen	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
open	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
harmony	NULL
with	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
America	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
with	NULL
Ellen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
taking	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
America	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
lost	NULL
energy	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
and	NULL
gone	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
nerve	NULL
was	NULL
shaken	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
day	NULL
went	NULL
by	NULL
and	NULL
nothing	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
shillings	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
value	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
stock	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
perhaps	NULL
3	NULL
or	NULL
4	NULL
pounds	NULL
by	NULL
selling	NULL
his	NULL
music	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
few	NULL
pictures	NULL
and	NULL
pieces	NULL
of	NULL
furniture	NULL
still	NULL
belonged	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
pen	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
writing	NULL
had	NULL
dropped	NULL
off	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

Look	NULL
which	NULL
way	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
hope	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
actually	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
within	NULL
easy	NULL
distance	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
face	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
actual	NULL
want	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
people	NULL
going	NULL
about	NULL
poorly	NULL
clad	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
without	NULL
shoes	NULL
and	NULL
stockings	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
months	NULL
'	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
too	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
remorseless	NULL
,	NULL
resistless	NULL
hand	NULL
of	NULL
fate	NULL
had	NULL
caught	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
grip	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
dragging	NULL
him	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
he	NULL
staggered	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
going	NULL
his	NULL
daily	NULL
rounds	NULL
,	NULL
buying	NULL
second-hand	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
spending	NULL
his	NULL
evenings	NULL
in	NULL
cleaning	NULL
and	NULL
mending	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
returning	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
West	NULL
End	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
some	NULL
clothes	NULL
from	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
servants	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
struck	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
crowd	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
gathered	NULL
round	NULL
a	NULL
space	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
railed	NULL
off	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
near	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
paths	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Green	NULL
Park	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lovely	NULL
soft	NULL
spring	NULL
morning	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
March	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
unusually	NULL
balmy	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
year	NULL
;	NULL
even	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
melancholy	NULL
was	NULL
relieved	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
spring	NULL
that	NULL
pervaded	NULL
earth	NULL
and	NULL
sky	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
soon	NULL
returned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
smiling	NULL
sadly	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
It	NULL
may	NULL
bring	NULL
hope	NULL
to	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
there	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
hope	NULL
henceforth	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

As	NULL
these	NULL
words	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
he	NULL
joined	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
crowd	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
gathered	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
railings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
three	NULL
sheep	NULL
with	NULL
very	NULL
small	NULL
lambs	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
penned	NULL
off	NULL
for	NULL
shelter	NULL
and	NULL
protection	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
that	NULL
ranged	NULL
the	NULL
park	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
pretty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Londoners	NULL
so	NULL
seldom	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
lambs	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
wonder	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
stopped	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
observed	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
seemed	NULL
fonder	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
lubberly	NULL
butcher	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
leaned	NULL
up	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
railings	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
tray	NULL
of	NULL
meat	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
shoulder	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
boy	NULL
and	NULL
smiling	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
grotesqueness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
admiration	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
watched	NULL
intently	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
coachman	NULL
's	NULL
livery	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
also	NULL
stopped	NULL
to	NULL
admire	NULL
the	NULL
lambs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
leaning	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
opposite	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
enclosure	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
knew	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
as	NULL
John	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
old	NULL
coachman	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
,	NULL
Master	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
strong	NULL
northern	NULL
accent	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
only	NULL
this	NULL
very	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
heartily	NULL
.	NULL

John	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
place	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
West	NULL
End	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
ever	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
Battersby	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
year	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL

that	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
screw	NULL

well	NULL

him	NULL

Ernest	NULL
asked	NULL
how	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL

you	NULL

said	NULL
John	NULL

LXXVII	NULL
I	NULL

the	NULL

if	NULL
you	NULL

you	NULL

n't	NULL

she	NULL

that	NULL

she	NULL

get	NULL
it	NULL
under	NULL
your	NULL
very	NULL
eyes	NULL

without	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
get	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
your	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
pawn	NULL
or	NULL
sell	NULL

she	NULL
'll	NULL

That	NULL
's	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
trouble	NULL
first	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
prison	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
happy	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
known	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
free	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
shop-lifting	NULL
and	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
loose	NULL
again	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
drink	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
seeing	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
nothing	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
a-killing	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
service	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
till	NULL
you	NULL
and	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ernest	NULL
here	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
hope	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL
neither	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
say	NULL
you	NULL
've	NULL
seen	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

We	NULL
assured	NULL
him	NULL
we	NULL
would	NULL
keep	NULL
his	NULL
counsel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
many	NULL
protestations	NULL
of	NULL
affection	NULL
towards	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
always	NULL
much	NULL
attached	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
talked	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
decided	NULL
first	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
terms	NULL
with	NULL
Ellen	NULL
concerning	NULL
their	NULL
future	NULL
custody	NULL
;	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
proposed	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
an	NULL
allowance	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
pound	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
paid	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
no	NULL
trouble	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
pound	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
eased	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
by	NULL
saying	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
pay	NULL
it	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
was	NULL
two	NULL
hours	NULL
older	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
whom	NULL
Ellen	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
indifferent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
confided	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
care	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
laundress	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
motherly	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
took	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
they	NULL
took	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
odious	NULL
task	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
unhappy	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
smote	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
notion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shock	NULL
the	NULL
break-up	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
people	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
claim	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
inestimable	NULL
service	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
rendered	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
irreparable	NULL
mischief	NULL
done	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
by	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
however	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
clear	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
scruples	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
offer	NULL
serious	NULL
resistance	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
of	NULL
another	NULL
interview	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ottery	NULL
to	NULL
manage	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
need	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
harrowed	NULL
ourselves	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
agony	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
which	NULL
Ellen	NULL
would	NULL
suffer	NULL
on	NULL
becoming	NULL
an	NULL
outcast	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
saw	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Richards	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
neighbour	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
called	NULL
him	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
first	NULL
discovered	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
drunkenness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
got	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
some	NULL
details	NULL
of	NULL
Ellen	NULL
's	NULL
opinions	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
conscience-stricken	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Thank	NULL
goodness	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
although	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
valid	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
evidently	NULL
regarded	NULL
this	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
detail	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
worth	NULL
anybody	NULL
's	NULL
while	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
more	NULL
particularly	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
regards	NULL
his	NULL
breaking	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
job	NULL
both	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
This	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
continued	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL

Ernest	NULL
is	NULL
too	NULL

wants	NULL

woman	NULL

a	NULL
bit	NULL
better	NULL

me	NULL

I	NULL
want	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
that	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
worse	NULL
than	NULL
him	NULL

We	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
lived	NULL
together	NULL

I	NULL

about	NULL

Besides	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
too	NULL
steady	NULL
:	NULL
his	NULL
being	NULL
in	NULL
prison	NULL
has	NULL
n't	NULL
done	NULL

it	NULL

I	NULL

What	NULL

not	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL
thought	NULL

the	NULL

concluded	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
am	NULL

"	NULL

I	NULL
may	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
say	NULL
here	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
need	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
further	NULL
about	NULL
Ellen	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
she	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
regularly	NULL
at	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ottery	NULL
's	NULL
every	NULL
Monday	NULL
morning	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
pound	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
neatly	NULL
dressed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
so	NULL
quiet	NULL
and	NULL
pretty	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
suspected	NULL
her	NULL
antecedents	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
sometimes	NULL
to	NULL
anticipate	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
after	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
ineffectual	NULL
attempts	NULL
--	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
occasions	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
pitiful	NULL
story	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
money	NULL
regularly	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
black	NULL
eye	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
had	NULL
throwed	NULL
a	NULL
stone	NULL
and	NULL
hit	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
mistake	NULL
"	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
pretty	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
explained	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
married	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Ottery	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
very	NULL
likely	NULL
be	NULL
again	NULL
committing	NULL
bigamy	NULL
by	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
may	NULL
call	NULL
it	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL
like	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
replied	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
going	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
America	NULL
with	NULL
Bill	NULL
the	NULL
butcher	NULL

man	NULL

and	NULL
we	NULL
hope	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
too	NULL
hard	NULL
on	NULL
us	NULL
and	NULL
stop	NULL
the	NULL
allowance	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
peace	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Bill	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
blacked	NULL
her	NULL
eye	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
little	NULL
things	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
gather	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
couple	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
Bill	NULL
she	NULL
has	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
partner	NULL
better	NULL
suited	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
than	NULL
either	NULL
John	NULL
or	NULL
Ernest	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
his	NULL
birthday	NULL
Ernest	NULL
generally	NULL
receives	NULL
an	NULL
envelope	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
American	NULL
post-mark	NULL
containing	NULL
a	NULL
book-marker	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
flaunting	NULL

it	NULL

moral	NULL
kettle-holder	NULL

or	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
similar	NULL

token	NULL

no	NULL

Of	NULL

she	NULL

taken	NULL
no	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXXVIII	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
well	NULL
turned	NULL
twenty-six	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL

in	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL

half	NULL
would	NULL

at	NULL
Blackfriars	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
crisis	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
till	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
fully	NULL
understood	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
how	NULL
nearly	NULL
his	NULL
supposed	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
habits	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
actual	NULL
want	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
indeed	NULL
noted	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
wan	NULL
worn	NULL
look	NULL
settling	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
was	NULL
either	NULL
too	NULL
indolent	NULL
or	NULL
too	NULL
hopeless	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
sustain	NULL
a	NULL
protracted	NULL
and	NULL
successful	NULL
warfare	NULL
with	NULL
Ellen	NULL
to	NULL
extend	NULL
the	NULL
sympathy	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
inquiries	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
I	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
I	NULL
hardly	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
nothing	NULL
short	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
finding	NULL
out	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
detached	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
nothing	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
him	NULL
much	NULL
good	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
all	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
things	NULL
did	NULL
turn	NULL
out	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
for	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
settle	NULL
themselves	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
whether	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
or	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
too	NULL
great	NULL
a	NULL
muddle	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
venture	NULL
to	NULL
tackle	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
Ellen	NULL
was	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
;	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
removed	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
my	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
godson	NULL
revived	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
turned	NULL
over	NULL
many	NULL
times	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
three	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
years	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
and	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
account	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
these	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
spent	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
,	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
in	NULL
gaol	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
years	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
acquiring	NULL
twofold	NULL
experience	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ways	NULL
of	NULL
business	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
marriage	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
failed	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
everything	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
undertaken	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
prisoner	NULL
;	NULL
yet	NULL
his	NULL
defeats	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
always	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
so	NULL
like	NULL
victories	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
satisfied	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
being	NULL
worth	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
pains	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
bestow	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
my	NULL
only	NULL
fear	NULL
was	NULL
lest	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
meddle	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
let	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
I	NULL
concluded	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
three	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
years	NULL
'	NULL
apprenticeship	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
rough	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
kept	NULL
him	NULL
going	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
great	NULL
need	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
thrown	NULL
him	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
resources	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
taught	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
profitable	NULL
openings	NULL
all	NULL
around	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
months	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
insuperable	NULL
difficulties	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
enlarged	NULL
his	NULL
sympathies	NULL
by	NULL
making	NULL
him	NULL
understand	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
classes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
confining	NULL
his	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
taken	NULL
by	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
only	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
books	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
second-hand	NULL
book-stalls	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
bric-a-brac	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
curiosity	NULL
shops	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
infinite	NULL
commercial	NULL
activity	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
omnipresent	NULL
around	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
understood	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
sympathised	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
kept	NULL
a	NULL
shop	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
has	NULL
often	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
travel	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
railway	NULL
that	NULL
overlooked	NULL
populous	NULL
suburbs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
street	NULL
after	NULL
street	NULL
of	NULL
dingy	NULL
houses	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
wonder	NULL
what	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
people	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
far	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
familiar	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
writer	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Odyssey	NULL
(	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suspect	NULL
strongly	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
assuredly	NULL
hit	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
nail	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
epitomised	NULL
his	NULL
typical	NULL
wise	NULL
man	NULL
as	NULL
knowing	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
ways	NULL
and	NULL
farings	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
men	NULL

"	NULL

What	NULL
culture	NULL
is	NULL
comparable	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
a	NULL
lie	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
sickly	NULL
debilitating	NULL
debauch	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
school	NULL
and	NULL
university	NULL
career	NULL
now	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
comparison	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
prison	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
tailor	NULL
in	NULL
Blackfriars	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
say	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
through	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
deeper	NULL
insight	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
spirit	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Grecian	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Surrey	NULL
pantomimes	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
confidence	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
power	NULL
to	NULL
swim	NULL
if	NULL
thrown	NULL
into	NULL
deep	NULL
waters	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
he	NULL
won	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
experiences	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
!	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
my	NULL
godson	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
seen	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
under	NULL
currents	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
of	NULL
use	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
style	NULL
more	NULL
suitable	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
prospects	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
aunt	NULL
had	NULL
wished	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
the	NULL
soil	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
kissed	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
vengeance	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
notion	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
coming	NULL
suddenly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
shop-keeper	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
income	NULL
of	NULL
between	NULL
three	NULL
and	NULL
four	NULL
thousand	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

Too	NULL
sudden	NULL
a	NULL
jump	NULL
from	NULL
bad	NULL
fortune	NULL
to	NULL
good	NULL
is	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
dangerous	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
from	NULL
good	NULL
to	NULL
bad	NULL
;	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
poverty	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
wearing	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
quasi-embryonic	NULL
condition	NULL
,	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
pass	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
his	NULL
later	NULL
developments	NULL
securely	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
like	NULL
measles	NULL
or	NULL
scarlet	NULL
fever	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL
mildly	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
early	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
man	NULL
is	NULL
safe	NULL
from	NULL
losing	NULL
every	NULL
penny	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
unless	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
facer	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
often	NULL
do	NULL
I	NULL
not	NULL
hear	NULL
middle-aged	NULL
women	NULL
and	NULL
quiet	NULL
family	NULL
men	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
speculative	NULL
tendency	NULL
;	NULL
_	NULL
they	NULL
_	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
touched	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
would	NULL
touch	NULL
,	NULL
any	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
soundest	NULL
,	NULL
best	NULL
reputed	NULL
investments	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
unlimited	NULL
liability	NULL
,	NULL
oh	NULL
dear	NULL
!	NULL

dear	NULL
!	NULL

and	NULL
they	NULL
throw	NULL
up	NULL
their	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Whenever	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
is	NULL
heard	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
thus	NULL
he	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
recognised	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
easy	NULL
prey	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
adventurer	NULL
who	NULL
comes	NULL
across	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
commonly	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
wind	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
discourse	NULL
by	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
natural	NULL
caution	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
well	NULL
knowing	NULL
how	NULL
foolish	NULL
speculation	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
some	NULL
investments	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
called	NULL
speculative	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
reality	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
pull	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
the	NULL
prospectus	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Cornish	NULL
gold	NULL
mine	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
on	NULL
having	NULL
actually	NULL
lost	NULL
money	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
realises	NULL
what	NULL
an	NULL
awful	NULL
thing	NULL
the	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finds	NULL
out	NULL
how	NULL
easily	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
lost	NULL
by	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
venture	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
beaten	NULL
path	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
facer	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
attack	NULL
of	NULL
poverty	NULL
,	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
badly	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
sensible	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
little	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
forget	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
can	NULL
fancy	NULL
few	NULL
pieces	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
fortune	NULL
greater	NULL
than	NULL
this	NULL
as	NULL
happening	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
provided	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
damaged	NULL
irretrievably	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
strongly	NULL
do	NULL
I	NULL
feel	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
subject	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
my	NULL
way	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
speculation	NULL
master	NULL
attached	NULL
to	NULL
every	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boys	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
encouraged	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
Money	NULL
Market	NULL
Review	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
Railway	NULL
News	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
financial	NULL
papers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
should	NULL
establish	NULL
a	NULL
stock	NULL
exchange	NULL
amongst	NULL
themselves	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
pence	NULL
should	NULL
stand	NULL
as	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
let	NULL
them	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
this	NULL
making	NULL
haste	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
rich	NULL
moneys	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
actual	NULL
practice	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
prize	NULL
awarded	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
head-master	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
prudent	NULL
dealer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
who	NULL
lost	NULL
their	NULL
money	NULL
time	NULL
after	NULL
time	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
dismissed	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
if	NULL
any	NULL
boy	NULL
proved	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
genius	NULL
for	NULL
speculation	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
money	NULL
--	NULL
well	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
speculate	NULL
by	NULL
all	NULL
means	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Universities	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
teachers	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
professorships	NULL
of	NULL
speculation	NULL
established	NULL
at	NULL
Oxford	NULL
and	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
reflect	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
things	NULL
worth	NULL
doing	NULL
which	NULL
Oxford	NULL
and	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
well	NULL
are	NULL
cooking	NULL
,	NULL
cricket	NULL
,	NULL
rowing	NULL
and	NULL
games	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
professorship	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
fear	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
establishment	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
professorial	NULL
chair	NULL
would	NULL
end	NULL
in	NULL
teaching	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
neither	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
speculate	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
how	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
speculate	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
would	NULL
simply	NULL
turn	NULL
them	NULL
out	NULL
as	NULL
bad	NULL
speculators	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
case	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
father	NULL
actually	NULL
carried	NULL
my	NULL
idea	NULL
into	NULL
practice	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
how	NULL
little	NULL
confidence	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
placed	NULL
in	NULL
glowing	NULL
prospectuses	NULL
and	NULL
flaming	NULL
articles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
five	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
invest	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
lights	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
father	NULL
expected	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
lose	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
turn	NULL
out	NULL
so	NULL
in	NULL
practice	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
took	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
pains	NULL
and	NULL
played	NULL
so	NULL
cautiously	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
kept	NULL
growing	NULL
and	NULL
growing	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
father	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
away	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
increment	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
pleased	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
self	NULL
defence	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
mistakes	NULL
with	NULL
money	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
1846	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
everyone	NULL
else	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
years	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
scared	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
so	NULL
severely	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
(	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
advice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
broker	NULL

kept	NULL

Midland	NULL
stock	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
August	NULL
1850	NULL

when	NULL
I	NULL
sold	NULL

at	NULL
32	NULL

the	NULL

Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
15,000	NULL

at	NULL
this	NULL
price	NULL

did	NULL

change	NULL
the	NULL

till	NULL
a	NULL

which	NULL
I	NULL

been	NULL
writing	NULL
lately	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
until	NULL
September	NULL
1861	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
then	NULL
sold	NULL
at	NULL
129	NULL
pounds	NULL
per	NULL
share	NULL
and	NULL
invested	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
and	NULL
North-Western	NULL
ordinary	NULL
stock	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
advised	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
rise	NULL
than	NULL
Midlands	NULL
now	NULL
were	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
bought	NULL
the	NULL
London	NULL
and	NULL
North-Western	NULL
stock	NULL
at	NULL
93	NULL
pounds	NULL
per	NULL
100	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
my	NULL
godson	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
1882	NULL
still	NULL
holds	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
original	NULL
15,000	NULL
pounds	NULL
had	NULL
increased	NULL
in	NULL
eleven	NULL
years	NULL
to	NULL
over	NULL
60,000	NULL
pounds	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
accumulated	NULL
interest	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
re-invested	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
about	NULL
10,000	NULL
pounds	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
worth	NULL
over	NULL
70,000	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
present	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
worth	NULL
nearly	NULL
double	NULL
that	NULL
sum	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
leaving	NULL
well	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

Large	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
property	NULL
now	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
increased	NULL
still	NULL
further	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
that	NULL
remained	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
minority	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
on	NULL
coming	NULL
of	NULL
age	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
income	NULL
of	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
3500	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wished	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
book-keeping	NULL
by	NULL
double	NULL
entry	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
myself	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
been	NULL
compelled	NULL
to	NULL
master	NULL
this	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
difficult	NULL
art	NULL
;	NULL
having	NULL
acquired	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
become	NULL
enamoured	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
consider	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
necessary	NULL
branch	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
education	NULL
after	NULL
reading	NULL
and	NULL
writing	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
should	NULL
master	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
proposed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
become	NULL
my	NULL
steward	NULL
,	NULL
book-keeper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
manager	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
hoardings	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
sum	NULL
which	NULL
my	NULL
ledger	NULL
showed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
accumulated	NULL
from	NULL
15,000	NULL
to	NULL
70,000	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
the	NULL
income	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
amounted	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
80,000	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
after	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
discovery	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
a	NULL
bachelor	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
honeymoon	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
renewed	NULL
unmarried	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
broached	NULL
my	NULL
scheme	NULL
,	NULL
desired	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
shop	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
offered	NULL
him	NULL
300	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
for	NULL
managing	NULL
(	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
indeed	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
required	NULL
any	NULL
managing	NULL
)	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
property	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
300	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
need	NULL
hardly	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
charge	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
estate	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
anything	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
wanting	NULL
to	NULL
complete	NULL
his	NULL
happiness	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
,	NULL
within	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
days	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
freed	NULL
from	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
hideous	NULL
,	NULL
hopeless	NULL
_	NULL
liaisons	NULL
_	NULL
imaginable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
raised	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
almost	NULL
squalor	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
handsome	NULL
income	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
A	NULL
pound	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL

"	NULL
for	NULL
Ellen	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
for	NULL
myself	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

I	NULL

"	NULL
we	NULL

You	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
clear	NULL
300	NULL
pounds	NULL
for	NULL
yourself	NULL

"	NULL

I	NULL
fixed	NULL
upon	NULL
this	NULL
sum	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
Mr	NULL
Disraeli	NULL
gave	NULL
Coningsby	NULL
when	NULL
Coningsby	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
lowest	NULL
ebb	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fortunes	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Disraeli	NULL
evidently	NULL
thought	NULL
300	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
the	NULL
smallest	NULL
sum	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
Coningsby	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL

live	NULL

and	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
ends	NULL
meet	NULL

with	NULL
this	NULL

however	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
his	NULL
hero	NULL
could	NULL
manage	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
along	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL

In	NULL
1862	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
now	NULL
writing	NULL

prices	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL

though	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
since	NULL
done	NULL
;	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
less	NULL
expensive	NULL
antecedents	NULL
than	NULL
Coningsby	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
300	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
thing	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXXIX	NULL
The	NULL
question	NULL
now	NULL
arose	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
explained	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
expenses	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
charged	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
estate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
showed	NULL
him	NULL
how	NULL
small	NULL
a	NULL
hole	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
items	NULL
I	NULL
proposed	NULL
to	NULL
charge	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
income	NULL
at	NULL
my	NULL
disposal	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
difficulties	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
quieted	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
pointing	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
reminded	NULL
him	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
an	NULL
understanding	NULL
between	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
do	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
occasion	NULL
should	NULL
arise	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
his	NULL
children	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
brought	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fresh	NULL
pure	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
among	NULL
other	NULL
children	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
happy	NULL
and	NULL
contented	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
being	NULL
still	NULL
ignorant	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fortune	NULL
that	NULL
awaited	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
insisted	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
pass	NULL
their	NULL
earlier	NULL
years	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
rich	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
remonstrated	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
decided	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
reflected	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
illegitimate	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sure	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
Ernest	NULL
proposed	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
for	NULL
everyone	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
so	NULL
young	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
matter	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
with	NULL
kindly	NULL
decent	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
healthy	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
unkind	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
as	NULL
my	NULL
grandfather	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
my	NULL
father	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
succeed	NULL
in	NULL
making	NULL
their	NULL
children	NULL
love	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
neither	NULL
shall	NULL
I.	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
myself	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
so	NULL
did	NULL
they	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
can	NULL
make	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
shall	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
hated	NULL
me	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
all	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
ruin	NULL
their	NULL
prospects	NULL
,	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
reasonable	NULL
time	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
old	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
mused	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
and	NULL
added	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
laugh	NULL
:	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
A	NULL
man	NULL
first	NULL
quarrels	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
about	NULL
three-quarters	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
born	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
insists	NULL
on	NULL
setting	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
separate	NULL
establishment	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
this	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
once	NULL
agreed	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
complete	NULL
the	NULL
separation	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
for	NULL
both	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
more	NULL
seriously	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
well	NULL
and	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
betrayed	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
misery	NULL
of	NULL
false	NULL
expectations	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
Sunday	NULL
walks	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
seen	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
waterside	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
miles	NULL
below	NULL
Gravesend	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
fast	NULL
coming	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
thrive	NULL
;	NULL
both	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
indeed	NULL
were	NULL
comfortable	NULL
well	NULL
grown	NULL
folks	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
whose	NULL
hands	NULL
young	NULL
people	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
as	NULL
fair	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
development	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
this	NULL
couple	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
no	NULL
less	NULL
well	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
than	NULL
Ernest	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
offered	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
pound	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
and	NULL
bring	NULL
them	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
jumped	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
offer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
we	NULL
brought	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
by	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Ernest	NULL
sent	NULL
his	NULL
small	NULL
stock	NULL
of	NULL
goods	NULL
to	NULL
Debenham	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
two	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
years	NULL
previously	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
civilisation	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
now	NULL
rapidly	NULL
recover	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
disappointed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
get	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
decidedly	NULL
worse	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
long	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
him	NULL
looking	NULL
so	NULL
ill	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
going	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
consult	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
eminent	NULL
doctors	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
gentleman	NULL
said	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
acute	NULL
disease	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
young	NULL
friend	NULL
was	NULL
suffering	NULL
from	NULL
nervous	NULL
prostration	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
severe	NULL
mental	NULL
suffering	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
remedy	NULL
except	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
prosperity	NULL
and	NULL
rest	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
broken	NULL
down	NULL
later	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
on	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
months	NULL
yet	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
suddenness	NULL

Had	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
been	NULL
less	NULL
eminent	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
profession	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
doubted	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
earnest	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
business	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
neither	NULL
waste	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL

that	NULL

his	NULL
patients	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
we	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
cab	NULL
to	NULL
Regent	NULL

spent	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
hours	NULL
in	NULL
sauntering	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
different	NULL
houses	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
certainly	NULL
became	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
experienced	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
mean	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
receiving	NULL
an	NULL

new	NULL
life	NULL

deriving	NULL
new	NULL
ways	NULL

life	NULL

which	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
thing	NULL
--	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
process	NULL

I	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
quite	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
estimate	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
larger	NULL
mammals	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
ones	NULL
which	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
were	NULL
most	NULL
beneficial	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
observed	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
lingered	NULL
instinctively	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
elephants	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
elephant	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
drinking	NULL
in	NULL
large	NULL
draughts	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
lives	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
re-creation	NULL
and	NULL
regeneration	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL

We	NULL
dined	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
gardens	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
noticed	NULL
with	NULL
pleasure	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
appetite	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
improved	NULL

Since	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL

whenever	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
out	NULL

at	NULL
once	NULL
gone	NULL
up	NULL

have	NULL
invariably	NULL
been	NULL
benefited	NULL

I	NULL
mention	NULL
this	NULL
here	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
readers	NULL
may	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
hint	NULL
a	NULL
useful	NULL
one	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fortnight	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL

more	NULL
so	NULL
even	NULL
than	NULL
our	NULL
friend	NULL

doctor	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL

It	NULL

trudging	NULL
about	NULL
with	NULL
luggage	NULL

were	NULL

both	NULL

fast	NULL
asleep	NULL

we	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL

sleep	NULL

soon	NULL

we	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
railway	NULL

dozed	NULL

passed	NULL

waking	NULL

the	NULL

were	NULL
beginning	NULL

show	NULL

was	NULL
already	NULL
devouring	NULL
every	NULL
object	NULL
we	NULL
passed	NULL
with	NULL
quick	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

passed	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
railway	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
drinking	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
too	NULL
deep	NULL

The	NULL

engine	NULL
that	NULL
drew	NULL
us	NULL
was	NULL

We	NULL
reached	NULL

six	NULL

had	NULL
just	NULL
time	NULL

get	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL

take	NULL
a	NULL
morning	NULL

before	NULL

my	NULL

himself	NULL

were	NULL

intermitted	NULL
for	NULL
more	NULL

an	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
together	NULL

He	NULL
fought	NULL
against	NULL
this	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
consoled	NULL
himself	NULL
by	NULL
saying	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL

nice	NULL

himself	NULL

that	NULL
in	NULL

weary	NULL
the	NULL

him	NULL

many	NULL

then	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
passed	NULL
between	NULL
Rome	NULL

Naples	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

many	NULL
months	NULL

he	NULL

completely	NULL
lost	NULL
all	NULL
sense	NULL

wounds	NULL

the	NULL
last	NULL
four	NULL

had	NULL
inflicted	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL

as	NULL
though	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
scar	NULL

a	NULL

One	NULL

upon	NULL
him	NULL

to	NULL
England	NULL

I	NULL
mean	NULL
the	NULL
sting	NULL

nothing	NULL

the	NULL

from	NULL

saved	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

came	NULL

him	NULL

thought	NULL

in	NULL

Besides	NULL

set	NULL

Some	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL

on	NULL
learning	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
supposed	NULL

was	NULL
now	NULL
comfortably	NULL
off	NULL
again	NULL

wanted	NULL
to	NULL
renew	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
grateful	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL

sometimes	NULL
tried	NULL

meet	NULL
their	NULL
advances	NULL
half	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL

and	NULL
ere	NULL
long	NULL
he	NULL
shrank	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
pretending	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
infernal	NULL
demon	NULL
of	NULL
honesty	NULL
haunted	NULL
him	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
These	NULL
men	NULL
know	NULL

_	NULL
sans	NULL
peur	NULL

sans	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL

they	NULL
had	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
people	NULL

under	NULL
false	NULL

so	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
up	NULL
even	NULL
hankering	NULL
after	NULL
rehabilitation	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
back	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
tastes	NULL
for	NULL
music	NULL
and	NULL
literature	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
long	NULL
since	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
how	NULL
silly	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
silly	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
in	NULL
theory	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
in	NULL
practice	NULL
it	NULL
worked	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
keeping	NULL
him	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
_	NULL
liaisons	NULL
_	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
tied	NULL
his	NULL
tongue	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
see	NULL

elsewhere	NULL

where	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
instinctively	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
reason	NULL
than	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
most	NULL
natural	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
wrong	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
said	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
once	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL

told	NULL
him	NULL

had	NULL
always	NULL
aimed	NULL
high	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL

replied	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
indignantly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL

had	NULL

no	NULL

mind	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

to	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
mildly	NULL

abnormal	NULL

ever	NULL

aimed	NULL
very	NULL
high	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
pure	NULL
malice	NULL
aforethought	NULL

I	NULL
once	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
fly	NULL
alight	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
hot	NULL
coffee	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
milk	NULL
had	NULL
formed	NULL
a	NULL
thin	NULL
skin	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
perceived	NULL
his	NULL
extreme	NULL
danger	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
noted	NULL
with	NULL
what	NULL
ample	NULL
strides	NULL
and	NULL
almost	NULL
supermuscan	NULL
effort	NULL
he	NULL
struck	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
treacherous	NULL
surface	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cup	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
solid	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
raise	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
wings	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
watched	NULL
him	NULL
I	NULL
fancied	NULL
that	NULL
so	NULL
supreme	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
difficulty	NULL
and	NULL
danger	NULL
might	NULL
leave	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
increase	NULL
of	NULL
moral	NULL
and	NULL
physical	NULL
power	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
even	NULL
descend	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
measure	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
offspring	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
surely	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
increased	NULL
moral	NULL
power	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
helped	NULL
it	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
knowingly	NULL
alight	NULL
upon	NULL
another	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
hot	NULL
coffee	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
more	NULL
I	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
sure	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL

why	NULL

the	NULL
right	NULL

so	NULL
long	NULL
only	NULL
as	NULL

do	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
why	NULL
they	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
result	NULL
depends	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
done	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
motive	NULL
goes	NULL
for	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
read	NULL
somewhere	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
remember	NULL
where	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
country	NULL
district	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
scarcity	NULL
of	NULL
food	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
suffered	NULL
acutely	NULL
;	NULL
many	NULL
indeed	NULL
actually	NULL
died	NULL
of	NULL
starvation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
were	NULL
hard	NULL
put	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
one	NULL
village	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
widow	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
of	NULL
young	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
small	NULL
visible	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
subsistence	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
looked	NULL
well-fed	NULL
and	NULL
comfortable	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
also	NULL
did	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
ones	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
everyone	NULL
asked	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
did	NULL
they	NULL
manage	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
plain	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
secret	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
equally	NULL
plain	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
one	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
hurried	NULL
,	NULL
hunted	NULL
look	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
if	NULL
anyone	NULL
alluded	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
hers	NULL
throve	NULL
when	NULL
others	NULL
starved	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
moreover	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
sometimes	NULL
seen	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
unusual	NULL
hours	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
evidently	NULL
brought	NULL
things	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
honestly	NULL
come	NULL
by	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
knew	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
under	NULL
suspicion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
hitherto	NULL
of	NULL
excellent	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
them	NULL
very	NULL
unhappy	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
confessed	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
believed	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
uncanny	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
absolutely	NULL
wicked	NULL
;	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
they	NULL
throve	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
kept	NULL
their	NULL
strength	NULL
when	NULL
all	NULL
their	NULL
neighbours	NULL
were	NULL
pinched	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
length	NULL
matters	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
clergyman	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
parish	NULL
cross	NULL
-	NULL
questioned	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
woman	NULL
so	NULL
closely	NULL
that	NULL
with	NULL
many	NULL
tears	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
bitter	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
degradation	NULL
she	NULL
confessed	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
children	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
hedges	NULL
and	NULL
gathered	NULL
snails	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
made	NULL
into	NULL
broth	NULL
and	NULL
ate	NULL
--	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
ever	NULL
be	NULL
forgiven	NULL
?	NULL

Was	NULL
there	NULL
any	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
salvation	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
either	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
after	NULL
such	NULL
unnatural	NULL
conduct	NULL
?	NULL

So	NULL
again	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
dowager	NULL
countess	NULL
whose	NULL
money	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
Consols	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
many	NULL
sons	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
anxiety	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
younger	NULL
ones	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
start	NULL
,	NULL
wanted	NULL
a	NULL
larger	NULL
income	NULL
than	NULL
Consols	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
consulted	NULL
her	NULL
solicitor	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
advised	NULL
to	NULL
sell	NULL
her	NULL
Consols	NULL
and	NULL
invest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
London	NULL
and	NULL
North-Western	NULL
Railway	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
at	NULL
about	NULL
85	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
what	NULL
eating	NULL
snails	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
widow	NULL
whose	NULL
story	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
told	NULL
above	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
shame	NULL
and	NULL
grief	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
doing	NULL
an	NULL
unclean	NULL
thing	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
boys	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
their	NULL
start	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
advised	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
sleep	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
haunted	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
presage	NULL
of	NULL
disaster	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
what	NULL
happened	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
started	NULL
her	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
years	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
capital	NULL
doubled	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bargain	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
sold	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
Consols	NULL
and	NULL
died	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL
blessedness	NULL
of	NULL
fund-holding	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
a	NULL
wrong	NULL
and	NULL
dangerous	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
had	NULL
absolutely	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Suppose	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
invested	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL
confidence	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
recommendation	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
eminent	NULL
London	NULL
banker	NULL
whose	NULL
advice	NULL
was	NULL
bad	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
suppose	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
this	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
conviction	NULL
of	NULL
sin	NULL
--	NULL
would	NULL
her	NULL
innocence	NULL
of	NULL
evil	NULL
purpose	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
excellence	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
motive	NULL
have	NULL
stood	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
stead	NULL
?	NULL

Not	NULL
they	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
story	NULL
.	NULL

Towneley	NULL
gave	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL
most	NULL
trouble	NULL
.	NULL

Towneley	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
money	NULL
soon	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Ernest	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Towneley	NULL
was	NULL
rich	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
married	NULL
now	NULL
;	NULL
Ernest	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
rich	NULL
soon	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
_	NULL
bona	NULL
fide	NULL
_	NULL
intended	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
married	NULL
already	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
doubtless	NULL
marry	NULL
a	NULL
lawful	NULL
wife	NULL
later	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
taking	NULL
pains	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Towneley	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
met	NULL
Ernest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
Towneley	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
quick	NULL
good	NULL
nature	NULL
read	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
,	NULL
caught	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
morally	NULL
speaking	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
scruff	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
him	NULL
laughingly	NULL
inside	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
telling	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
such	NULL
nonsense	NULL
.	NULL

Towneley	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
idol	NULL
now	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
easily	NULL
touched	NULL
,	NULL
felt	NULL
more	NULL
gratefully	NULL
and	NULL
warmly	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
unconscious	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
stronger	NULL
than	NULL
Towneley	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL
determine	NULL
to	NULL
break	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
determinedly	NULL
perhaps	NULL
than	NULL
with	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
living	NULL
person	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
thanked	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
hurried	NULL
voice	NULL
and	NULL
pressed	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
tears	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
efforts	NULL
to	NULL
repress	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
we	NULL
meet	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
hereafter	NULL
you	NULL
hear	NULL
of	NULL

writing	NULL
things	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL

me	NULL

as	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
they	NULL
parted	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Towneley	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
fellow	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
gravely	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
cut	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Towneley	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
without	NULL

very	NULL
best	NULL
man	NULL
I	NULL
ever	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
life	NULL
--	NULL
except	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
paid	NULL
me	NULL
the	NULL
compliment	NULL
of	NULL
saying	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
yourself	NULL
;	NULL
Towneley	NULL
is	NULL
my	NULL
notion	NULL
of	NULL
everything	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
most	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
real	NULL
solidarity	NULL
between	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
perpetual	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
losing	NULL
his	NULL
good	NULL
opinion	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
things	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
continued	NULL
more	NULL
merrily	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
which	NULL
Towneley	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

A	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
already	NULL
,	NULL
can	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
for	NULL
Christ	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
tolerably	NULL
easily	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
part	NULL

but	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
people	NULL
like	NULL
Towneley	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXXXI	NULL
So	NULL
he	NULL
fell	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
all	NULL
old	NULL
friends	NULL
except	NULL
myself	NULL
and	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
old	NULL
intimates	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
sure	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
like	NULL
myself	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
getting	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
fresh	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
attended	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
keeping	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
account	NULL
books	NULL
whenever	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
anything	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
possibly	NULL
be	NULL
attended	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
seldom	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
spent	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
adding	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
many	NULL
notes	NULL
and	NULL
tentative	NULL
essays	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
accumulated	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
portfolios	NULL
.	NULL

Anyone	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
writing	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
that	NULL
literature	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
natural	NULL
development	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
pleased	NULL
at	NULL
seeing	NULL
him	NULL
settle	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
spontaneously	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
pleased	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
observe	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
still	NULL
occupy	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
none	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
serious	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
almost	NULL
said	NULL
solemn	NULL
,	NULL
subjects	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
cared	NULL
about	NULL
any	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
serious	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
music	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
slender	NULL
reward	NULL
which	NULL
God	NULL
had	NULL
attached	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
pursuit	NULL
of	NULL
serious	NULL
inquiry	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sufficient	NULL
proof	NULL
that	NULL
He	NULL
disapproved	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
that	NULL
He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
set	NULL
much	NULL
store	NULL
by	NULL
it	NULL
nor	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
encourage	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
rewards	NULL
.	NULL

Look	NULL
at	NULL
Milton	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
only	NULL
got	NULL
5	NULL
pounds	NULL
for	NULL
'	NULL
Paradise	NULL
Lost	NULL
.	NULL
'	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
rejoined	NULL
promptly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
twice	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
myself	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
written	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
shocked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
laughingly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
write	NULL
poetry	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
cut	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
my	NULL
burlesques	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
written	NULL
in	NULL
rhyme	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
I	NULL
dropped	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
to	NULL
reopen	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
getting	NULL
300	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
for	NULL
doing	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
absolutely	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
some	NULL
employment	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
bring	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
upon	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
but	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
very	NULL
hard	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
need	NULL
hardly	NULL
say	NULL
was	NULL
unsuccessful	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
older	NULL
I	NULL
grow	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
convinced	NULL
I	NULL
become	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
folly	NULL
and	NULL
credulity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
harder	NULL
do	NULL
I	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
impose	NULL
oneself	NULL
upon	NULL
that	NULL
folly	NULL
and	NULL
credulity	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
editor	NULL
after	NULL
editor	NULL
with	NULL
article	NULL
after	NULL
article	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
an	NULL
editor	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
his	NULL
articles	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
almost	NULL
invariably	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
them	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
polite	NULL
note	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
suited	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
particular	NULL
paper	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
very	NULL
articles	NULL
appeared	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
later	NULL
works	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
deny	NULL
the	NULL
soundness	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL

and	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
dependent	NULL

the	NULL
300	NULL

a	NULL
year	NULL

should	NULL

advised	NULL
him	NULL

As	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL

I	NULL
temporised	NULL

raised	NULL

quieted	NULL
him	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
Mr	NULL

's	NULL
instinct	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL

telling	NULL

begin	NULL

very	NULL

stage	NULL

as	NULL
I	NULL

would	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
fixed	NULL
upon	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
drew	NULL
nearer	NULL
I	NULL
prepared	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL

and	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL

on	NULL
his	NULL
twenty-eighth	NULL
birthday	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL

to	NULL
show	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
signed	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
death-bed	NULL

the	NULL
effect	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL

hold	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
in	NULL

him	NULL

His	NULL
birthday	NULL
happened	NULL
that	NULL
year	NULL
(	NULL
1863	NULL

to	NULL
be	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
Sunday	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL

I	NULL
transferred	NULL
his	NULL
shares	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL

presented	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
account	NULL

had	NULL
been	NULL
keeping	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL
half	NULL

In	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
to	NULL
prepare	NULL
him	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL

could	NULL
get	NULL
him	NULL

at	NULL
finding	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
speak	NULL

was	NULL

It	NULL

pill	NULL
to	NULL
Theobald	NULL

if	NULL
the	NULL

I	NULL

made	NULL
one	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL

them	NULL

Ernest	NULL

it	NULL
would	NULL

I	NULL
wrote	NULL

Theobald	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL

Of	NULL

no	NULL

Ernest	NULL

He	NULL

I	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
before	NULL

pleased	NULL

how	NULL

he	NULL

at	NULL
two	NULL

His	NULL

a	NULL

The	NULL
journey	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
painful	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
drew	NULL
near	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
and	NULL
caught	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
familiar	NULL
feature	NULL

so	NULL
strong	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
association	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL

his	NULL
coming	NULL

as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
vacations	NULL

Do	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
dull	NULL
weight	NULL
of	NULL
_	NULL
home-sickness	NULL
_	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
oppress	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
fast	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
approaching	NULL

mother	NULL

"	NULL

Would	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
meet	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL

station	NULL

Would	NULL
he	NULL
greet	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
nothing	NULL

or	NULL
would	NULL
he	NULL

How	NULL

again	NULL

would	NULL
he	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL

's	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
drew	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
platform	NULL
,	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
eye	NULL
ran	NULL
hurriedly	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
well-known	NULL
form	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
palings	NULL
which	NULL
divided	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
yard	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
platform	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
pony	NULL
carriage	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
shabby	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
recognised	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
coachman	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
more	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
driving	NULL
towards	NULL
Battersby	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
smiling	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
coachman	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
surprise	NULL
at	NULL
finding	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
changed	NULL
in	NULL
personal	NULL
appearance	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
coachman	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
surprised	NULL
because	NULL
when	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
last	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
dressed	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
layman	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
layman	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
regardless	NULL
of	NULL
expense	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
change	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
great	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
till	NULL
Ernest	NULL
actually	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
coachman	NULL
knew	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
are	NULL
my	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
hurriedly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
Master	NULL
's	NULL

the	NULL
answer	NULL

but	NULL
the	NULL
Missis	NULL

very	NULL
sadly	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
horse	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
pulled	NULL
hard	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
reins	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
weather	NULL
was	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
raw	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
ideal	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
November	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
the	NULL
floods	NULL
were	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
near	NULL
here	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
horsemen	NULL
and	NULL
dogs	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
hounds	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
near	NULL
Battersby	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
saw	NULL
several	NULL
people	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
either	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
is	NULL
most	NULL
likely	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
recognise	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
good	NULL
luck	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Battersby	NULL
church	NULL
tower	NULL
drew	NULL
near	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
Rectory	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
chimneys	NULL
just	NULL
showing	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
leafless	NULL
trees	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
surrounded	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
threw	NULL
himself	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
and	NULL
covered	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
quarters	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
more	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
steps	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
hearing	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
arrive	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
way	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
steps	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Like	NULL
the	NULL
coachman	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
appointed	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
money	NULL
were	NULL
abundant	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
robust	NULL
and	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
health	NULL
and	NULL
vigour	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bargained	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
Ernest	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
respectable	NULL
,	NULL
well-regulated	NULL
prodigal	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL

from	NULL
the	NULL
tenderest	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
long-suffering	NULL
father	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
world	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
shoes	NULL
and	NULL
stockings	NULL
and	NULL
whole	NULL
clothes	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
only	NULL
because	NULL
absolute	NULL
rags	NULL
and	NULL
tatters	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
graciously	NULL
dispensed	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
whereas	NULL
here	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
swaggering	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
grey	NULL
ulster	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
blue	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
necktie	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looking	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
unprincipled	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
generous	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
to	NULL
provide	NULL
Ernest	NULL
with	NULL
decent	NULL
clothes	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
visit	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
death-bed	NULL
?	NULL

Could	NULL
any	NULL
advantage	NULL
be	NULL
meaner	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
?	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
a	NULL
penny	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
eight	NULL
or	NULL
nine	NULL
pounds	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
promised	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
fortunate	NULL

had	NULL
given	NULL
a	NULL
limit	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
Theobald	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
afford	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
portmanteau	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
using	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
portmanteau	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
saw	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
passing	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
prepared	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
way	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
now	NULL
saw	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
his	NULL
telegram	NULL
so	NULL
immediately	NULL
on	NULL
receiving	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
letter	NULL

and	NULL
had	NULL
followed	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
promptly	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
laughingly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL

He	NULL
stammered	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL

looked	NULL
sheepish	NULL

he	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

Ernest	NULL

said	NULL
Theobald	NULL
excitedly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL

This	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
true	NULL
Theobald	NULL
ring	NULL
and	NULL
instantly	NULL
brought	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
train	NULL
of	NULL
ideas	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
were	NULL
connected	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
surroundings	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
familiar	NULL
ones	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
surrounded	NULL
were	NULL
changed	NULL
almost	NULL
beyond	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
recognition	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
sharply	NULL
on	NULL
Theobald	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
repeat	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
consider	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
strike	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
readers	NULL
as	NULL
disrespectful	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
effectual	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
turned	NULL
almost	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
ashen	NULL
colour	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
again	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
repeat	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
occasion	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
quickly	NULL
recovered	NULL
his	NULL
temper	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
asked	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
this	NULL
opening	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
replied	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tone	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
assumed	NULL
towards	NULL
one	NULL
he	NULL
most	NULL
particularly	NULL
desired	NULL
to	NULL
conciliate	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
rapidly	NULL
worse	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
concluded	NULL
by	NULL
saying	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
comfort	NULL
and	NULL
mainstay	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
for	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
thirty	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
wish	NULL
it	NULL
prolonged	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pair	NULL
then	NULL
went	NULL
upstairs	NULL
to	NULL
Christina	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
born	NULL

His	NULL
father	NULL
went	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
prepared	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
son	NULL
's	NULL
approach	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
poor	NULL
woman	NULL
raised	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
weeping	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
flung	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
around	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
cried	NULL
:	NULL

Ernest	NULL
broke	NULL
down	NULL

wept	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL

for	NULL
years	NULL

"	NULL

she	NULL

you	NULL

quietly	NULL
out	NULL

the	NULL

I	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXXXIII	NULL
Joey	NULL
and	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Joey	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
ordained	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
curate	NULL
to	NULL
Theobald	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
sympathetic	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
saw	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
_	NULL
rapprochement	NULL
_	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
startled	NULL
at	NULL
seeing	NULL
Joey	NULL
dressed	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looking	NULL
so	NULL
like	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
years	NULL
earlier	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
family	NULL
likeness	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Joey	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
illumined	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
spark	NULL
of	NULL
Bohemianism	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
as	NULL
other	NULL
clergymen	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
neither	NULL
better	NULL
nor	NULL
worse	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
greeted	NULL
Ernest	NULL
rather	NULL
_	NULL
de	NULL
haut	NULL
en	NULL
bas	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
by	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
tailed	NULL
off	NULL
unsatisfactorily	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
sister	NULL
presented	NULL
her	NULL
cheek	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
kissed	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
dreading	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
three	NULL
hours	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
distant	NULL
and	NULL
reproachful	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
superior	NULL
person	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
grievance	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
inasmuch	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
unmarried	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
laid	NULL
the	NULL
blame	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
at	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
door	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
misconduct	NULL
she	NULL
maintained	NULL
in	NULL
secret	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
prevented	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
from	NULL
making	NULL
offers	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
ran	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
bill	NULL
for	NULL
consequential	NULL
damages	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
and	NULL
Joey	NULL
had	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
developed	NULL
an	NULL
instinct	NULL
for	NULL
hunting	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
hounds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
had	NULL
fairly	NULL
identified	NULL
themselves	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
older	NULL
generation	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
as	NULL
against	NULL
Ernest	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
this	NULL
head	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
offensive	NULL
and	NULL
defensive	NULL
alliance	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
between	NULL
themselves	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
subdued	NULL
but	NULL
internecine	NULL
warfare	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
Ernest	NULL
gathered	NULL
,	NULL
partly	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
recollections	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
parties	NULL
concerned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
partly	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
observation	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
little	NULL
ways	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
half-hour	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
arrival	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
bedroom	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
eyed	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
time	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
surprise	NULL
not	NULL
unmixed	NULL
with	NULL
indignation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
knew	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
thinking	NULL
.	NULL

Christina	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
firmer	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
vigorous	NULL
both	NULL
in	NULL
mind	NULL
and	NULL
body	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
than	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
last	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
too	NULL
how	NULL
well	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dressed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
return	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
affection	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
first-born	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
alarmed	NULL
about	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
pocket	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
supposed	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
mulcted	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
magnificence	NULL
.	NULL

Perceiving	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
Ernest	NULL
relieved	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
's	NULL
bequest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
husbanded	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
brother	NULL
and	NULL
sister	NULL
--	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
pretended	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
notice	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
to	NULL
notice	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
an	NULL
interest	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
mother	NULL
kicked	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
's	NULL
having	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
"	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
papa	NULL
's	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
deprecating	NULL
tone	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
your	NULL
papa	NULL
has	NULL
had	NULL
"	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Ernest	NULL
calmed	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
suggesting	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
Miss	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
how	NULL
large	NULL
the	NULL
sum	NULL
would	NULL
become	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Theobald	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
compromise	NULL
was	NULL
accepted	NULL
by	NULL
Christina	NULL
who	NULL
forthwith	NULL
,	NULL
ill	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
entered	NULL
with	NULL
ardour	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
taking	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
fresh	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
departure	NULL
,	NULL
began	NULL
spending	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
money	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
may	NULL
say	NULL
in	NULL
passing	NULL
that	NULL
Christina	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
money	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
possessed	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
place	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
fourteen	NULL
years	NULL
'	NULL
minority	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
outgoings	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
the	NULL
accumulation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
myself	NULL
and	NULL
almost	NULL
everyone	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
somewhat	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
1846	NULL
times	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
cripple	NULL
him	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
seriously	NULL
to	NULL
hurt	NULL
him	NULL

but	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL

more	NULL

having	NULL

If	NULL

sixty	NULL

Christina	NULL

too	NULL
great	NULL

--	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
quite	NULL
wiped	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
disgrace	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
having	NULL

imprisoned	NULL

There	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
nonsense	NULL
about	NULL
that	NULL

The	NULL
whole	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mistake	NULL

unfortunate	NULL

true	NULL

the	NULL
less	NULL
said	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
Ernest	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL

live	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL

pay	NULL

In	NULL
fact	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
only	NULL
right	NULL
that	NULL
Theobald	NULL
should	NULL
make	NULL

this	NULL
was	NULL
far	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
take	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
out	NULL

Theobald	NULL

Joey	NULL

very	NULL
handsomely	NULL

Battersby	NULL

"	NULL
Of	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
buy	NULL

Oh	NULL

a	NULL

Theobald	NULL

very	NULL
nicely	NULL

if	NULL
she	NULL

her	NULL

herself	NULL

her	NULL
heart	NULL
fluttered	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL

vivacity	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
sit	NULL

happily	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
photographed	NULL

so	NULL
very	NULL
long	NULL

the	NULL

depended	NULL

entirely	NULL
upon	NULL

expression	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
painter	NULL
could	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
portrait	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL

all	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
Joey	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
become	NULL
Archbishop	NULL

so	NULL
on	NULL
till	NULL
her	NULL
daughter	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
medicine	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
this	NULL
reverie	NULL

which	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
fragment	NULL

actually	NULL
ran	NULL

Christina	NULL

occupied	NULL
about	NULL

half	NULL

it	NULL

the	NULL

Ill	NULL

dying	NULL
indeed	NULL

suffering	NULL

she	NULL

she	NULL
brightened	NULL
up	NULL

laugh	NULL
once	NULL

twice	NULL
quite	NULL
merrily	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
Dr	NULL
Martin	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
almost	NULL

Theobald	NULL
,	NULL
whenever	NULL
this	NULL

shake	NULL

Charlotte	NULL

this	NULL

Ernest	NULL
noticed	NULL

put	NULL
the	NULL

Theobald	NULL
stood	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
and	NULL
whistled	NULL
his	NULL
two	NULL
tunes	NULL
softly	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
old	NULL
way	NULL

Ernest	NULL
left	NULL

him	NULL
completely	NULL
off	NULL

He	NULL
strolled	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
doors	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
sodden	NULL
spinney	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

and	NULL
solaced	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pipe	NULL
.	NULL

Ere	NULL
long	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL

the	NULL
cottage	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL

Her	NULL

Susan	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rocking-chair	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL

Susan	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
ironing	NULL

the	NULL
window	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
smell	NULL

pervaded	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL

Susan	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
retained	NULL
too	NULL
securely	NULL
by	NULL
Christina	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
likely	NULL

side	NULL

Ernest	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
this	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL

and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
call	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
support	NULL

moral	NULL
or	NULL
otherwise	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
called	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
also	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
gather	NULL

a	NULL

her	NULL

she	NULL
often	NULL

God	NULL

fearing	NULL

united	NULL

now	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL

wander	NULL

,	NULL
being	NULL
more	NULL
sensible	NULL

seemed	NULL
also	NULL

She	NULL
ventured	NULL

implored	NULL
Theobald	NULL

"	NULL

Ernest	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
press	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
near	NULL
relations	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
direct	NULL
communication	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
immortal	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
others	NULL
never	NULL
said	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
whether	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
ashamed	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
feared	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
increase	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
damnation	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
determine	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
has	NULL
often	NULL
thought	NULL
about	NULL
this	NULL
since	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
Susan	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
would	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
beforehand	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
Master	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Susan	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
question	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
your	NULL
ma	NULL
has	NULL
sent	NULL
a	NULL
message	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
by	NULL
Miss	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
nothing	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
will	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
questioning	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
that	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
reality	NULL
believe	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
incident	NULL
went	NULL
far	NULL
to	NULL
strengthen	NULL
his	NULL
surmises	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
wavered	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
misdirected	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
asking	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
prayers	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
congregation	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
gloomily	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
does	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
Christina	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
spiritual-mindedness	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
even	NULL
harped	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
grievance	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
having	NULL
eaten	NULL
black	NULL
puddings	NULL
--	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
them	NULL
up	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
how	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
not	NULL
persevered	NULL
in	NULL
eating	NULL
them	NULL
after	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
misgivings	NULL
about	NULL
their	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
forbidden	NULL
!	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
weighed	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
place	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
like	NULL
--	NULL
Ernest	NULL
interrupted	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
My	NULL
dear	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
ill	NULL
and	NULL
your	NULL
mind	NULL
is	NULL
unstrung	NULL
;	NULL
others	NULL
can	NULL
now	NULL
judge	NULL
better	NULL
about	NULL
you	NULL
than	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
assure	NULL
you	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
you	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
devotedly	NULL
unselfish	NULL
wife	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
that	NULL
ever	NULL
lived	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
not	NULL
literally	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
for	NULL
Christ	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
practically	NULL
as	NULL

it	NULL

in	NULL
your	NULL
power	NULL

and	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
this	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
saint	NULL

but	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
distinguished	NULL
one	NULL

"	NULL

At	NULL
these	NULL
words	NULL
Christina	NULL
brightened	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
give	NULL
me	NULL
hope	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
give	NULL
me	NULL
hope	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
cried	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dried	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
assure	NULL
her	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
again	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
solemn	NULL
conviction	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
about	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
distinguished	NULL
saint	NULL
now	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
quite	NULL
content	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
meanest	NULL
who	NULL
actually	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
heaven	NULL
,	NULL
provided	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
sure	NULL
of	NULL
escaping	NULL
that	NULL
awful	NULL
Hell	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
evidently	NULL
was	NULL
omnipresent	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
Ernest	NULL
could	NULL
say	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
dispel	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
ungrateful	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
confess	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
after	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
's	NULL
consolation	NULL
from	NULL
Ernest	NULL
she	NULL
prayed	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
every	NULL
blessing	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
inasmuch	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
always	NULL
feared	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
children	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
never	NULL
meet	NULL
in	NULL
heaven	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
wandering	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
hardly	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
presence	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
was	NULL
reverting	NULL
to	NULL
states	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
illness	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
Sunday	NULL
Ernest	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
noted	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
ever	NULL
receding	NULL
tide	NULL
of	NULL
Evangelicalism	NULL
had	NULL
ebbed	NULL
many	NULL
a	NULL
stage	NULL
lower	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
absence	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
father	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
Rectory	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
across	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
intervening	NULL
field	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
Master	NULL
's	NULL
gown	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wearing	NULL
a	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
Geneva	NULL
bands	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
bands	NULL
were	NULL
worn	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lo	NULL
!	NULL

greater	NULL
marvel	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
Theobald	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
preach	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
Master	NULL
's	NULL
gown	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
surplice	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
whole	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
service	NULL
was	NULL
changed	NULL
;	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
high	NULL
even	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
high-church	NULL
Theobald	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
under	NULL
any	NULL
circumstances	NULL
become	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
easy-going	NULL
slovenliness	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
say	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
orchestral	NULL
accompaniments	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hymns	NULL
had	NULL
disappeared	NULL
while	NULL
my	NULL
hero	NULL
was	NULL
yet	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
no	NULL
chanting	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
years	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
harmonium	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
introduced	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
,	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL
had	NULL
prevailed	NULL
on	NULL
Theobald	NULL
to	NULL
allow	NULL
the	NULL
canticles	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sung	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
sung	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
double	NULL
chants	NULL
by	NULL
Lord	NULL
Mornington	NULL
and	NULL
Dr	NULL
Dupuis	NULL
and	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
allowed	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Christina	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
My	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
really	NULL
think	NULL
"	NULL
(	NULL
Christina	NULL
always	NULL
"	NULL
really	NULL
"	NULL
thought	NULL
)	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
chanting	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
bringing	NULL
many	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
stayed	NULL
away	NULL
hitherto	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Goodhew	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
old	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wright	NULL
only	NULL
yesterday	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
_	NULL
quite	NULL
_	NULL
agreed	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
chant	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
Glory	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Father	NULL
'	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
psalms	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
saying	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Theobald	NULL
looked	NULL
black	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
waters	NULL
of	NULL
chanting	NULL
rising	NULL
higher	NULL
and	NULL
higher	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
inch	NULL
by	NULL
inch	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
yield	NULL
than	NULL
fight	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
ordered	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Glory	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Father	NULL
"	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
chanted	NULL
in	NULL
future	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Really	NULL
,	NULL
mamma	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
battle	NULL
was	NULL
won	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
you	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
call	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
Glory	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Father	NULL
'	NULL
you	NULL
should	NULL
say	NULL
'	NULL
Gloria	NULL
.	NULL
'	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Christina	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
"	NULL
Gloria	NULL
"	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
after	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
wonderfully	NULL
clever	NULL
girl	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
lower	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
bishop	NULL
.	NULL

By-and-by	NULL
when	NULL
Theobald	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
unusually	NULL
long	NULL
holiday	NULL
one	NULL
summer	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
high-church	NULL
clergyman	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
gentleman	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
weight	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
considerable	NULL
private	NULL
means	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
without	NULL
preferment	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
often	NULL
help	NULL
his	NULL
brother	NULL
clergymen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
being	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
duty	NULL
at	NULL
Battersby	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
Sundays	NULL
that	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
away	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
his	NULL
return	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
psalms	NULL
were	NULL
being	NULL
chanted	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
Glorias	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
influential	NULL
clergyman	NULL
,	NULL
Christina	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
bull	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
horns	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
Theobald	NULL
returned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
laughed	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
off	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
clergyman	NULL
laughed	NULL
and	NULL
bounced	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Christina	NULL
laughed	NULL
and	NULL
coaxed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
uttered	NULL
unexceptionable	NULL
sentiments	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
undone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
use	NULL
grieving	NULL
over	NULL
spilt	NULL
milk	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
henceforth	NULL
the	NULL
psalms	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
chanted	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Theobald	NULL
grisled	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
this	NULL
same	NULL
absence	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Goodhew	NULL
and	NULL
old	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wright	NULL
taken	NULL
to	NULL
doing	NULL
but	NULL
turning	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
east	NULL
while	NULL
repeating	NULL
the	NULL
Belief	NULL
?	NULL

Theobald	NULL
disliked	NULL
this	NULL
even	NULL
worse	NULL
than	NULL
chanting	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
something	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
timid	NULL
way	NULL
at	NULL
dinner	NULL
after	NULL
service	NULL
,	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Really	NULL
,	NULL
papa	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
_	NULL
must	NULL
_	NULL
take	NULL
to	NULL
calling	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
Creed	NULL
'	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
Belief	NULL
'	NULL
"	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Theobald	NULL
winced	NULL
impatiently	NULL
and	NULL
snorted	NULL
meek	NULL
defiance	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
spirit	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
aunts	NULL
Jane	NULL
and	NULL
Eliza	NULL
was	NULL
strong	NULL
in	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
small	NULL
to	NULL
fight	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
it	NULL
off	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
laugh	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
As	NULL
for	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
thought	NULL
Christina	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
she	NULL
knows	NULL
_	NULL
everything	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

So	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Goodhew	NULL
and	NULL
old	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wright	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
east	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
Creed	NULL
was	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by-and-by	NULL
others	NULL
followed	NULL
their	NULL
example	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ere	NULL
long	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
stood	NULL
out	NULL
yielded	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
eastward	NULL
too	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
Theobald	NULL
made	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
right	NULL
and	NULL
proper	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
-	NULL
and-by	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
say	NULL
"	NULL
Alleluia	NULL
"	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
Hallelujah	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
too	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Theobald	NULL
turned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
frightened	NULL
and	NULL
ran	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
they	NULL
changed	NULL
the	NULL
double	NULL
chants	NULL
for	NULL
single	NULL
ones	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
altered	NULL
them	NULL
psalm	NULL
by	NULL
psalm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
psalms	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
where	NULL
a	NULL
cursory	NULL
reader	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
changed	NULL
from	NULL
major	NULL
to	NULL
minor	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
minor	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
major	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
looks	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
friendly	NULL
eyes	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
theory	NULL
of	NULL
Evolution	NULL
or	NULL

.	NULL

My	NULL
hero	NULL
thought	NULL
over	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
remembered	NULL
many	NULL
a	NULL
_	NULL
ruse	NULL
_	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
Christina	NULL
and	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
many	NULL
a	NULL
detail	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
struggle	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
further	NULL
interrupt	NULL
my	NULL
story	NULL
to	NULL
refer	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
favourite	NULL
retort	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
end	NULL
in	NULL
Rome	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
firmly	NULL
believed	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
smiled	NULL
now	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
another	NULL
alternative	NULL
clear	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
so	NULL
horrible	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
Theobald	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
the	NULL
toppling	NULL
over	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
system	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
welcomed	NULL
the	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
absurdities	NULL
and	NULL
unrealities	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
would	NULL
end	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
downfall	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
very	NULL
differently	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
believing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cow	NULL
jumping	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
probably	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
nine-tenths	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
clergy	NULL
themselves	NULL
--	NULL
who	NULL
know	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
does	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
outward	NULL
and	NULL
visible	NULL
symbols	NULL
are	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
date	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
knows	NULL
the	NULL
baffling	NULL
complexity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
problem	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
comes	NULL
to	NULL
deciding	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
actually	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

Also	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
seen	NULL
them	NULL
more	NULL
closely	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knows	NULL
better	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
wolves	NULL
in	NULL
sheep	NULL
's	NULL
clothing	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
are	NULL
thirsting	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
blood	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
victim	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
exulting	NULL
so	NULL
clamorously	NULL
over	NULL
its	NULL
anticipated	NULL
early	NULL
fall	NULL
into	NULL
their	NULL
clutches	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
spirit	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
her	NULL
letter	NULL
--	NULL
true	NULL
once	NULL
--	NULL
is	NULL
now	NULL
true	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
spirit	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
High	NULL
Priests	NULL
of	NULL
Science	NULL
is	NULL
as	NULL
lying	NULL
as	NULL
its	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Theobalds	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
do	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
do	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
seems	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
correct	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
who	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
hearts	NULL
neither	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
nor	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
are	NULL
in	NULL
reality	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
dangerous	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
classes	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
peace	NULL
and	NULL
liberties	NULL
of	NULL
mankind	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
fear	NULL
is	NULL
he	NULL
who	NULL
goes	NULL
at	NULL
things	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
cocksureness	NULL
of	NULL
pushing	NULL
vulgarity	NULL
and	NULL
self-conceit	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
vices	NULL
which	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
justly	NULL
laid	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
charge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
clergy	NULL
.	NULL

Many	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
farmers	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
when	NULL
service	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
knew	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
having	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
fortune	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fact	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
immediately	NULL
told	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
gossips	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
long	NULL
in	NULL
spreading	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
simplified	NULL
matters	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
civil	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Goodhew	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wright	NULL
the	NULL
cut	NULL
direct	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
in	NULL
disguise	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
week	NULL
passed	NULL
slowly	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
sacrament	NULL
together	NULL
round	NULL
Christina	NULL
's	NULL
death-bed	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
impatience	NULL
became	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
transparent	NULL
daily	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
fortunately	NULL
Christina	NULL
(	NULL
who	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
well	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
shut	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
)	NULL
became	NULL
weaker	NULL
and	NULL
less	NULL
coherent	NULL
in	NULL
mind	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
hardly	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
perceived	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
comatose	NULL
state	NULL
which	NULL
lasted	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
so	NULL
peacefully	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
blending	NULL
of	NULL
sea	NULL
and	NULL
sky	NULL
in	NULL
mid-ocean	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
soft	NULL
hazy	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
none	NULL
can	NULL
say	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
ends	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
heavens	NULL
begin	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
she	NULL
died	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
realities	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
with	NULL
less	NULL
pain	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
waked	NULL
from	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
illusions	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
comfort	NULL
and	NULL
mainstay	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
life	NULL
for	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
thirty	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Theobald	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
wish	NULL
it	NULL
prolonged	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
buried	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
to	NULL
conceal	NULL
his	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
emotion	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
funeral	NULL
accompanied	NULL
by	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
any	NULL
possible	NULL
misapprehension	NULL
about	NULL
Miss	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
's	NULL
intentions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
friend	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
presence	NULL
at	NULL
Christina	NULL
's	NULL
funeral	NULL
would	NULL
surprise	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
faults	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
rather	NULL
liked	NULL
Christina	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
chopped	NULL
Ernest	NULL
or	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
into	NULL
little	NULL
pieces	NULL
of	NULL
mincemeat	NULL
to	NULL
gratify	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
wish	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
chopped	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
cross	NULL
her	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
nature	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
even	NULL
temper	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
pleased	NULL
than	NULL
ruffled	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
a	NULL
good-natured	NULL
action	NULL
,	NULL
provided	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
cost	NULL
her	NULL
much	NULL
exertion	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
involve	NULL
expense	NULL
to	NULL
Theobald	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
own	NULL
little	NULL
purse	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
matter	NULL
;	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
or	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
after	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
reserved	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
absolutely	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
dress	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
hear	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
end	NULL
as	NULL
Ernest	NULL
described	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
without	NULL
feeling	NULL
very	NULL
compassionate	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
son	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
more	NULL
so	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
consented	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
funeral	NULL
;	NULL
perhaps	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
influenced	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
and	NULL
Joey	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
interested	NULL
on	NULL
hearing	NULL
what	NULL
my	NULL
godson	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
found	NULL
Theobald	NULL
looking	NULL
remarkably	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
one	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
bearing	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
beautifully	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
indeed	NULL
once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
shake	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
comfort	NULL
and	NULL
mainstay	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
for	NULL
over	NULL
thirty	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
ended	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
stayed	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
Sunday	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
my	NULL
departure	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
morning	NULL
after	NULL
having	NULL
told	NULL
Theobald	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
wished	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Theobald	NULL
asked	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
Christina	NULL
's	NULL
epitaph	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL

said	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
as	NULL
little	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
;	NULL
eulogies	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
departed	NULL
are	NULL
in	NULL
most	NULL
cases	NULL
both	NULL
unnecessary	NULL
and	NULL
untrue	NULL

Christina	NULL
's	NULL
epitaph	NULL
shall	NULL
contain	NULL
nothing	NULL
which	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
either	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
dates	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
birth	NULL
and	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
say	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
my	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
wind	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
simple	NULL
text	NULL
--	NULL
her	NULL
favourite	NULL
one	NULL

I	NULL
said	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
this	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
settled	NULL

So	NULL
Ernest	NULL
was	NULL
sent	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL

the	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXXXIV	NULL
On	NULL
our	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
Ernest	NULL
broached	NULL
his	NULL
plans	NULL
for	NULL
spending	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
year	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wanted	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
more	NULL
into	NULL
society	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
brushed	NULL
this	NULL
aside	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
last	NULL
thing	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
fancy	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
society	NULL
indeed	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
very	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

putting	NULL

the	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
into	NULL

brought	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL

morning	NULL

He	NULL
passed	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
Christina	NULL

written	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
birth	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
last	NULL
child	NULL

which	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL

And	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL

if	NULL
you	NULL

turn	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL
novel	NULL

mind	NULL

print	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
so	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
held	NULL
sacred	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
gaze	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Because	NULL
my	NULL
mother	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
wished	NULL

published	NULL

Therefore	NULL
publish	NULL
it	NULL

This	NULL
is	NULL
why	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

Within	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
Ernest	NULL
carried	NULL
his	NULL
intention	NULL
into	NULL
effect	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
made	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
arrangements	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
children	NULL
's	NULL
welfare	NULL
left	NULL
England	NULL
before	NULL
Christmas	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
heard	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
learnt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
visiting	NULL
almost	NULL
all	NULL
parts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
staying	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
places	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
inhabitants	NULL
unusually	NULL
good-looking	NULL
and	NULL
agreeable	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
filled	NULL
an	NULL
immense	NULL
quantity	NULL
of	NULL
note-books	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
of	NULL
1867	NULL
he	NULL
returned	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
luggage	NULL
stained	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
variation	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
hotel	NULL
advertisement	NULL
'	NULL
twixt	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
Japan	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
very	NULL
brown	NULL
and	NULL
strong	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
favoured	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
almost	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
caught	NULL
some	NULL
good	NULL
looks	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
among	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
living	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
rooms	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Temple	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL
as	NULL
easily	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
away	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
things	NULL
we	NULL
did	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
;	NULL
we	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
to	NULL
Gravesend	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
thence	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
miles	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
riverside	NULL
till	NULL
we	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
solitary	NULL
house	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
people	NULL
lived	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
placed	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lovely	NULL
April	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
fresh	NULL
air	NULL
blowing	NULL
from	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
tide	NULL
was	NULL
high	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
was	NULL
alive	NULL
with	NULL
shipping	NULL
coming	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
wind	NULL
and	NULL
tide	NULL
.	NULL

Sea-gulls	NULL
wheeled	NULL
around	NULL
us	NULL
overhead	NULL
,	NULL
sea-weed	NULL
clung	NULL
everywhere	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
banks	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
advancing	NULL
tide	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
covered	NULL
,	NULL
everything	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
sea-ey	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fine	NULL
bracing	NULL
air	NULL
which	NULL
blew	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
made	NULL
me	NULL
feel	NULL
more	NULL
hungry	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
children	NULL
could	NULL
live	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
physical	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
than	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
applauded	NULL
the	NULL
selection	NULL
which	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
on	NULL
behalf	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
youngsters	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
off	NULL
we	NULL
heard	NULL
shouts	NULL
and	NULL
children	NULL
's	NULL
laughter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
boys	NULL
and	NULL
girls	NULL
romping	NULL
together	NULL
and	NULL
running	NULL
after	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
distinguish	NULL
our	NULL
own	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
got	NULL
near	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
soon	NULL
made	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
children	NULL
were	NULL
blue-eyed	NULL
,	NULL
flaxen-pated	NULL
little	NULL
folks	NULL
,	NULL
whereas	NULL
ours	NULL
were	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
straight-haired	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
coming	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
desired	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
these	NULL
paid	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
than	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
stranger	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
visit	NULL
a	NULL
spot	NULL
so	NULL
unfrequented	NULL
except	NULL
by	NULL
sea-faring	NULL
folk	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
plainly	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
interest	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
us	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
quickened	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
our	NULL
pockets	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
oranges	NULL
and	NULL
sweeties	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
extent	NULL
greater	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
entered	NULL
into	NULL
their	NULL
small	NULL
imaginations	NULL
to	NULL
conceive	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
great	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
making	NULL
them	NULL
come	NULL
near	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
wild	NULL
young	NULL
colts	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
inquisitive	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
very	NULL
coy	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
cajoled	NULL
easily	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
children	NULL
were	NULL
nine	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
--	NULL
five	NULL
boys	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
girls	NULL
belonging	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Rollings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
finer	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
children	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
Rollings	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
were	NULL
hardy	NULL
,	NULL
robust	NULL

Mr	NULL

The	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXXXV	NULL
Ernest	NULL
being	NULL
about	NULL
two	NULL
and	NULL
thirty	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
fling	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
steadily	NULL
.	NULL

Up	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
abundant	NULL
promise	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
produced	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
indeed	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
come	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
for	NULL
another	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
years	NULL
yet	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
lived	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
very	NULL
quietly	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
hardly	NULL
anyone	NULL
but	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
old	NULL
friends	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
intimate	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
formed	NULL
our	NULL
little	NULL
set	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
outside	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
my	NULL
godson	NULL
was	NULL
hardly	NULL
known	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
main	NULL
expense	NULL
was	NULL
travelling	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
indulged	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
frequent	NULL
intervals	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
short	NULL
times	NULL
only	NULL
.	NULL

Do	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
through	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
about	NULL
fifteen	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
income	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
away	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
money	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
well	NULL
bestowed	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
put	NULL
by	NULL
until	NULL
some	NULL
opportunity	NULL
arose	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
advantage	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
writing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
little	NULL
differences	NULL
of	NULL
opinion	NULL
upon	NULL
this	NULL
head	NULL
that	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
tacit	NULL
understanding	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
was	NULL
seldom	NULL
referred	NULL
to	NULL
between	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
actually	NULL
publishing	NULL
till	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
brought	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
flat	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL

I	NULL
opened	NULL
it	NULL

found	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL

series	NULL
of	NULL
semi-theological	NULL
,	NULL
semi	NULL
-	NULL
social	NULL
essays	NULL

purporting	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
written	NULL
by	NULL
six	NULL
or	NULL
seven	NULL
different	NULL
people	NULL

and	NULL
viewing	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
class	NULL
of	NULL
subjects	NULL
from	NULL
different	NULL

People	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
forgotten	NULL
the	NULL
famous	NULL
"	NULL
Essays	NULL
and	NULL
Reviews	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
wickedly	NULL
given	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
touches	NULL
to	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
essays	NULL
which	NULL
suggested	NULL
vaguely	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
written	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
bishop	NULL

The	NULL
essays	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
support	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL

and	NULL
appeared	NULL
both	NULL
by	NULL
internal	NULL
suggestion	NULL

and	NULL
their	NULL
prima	NULL

purport	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
half-dozen	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
experience	NULL

high	NULL
position	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
the	NULL
difficult	NULL
questions	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
no	NULL
less	NULL
boldly	NULL
from	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
bosom	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
Church	NULL

reopened	NULL

reconsidered	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
merits	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
teaching	NULL
of	NULL

were	NULL

Irrational	NULL

,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
written	NULL
vigorously	NULL
and	NULL
fearlessly	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
by	NULL
people	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
authority	NULL
;	NULL
all	NULL
granted	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
professed	NULL
to	NULL
enjoin	NULL
belief	NULL
in	NULL

which	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
accept	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
weigh	NULL
evidence	NULL

but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
contended	NULL
that	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
valuable	NULL

had	NULL
got	NULL
so	NULL
closely	NULL
mixed	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
these	NULL
mistakes	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
mistakes	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
meddled	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
lay	NULL
great	NULL
stress	NULL
on	NULL
these	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
cavilling	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Queen	NULL
's	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
reign	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
that	NULL
William	NULL
the	NULL
Conqueror	NULL
was	NULL
illegitimate	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
article	NULL
maintained	NULL
that	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
inconvenient	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
prayer	NULL
book	NULL
and	NULL
articles	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
inconvenient	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
way	NULL
the	NULL
meanings	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
put	NULL
upon	NULL
those	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
argued	NULL

was	NULL
what	NULL

in	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
LXXXVI	NULL
And	NULL
now	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
bring	NULL
my	NULL
story	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
close	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
preceding	NULL
chapter	NULL
was	NULL
written	NULL
soon	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
events	NULL
it	NULL
records	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
of	NULL
1867	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
my	NULL
story	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
written	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
point	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
altered	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
from	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
time	NULL
occasionally	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL
autumn	NULL
of	NULL
1882	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
more	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
eighty	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
well	NULL
in	NULL
health	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
conceal	NULL
from	NULL
myself	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
young	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
himself	NULL
is	NULL
forty-seven	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
hardly	NULL
looks	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
richer	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
never	NULL
married	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
London	NULL
and	NULL
North	NULL
-	NULL
Western	NULL
shares	NULL
have	NULL
nearly	NULL
doubled	NULL
themselves	NULL
.	NULL

Through	NULL
sheer	NULL
inability	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
his	NULL
income	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
hoard	NULL
in	NULL
self-defence	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
still	NULL
lives	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Temple	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
rooms	NULL
I	NULL
took	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
shop	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
induce	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
says	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
wherever	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
hotel	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
town	NULL
he	NULL
likes	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
quiet	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
town	NULL
he	NULL
feels	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
left	NULL
little	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
can	NULL
go	NULL
wrong	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
tied	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
locality	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
no	NULL
exception	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
says	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rule	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
cheaper	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
milk	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
a	NULL
cow	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
mentioned	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Jupp	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
say	NULL
here	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
that	NULL
remains	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
old	NULL
woman	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
now	NULL
living	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
says	NULL
triumphantly	NULL
,	NULL
can	NULL
say	NULL
how	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Old	NULL
Kent	NULL
Road	NULL
is	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presumably	NULL
has	NULL
carried	NULL
her	NULL
secret	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
grave	NULL
.	NULL

Old	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
lives	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finds	NULL
it	NULL
hard	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
ends	NULL
meet	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
minds	NULL
this	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
has	NULL
prevented	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
getting	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
drink	NULL
than	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
use	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
beyond	NULL
paying	NULL
her	NULL
allowance	NULL
weekly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
absolutely	NULL
refusing	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
anticipate	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
pawns	NULL
her	NULL
flat	NULL
iron	NULL
every	NULL
Saturday	NULL
for	NULL
4d.	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
takes	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
every	NULL
Monday	NULL
morning	NULL
for	NULL
4.5	NULL
d.	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
gets	NULL
her	NULL
allowance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
has	NULL
done	NULL
this	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
ten	NULL
years	NULL
as	NULL
regularly	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
comes	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
flat	NULL
iron	NULL
actually	NULL
go	NULL
we	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
can	NULL
still	NULL
worry	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
financial	NULL
problems	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
hugger	NULL
-	NULL
mugger	NULL
way	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
be	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
the	NULL
flat	NULL
iron	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
beyond	NULL
redemption	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
interfere	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
something	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
which	NULL
always	NULL
reminds	NULL
me	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
unlike	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
person	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
another	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
last	NULL
time	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
gossip	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
a	NULL
cab	NULL
drive	NULL
up	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
the	NULL
staircase	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
Mr	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
's	NULL
pa	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
Beelzebub	NULL
old	NULL
head	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
greased	NULL
her	NULL
sides	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
curtsey	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
likes	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
professed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
luck	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
lodgers	NULL
did	NULL
use	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
dreadful	NULL
,	NULL
going	NULL
away	NULL
without	NULL
paying	NULL
and	NULL
leaving	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
stick	NULL
behind	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to-day	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
pleased	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
penny	NULL
carrot	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
lovely	NULL
dinner	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
cushion	NULL
of	NULL
ham	NULL
and	NULL
green	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL

it	NULL

then	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL

from	NULL
all	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
gather	NULL
makes	NULL
it	NULL
pay	NULL
extremely	NULL
well	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
like	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
spark	NULL

so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
observe	NULL

any	NULL

he	NULL
has	NULL
a	NULL
fair	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
humour	NULL
and	NULL
abundance	NULL
of	NULL
common	NULL
sense	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
instinct	NULL
is	NULL
clearly	NULL
a	NULL
practical	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
put	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
mind	NULL
almost	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
Theobald	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
sailor	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
of	NULL
Ernest	NULL
.	NULL

Ernest	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Battersby	NULL
and	NULL
stay	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
twice	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
until	NULL
Theobald	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
continued	NULL
on	NULL
excellent	NULL
terms	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
neighbouring	NULL
clergy	NULL
call	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
atrocious	NULL
books	NULL
which	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ernest	NULL
Pontifex	NULL
"	NULL
has	NULL
written	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
harmony	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
absence	NULL
of	NULL
discord	NULL
which	NULL
subsisted	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
was	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
Theobald	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
looked	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
inside	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
's	NULL
works	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ernest	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
alluded	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
presence	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pair	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
excellently	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
doubtless	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
that	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
visits	NULL
were	NULL
short	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
too	NULL
frequent	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
Theobald	NULL
wanted	NULL
Ernest	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
his	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Ernest	NULL
knew	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
Theobald	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
on	NULL
small	NULL
business	NULL
matters	NULL
and	NULL
paid	NULL
a	NULL
visit	NULL
to	NULL
Ernest	NULL
's	NULL
chambers	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
generally	NULL
brought	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
lettuces	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
cabbage	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
half-a-dozen	NULL
turnips	NULL
done	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
brown	NULL
paper	NULL

and	NULL
told	NULL
Ernest	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
fresh	NULL
vegetables	NULL
were	NULL
rather	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
some	NULL

Ernest	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
explained	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
vegetables	NULL
were	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
use	NULL

him	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
rather	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
bring	NULL
them	NULL

Theobald	NULL
persisted	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
through	NULL
sheer	NULL
love	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
small	NULL

take	NULL

these	NULL

well	NULL

if	NULL

departed	NULL

such	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
he	NULL

that	NULL

much	NULL
sooner	NULL

nine	NULL

out	NULL

Partly	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
incompatibility	NULL

temperament	NULL

but	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
the	NULL
main	NULL
ground	NULL
of	NULL
complaint	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
independent	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
rich	NULL
while	NULL
still	NULL
very	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
thus	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
robbed	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
power	NULL
to	NULL
tease	NULL

scratch	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
which	NULL

do	NULL

The	NULL
love	NULL
of	NULL
teasing	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
way	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
safe	NULL

doing	NULL
so	NULL
had	NULL
remained	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
nature	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
his	NULL
nurse	NULL

keep	NULL

torment	NULL
her	NULL

Ernest	NULL
tells	NULL

Joey	NULL
was	NULL
far	NULL
fiercer	NULL

ever	NULL

Ernest	NULL
remarking	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL

On	NULL
this	NULL
Ernest	NULL
departed	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
wrote	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
critics	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
[	NULL

,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

Ernest	NULL
remembered	NULL
[	NULL
Greek	NULL

and	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
words	NULL
were	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
like	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
month	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
was	NULL

to	NULL
his	NULL
fathers	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL

Ernest	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL

you	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
replied	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
old	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
like	NULL
playing	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
all	NULL
whose	NULL
minds	NULL
are	NULL
active	NULL
,	NULL
Ernest	NULL
overworks	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
occasionally	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
fierce	NULL
and	NULL
reproachful	NULL
encounters	NULL
with	NULL
Dr	NULL
Skinner	NULL
or	NULL
Theobald	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
sleep	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
beyond	NULL
this	NULL
neither	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
worthies	NULL
can	NULL
now	NULL
molest	NULL
him	NULL
further	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
myself	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
son	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
son	NULL
;	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
half	NULL
afraid	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
example	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
books	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
father	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
ought	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
trust	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
forgiven	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
books	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
bone	NULL
of	NULL
contention	NULL
between	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
want	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
like	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
offend	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
readers	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
says	NULL
he	NULL
can	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
change	NULL
his	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
writing	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
colour	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
write	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
does	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
generally	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
favourite	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
admitted	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
talent	NULL

but	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
considered	NULL
generally	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
unpractical	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
matter	NULL
how	NULL
serious	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
always	NULL
accused	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
in	NULL
jest	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
first	NULL
book	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
success	NULL
for	NULL
reasons	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
already	NULL
explained	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
others	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
creditable	NULL
failures	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
unfortunate	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
whose	NULL
books	NULL
is	NULL
sneered	NULL
at	NULL
by	NULL
literary	NULL
critics	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
comes	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
becomes	NULL
"	NULL
excellent	NULL

as	NULL
soon	NULL

it	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
followed	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL

work	NULL

condemned	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
asked	NULL
a	NULL
reviewer	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
over	NULL

over	NULL
again	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
madness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
find	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL

the	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
say	NULL

him	NULL
which	NULL
makes	NULL
him	NULL

What	NULL
can	NULL

It	NULL
may	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL

the	NULL

lost	NULL
all	NULL

looked	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL
