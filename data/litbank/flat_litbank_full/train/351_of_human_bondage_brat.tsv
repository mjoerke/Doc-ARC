the	NULL
cow	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
calf	NULL
--	NULL
till	NULL
Philip	NULL
forgot	NULL
his	NULL
tears	NULL
and	NULL
grew	NULL
excited	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
approaching	NULL
journey	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
helped	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
lay	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
clothes	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sent	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
nursery	NULL
to	NULL
gather	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
toys	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
playing	NULL
happily	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
alone	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bed-room	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Emma	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
putting	NULL
his	NULL
things	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
big	NULL
tin	NULL
box	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
take	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
by	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
Emma	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
'd	NULL
better	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL
fancy	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Uncle	NULL
William	NULL
's	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Never	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
're	NULL
your	NULL
own	NULL
things	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
downstairs	NULL
slowly	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
open	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
walked	NULL
slowly	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
so	NULL
short	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
particular	NULL
interest	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
stranger	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
nothing	NULL
that	NULL
struck	NULL
his	NULL
fancy	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
things	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
belonged	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
landlord	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
fixed	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
clock	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
heard	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
say	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
again	NULL
rather	NULL
disconsolately	NULL
upstairs	NULL
.	NULL

Outside	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
bed-room	NULL
he	NULL
stopped	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
wrong	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
frightened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
uncomfortably	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
something	NULL
impelled	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
the	NULL
handle	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
gently	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
anyone	NULL
within	NULL
from	NULL
hearing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
slowly	NULL
pushed	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
open	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
threshold	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
courage	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
frightened	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
strange	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
blinds	NULL
were	NULL
drawn	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cold	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
January	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
dark	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
dressing-table	NULL
were	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
's	NULL
brushes	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
mirror	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
tray	NULL
were	NULL
hairpins	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
photograph	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
chimney-piece	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
different	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
curious	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chairs	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bed	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
someone	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
pillow	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
night-dress	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
opened	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
cupboard	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
dresses	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
stepping	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
as	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
and	NULL
buried	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
smelt	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
scent	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
used	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
pulled	NULL
open	NULL
the	NULL
drawers	NULL
,	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
:	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
lavender	NULL
bags	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
linen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
scent	NULL
was	NULL
fresh	NULL
and	NULL
pleasant	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
strangeness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
left	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
walk	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
presently	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
upstairs	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
nursery	NULL
tea	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
her	NULL
kiss	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
true	NULL
simply	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
climbed	NULL
up	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
pillow	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
lay	NULL
there	NULL
quite	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

IV	NULL
Philip	NULL
parted	NULL
from	NULL
Emma	NULL
with	NULL
tears	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
journey	NULL
to	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
amused	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
arrived	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
resigned	NULL
and	NULL
cheerful	NULL
.	NULL

Blackstable	NULL
was	NULL
sixty	NULL
miles	NULL
from	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

Giving	NULL
their	NULL
luggage	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
porter	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
set	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
with	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
them	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
reached	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
suddenly	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
red	NULL
and	NULL
five-barred	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
swung	NULL
both	NULL
ways	NULL
on	NULL
easy	NULL
hinges	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
forbidden	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
swing	NULL
backwards	NULL
and	NULL
forwards	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
walked	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
front-door	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
used	NULL
by	NULL
visitors	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
Sundays	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
special	NULL
occasions	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
or	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
traffic	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
took	NULL
place	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
side-door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
back	NULL
door	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
gardener	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
beggars	NULL
and	NULL
tramps	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fairly	NULL
large	NULL
house	NULL
of	NULL
yellow	NULL
brick	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
red	NULL
roof	NULL
,	NULL
built	NULL
about	NULL
five	NULL
and	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
ecclesiastical	NULL
style	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
front-door	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
church	NULL
porch	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
windows	NULL
were	NULL
gothic	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
by	NULL
what	NULL
train	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
coming	NULL
,	NULL
waited	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
click	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
it	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
's	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Run	NULL
and	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
kiss	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
,	NULL
awkwardly	NULL
,	NULL
trailing	NULL
his	NULL
club-foot	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
stopped	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
shrivelled	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
age	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
face	NULL
extraordinarily	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
deep	NULL
wrinkles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pale	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
gray	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
arranged	NULL
in	NULL
ringlets	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fashion	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
youth	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
only	NULL
ornament	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
gold	NULL
chain	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
hung	NULL
a	NULL
cross	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
shy	NULL
manner	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
gentle	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Did	NULL
you	NULL
walk	NULL
,	NULL
William	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
reproachfully	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
nephew	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
hurt	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
always	NULL
walk	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
surprised	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
conversation	NULL
.	NULL

Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
paved	NULL
with	NULL
red	NULL
and	NULL
yellow	NULL
tiles	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
alternately	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
Greek	NULL
Cross	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Lamb	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
imposing	NULL
staircase	NULL
led	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
polished	NULL
pine	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
smell	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
because	NULL
fortunately	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
was	NULL
reseated	NULL
,	NULL
enough	NULL
wood	NULL
remained	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
balusters	NULL
were	NULL
decorated	NULL
with	NULL
emblems	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Four	NULL
Evangelists	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
stove	NULL
lighted	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
'd	NULL
be	NULL
cold	NULL
after	NULL
your	NULL
journey	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
black	NULL
stove	NULL
that	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
lighted	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
bad	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
lighted	NULL
if	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

Coal	NULL
was	NULL
expensive	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
fires	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
they	NULL
wanted	NULL
all	NULL
them	NULL
fires	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
keep	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
Mr.	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
fire	NULL
should	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
was	NULL
used	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
on	NULL
Sunday	NULL
afternoons	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
nap	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
every	NULL
Saturday	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
fire	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
study	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
write	NULL
his	NULL
sermon	NULL
.	NULL

Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
took	NULL
Philip	NULL
upstairs	NULL
and	NULL
showed	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
tiny	NULL
bed-room	NULL
that	NULL
looked	NULL
out	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
drive	NULL
.	NULL

Immediately	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
tree	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
remembered	NULL
now	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
branches	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
low	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
climb	NULL
quite	NULL
high	NULL
up	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
A	NULL
small	NULL
room	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
frightened	NULL
at	NULL
sleeping	NULL
alone	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

On	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
visit	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
nurse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
little	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
uncertainty	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Can	NULL
you	NULL
wash	NULL
your	NULL
own	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
shall	NULL
I	NULL
wash	NULL
them	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
wash	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
firmly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
settled	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
should	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
much	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
treat	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
shy	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
hoped	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
noisy	NULL
and	NULL
rough	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
rough	NULL
and	NULL
noisy	NULL
boys	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
excuse	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
Philip	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL

him	NULL

without	NULL

in	NULL

if	NULL
he	NULL

the	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
downstairs	NULL

rang	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
for	NULL
tea	NULL

The	NULL
dining-room	NULL

large	NULL

well-proportioned	NULL

had	NULL
windows	NULL

two	NULL

it	NULL

one	NULL

an	NULL
imposing	NULL
mahogany	NULL
sideboard	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

in	NULL
it	NULL

In	NULL
one	NULL
corner	NULL
stood	NULL
a	NULL
harmonium	NULL

On	NULL
each	NULL
side	NULL

the	NULL

chairs	NULL
covered	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
never	NULL

the	NULL
arm-chair	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
preferred	NULL
a	NULL
chair	NULL

not	NULL
too	NULL
comfortable	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
a	NULL

if	NULL
her	NULL

she	NULL
might	NULL

so	NULL
ready	NULL

it	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL

two	NULL

One	NULL
was	NULL
large	NULL

unused	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
journey	NULL
from	NULL
London	NULL
to	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
very	NULL
tiring	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
seldom	NULL

only	NULL
three	NULL

when	NULL
her	NULL

wanted	NULL
a	NULL
holiday	NULL

since	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
money	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL

he	NULL
went	NULL
by	NULL
himself	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
Church	NULL
Congresses	NULL

usually	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL

once	NULL
he	NULL

Paris	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
exhibition	NULL

and	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
to	NULL
Switzerland	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
egg	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
chair	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
too	NULL
low	NULL
for	NULL
Philip	NULL

and	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
neither	NULL
Mr.	NULL

Philip	NULL
would	NULL

himself	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
always	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
boiled	NULL
egg	NULL
at	NULL
tea	NULL
on	NULL
Sunday	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
fortified	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
service	NULL

V	NULL
Philip	NULL
came	NULL
gradually	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
fragments	NULL
of	NULL
conversation	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
meant	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
ears	NULL
,	NULL
learned	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
both	NULL
about	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
dead	NULL
parents	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
father	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
much	NULL
younger	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
of	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
brilliant	NULL
career	NULL
at	NULL
St.	NULL
Luke	NULL
's	NULL
Hospital	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
staff	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
earn	NULL
money	NULL
in	NULL
considerable	NULL
sums	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spent	NULL
it	NULL
freely	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
parson	NULL
set	NULL
about	NULL
restoring	NULL
his	NULL
church	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
his	NULL
brother	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
subscription	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
by	NULL
receiving	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
:	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
,	NULL
thrifty	NULL
by	NULL
inclination	NULL
and	NULL
economical	NULL
by	NULL
necessity	NULL
,	NULL
accepted	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
mingled	NULL
feelings	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
envious	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
brother	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
afford	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
pleased	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
vaguely	NULL
irritated	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
generosity	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
almost	NULL
ostentatious	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Henry	NULL
Carey	NULL
married	NULL
a	NULL
patient	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
beautiful	NULL
girl	NULL
but	NULL
penniless	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
orphan	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
near	NULL
relations	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
family	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
array	NULL
of	NULL
fine	NULL
friends	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
wedding	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
parson	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
visits	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
held	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
reserve	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
shy	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
he	NULL
resented	NULL
her	NULL
great	NULL
beauty	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
dressed	NULL
more	NULL
magnificently	NULL
than	NULL
became	NULL
the	NULL
wife	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hardworking	NULL
surgeon	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
charming	NULL
furniture	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
flowers	NULL
among	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
lived	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
winter	NULL
,	NULL
suggested	NULL
an	NULL
extravagance	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
deplored	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
entertainments	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
on	NULL
getting	NULL
home	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
hospitality	NULL
without	NULL
making	NULL
some	NULL
return	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
grapes	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
that	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
cost	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
eight	NULL
shillings	NULL
a	NULL
pound	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
luncheon	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
given	NULL
asparagus	NULL
two	NULL
months	NULL
before	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
garden	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
anticipated	NULL
was	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
prophet	NULL
who	NULL
saw	NULL
fire	NULL
and	NULL
brimstone	NULL
consume	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
mend	NULL
its	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
warning	NULL
.	NULL

Poor	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
practically	NULL
penniless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
fine	NULL
friends	NULL
now	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
extravagance	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
criminal	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mercy	NULL
that	NULL
Providence	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
fit	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
his	NULL
dear	NULL
mother	NULL
to	NULL
itself	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
at	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
an	NULL
incident	NULL
happened	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
irritate	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
breakfast	NULL
table	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
packet	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sent	NULL
on	NULL
by	NULL
post	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
late	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
addressed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
parson	NULL
opened	NULL
it	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
photographs	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
showed	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
shoulders	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
plainly	NULL
done	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
low	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
forehead	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
an	NULL
unusual	NULL
look	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
thin	NULL
and	NULL
worn	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
illness	NULL
could	NULL
impair	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
features	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
dark	NULL
eyes	NULL
a	NULL
sadness	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
remember	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
woman	NULL
gave	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
shock	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
quickly	NULL
followed	NULL
by	NULL
perplexity	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
photographs	NULL
seemed	NULL
quite	NULL
recent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
imagine	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
ordered	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
D'you	NULL
know	NULL
anything	NULL
about	NULL
these	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
mamma	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
'd	NULL
been	NULL
taken	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Miss	NULL
Watkin	NULL
scolded	NULL
her	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
I	NULL
wanted	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
me	NULL
by	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
grows	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
child	NULL
spoke	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
clear	NULL
treble	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
recalled	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
meant	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
'd	NULL
better	NULL
take	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
photographs	NULL
and	NULL
keep	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
your	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
sent	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Watkin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
wrote	NULL
and	NULL
explained	NULL
how	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
feeling	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
hopeful	NULL
;	NULL
Emma	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
maids	NULL
were	NULL
downstairs	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
basement	NULL
:	NULL
suddenly	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
felt	NULL
desperately	NULL
alone	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
great	NULL
fear	NULL
seized	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
recover	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
confinement	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
expecting	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
son	NULL
was	NULL
nine	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
grow	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
forget	NULL
,	NULL
forget	NULL
her	NULL
utterly	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
passionately	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
weakly	NULL
and	NULL
deformed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
photographs	NULL
of	NULL
herself	NULL
taken	NULL
since	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
ten	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
her	NULL
son	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
forget	NULL
her	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
forget	NULL
utterly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
maid	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
would	NULL
prevent	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
send	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
strength	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
struggle	NULL
or	NULL
argue	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
dress	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
legs	NULL
gave	NULL
way	NULL
beneath	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
soles	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
tingled	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
unused	NULL
to	NULL
doing	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
raised	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
brush	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
faint	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
maid	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
beautiful	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
fine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
rich	NULL
gold	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
were	NULL
straight	NULL
and	NULL
dark	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
skirt	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
chose	NULL
the	NULL
bodice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
dress	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
best	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
damask	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
fashionable	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
glass	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
skin	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
much	NULL
colour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
redness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
beautiful	NULL
mouth	NULL
emphatic	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
restrain	NULL
a	NULL
sob	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
afford	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sorry	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
feeling	NULL
already	NULL
desperately	NULL
tired	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
furs	NULL
which	NULL
Henry	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
Christmas	NULL
before	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
happy	NULL
then	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
slipped	NULL
downstairs	NULL
with	NULL
beating	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
got	NULL
safely	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
drove	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
photographer	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
paid	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
photographs	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sitting	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
assistant	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
ill	NULL
,	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
come	NULL
another	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
staying	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
finished	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
drove	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dingy	NULL
little	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
Kensington	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
hated	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
horrible	NULL
house	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
door	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
drove	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
and	NULL
Emma	NULL
ran	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
steps	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
frightened	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
empty	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
they	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Watkin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
cook	NULL
was	NULL
sent	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Watkin	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
waiting	NULL
anxiously	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
came	NULL
downstairs	NULL
now	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
anxiety	NULL
and	NULL
reproaches	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
exertion	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
was	NULL
fit	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
for	NULL
firmness	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
existed	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
fell	NULL
heavily	NULL
into	NULL
Emma	NULL
's	NULL
arms	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
carried	NULL
upstairs	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
remained	NULL
unconscious	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
incredibly	NULL
long	NULL
to	NULL
those	NULL
that	NULL
watched	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
,	NULL
hurriedly	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Watkin	NULL
got	NULL
some	NULL
explanation	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
playing	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
bed-room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
neither	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ladies	NULL
paid	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
only	NULL
understood	NULL
vaguely	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
talking	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
why	NULL
those	NULL
words	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
memory	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wanted	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
me	NULL
by	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
grows	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
ordered	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Two	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

VI	NULL
One	NULL
day	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
like	NULL
another	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
after	NULL
breakfast	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL
The	NULL
Times	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
shared	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
neighbours	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
ten	NULL
till	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
gardener	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Ellis	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Limes	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
it	NULL
remained	NULL
till	NULL
seven	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Brooks	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Manor	NULL
House	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
it	NULL
late	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
keeping	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
summer	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
jam	NULL
,	NULL
often	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
copy	NULL
to	NULL
cover	NULL
the	NULL
pots	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
paper	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
bonnet	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
the	NULL
shopping	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
accompanied	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Blackstable	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fishing	NULL
village	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
consisted	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
high	NULL
street	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
shops	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
bank	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
houses	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
coalship	NULL
owners	NULL
;	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
harbor	NULL
were	NULL
shabby	NULL
streets	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
lived	NULL
fishermen	NULL
and	NULL
poor	NULL
people	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
since	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
chapel	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
account	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
dissenting	NULL
ministers	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
she	NULL
stepped	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
meeting	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
fixed	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
pavement	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
scandal	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
resigned	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
three	NULL
chapels	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
High	NULL
Street	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
law	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
stepped	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
their	NULL
erection	NULL
.	NULL

Shopping	NULL
in	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
simple	NULL
matter	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
dissent	NULL
,	NULL
helped	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
parish	NULL
church	NULL
was	NULL
two	NULL
miles	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
common	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
deal	NULL
only	NULL
with	NULL
churchgoers	NULL
;	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
knew	NULL
perfectly	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
custom	NULL
might	NULL
make	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
tradesman	NULL
's	NULL
faith	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
butchers	NULL
who	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
deal	NULL
with	NULL
both	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
;	NULL
nor	NULL
were	NULL
they	NULL
satisfied	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
simple	NULL
plan	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
for	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
butcher	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sending	NULL
meat	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
constantly	NULL
threatened	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
was	NULL
sometimes	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
threat	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
wrong	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
carried	NULL
iniquity	NULL
further	NULL
and	NULL
actually	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
chapel	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
excellent	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
meat	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
often	NULL
stopped	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bank	NULL
to	NULL
deliver	NULL
a	NULL
message	NULL
to	NULL
Josiah	NULL
Graves	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
manager	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
choir-master	NULL
,	NULL
treasurer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
churchwarden	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
thin	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sallow	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
nose	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
extremely	NULL
old	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
kept	NULL
the	NULL
parish	NULL
accounts	NULL
,	NULL
arranged	NULL
the	NULL
treats	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
choir	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
schools	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
organ	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
parish	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
generally	NULL
considered	NULL
(	NULL
in	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
)	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
choir	NULL
he	NULL
led	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
in	NULL
Kent	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
any	NULL
ceremony	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
visit	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Bishop	NULL
for	NULL
confirmation	NULL
or	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Rural	NULL
Dean	NULL
to	NULL
preach	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Harvest	NULL
Thanksgiving	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
necessary	NULL
preparations	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
hesitation	NULL
in	NULL
doing	NULL
all	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
without	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
perfunctory	NULL
consultation	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
always	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
saved	NULL
trouble	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
resented	NULL
the	NULL
churchwarden	NULL
's	NULL
managing	NULL
ways	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
really	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
important	NULL
person	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
parish	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
constantly	NULL
told	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
Josiah	NULL
Graves	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
care	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
rap	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
knuckles	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
advised	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
with	NULL
Josiah	NULL
Graves	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
his	NULL
fault	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Vicar	NULL
,	NULL
finding	NULL
his	NULL
comfort	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
practice	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Christian	NULL
virtue	NULL
,	NULL
exercised	NULL
forbearance	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
revenged	NULL
himself	NULL
by	NULL
calling	NULL
the	NULL
churchwarden	NULL
Bismarck	NULL
behind	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
serious	NULL
quarrel	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
still	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
anxious	NULL
time	NULL
with	NULL
dismay	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Conservative	NULL
candidate	NULL
had	NULL
announced	NULL
his	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
addressing	NULL
a	NULL
meeting	NULL
at	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Josiah	NULL
Graves	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
arranged	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Mission	NULL
Hall	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
hoped	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
appeared	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
candidate	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
Josiah	NULL
Graves	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
chair	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
could	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
firm	NULL
views	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
respect	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
cloth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
ridiculous	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
churchwarden	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
chair	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
meeting	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
reminded	NULL
Josiah	NULL
Graves	NULL
that	NULL
parson	NULL
meant	NULL
person	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
vicar	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
person	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
parish	NULL
.	NULL

Josiah	NULL
Graves	NULL
answered	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
to	NULL
recognise	NULL
the	NULL
dignity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
politics	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
turn	NULL
he	NULL
reminded	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
Blessed	NULL
Saviour	NULL
had	NULL
enjoined	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
render	NULL
unto	NULL
Caesar	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
Caesar	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
this	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
replied	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
devil	NULL
could	NULL
quote	NULL
scripture	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
purpose	NULL
,	NULL
himself	NULL
had	NULL
sole	NULL
authority	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
Mission	NULL
Hall	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
chairman	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
refuse	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
political	NULL
meeting	NULL
.	NULL

Josiah	NULL
Graves	NULL
told	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
do	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
part	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
Wesleyan	NULL
Chapel	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
an	NULL
equally	NULL
suitable	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
Josiah	NULL
Graves	NULL
set	NULL
foot	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
heathen	NULL
temple	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
fit	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
churchwarden	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
Christian	NULL
parish	NULL
.	NULL

Josiah	NULL
Graves	NULL
thereupon	NULL
resigned	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
offices	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL
evening	NULL
sent	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
cassock	NULL
and	NULL
surplice	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Graves	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
kept	NULL
house	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
secretaryship	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Maternity	NULL
Club	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
provided	NULL
the	NULL
pregnant	NULL
poor	NULL
with	NULL
flannel	NULL
,	NULL
baby	NULL
linen	NULL
,	NULL
coals	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
five	NULL
shillings	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
master	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
soon	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Josiah	NULL
Graves	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
irritation	NULL
,	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
his	NULL
chief	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Graves	NULL
were	NULL
much	NULL
distressed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
quarrel	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
met	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
discreet	NULL
exchange	NULL
of	NULL
letters	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
their	NULL
minds	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
right	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
talked	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
morning	NULL
till	NULL
night	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
since	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
persuading	NULL
these	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
what	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
hearts	NULL
they	NULL
wanted	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
of	NULL
anxiety	NULL
a	NULL
reconciliation	NULL
was	NULL
effected	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
both	NULL
their	NULL
interests	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
ascribed	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
common	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
Redeemer	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
meeting	NULL
was	NULL
held	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Mission	NULL
Hall	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
was	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
chairman	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
and	NULL
Josiah	NULL
Graves	NULL
both	NULL
made	NULL
speeches	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
her	NULL
business	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
banker	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
generally	NULL
went	NULL
upstairs	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
chat	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
ladies	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
parish	NULL
matters	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
curate	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
bonnet	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Wilson	NULL
--	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Wilson	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
richest	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
five	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
his	NULL
cook	NULL
--	NULL
Philip	NULL
sat	NULL
demurely	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
stiff	NULL
parlour	NULL
,	NULL
used	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
visitors	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
busied	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
restless	NULL
movements	NULL
of	NULL
goldfish	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
bowl	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
windows	NULL
were	NULL
never	NULL
opened	NULL
except	NULL
to	NULL
air	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
stuffy	NULL
smell	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
mysterious	NULL
connection	NULL
with	NULL
banking	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
grocer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
continued	NULL
their	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
shopping	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
they	NULL
often	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
side	NULL
street	NULL
of	NULL
little	NULL
houses	NULL
,	NULL
mostly	NULL
of	NULL
wood	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
fishermen	NULL
dwelt	NULL
(	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
a	NULL
fisherman	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
doorstep	NULL
mending	NULL
his	NULL
nets	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
nets	NULL
hung	NULL
to	NULL
dry	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
doors	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
beach	NULL
,	NULL
shut	NULL
in	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
side	NULL
by	NULL
warehouses	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
stood	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
turbid	NULL
and	NULL
yellow	NULL
,	NULL
[	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
knows	NULL
what	NULL
thoughts	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
?	NULL
]	NULL

while	NULL
Philip	NULL
searched	NULL
for	NULL
flat	NULL
stones	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
ducks	NULL
and	NULL
drakes	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
slowly	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
looked	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
post	NULL
office	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
nodded	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Wigram	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
sat	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
window	NULL
sewing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
got	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

Dinner	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
o'clock	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
Monday	NULL
,	NULL
Tuesday	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Wednesday	NULL
it	NULL
consisted	NULL
of	NULL
beef	NULL
,	NULL
roast	NULL
,	NULL
hashed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
minced	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
Thursday	NULL
,	NULL
Friday	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Saturday	NULL
of	NULL
mutton	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
Sunday	NULL
they	NULL
ate	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
chickens	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
Philip	NULL
did	NULL
his	NULL
lessons	NULL
,	NULL
He	NULL
was	NULL
taught	NULL
Latin	NULL
and	NULL
mathematics	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
neither	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
French	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
French	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
ignorant	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
well	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
accompany	NULL
the	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
songs	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
sung	NULL
for	NULL
thirty	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

Uncle	NULL
William	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
curate	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
twelve	NULL
songs	NULL
by	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
sing	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
's	NULL
notice	NULL
whenever	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
often	NULL
sang	NULL
still	NULL
when	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
tea-party	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
few	NULL
people	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
Careys	NULL
cared	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
parties	NULL
consisted	NULL
always	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
curate	NULL
,	NULL
Josiah	NULL
Graves	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Wigram	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
tea	NULL
Miss	NULL
Graves	NULL
played	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
Mendelssohn	NULL
's	NULL
Songs	NULL
without	NULL
Words	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
sang	NULL
When	NULL
the	NULL
Swallows	NULL
Homeward	NULL
Fly	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
Trot	NULL
,	NULL
Trot	NULL
,	NULL
My	NULL
Pony	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
Careys	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
give	NULL
tea-parties	NULL
often	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
preparations	NULL
upset	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
their	NULL
guests	NULL
were	NULL
gone	NULL
they	NULL
felt	NULL
themselves	NULL
exhausted	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
preferred	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
tea	NULL
by	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
tea	NULL
they	NULL
played	NULL
backgammon	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
arranged	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
should	NULL
win	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
losing	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
cold	NULL
supper	NULL
at	NULL
eight	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
scrappy	NULL
meal	NULL
because	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
resented	NULL
getting	NULL
anything	NULL
ready	NULL
after	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
helped	NULL
to	NULL
clear	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
seldom	NULL
ate	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
stewed	NULL
fruit	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
slice	NULL
of	NULL
cold	NULL
meat	NULL
.	NULL

Immediately	NULL
after	NULL
supper	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
rang	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
for	NULL
prayers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
rebelled	NULL
against	NULL
being	NULL
undressed	NULL
by	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
establishing	NULL
his	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
dress	NULL
and	NULL
undress	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
nine	NULL
o'clock	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
eggs	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
plate	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
wrote	NULL
the	NULL
date	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
egg	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
number	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
then	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
plate-basket	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
arm	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
upstairs	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
clock	NULL
struck	NULL
ten	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
lamps	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
followed	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Philip	NULL
arrived	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
some	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
deciding	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
evening	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
his	NULL
bath	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
hot	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
boiler	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
persons	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
bath	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
bathroom	NULL
in	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
was	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Wilson	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
thought	NULL
ostentatious	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
bath	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
on	NULL
Monday	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
clean	NULL
.	NULL

Uncle	NULL
William	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
his	NULL
on	NULL
Saturday	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
tired	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
bath	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
Friday	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
had	NULL
hers	NULL
on	NULL
Thursday	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
reason	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
Saturday	NULL
were	NULL
naturally	NULL
indicated	NULL
for	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
keep	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
up	NULL
on	NULL
Saturday	NULL
night	NULL
:	NULL
what	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
cooking	NULL
on	NULL
Sunday	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
pastry	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
giving	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
his	NULL
bath	NULL
on	NULL
Saturday	NULL
night	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
clear	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bath	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
was	NULL
shy	NULL
about	NULL
bathing	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
sermon	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
insisted	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
clean	NULL
and	NULL
sweet	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
lord	NULL
's	NULL
Day	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
rather	NULL
go	NULL
than	NULL
be	NULL
put	NULL
upon	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
eighteen	NULL
years	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
expect	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
more	NULL
work	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
show	NULL
some	NULL
consideration	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
anyone	NULL
to	NULL
bath	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
could	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
bath	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
settled	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
sure	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
bath	NULL
himself	NULL
properly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
dirty	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Lord	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
abide	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
properly	NULL
washed	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
'd	NULL
work	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bone	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Saturday	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

VII	NULL
Sunday	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
crowded	NULL
with	NULL
incident	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
was	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
parish	NULL
who	NULL
worked	NULL
seven	NULL
days	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
household	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
earlier	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
lying	NULL
abed	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
parson	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
rest	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
remarked	NULL
as	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
knocked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
punctually	NULL
at	NULL
eight	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
took	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
longer	NULL
to	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
breakfast	NULL
at	NULL
nine	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
breathless	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
's	NULL
boots	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
to	NULL
warm	NULL
.	NULL

Prayers	NULL
were	NULL
longer	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
breakfast	NULL
more	NULL
substantial	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
breakfast	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
cut	NULL
thin	NULL
slices	NULL
of	NULL
bread	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
communion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
privileged	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
crust	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
sent	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
study	NULL
to	NULL
fetch	NULL
a	NULL
marble	NULL
paperweight	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
pressed	NULL
the	NULL
bread	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
thin	NULL
and	NULL
pulpy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
cut	NULL
into	NULL
small	NULL
squares	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
amount	NULL
was	NULL
regulated	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
bad	NULL
day	NULL
few	NULL
people	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
fine	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
many	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
few	NULL
stayed	NULL
for	NULL
communion	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
most	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
dry	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
walk	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
pleasant	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
fine	NULL
that	NULL
people	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
hurry	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
brought	NULL
the	NULL
communion	NULL
plate	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
safe	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pantry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
polished	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
chamois	NULL
leather	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
ten	NULL
the	NULL
fly	NULL
drove	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
boots	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
took	NULL
several	NULL
minutes	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
bonnet	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
voluminous	NULL
cloak	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
with	NULL
just	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
expression	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
as	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
become	NULL
an	NULL
early	NULL
Christian	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
led	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
arena	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
that	NULL
after	NULL
thirty	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
marriage	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
ready	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
on	NULL
Sunday	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
black	NULL
satin	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
colours	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
on	NULL
Sundays	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
wear	NULL
black	NULL
;	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
conspiracy	NULL
with	NULL
Miss	NULL
Graves	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
ventured	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
feather	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
pink	NULL
rose	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
bonnet	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
insisted	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
disappear	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
scarlet	NULL
woman	NULL
:	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
sighed	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
but	NULL
obeyed	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
step	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
egg	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
egg	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
women	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
regard	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
comfort	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
scolded	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
answered	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
everything	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
hurried	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
fetch	NULL
an	NULL
egg	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
beat	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL
of	NULL
sherry	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Vicar	NULL
swallowed	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
gulp	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
communion	NULL
plate	NULL
was	NULL
stowed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
set	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fly	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
The	NULL
Red	NULL
Lion	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
smell	NULL
of	NULL
stale	NULL
straw	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
drove	NULL
with	NULL
both	NULL
windows	NULL
closed	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
catch	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sexton	NULL
was	NULL
waiting	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
porch	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
communion	NULL
plate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
vestry	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
settled	NULL
themselves	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
pew	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
placed	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
sixpenny	NULL
bit	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
plate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
Philip	NULL
threepence	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
purpose	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
church	NULL
filled	NULL
up	NULL
gradually	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
service	NULL
began	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
grew	NULL
bored	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
sermon	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
fidgetted	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
put	NULL
a	NULL
gentle	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
reproachfully	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
regained	NULL
interest	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
final	NULL
hymn	NULL
was	NULL
sung	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Graves	NULL
passed	NULL
round	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
plate	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
everyone	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
Miss	NULL
Graves	NULL
'	NULL
pew	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
words	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
while	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
vestry	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
uncle	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
curate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Graves	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
surplices	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
remains	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
consecrated	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
eat	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
it	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
blasphemous	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
it	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
keen	NULL
appetite	NULL
relieved	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
duty	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
counted	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
consisted	NULL
of	NULL
pennies	NULL
,	NULL
sixpences	NULL
and	NULL
threepenny	NULL
bits	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
always	NULL
two	NULL
single	NULL
shillings	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
plate	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
by	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Graves	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
florin	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Graves	NULL
told	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
a	NULL
stranger	NULL
to	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
wondered	NULL
who	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Miss	NULL
Graves	NULL
had	NULL
observed	NULL
the	NULL
rash	NULL
act	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
stranger	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
married	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
drive	NULL
home	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
information	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
ask	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
subscription	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Additional	NULL
Curates	NULL
Society	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
asked	NULL
if	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
behaved	NULL
properly	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
remarked	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Wigram	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
mantle	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Cox	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
somebody	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Phillips	NULL
was	NULL
engaged	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
deserved	NULL
a	NULL
substantial	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
to	NULL
rest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
for	NULL
forty	NULL
winks	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
tea	NULL
at	NULL
five	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
ate	NULL
an	NULL
egg	NULL
to	NULL
support	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
evensong	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
might	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
service	NULL
through	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
hymns	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
walked	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
limped	NULL
along	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
walk	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
road	NULL
strangely	NULL
impressed	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
its	NULL
lights	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
,	NULL
coming	NULL
gradually	NULL
nearer	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
very	NULL
friendly	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
shy	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
little	NULL
by	NULL
little	NULL
grew	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
slip	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
and	NULL
walk	NULL
more	NULL
easily	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
protection	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
supper	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
's	NULL
slippers	NULL
were	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
footstool	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
side	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
the	NULL
shoe	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
misshapen	NULL
and	NULL
odd	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
tired	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
resist	NULL
when	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
undressed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
kissed	NULL
him	NULL
after	NULL
she	NULL
tucked	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

VIII	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
led	NULL
always	NULL
the	NULL
solitary	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
only	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
loneliness	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
greater	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
lived	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
friends	NULL
with	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
chubby	NULL
little	NULL
person	NULL
of	NULL
thirty-five	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
daughter	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fisherman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
at	NULL
eighteen	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
place	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
leaving	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
held	NULL
a	NULL
possible	NULL
marriage	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
rod	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
timid	NULL
heads	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
master	NULL
and	NULL
mistress	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
house	NULL
off	NULL
Harbour	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
evenings	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
stories	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
touched	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
imagination	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
narrow	NULL
alleys	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
harbour	NULL
grew	NULL
rich	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
romance	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
young	NULL
fancy	NULL
lent	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
evening	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
go	NULL
home	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
catch	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
evil	NULL
communications	NULL
corrupted	NULL
good	NULL
manners	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
disliked	NULL
the	NULL
fisher	NULL
folk	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
rough	NULL
,	NULL
uncouth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
chapel	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
comfortable	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
than	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
toys	NULL
and	NULL
played	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
aunt	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sorry	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
disorder	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
recognised	NULL
that	NULL
boys	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
untidy	NULL
she	NULL
preferred	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
mess	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
fidgeted	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
was	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
restless	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
high	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
thought	NULL
Philip	NULL
very	NULL
young	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
motherless	NULL
child	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
attempts	NULL
to	NULL
gain	NULL
his	NULL
affection	NULL
were	NULL
awkward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
shy	NULL
,	NULL
received	NULL
her	NULL
demonstrations	NULL
with	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
sullenness	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
mortified	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
his	NULL
shrill	NULL
voice	NULL
raised	NULL
in	NULL
laughter	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
suddenly	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
flushed	NULL
darkly	NULL
when	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
explained	NULL
the	NULL
joke	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
anything	NULL
amusing	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
smiled	NULL
with	NULL
constraint	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
seems	NULL
happier	NULL
with	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
than	NULL
with	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
William	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
sewing	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
One	NULL
can	NULL
see	NULL
he	NULL
's	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
badly	NULL
brought	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wants	NULL
licking	NULL
into	NULL
shape	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
Sunday	NULL
after	NULL
Philip	NULL
arrived	NULL
an	NULL
unlucky	NULL
incident	NULL
occurred	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
had	NULL
retired	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
after	NULL
dinner	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
snooze	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
irritable	NULL
mood	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

Josiah	NULL
Graves	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
had	NULL
objected	NULL
strongly	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
candlesticks	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
had	NULL
adorned	NULL
the	NULL
altar	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
them	NULL
second-hand	NULL
in	NULL
Tercanbury	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
they	NULL
looked	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Josiah	NULL
Graves	NULL
said	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
popish	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
taunt	NULL
that	NULL
always	NULL
aroused	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
Oxford	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
movement	NULL
which	NULL
ended	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
secession	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Established	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
Manning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
sympathy	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
Rome	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
willingly	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
service	NULL
more	NULL
ornate	NULL
than	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
usual	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
low-church	NULL
parish	NULL
of	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
secret	NULL
soul	NULL
he	NULL
yearned	NULL
for	NULL
processions	NULL
and	NULL
lighted	NULL
candles	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
drew	NULL
the	NULL
line	NULL
at	NULL
incense	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hated	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
protestant	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
called	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
Catholic	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
Papists	NULL
required	NULL
an	NULL
epithet	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
Roman	NULL
Catholic	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
was	NULL
Catholic	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
fullest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
noblest	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
term	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
pleased	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
shaven	NULL
face	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
priest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
youth	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
possessed	NULL
an	NULL
ascetic	NULL
air	NULL
which	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
often	NULL
related	NULL
that	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
holidays	NULL
in	NULL
Boulogne	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
holidays	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
for	NULL
economy	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
accompany	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
cure	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
invited	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
preach	NULL
a	NULL
sermon	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
dismissed	NULL
his	NULL
curates	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
married	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
decided	NULL
views	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
celibacy	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
unbeneficed	NULL
clergy	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
election	NULL
the	NULL
Liberals	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
garden	NULL
fence	NULL
in	NULL
large	NULL
blue	NULL
letters	NULL
:	NULL
This	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
Rome	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
angry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
threatened	NULL
to	NULL
prosecute	NULL
the	NULL
leaders	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Liberal	NULL
party	NULL
in	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
Josiah	NULL
Graves	NULL
said	NULL
would	NULL
induce	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
remove	NULL
the	NULL
candlesticks	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
altar	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
muttered	NULL
Bismarck	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
irritably	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
an	NULL
unexpected	NULL
noise	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
pulled	NULL
the	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
seated	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
bricks	NULL
around	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
built	NULL
a	NULL
monstrous	NULL
castle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
defect	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
foundation	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
brought	NULL
the	NULL
structure	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
noisy	NULL
ruin	NULL

Philip	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
with	NULL
frightened	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
habit	NULL

flushed	NULL
deeply	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

he	NULL
answered	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
it	NULL

but	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
wish	NULL
it	NULL

be	NULL
supposed	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL

consented	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL

He	NULL
hung	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
bricks	NULL
away	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
instinctive	NULL
disinclination	NULL
to	NULL
letting	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
tears	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
clenched	NULL
his	NULL
teeth	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
the	NULL
sobs	NULL
from	NULL
escaping	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arm-chair	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
pages	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
stood	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
vicarage	NULL
was	NULL
set	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
highroad	NULL
to	NULL
Tercanbury	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
one	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
semicircular	NULL
strip	NULL
of	NULL
lawn	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
horizon	NULL
green	NULL
fields	NULL
.	NULL

Sheep	NULL
were	NULL
grazing	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sky	NULL
was	NULL
forlorn	NULL
and	NULL
gray	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
infinitely	NULL
unhappy	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
tea	NULL

and	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
descended	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
answered	NULL

"	NULL
Philip	NULL
made	NULL
so	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
accurate	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
kept	NULL
awake	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
thoughts	NULL

and	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
listening	NULL
sullenly	NULL
,	NULL
reflected	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
noise	NULL
once	NULL

and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
slept	NULL
before	NULL
or	NULL
after	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
explanation	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
narrated	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
has	NULL
n't	NULL

he	NULL
finished	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
sure	NULL
you	NULL

said	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL

anxious	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL

not	NULL
seem	NULL
wickeder	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
reply	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
munching	NULL
his	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
power	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
prevented	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
making	NULL
any	NULL
expression	NULL

regret	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
ears	NULL
tingling	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
word	NULL
would	NULL
issue	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

said	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL

Tea	NULL
was	NULL
finished	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
surreptitiously	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
elaborately	NULL
ignored	NULL
him	NULL

When	NULL
Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
go	NULL
upstairs	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
ready	NULL
for	NULL
church	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL

got	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL

coat	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
came	NULL
downstairs	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
humiliation	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
placed	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
cheeks	NULL
reddened	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
silently	NULL
watching	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
broad	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
voluminous	NULL
cloak	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
off	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL

Philip	NULL
shook	NULL
his	NULL

decidedly	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

was	NULL
taken	NULL
aback	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
helplessly	NULL

Philip	NULL
broke	NULL
his	NULL
silence	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
gasped	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
so	NULL
savagely	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
start	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
chair	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
the	NULL
friendless	NULL
,	NULL
crippled	NULL
boy	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
eager	NULL
wish	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
love	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
barren	NULL
woman	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
clearly	NULL
God	NULL
's	NULL
will	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
childless	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
scarcely	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
little	NULL
children	NULL
sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
ached	NULL
so	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
tears	NULL
rose	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
rolled	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
watched	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
amazement	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
cried	NULL
without	NULL
restraint	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
Philip	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
crying	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sorry	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
silently	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
kiss	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
without	NULL
being	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
lady	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
small	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
black	NULL
satin	NULL
,	NULL
shrivelled	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
sallow	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
funny	NULL
corkscrew	NULL
curls	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
boy	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
lap	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
around	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
wept	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
would	NULL
break	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
her	NULL
tears	NULL
were	NULL
partly	NULL
tears	NULL
of	NULL
happiness	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
strangeness	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

love	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
suffer	NULL

IX	NULL
On	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
Sunday	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
his	NULL
preparations	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
upstairs	NULL

Philip	NULL
asked	NULL

Mr.	NULL

looked	NULL
out	NULL

window	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
cold	NULL

took	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
drew	NULL
up	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
chair	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
table	NULL
--	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
some	NULL
more	NULL
coals	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
cheerful	NULL
blaze	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
loosened	NULL
his	NULL
collar	NULL
,	NULL
arranged	NULL
the	NULL
cushions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
settled	NULL
himself	NULL
comfortably	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
thinking	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
chilly	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
rug	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
legs	NULL
and	NULL
tucked	NULL
it	NULL
round	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
drew	NULL
the	NULL
blinds	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
offend	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
closed	NULL
them	NULL
already	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
on	NULL
tiptoe	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Vicar	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
peace	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
today	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
asleep	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
snored	NULL
softly	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
Sixth	NULL
Sunday	NULL
after	NULL
Epiphany	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
collect	NULL
began	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
:	NULL
O	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
blessed	NULL
Son	NULL
was	NULL
manifested	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
destroy	NULL
the	NULL
works	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
devil	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
us	NULL
the	NULL
sons	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
heirs	NULL
of	NULL
Eternal	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
through	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
no	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
saying	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
aloud	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
unknown	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
construction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sentence	NULL
was	NULL
strange	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
two	NULL
lines	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
his	NULL
attention	NULL
was	NULL
constantly	NULL
wandering	NULL
:	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
fruit	NULL
trees	NULL
trained	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
twig	NULL
beat	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
windowpane	NULL
;	NULL
sheep	NULL
grazed	NULL
stolidly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
knots	NULL
inside	NULL
his	NULL
brain	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
panic	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
by	NULL
tea-time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
on	NULL
whispering	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
quickly	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
merely	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
them	NULL
parrot-like	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
memory	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
sleep	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
four	NULL
o'clock	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
wide	NULL
awake	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
downstairs	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
hear	NULL
Philip	NULL
his	NULL
collect	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
make	NULL
no	NULL
mistakes	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
uncle	NULL
then	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
pleased	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
sound	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
stop	NULL
suddenly	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
heart	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
jump	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
quietly	NULL
slipped	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
front-door	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
walked	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
window	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
cautiously	NULL
looked	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
sitting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
chair	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
buried	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sobbing	NULL
desperately	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
convulsive	NULL
movement	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
was	NULL
frightened	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
struck	NULL
her	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
collected	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
cry	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
calmness	NULL
was	NULL
some	NULL
instinctive	NULL
shame	NULL
of	NULL
showing	NULL
his	NULL
feelings	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
hid	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
weep	NULL
.	NULL

Without	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
disliked	NULL
being	NULL
wakened	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
sat	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
disentangled	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
rug	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
legs	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL

"	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
perplexity	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
extraordinarily	NULL
helpless	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL

"	NULL
Very	NULL

"	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
study	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
collect	NULL
books	NULL
was	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
's	NULL
only	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
Tercanbury	NULL
without	NULL
spending	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
second-hand	NULL
shop	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
brought	NULL
back	NULL
four	NULL
or	NULL
five	NULL
musty	NULL
volumes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
read	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
lost	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
reading	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
the	NULL
pages	NULL
,	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
illustrations	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
illustrated	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
mend	NULL
the	NULL
bindings	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
welcomed	NULL
wet	NULL
days	NULL
because	NULL
on	NULL
them	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
stay	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
without	NULL
pangs	NULL
of	NULL
conscience	NULL
and	NULL
spend	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
with	NULL
white	NULL
of	NULL
egg	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
glue-pot	NULL
,	NULL
patching	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
Russia	NULL
leather	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
battered	NULL
quarto	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
many	NULL
volumes	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
travels	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
steel	NULL
engravings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
quickly	NULL
found	NULL
two	NULL
which	NULL
described	NULL
Palestine	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
coughed	NULL
elaborately	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
compose	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
humiliated	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
tears	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
rattled	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
handle	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
poring	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
prayer-book	NULL
,	NULL
hiding	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
crying	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
collect	NULL
yet	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
trust	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
oddly	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
learn	NULL
it	NULL
by	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
gasp	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
need	NULL
n't	NULL

I	NULL
've	NULL

my	NULL
lap	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
'll	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
slipped	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
and	NULL
limped	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
round	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Look	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
where	NULL
our	NULL
blessed	NULL
Lord	NULL
was	NULL
born	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
showed	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
Eastern	NULL
town	NULL
with	NULL
flat	NULL
roofs	NULL
and	NULL
cupolas	NULL
and	NULL
minarets	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
foreground	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
palm-trees	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
under	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
resting	NULL
two	NULL
Arabs	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
camels	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
passed	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
picture	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
the	NULL
houses	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
loose	NULL
habiliments	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
nomads	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Read	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
says	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
even	NULL
voice	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
opposite	NULL
page	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
romantic	NULL
narrative	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
Eastern	NULL
traveller	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
thirties	NULL
,	NULL
pompous	NULL
maybe	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
fragrant	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
emotion	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
East	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
generation	NULL
that	NULL
followed	NULL
Byron	NULL
and	NULL
Chateaubriand	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
Philip	NULL
interrupted	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
another	NULL
picture	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

When	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
rose	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
her	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
cloth	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
book	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
hurried	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
illustrations	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
difficulty	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
induced	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
book	NULL
down	NULL
for	NULL
tea	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL
his	NULL
horrible	NULL
struggle	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
collect	NULL
by	NULL
heart	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL
his	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
raining	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
book	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
gave	NULL
it	NULL
him	NULL
joyfully	NULL
.	NULL

Talking	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
future	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
both	NULL
desired	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
orders	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
eagerness	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
book	NULL
which	NULL
described	NULL
places	NULL
hallowed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
Jesus	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
sign	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
addressed	NULL
itself	NULL
naturally	NULL
to	NULL
holy	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
more	NULL
books	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
study	NULL
,	NULL
showed	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
shelf	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
illustrated	NULL
works	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
chose	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
one	NULL
that	NULL
dealt	NULL
with	NULL
Rome	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
greedily	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pictures	NULL
led	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
amusement	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
page	NULL
before	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
page	NULL
after	NULL
each	NULL
engraving	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
he	NULL
lost	NULL
all	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
toys	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
near	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
out	NULL
books	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
impression	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
Eastern	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
his	NULL
chief	NULL
amusement	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
which	NULL
described	NULL
the	NULL
Levant	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
with	NULL
excitement	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
pictures	NULL
of	NULL
mosques	NULL
and	NULL
rich	NULL
palaces	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
on	NULL
Constantinople	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
peculiarly	NULL
stirred	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
Hall	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Thousand	NULL
Columns	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Byzantine	NULL
cistern	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
popular	NULL
fancy	NULL
had	NULL
endowed	NULL
with	NULL
fantastic	NULL
vastness	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
legend	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
told	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
boat	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
moored	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
entrance	NULL
to	NULL
tempt	NULL
the	NULL
unwary	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
traveller	NULL
venturing	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
seen	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Philip	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL
the	NULL
boat	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
through	NULL
one	NULL
pillared	NULL
alley	NULL
after	NULL
another	NULL
or	NULL
came	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
strange	NULL
mansion	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
fortune	NULL
befell	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
hit	NULL
upon	NULL
Lane	NULL
's	NULL
translation	NULL
of	NULL
The	NULL
Thousand	NULL
Nights	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
Night	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
captured	NULL
first	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
illustrations	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
start	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
stories	NULL
that	NULL
dealt	NULL
with	NULL
magic	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
those	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
forgot	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
called	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

Insensibly	NULL
he	NULL
formed	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
delightful	NULL
habit	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
reading	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
thus	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
providing	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
refuge	NULL
from	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
distress	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
either	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
creating	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
an	NULL
unreal	NULL
world	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
world	NULL
of	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
a	NULL
source	NULL
of	NULL
bitter	NULL
disappointment	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
brain	NULL
was	NULL
precocious	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
uncle	NULL
and	NULL
aunt	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
occupied	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
neither	NULL
worried	NULL
nor	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
noise	NULL
,	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
trouble	NULL
themselves	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
books	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
little	NULL
he	NULL
forgot	NULL
the	NULL
odd	NULL
lots	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
another	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
cheap	NULL
.	NULL

Haphazard	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
sermons	NULL
and	NULL
homilies	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
travels	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
lives	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Saints	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Fathers	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
histories	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
novels	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
these	NULL
Philip	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
discovered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
chose	NULL
them	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
titles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
was	NULL
The	NULL
Lancashire	NULL
Witches	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
The	NULL
Admirable	NULL
Crichton	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
many	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

Whenever	NULL
he	NULL
started	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
solitary	NULL
travellers	NULL
riding	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
brink	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
desperate	NULL
ravine	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
safe	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
summer	NULL
was	NULL
come	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
gardener	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
sailor	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
hammock	NULL
and	NULL
fixed	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
branches	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
weeping	NULL
willow	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
here	NULL
for	NULL
long	NULL
hours	NULL
he	NULL
lay	NULL
,	NULL
hidden	NULL
from	NULL
anyone	NULL
who	NULL
might	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
,	NULL
reading	NULL
,	NULL
reading	NULL
passionately	NULL
.	NULL

Time	NULL
passed	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
July	NULL
;	NULL
August	NULL
came	NULL
:	NULL
on	NULL
Sundays	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
was	NULL
crowded	NULL
with	NULL
strangers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
collection	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
offertory	NULL
often	NULL
amounted	NULL
to	NULL
two	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
nor	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
much	NULL
during	NULL
this	NULL
period	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
disliked	NULL
strange	NULL
faces	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
visitors	NULL
from	NULL
London	NULL
with	NULL
aversion	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
house	NULL
opposite	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
for	NULL
six	NULL
weeks	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
two	NULL
little	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
sent	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
if	NULL
Philip	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
play	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
returned	NULL
a	NULL
polite	NULL
refusal	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
corrupted	NULL
by	NULL
little	NULL
boys	NULL
from	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
preserved	NULL
from	NULL
contamination	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
infant	NULL
Samuel	NULL
.	NULL

X	NULL
The	NULL
Careys	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
their	NULL
minds	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
King	NULL
's	NULL
School	NULL
at	NULL
Tercanbury	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
neighbouring	NULL
clergy	NULL
sent	NULL
their	NULL
sons	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
united	NULL
by	NULL
long	NULL
tradition	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Cathedral	NULL
:	NULL
its	NULL
headmaster	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
honorary	NULL
Canon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
past	NULL
headmaster	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
.	NULL

Boys	NULL
were	NULL
encouraged	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
aspire	NULL
to	NULL
Holy	NULL
Orders	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
education	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
might	NULL
prepare	NULL
an	NULL
honest	NULL
lad	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
God	NULL
's	NULL
service	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
preparatory	NULL
school	NULL
was	NULL
attached	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
arranged	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
Tercanbury	NULL
one	NULL
Thursday	NULL
afternoon	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
September	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
day	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
excited	NULL
and	NULL
rather	NULL
frightened	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
little	NULL
of	NULL
school	NULL
life	NULL
but	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
stories	NULL
of	NULL
The	NULL
Boy	NULL
's	NULL
Own	NULL
Paper	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
also	NULL
read	NULL
Eric	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
Little	NULL
by	NULL
Little	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
at	NULL
Tercanbury	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
sick	NULL
with	NULL
apprehension	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
drive	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
sat	NULL
pale	NULL
and	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
high	NULL
brick	NULL
wall	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
gave	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
prison	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
door	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
opened	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
ringing	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
clumsy	NULL
,	NULL
untidy	NULL
man	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
fetched	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
tin	NULL
trunk	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
play-box	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
shown	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
massive	NULL
,	NULL
ugly	NULL
furniture	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
chairs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
suite	NULL
were	NULL
placed	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
forbidding	NULL
rigidity	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
headmaster	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
's	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
like	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
'll	NULL
see	NULL
for	NULL
yourself	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
another	NULL
pause	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
wondered	NULL
why	NULL
the	NULL
headmaster	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
Philip	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL
and	NULL
spoke	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Tell	NULL
him	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
club-foot	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
could	NULL
speak	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
burst	NULL
open	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
swept	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
Philip	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
gigantic	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
over	NULL
six	NULL
feet	NULL
high	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
broad	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
enormous	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
red	NULL
beard	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
talked	NULL
loudly	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
jovial	NULL
manner	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
aggressive	NULL
cheerfulness	NULL
struck	NULL
terror	NULL
in	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
took	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
small	NULL
hand	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
young	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
school	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
shouted	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
reddened	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
no	NULL
word	NULL
to	NULL
answer	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
old	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Nine	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
must	NULL
say	NULL
sir	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
expect	NULL
you	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
lot	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
headmaster	NULL
bellowed	NULL
cheerily	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
confidence	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
tickle	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
rough	NULL
fingers	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
shy	NULL
and	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
,	NULL
squirmed	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
touch	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
dormitory	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
'll	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Only	NULL
eight	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
in	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
feel	NULL
so	NULL
strange	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
opened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Watson	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
woman	NULL
with	NULL
black	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
neatly	NULL
parted	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
curiously	NULL
thick	NULL
lips	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
round	NULL
nose	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
large	NULL
and	NULL
black	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
singular	NULL
coldness	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
appearance	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
seldom	NULL
spoke	NULL
and	NULL
smiled	NULL
more	NULL
seldom	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
husband	NULL
introduced	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
gave	NULL
Philip	NULL
a	NULL
friendly	NULL
push	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
This	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
Helen	NULL
,	NULL
His	NULL

.	NULL
"	NULL

Without	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
she	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
Philip	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
speaking	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
headmaster	NULL
asked	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
books	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
working	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Vicar	NULL
of	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
by	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
's	NULL
boisterous	NULL
heartiness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL

with	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
'll	NULL

He	NULL
'll	NULL

Wo	NULL
n't	NULL

?	NULL
"	NULL

Without	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
answer	NULL
from	NULL
Philip	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
man	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
bellow	NULL
of	NULL
laughter	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
kissed	NULL
Philip	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
forehead	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL
along	NULL

young	NULL

"	NULL
shouted	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL

He	NULL
swept	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
with	NULL
giant	NULL
strides	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
hurriedly	NULL
limped	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
bare	NULL
room	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
tables	NULL
that	NULL
ran	NULL
along	NULL
its	NULL
whole	NULL
length	NULL
;	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
wooden	NULL
forms	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Nobody	NULL

said	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL

"	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
led	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
play-ground	NULL
with	NULL
high	NULL
brick	NULL
walls	NULL
on	NULL
three	NULL
sides	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
fourth	NULL
side	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
iron	NULL
railing	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
you	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
vast	NULL
lawn	NULL
and	NULL
beyond	NULL
this	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
buildings	NULL
of	NULL
King	NULL
's	NULL
School	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
small	NULL
boy	NULL
was	NULL
wandering	NULL
disconsolately	NULL

kicking	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
gravel	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Hulloa	NULL

shouted	NULL
Mr.	NULL

"	NULL
When	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL
turn	NULL
up	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
small	NULL
boy	NULL
came	NULL
forward	NULL
and	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Here	NULL

a	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
headmaster	NULL
glared	NULL
amicably	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
children	NULL

filling	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
fear	NULL

the	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
this	NULL
answer	NULL
would	NULL
cause	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
awkwardness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Venning	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
turned	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
facetiousness	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
wash	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
indignantly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
washerwoman	NULL
then	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
wash	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
little	NULL
boy	NULL
crowed	NULL
with	NULL
delight	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
success	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
dialectic	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
caught	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL
your	NULL
foot	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
instinctively	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
withdraw	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
sight	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hid	NULL
it	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
whole	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
club-foot	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL
get	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL

.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
little	NULL
boy	NULL
accompanied	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sharp	NULL
kick	NULL
on	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
shin	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
expect	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
guard	NULL
against	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pain	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
great	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
gasp	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
greater	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
surprise	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
Venning	NULL
kicked	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
eye	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
was	NULL
smaller	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
in	NULL
The	NULL
Boy	NULL
's	NULL
Own	NULL
Paper	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mean	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
hit	NULL
anyone	NULL
smaller	NULL
than	NULL
yourself	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
nursing	NULL
his	NULL
shin	NULL
a	NULL
third	NULL
boy	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
tormentor	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
were	NULL
talking	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
grew	NULL
hot	NULL
and	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
others	NULL
arrived	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
their	NULL
doings	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
holidays	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
wonderful	NULL
cricket	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
played	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
new	NULL
boys	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
these	NULL
presently	NULL
Philip	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
talking	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
shy	NULL
and	NULL
nervous	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
himself	NULL
pleasant	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
asked	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
many	NULL
questions	NULL
and	NULL
answered	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
quite	NULL
willingly	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
boy	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
play	NULL
cricket	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
answered	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
club-foot	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
quickly	NULL
and	NULL
reddened	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
an	NULL
unseemly	NULL
question	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
shy	NULL
to	NULL
apologise	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
awkwardly	NULL
.	NULL

XI	NULL
Next	NULL
morning	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
clanging	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bell	NULL
awoke	NULL
Philip	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
his	NULL
cubicle	NULL
in	NULL
astonishment	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
a	NULL
voice	NULL
sang	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL
awake	NULL
,	NULL
Singer	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
partitions	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cubicle	NULL
were	NULL
of	NULL
polished	NULL
pitch-pine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
green	NULL
curtain	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
those	NULL
days	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
ventilation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
were	NULL
closed	NULL
except	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
dormitory	NULL
was	NULL
aired	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
knelt	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
his	NULL
prayers	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
shivered	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
taught	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
prayers	NULL
were	NULL
more	NULL
acceptable	NULL
to	NULL
God	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
nightshirt	NULL
than	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dressed	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
surprise	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
realise	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
creature	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
God	NULL
who	NULL
appreciated	NULL
the	NULL
discomfort	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
worshippers	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
washed	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
baths	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
fifty	NULL
boarders	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
each	NULL
boy	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
bath	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
washing	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
basin	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
wash-stand	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
furniture	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
cubicle	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boys	NULL
chatted	NULL
gaily	NULL
while	NULL
they	NULL
dressed	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
ears	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
another	NULL
bell	NULL
sounded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
ran	NULL
downstairs	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
took	NULL
their	NULL
seats	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
forms	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
long	NULL
tables	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
school-room	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
,	NULL
followed	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
servants	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
read	NULL
prayers	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
impressive	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
supplications	NULL
thundered	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
loud	NULL
voice	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
threats	NULL
personally	NULL
addressed	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
listened	NULL
with	NULL
anxiety	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
read	NULL
a	NULL
chapter	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Bible	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
servants	NULL
trooped	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
untidy	NULL
youth	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL
large	NULL
pots	NULL
of	NULL
tea	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
journey	NULL
immense	NULL
dishes	NULL
of	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
squeamish	NULL
appetite	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
thick	NULL
slabs	NULL
of	NULL
poor	NULL
butter	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bread	NULL
turned	NULL
his	NULL
stomach	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
other	NULL
boys	NULL
scraping	NULL
it	NULL
off	NULL
and	NULL
followed	NULL
their	NULL
example	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
all	NULL
had	NULL
potted	NULL
meats	NULL
and	NULL
such	NULL
like	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
play-boxes	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
had	NULL
'	NULL
extras	NULL
,	NULL
'	NULL
eggs	NULL
or	NULL
bacon	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
profit	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
whether	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
these	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
replied	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
boys	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
spoilt	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
quite	NULL
agreed	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
considered	NULL
nothing	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
for	NULL
growing	NULL
lads	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
some	NULL
parents	NULL
,	NULL
unduly	NULL
pampering	NULL
their	NULL
offspring	NULL
,	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
'	NULL
extras	NULL
'	NULL
gave	NULL
boys	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
consideration	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
breakfast	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
wandered	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
play-ground	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
the	NULL
day-boys	NULL
were	NULL
gradually	NULL
assembling	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
sons	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
local	NULL
clergy	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
officers	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Depot	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
manufacturers	NULL
or	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
business	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
town	NULL
possessed	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
a	NULL
bell	NULL
rang	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
trooped	NULL
into	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
consisted	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
,	NULL
long	NULL
room	NULL
at	NULL
opposite	NULL
ends	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
two	NULL
under-masters	NULL
conducted	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
and	NULL
third	NULL
forms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
smaller	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
leading	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
used	NULL
by	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
taught	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
form	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
attach	NULL
the	NULL
preparatory	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
senior	NULL
school	NULL
these	NULL
three	NULL
classes	NULL
were	NULL
known	NULL
officially	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
speech	NULL
days	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
reports	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
upper	NULL
,	NULL
middle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lower	NULL
second	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
master	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
red-faced	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
Rice	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
jolly	NULL
manner	NULL
with	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
passed	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
to	NULL
eleven	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
let	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
'	NULL
rest	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
whole	NULL
school	NULL
rushed	NULL
noisily	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
play-ground	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
new	NULL
boys	NULL
were	NULL
told	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
stationed	NULL
themselves	NULL
along	NULL
opposite	NULL
walls	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
Pig	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Middle	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
boys	NULL
ran	NULL
from	NULL
wall	NULL
to	NULL
wall	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
boys	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
them	NULL
:	NULL
when	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
seized	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
mystic	NULL
words	NULL
said	NULL
--	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
three	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
pig	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
prisoner	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
sides	NULL
,	NULL
helped	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
free	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
running	NULL
past	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
limp	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
chance	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
runners	NULL
,	NULL
taking	NULL
their	NULL
opportunity	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
straight	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
he	NULL
covered	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
brilliant	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
imitating	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
clumsy	NULL
run	NULL
.	NULL

Other	NULL
boys	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
laugh	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
copied	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
ran	NULL
round	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
limping	NULL
grotesquely	NULL
,	NULL
screaming	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
treble	NULL
voices	NULL
with	NULL
shrill	NULL
laughter	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
lost	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
delight	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
new	NULL
amusement	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
choked	NULL
with	NULL
helpless	NULL
merriment	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
tripped	NULL
Philip	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
fell	NULL
,	NULL
heavily	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
fell	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cut	NULL
his	NULL
knee	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
laughed	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
louder	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
boy	NULL
pushed	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
behind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
fallen	NULL
again	NULL
if	NULL
another	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
caught	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
game	NULL
was	NULL
forgotten	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
entertainment	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
deformity	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
invented	NULL
an	NULL
odd	NULL
,	NULL
rolling	NULL
limp	NULL
that	NULL
struck	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
as	NULL
supremely	NULL
ridiculous	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
several	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
and	NULL
rolled	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
laughter	NULL
:	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
completely	NULL
scared	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
why	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
laughing	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
breathe	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
frightened	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
stupidly	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
ran	NULL
round	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
mimicking	NULL
and	NULL
laughing	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
shouted	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
and	NULL
catch	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
move	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
run	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
using	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
strength	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
crying	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
rang	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
trooped	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
knee	NULL
was	NULL
bleeding	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dusty	NULL
and	NULL
dishevelled	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
some	NULL
minutes	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Rice	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
control	NULL
his	NULL
form	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
excited	NULL
still	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
strange	NULL
novelty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
furtively	NULL
looking	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tucked	NULL
them	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
bench	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
football	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
stopped	NULL
Philip	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
out	NULL
after	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
you	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
play	NULL
football	NULL
,	NULL
Carey	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
blushed	NULL
self-consciously	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Very	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
'd	NULL
better	NULL
go	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
can	NULL
walk	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
boys	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
charge	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Rice	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
and	NULL
seeing	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
changed	NULL
,	NULL
asked	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
said	NULL
I	NULL
need	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
boys	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
curiously	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
shame	NULL
came	NULL
over	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
without	NULL
answering	NULL
.	NULL

Others	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
reply	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
's	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
club-foot	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
see	NULL

"	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Rice	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
young	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
taken	NULL
his	NULL
degree	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
before	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
suddenly	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
instinct	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
beg	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
's	NULL
pardon	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
shy	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
gruff	NULL
and	NULL
loud	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
waiting	NULL
about	NULL

Get	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

Some	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
started	NULL
and	NULL
those	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
left	NULL
now	NULL
set	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
groups	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
'd	NULL
better	NULL
come	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
Carey	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
master	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
guessed	NULL
the	NULL
kindness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
sob	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
throat	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
go	NULL
very	NULL
fast	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
go	NULL
very	NULL
slow	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
master	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
red-faced	NULL
,	NULL
commonplace	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
said	NULL
a	NULL
gentle	NULL
word	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
suddenly	NULL
felt	NULL
less	NULL
unhappy	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
undressing	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
Singer	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
cubicle	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
in	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
let	NULL
's	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
your	NULL
foot	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
answered	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
jumped	NULL
into	NULL
bed	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
say	NULL
no	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL

said	NULL
Singer	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL
on	NULL

Mason	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
cubicle	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
he	NULL
slipped	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
made	NULL
for	NULL
Philip	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
tear	NULL
the	NULL
bed-clothes	NULL
off	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
them	NULL
tightly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
leave	NULL
me	NULL
alone	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
cried	NULL
.	NULL

Singer	NULL
seized	NULL
a	NULL
brush	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
beat	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
hands	NULL
clenched	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
blanket	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
cried	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
show	NULL
us	NULL
your	NULL
foot	NULL
quietly	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

In	NULL
desperation	NULL
Philip	NULL
clenched	NULL
his	NULL
fist	NULL
and	NULL
hit	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
who	NULL
tormented	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
disadvantage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
seized	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
'll	NULL
break	NULL
my	NULL
arm	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Stop	NULL
still	NULL
then	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
your	NULL
foot	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
sob	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
gasp	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
arm	NULL
another	NULL
wrench	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pain	NULL
was	NULL
unendurable	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
foot	NULL
.	NULL

Singer	NULL
still	NULL
kept	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
wrist	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
curiously	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
deformity	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL
beastly	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Mason	NULL
.	NULL

Another	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ugh	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
disgust	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
rum	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Singer	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
it	NULL
hard	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
touched	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
tip	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
forefinger	NULL
,	NULL
cautiously	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
they	NULL
heard	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
's	NULL
heavy	NULL
tread	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
threw	NULL
the	NULL
clothes	NULL
back	NULL
on	NULL
Philip	NULL
and	NULL
dashed	NULL
like	NULL
rabbits	NULL
into	NULL
their	NULL
cubicles	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
dormitory	NULL
.	NULL

Raising	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
tiptoe	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
rod	NULL
that	NULL
bore	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
curtain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
into	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cubicles	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
little	NULL
boys	NULL
were	NULL
safely	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Singer	NULL
called	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
his	NULL
teeth	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pillow	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
sobbing	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
inaudible	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
crying	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
caused	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
humiliation	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
foot	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
rage	NULL
at	NULL
himself	NULL
because	NULL
,	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
the	NULL
torture	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
foot	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
accord	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
misery	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
childish	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
unhappiness	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
no	NULL
particular	NULL
reason	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
cold	NULL
morning	NULL
when	NULL
Emma	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
beside	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
once	NULL
since	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
the	NULL
warmth	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
body	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
around	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
wretched	NULL
days	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
awake	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
tears	NULL
dried	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
unhappy	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
was	NULL
alive	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Emma	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
up	NULL
presently	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
fell	NULL
asleep	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
awoke	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
clanging	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bell	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
thing	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
saw	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
curtain	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
cubicle	NULL
.	NULL

XII	NULL
As	NULL
time	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
deformity	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
interest	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
accepted	NULL
like	NULL
one	NULL
boy	NULL
's	NULL
red	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
another	NULL
's	NULL
unreasonable	NULL
corpulence	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
meanwhile	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
horribly	NULL
sensitive	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
ran	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
limp	NULL
more	NULL
conspicuous	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
adopted	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
walk	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
club-foot	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
attract	NULL
notice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
constantly	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
reference	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Because	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
join	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
games	NULL
which	NULL
other	NULL
boys	NULL
played	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
life	NULL
remained	NULL
strange	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
interested	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
outside	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
doings	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
barrier	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
they	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
fault	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
play	NULL
football	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
them	NULL
understand	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
talkativeness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
gradually	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
biggest	NULL
boy	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
dormitory	NULL
,	NULL
Singer	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
dislike	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
small	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
hard	NULL
treatment	NULL
.	NULL

About	NULL
half-way	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
term	NULL
a	NULL
mania	NULL
ran	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
game	NULL
called	NULL
Nibs	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
game	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
played	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
table	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
form	NULL
with	NULL
steel	NULL
pens	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
push	NULL
your	NULL
nib	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
finger-nail	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
your	NULL
opponent	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
manoeuvred	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
this	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
nib	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
yours	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
this	NULL
result	NULL
was	NULL
achieved	NULL
you	NULL
breathed	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ball	NULL
of	NULL
your	NULL
thumb	NULL
,	NULL
pressed	NULL
it	NULL
hard	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
nibs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
able	NULL
then	NULL
to	NULL
lift	NULL
them	NULL
without	NULL
dropping	NULL
either	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
nibs	NULL
became	NULL
yours	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
nothing	NULL
was	NULL
seen	NULL
but	NULL
boys	NULL
playing	NULL
this	NULL
game	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
skilful	NULL
acquired	NULL
vast	NULL
stores	NULL
of	NULL
nibs	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
gambling	NULL
,	NULL
forbade	NULL
the	NULL
game	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
confiscated	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
nibs	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
'	NULL
possession	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
adroit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
heart	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
winning	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
fingers	NULL
itched	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
football	NULL
field	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
shop	NULL
and	NULL
bought	NULL
a	NULL
pennyworth	NULL
of	NULL
J	NULL
pens	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
carried	NULL
them	NULL
loose	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
and	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
feeling	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
Singer	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Singer	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
nibs	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
kept	NULL
back	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
large	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
Jumbo	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
unconquerable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
resist	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
Js	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
disadvantage	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
small	NULL
nibs	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
adventurous	NULL
disposition	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
risk	NULL
;	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
Singer	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
allow	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
refuse	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
played	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
game	NULL
now	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
thrill	NULL
of	NULL
excitement	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
lost	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
small	NULL
nibs	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Singer	NULL
was	NULL
jubilant	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
time	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
chance	NULL
the	NULL
Jumbo	NULL
slipped	NULL
round	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
push	NULL
his	NULL
J	NULL
across	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
crowed	NULL
with	NULL
triumph	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
doing	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
from	NULL
Singer	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
neither	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
forbidden	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
that	NULL
idiotic	NULL
game	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
fast	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
frightened	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
fright	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
exultation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
swished	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
hurt	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
boast	NULL
about	NULL
afterwards	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
study	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
headmaster	NULL
turned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
followed	NULL
him	NULL
side	NULL
by	NULL
side	NULL
Singer	NULL
whispered	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
We	NULL
're	NULL
in	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
pointed	NULL
to	NULL
Singer	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Bend	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
quiver	NULL
at	NULL
each	NULL
stroke	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
cry	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Three	NULL
more	NULL
followed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
'll	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

Get	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Singer	NULL
stood	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
tears	NULL
were	NULL
streaming	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
stepped	NULL
forward	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL

you	NULL

You	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL

Go	NULL
away	NULL

both	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL

and	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
naughty	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
school-room	NULL
a	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
mysterious	NULL
way	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
happening	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
set	NULL
upon	NULL
Singer	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
with	NULL
eager	NULL
questions	NULL
.	NULL

Singer	NULL
faced	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
red	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
and	NULL
marks	NULL
of	NULL
tears	NULL
still	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
pointed	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
got	NULL
off	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
cripple	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
angrily	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
stood	NULL
silent	NULL
and	NULL
flushed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
contempt	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
many	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL
get	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

one	NULL
boy	NULL
asked	NULL
Singer	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
hurt	NULL
"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
ask	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
Nibs	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
jolly	NULL
nice	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
risk	NULL
anything	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
ask	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Did	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
quickly	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
foot	NULL
and	NULL
tripped	NULL
Philip	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
rather	NULL
unsteady	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
fell	NULL
heavily	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Cripple	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Singer	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
term	NULL
he	NULL
tormented	NULL
Philip	NULL
cruelly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
Philip	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
small	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
being	NULL
friendly	NULL
and	NULL
jolly	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
abased	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
knife	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
though	NULL
Singer	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
knife	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
placated	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
,	NULL
driven	NULL
beyond	NULL
endurance	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
hit	NULL
and	NULL
kicked	NULL
the	NULL
bigger	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Singer	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
stronger	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
helpless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
forced	NULL
after	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
torture	NULL
to	NULL
beg	NULL
his	NULL
pardon	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
rankled	NULL
with	NULL
Philip	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
the	NULL
humiliation	NULL
of	NULL
apologies	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
wrung	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
pain	NULL
greater	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
bear	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
what	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
worse	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
seemed	NULL
no	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
wretchedness	NULL
;	NULL
Singer	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
eleven	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
upper	NULL
school	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thirteen	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
live	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
tormentor	NULL
from	NULL
whom	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
escape	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
happy	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
working	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
often	NULL
there	NULL
recurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
queer	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
its	NULL
misery	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
awake	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
little	NULL
bed	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

XIII	NULL
Two	NULL
years	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
twelve	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
form	NULL
,	NULL
within	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
places	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
Christmas	NULL
when	NULL
several	NULL
boys	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
leaving	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
senior	NULL
school	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
head	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
collection	NULL
of	NULL
prizes	NULL
,	NULL
worthless	NULL
books	NULL
on	NULL
bad	NULL
paper	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
gorgeous	NULL
bindings	NULL
decorated	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
arms	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
:	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
had	NULL
freed	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
bullying	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
unhappy	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
fellows	NULL
forgave	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
success	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
deformity	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
After	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
jolly	NULL
easy	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
prizes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
they	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
there	NULL
's	NULL
nothing	NULL
he	NULL
CAN	NULL
do	NULL
but	NULL
swat	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
his	NULL
early	NULL
terror	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
loud	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
headmaster	NULL
's	NULL
heavy	NULL
hand	NULL
was	NULL
laid	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
shoulder	NULL
Philip	NULL
discerned	NULL
vaguely	NULL
the	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
caress	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
memory	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
more	NULL
useful	NULL
for	NULL
scholastic	NULL
achievements	NULL
than	NULL
mental	NULL
power	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
expected	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
preparatory	NULL
school	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
scholarship	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
very	NULL
self-conscious	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
new-born	NULL
child	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
realise	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
body	NULL
is	NULL
more	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
than	NULL
surrounding	NULL
objects	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
will	NULL
play	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
toes	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
belong	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
rattle	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
side	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
degrees	NULL
,	NULL
through	NULL
pain	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
understands	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
experiences	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
kind	NULL
are	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
individual	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
here	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
everyone	NULL
becomes	NULL
equally	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
body	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
separate	NULL
and	NULL
complete	NULL
organism	NULL
,	NULL
everyone	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
become	NULL
equally	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
complete	NULL
and	NULL
separate	NULL
personality	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
apartness	NULL
from	NULL
others	NULL
comes	NULL
to	NULL
most	NULL
with	NULL
puberty	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
developed	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
degree	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
individual	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
fellows	NULL
noticeable	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
individual	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
little	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
bee	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
hive	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
lucky	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL

for	NULL

have	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
happiness	NULL
:	NULL
their	NULL
activities	NULL
are	NULL
shared	NULL
by	NULL
all	NULL

and	NULL
their	NULL
pleasures	NULL

only	NULL
pleasures	NULL

Whit-Monday	NULL

or	NULL
from	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
because	NULL

them	NULL

Philip	NULL
passed	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
innocence	NULL
of	NULL
childhood	NULL
to	NULL
bitter	NULL
consciousness	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
ridicule	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
club-foot	NULL
had	NULL
excited	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
circumstances	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
case	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
peculiar	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
apply	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
the	NULL
ready-made	NULL
rules	NULL
which	NULL
acted	NULL
well	NULL
enough	NULL
in	NULL
ordinary	NULL
affairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
many	NULL
books	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
filled	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
with	NULL
ideas	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
half	NULL
understood	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
more	NULL
scope	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
.	NULL

Beneath	NULL
his	NULL
painful	NULL
shyness	NULL
something	NULL
was	NULL
growing	NULL
up	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
obscurely	NULL
he	NULL
realised	NULL
his	NULL
personality	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
odd	NULL
surprises	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
afterwards	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
sea	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
called	NULL
Luard	NULL
between	NULL
whom	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
a	NULL
friendship	NULL
had	NULL
arisen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
playing	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
school-room	NULL
,	NULL
Luard	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
perform	NULL
some	NULL
trick	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
ebony	NULL
pen-holder	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
play	NULL

giddy	NULL
ox	NULL

Philip	NULL

'll	NULL
only	NULL

it	NULL

"	NULL

I	NULL

But	NULL
no	NULL
sooner	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
's	NULL
mouth	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
pen-holder	NULL
snapped	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

Luard	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
with	NULL
dismay	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
awfully	NULL
sorry	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
tears	NULL
rolled	NULL
down	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
cheeks	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL

what	NULL

with	NULL
surprise	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL

said	NULL
Philip	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL

Philip	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
pieces	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pen-holder	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
restrain	NULL
his	NULL
sobs	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
utterly	NULL
miserable	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
quite	NULL
well	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
the	NULL
pen-holder	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
holidays	NULL
at	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
and	NULL
twopence	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
invent	NULL
that	NULL
pathetic	NULL
story	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
as	NULL
unhappy	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
true	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pious	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
religious	NULL
tone	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
conscience	NULL
very	NULL
sensitive	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
absorbed	NULL
insensibly	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Tempter	NULL
was	NULL
ever	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
watch	NULL
to	NULL
gain	NULL
his	NULL
immortal	NULL
soul	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
truthful	NULL
than	NULL
most	NULL
boys	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
told	NULL
a	NULL
lie	NULL
without	NULL
suffering	NULL
from	NULL
remorse	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
over	NULL
this	NULL
incident	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
distressed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Luard	NULL
and	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
invention	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
he	NULL
dreaded	NULL
humiliation	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
anything	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
hugged	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
agonising	NULL
joy	NULL
of	NULL
humiliating	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Glory	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
got	NULL
any	NULL
further	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
satisfied	NULL
his	NULL
conscience	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
comfortable	NULL
method	NULL
of	NULL
expressing	NULL
his	NULL
repentance	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Almighty	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
genuinely	NULL
affected	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
tears	NULL
that	NULL
flowed	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
grubby	NULL
cheeks	NULL
were	NULL
real	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
accident	NULL
of	NULL
association	NULL
there	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
scene	NULL
when	NULL
Emma	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
for	NULL
crying	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
going	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
good-bye	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Misses	NULL
Watkin	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
grief	NULL
and	NULL
pity	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

XIV	NULL
Then	NULL
a	NULL
wave	NULL
of	NULL
religiosity	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

Bad	NULL
language	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
heard	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
nastinesses	NULL
of	NULL
small	NULL
boys	NULL
were	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
with	NULL
hostility	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
bigger	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
lords	NULL
temporal	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Middle	NULL
Ages	NULL
,	NULL
used	NULL
the	NULL
strength	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
arms	NULL
to	NULL
persuade	NULL
those	NULL
weaker	NULL
than	NULL
themselves	NULL
to	NULL
virtuous	NULL
courses	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
restless	NULL
mind	NULL
avid	NULL
for	NULL
new	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
became	NULL
very	NULL
devout	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
heard	NULL
soon	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
join	NULL
a	NULL
Bible	NULL
League	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
for	NULL
particulars	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
consisted	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
form	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
filled	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
applicant	NULL
's	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
school	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
solemn	NULL
declaration	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
signed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
read	NULL
a	NULL
set	NULL
portion	NULL
of	NULL
Holy	NULL
Scripture	NULL
every	NULL
night	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
request	NULL
for	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
crown	NULL
;	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
explained	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
demanded	NULL
partly	NULL
to	NULL
prove	NULL
the	NULL
earnestness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
applicant	NULL
's	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
member	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
League	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
partly	NULL
to	NULL
cover	NULL
clerical	NULL
expenses	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
duly	NULL
sent	NULL
the	NULL
papers	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
return	NULL
received	NULL
a	NULL
calendar	NULL
worth	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
penny	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
set	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
appointed	NULL
passage	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
read	NULL
each	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
sheet	NULL
of	NULL
paper	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
picture	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Good	NULL
Shepherd	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
lamb	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
decoratively	NULL
framed	NULL
in	NULL
red	NULL
lines	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
prayer	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
before	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
evening	NULL
he	NULL
undressed	NULL
as	NULL
quickly	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
task	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
gas	NULL
was	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
read	NULL
industriously	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
always	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
criticism	NULL
,	NULL
stories	NULL
of	NULL
cruelty	NULL
,	NULL
deceit	NULL
,	NULL
ingratitude	NULL
,	NULL
dishonesty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
low	NULL
cunning	NULL
.	NULL

Actions	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
excited	NULL
his	NULL
horror	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
reading	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
without	NULL
comment	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
committed	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
direct	NULL
inspiration	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
method	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
League	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
alternate	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Old	NULL
Testament	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
New	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
night	NULL
Philip	NULL
came	NULL
across	NULL
these	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
Jesus	NULL
Christ	NULL
:	NULL
If	NULL
ye	NULL
have	NULL
faith	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
doubt	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
ye	NULL
shall	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
done	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fig-tree	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
also	NULL
if	NULL
ye	NULL
shall	NULL
say	NULL
unto	NULL
this	NULL
mountain	NULL
,	NULL
Be	NULL
thou	NULL
removed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
thou	NULL
cast	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
whatsoever	NULL
ye	NULL
shall	NULL
ask	NULL
in	NULL
prayer	NULL
,	NULL
believing	NULL
,	NULL
ye	NULL
shall	NULL
receive	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
particular	NULL
impression	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
that	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
Sunday	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Canon	NULL
in	NULL
residence	NULL
chose	NULL
them	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
text	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
sermon	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
if	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
this	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
impossible	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
of	NULL
King	NULL
's	NULL
School	NULL
sit	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
choir	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
pulpit	NULL
stands	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
transept	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
preacher	NULL
's	NULL
back	NULL
is	NULL
almost	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
distance	NULL
also	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
great	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
needs	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
voice	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
elocution	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
himself	NULL
heard	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
choir	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
long	NULL
usage	NULL
the	NULL
Canons	NULL
of	NULL
Tercanbury	NULL
are	NULL
chosen	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
learning	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
qualities	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
of	NULL
use	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cathedral	NULL
church	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
text	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
them	NULL
so	NULL
short	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
clearly	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
ears	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
seemed	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
personal	NULL
application	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
through	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sermon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
getting	NULL
into	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
pages	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Gospel	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
implicitly	NULL
everything	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
print	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
already	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Bible	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
said	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
quite	NULL
clearly	NULL
often	NULL
mysteriously	NULL
meant	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
mind	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
Christmas	NULL
holidays	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
after	NULL
supper	NULL
and	NULL
prayers	NULL
were	NULL
just	NULL
finished	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
was	NULL
counting	NULL
the	NULL
eggs	NULL
that	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
and	NULL
writing	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
one	NULL
the	NULL
date	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
stood	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
and	NULL
pretended	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
listlessly	NULL
the	NULL
pages	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Bible	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
Uncle	NULL
William	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
passage	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
does	NULL
it	NULL
really	NULL
mean	NULL
that	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
finger	NULL
against	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
across	NULL
it	NULL
accidentally	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
spectacles	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
holding	NULL
The	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
Times	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
damp	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
press	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
always	NULL
aired	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
passage	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
about	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
faith	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
remove	NULL
mountains	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
it	NULL
says	NULL
so	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Bible	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL

,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
gently	NULL
,	NULL
taking	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
plate-basket	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
answer	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
faith	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
D'you	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL

you	NULL
really	NULL

move	NULL
mountains	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
By	NULL
the	NULL
grace	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
,	NULL
say	NULL
good-night	NULL
to	NULL
your	NULL
uncle	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
not	NULL
wanting	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
a	NULL
mountain	NULL
tonight	NULL
,	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
allowed	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
kissed	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
forehead	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
and	NULL
preceded	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
upstairs	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
information	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
little	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
icy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
shivered	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
nightshirt	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
prayers	NULL
were	NULL
more	NULL
pleasing	NULL
to	NULL
God	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
them	NULL
under	NULL
conditions	NULL
of	NULL
discomfort	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
coldness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
feet	NULL
were	NULL
an	NULL
offering	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Almighty	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
tonight	NULL
he	NULL
sank	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
;	NULL
buried	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
prayed	NULL
to	NULL
God	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
might	NULL
that	NULL
He	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
his	NULL
club-foot	NULL
whole	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
small	NULL
thing	NULL
beside	NULL
the	NULL
moving	NULL
of	NULL
mountains	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
God	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
if	NULL
He	NULL
wished	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
faith	NULL
was	NULL
complete	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
finishing	NULL
his	NULL
prayers	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
request	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
fixed	NULL
a	NULL
date	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
miracle	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Thy	NULL
loving	NULL
mercy	NULL
and	NULL
goodness	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
Thy	NULL
will	NULL

make	NULL
my	NULL
foot	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
I	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
his	NULL
petition	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
formula	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
repeated	NULL
it	NULL
later	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
short	NULL
pause	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
always	NULL
made	NULL
after	NULL
prayers	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
rose	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
shivering	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
nightshirt	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
once	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
with	NULL
eagerness	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
holidays	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
laughed	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
astonishment	NULL
when	NULL

down	NULL

after	NULL
breakfast	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
hurry	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
buy	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
boots	NULL

At	NULL
school	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
astounded	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Hulloa	NULL
,	NULL
Carey	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
have	NULL
you	NULL
done	NULL
with	NULL
your	NULL
foot	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
answer	NULL
casually	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
natural	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
football	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
leaped	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
himself	NULL
running	NULL
,	NULL
running	NULL
,	NULL
faster	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
boys	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Easter	NULL
term	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
sports	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
in	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
races	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
rather	NULL
fancied	NULL
himself	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
hurdles	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
splendid	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
like	NULL
everyone	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
curiously	NULL
by	NULL
new	NULL
boys	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
deformity	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
baths	NULL
in	NULL
summer	NULL
to	NULL
need	NULL
incredible	NULL
precautions	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
undressing	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
hide	NULL
his	NULL
foot	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
prayed	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
doubts	NULL
assailed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
confident	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
school	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
tremulous	NULL
with	NULL
excitement	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
snow	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
had	NULL
allowed	NULL
herself	NULL
the	NULL
unaccustomed	NULL
luxury	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fire	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
bed-room	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
little	NULL
room	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
cold	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
fingers	NULL
were	NULL
numb	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
great	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
undoing	NULL
his	NULL
collar	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
teeth	NULL
chattered	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
idea	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
do	NULL
something	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
to	NULL
attract	NULL
the	NULL
attention	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
rug	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
kneel	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bare	NULL
boards	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
nightshirt	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
softness	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
displease	NULL
his	NULL
Maker	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
off	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
his	NULL
prayers	NULL
naked	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
bed	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
cold	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
soundly	NULL
that	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
shake	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hot	NULL
water	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
drew	NULL
the	NULL
curtains	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
remembered	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
miracle	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
joy	NULL
and	NULL
gratitude	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
first	NULL
instinct	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
feel	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
whole	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
doubt	NULL
the	NULL
goodness	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
foot	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
toes	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
right	NULL
foot	NULL
he	NULL
just	NULL
touched	NULL
his	NULL
left	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
passed	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
limped	NULL
downstairs	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
for	NULL
prayers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
breakfast	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
very	NULL
quiet	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
presently	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
's	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
breakfast	NULL
he	NULL
'll	NULL
have	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Philip	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
that	NULL
always	NULL
irritated	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
called	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
wool-gathering	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Supposing	NULL
you	NULL
'd	NULL
asked	NULL
God	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
really	NULL
believed	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
happen	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
moving	NULL
a	NULL
mountain	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
faith	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
happen	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
it	NULL
mean	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
a	NULL
funny	NULL
boy	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
asked	NULL
about	NULL
moving	NULL
mountains	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
ago	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
would	NULL
just	NULL
mean	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
got	NULL
faith	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
answered	NULL
Uncle	NULL
William	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
accepted	NULL
the	NULL
explanation	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
God	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
cured	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
really	NULL
believe	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
believe	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
given	NULL
God	NULL
enough	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
asked	NULL
Him	NULL
for	NULL
nineteen	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
his	NULL
prayer	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
fixed	NULL
upon	NULL
Easter	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
His	NULL
Son	NULL
's	NULL
glorious	NULL
resurrection	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
God	NULL
in	NULL
His	NULL
happiness	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
mercifully	NULL
inclined	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
Philip	NULL
added	NULL
other	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
attaining	NULL
his	NULL
desire	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
wish	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
moon	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
dappled	NULL
horse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
shooting	NULL
stars	NULL
;	NULL
during	NULL
exeat	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
chicken	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
broke	NULL
the	NULL
lucky	NULL
bone	NULL
with	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
and	NULL
wished	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
foot	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
whole	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
appealing	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
to	NULL
gods	NULL
older	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
race	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
God	NULL
of	NULL
Israel	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
bombarded	NULL
the	NULL
Almighty	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
prayer	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
odd	NULL
times	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
whenever	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
identical	NULL
words	NULL
always	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
important	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
his	NULL
request	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
terms	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
presently	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
also	NULL
his	NULL
faith	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
great	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
resist	NULL
the	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
assailed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
experience	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
rule	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
ever	NULL
has	NULL
faith	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
salt	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
nurse	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
:	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
catch	NULL
any	NULL
bird	NULL
by	NULL
putting	NULL
salt	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
tail	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
once	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
bag	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
Kensington	NULL
Gardens	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
get	NULL
near	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
salt	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
bird	NULL
's	NULL
tail	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
Easter	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
struggle	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
dull	NULL
resentment	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
for	NULL
taking	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
text	NULL
which	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
moving	NULL
of	NULL
mountains	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
that	NULL
said	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
and	NULL
meant	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
playing	NULL
a	NULL
practical	NULL
joke	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

XV	NULL
The	NULL
King	NULL

School	NULL
at	NULL
Tercanbury	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thirteen	NULL
,	NULL
prided	NULL
itself	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL
antiquity	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
traced	NULL
its	NULL
origin	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
abbey	NULL
school	NULL

founded	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
Conquest	NULL

where	NULL

been	NULL
reorganised	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
officers	NULL
of	NULL
King	NULL
Henry	NULL

thus	NULL
acquired	NULL
its	NULL

suggested	NULL
that	NULL

the	NULL

feeling	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
less	NULL

study	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
classics	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
German	NULL
nor	NULL
chemistry	NULL
was	NULL
taught	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
French	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
form-masters	NULL

they	NULL
could	NULL
keep	NULL

better	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
foreigner	NULL

,	NULL
since	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
grammar	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
Frenchman	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
unimportant	NULL
that	NULL
none	NULL

got	NULL
a	NULL
cup	NULL

coffee	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

Boulogne	NULL
unless	NULL
the	NULL
waiter	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL

Geography	NULL
was	NULL
taught	NULL
chiefly	NULL
by	NULL
making	NULL
boys	NULL
draw	NULL
maps	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
favourite	NULL
occupation	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
dealt	NULL

it	NULL

possible	NULL

great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
drawing	NULL
the	NULL
Andes	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
Apennines	NULL

The	NULL
masters	NULL
,	NULL
graduates	NULL
of	NULL
Oxford	NULL
or	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
ordained	NULL
and	NULL
unmarried	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
by	NULL
chance	NULL
they	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
by	NULL
accepting	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
smaller	NULL
livings	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
disposal	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Chapter	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
had	NULL
cared	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
refined	NULL
society	NULL
of	NULL
Tercanbury	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
cavalry	NULL
depot	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
martial	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
ecclesiastical	NULL
tone	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
monotony	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
country	NULL
rectory	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
now	NULL
all	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
middle	NULL
age	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
headmaster	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
married	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
conducted	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
till	NULL
age	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
retired	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
rewarded	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
living	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
under-masters	NULL
could	NULL
hope	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
honorary	NULL
Canonry	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
before	NULL
Philip	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
change	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
obvious	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Fleming	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
headmaster	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
century	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
become	NULL
too	NULL
deaf	NULL
to	NULL
continue	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
glory	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
livings	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
outskirts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
fell	NULL
vacant	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
stipend	NULL
of	NULL
six	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Chapter	NULL
offered	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
manner	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
imply	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
high	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
retire	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
nurse	NULL
his	NULL
ailments	NULL
comfortably	NULL
on	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
income	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
curates	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
hoped	NULL
for	NULL
preferment	NULL
told	NULL
their	NULL
wives	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
scandalous	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
parish	NULL
that	NULL
needed	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
strong	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
energetic	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
fellow	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
parochial	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
feathered	NULL
his	NULL
nest	NULL
already	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
mutterings	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
unbeneficed	NULL
clergy	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
reach	NULL
the	NULL
ears	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cathedral	NULL
Chapter	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
parishioners	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
therefore	NULL
nobody	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
opinion	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Wesleyans	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Baptists	NULL
both	NULL
had	NULL
chapels	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Fleming	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
disposed	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
became	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
successor	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
contrary	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
traditions	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lower-masters	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
chosen	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
common-room	NULL
was	NULL
unanimous	NULL
in	NULL
desiring	NULL
the	NULL
election	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
,	NULL
headmaster	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
preparatory	NULL
school	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
be	NULL
described	NULL
as	NULL
already	NULL
a	NULL
master	NULL
of	NULL
King	NULL
's	NULL
School	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
known	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
danger	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
nuisance	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
Chapter	NULL
sprang	NULL
a	NULL
surprise	NULL
on	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
chose	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
called	NULL
Perkins	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
nobody	NULL
knew	NULL
who	NULL
Perkins	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
favourably	NULL
impressed	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
shock	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
Perkins	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
son	NULL
of	NULL
Perkins	NULL
the	NULL
linendraper	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Fleming	NULL
informed	NULL
the	NULL
masters	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
manner	NULL
showed	NULL
his	NULL
consternation	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
were	NULL
dining	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
ate	NULL
their	NULL
meal	NULL
almost	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
reference	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
servants	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
names	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
present	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
occasion	NULL
are	NULL
unimportant	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
known	NULL
to	NULL
generations	NULL
of	NULL
school-boys	NULL
as	NULL
Sighs	NULL
,	NULL
Tar	NULL
,	NULL
Winks	NULL
,	NULL
Squirts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Pat	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
all	NULL
knew	NULL
Tom	NULL
Perkins	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
thing	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
remembered	NULL
him	NULL
quite	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
,	NULL
dark	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
untidy	NULL
black	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
large	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
gipsy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
day-boy	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
scholarship	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
endowment	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
education	NULL
had	NULL
cost	NULL
him	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
brilliant	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
every	NULL
Speech-Day	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
loaded	NULL
with	NULL
prizes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
their	NULL
show-boy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
remembered	NULL
now	NULL
bitterly	NULL
their	NULL
fear	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
some	NULL
scholarship	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
larger	NULL
public	NULL
schools	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
pass	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Fleming	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
linendraper	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
--	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
,	NULL
Perkins	NULL
and	NULL
Cooper	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
St.	NULL
Catherine	NULL
's	NULL
Street	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
hoped	NULL
Tom	NULL
would	NULL
remain	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Oxford	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
school	NULL
was	NULL
Perkins	NULL
and	NULL
Cooper	NULL
's	NULL
best	NULL
customer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
too	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
required	NULL
assurance	NULL
.	NULL

Tom	NULL
Perkins	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
triumph	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
finest	NULL
classical	NULL
scholar	NULL
that	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Fleming	NULL
remembered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
took	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
valuable	NULL
scholarship	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
another	NULL
at	NULL
Magdalen	NULL
and	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
brilliant	NULL
career	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
University	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
school	NULL
magazine	NULL
recorded	NULL
the	NULL
distinctions	NULL
he	NULL
achieved	NULL
year	NULL
after	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
his	NULL
double	NULL
first	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Fleming	NULL
himself	NULL
wrote	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
eulogy	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
page	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
greater	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
welcomed	NULL
his	NULL
success	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
Perkins	NULL
and	NULL
Cooper	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
upon	NULL
evil	NULL
days	NULL
:	NULL
Cooper	NULL
drank	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
fish	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
Tom	NULL
Perkins	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
degree	NULL
the	NULL
linendrapers	NULL
filed	NULL
their	NULL
petition	NULL
in	NULL
bankruptcy	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
due	NULL
course	NULL
Tom	NULL
Perkins	NULL
took	NULL
Holy	NULL
Orders	NULL
and	NULL
entered	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
profession	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
admirably	NULL
suited	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
an	NULL
assistant	NULL
master	NULL
at	NULL
Wellington	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
at	NULL
Rugby	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL
welcoming	NULL
his	NULL
success	NULL
at	NULL
other	NULL
schools	NULL
and	NULL
serving	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
leadership	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

Tar	NULL
had	NULL
frequently	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
lines	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Squirts	NULL
had	NULL
boxed	NULL
his	NULL
ears	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
imagine	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
Chapter	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
mistake	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
forget	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
son	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bankrupt	NULL
linendraper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
alcoholism	NULL
of	NULL
Cooper	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
increase	NULL
the	NULL
disgrace	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
understood	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Dean	NULL
had	NULL
supported	NULL
his	NULL
candidature	NULL
with	NULL
zeal	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
the	NULL
Dean	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
ask	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
would	NULL
the	NULL
pleasant	NULL
little	NULL
dinners	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
precincts	NULL
ever	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
when	NULL
Tom	NULL
Perkins	NULL
sat	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
what	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
depot	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
really	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
expect	NULL
officers	NULL
and	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
themselves	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
incalculable	NULL
harm	NULL
.	NULL

Parents	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
dissatisfied	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
surprised	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
wholesale	NULL
withdrawals	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
indignity	NULL
of	NULL
calling	NULL
him	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
!	NULL

The	NULL
masters	NULL
thought	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
protest	NULL
of	NULL
sending	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
resignations	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
body	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
uneasy	NULL
fear	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
accepted	NULL
with	NULL
equanimity	NULL
restrained	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
prepare	NULL
ourselves	NULL
for	NULL
changes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Sighs	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
conducted	NULL
the	NULL
fifth	NULL
form	NULL
for	NULL
five	NULL
and	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
with	NULL
unparalleled	NULL
incompetence	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
reassured	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Fleming	NULL
invited	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
luncheon	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
thirty-two	NULL
,	NULL
tall	NULL
and	NULL
lean	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
wild	NULL
and	NULL
unkempt	NULL
look	NULL
they	NULL
remembered	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
ill-made	NULL
and	NULL
shabby	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
untidily	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
black	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
plainly	NULL
never	NULL
learned	NULL
to	NULL
brush	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
fell	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
forehead	NULL
with	NULL
every	NULL
gesture	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
movement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
pushed	NULL
it	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
moustache	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
beard	NULL
which	NULL
came	NULL
high	NULL
up	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
almost	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
cheek-bones	NULL
,	NULL
He	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
masters	NULL
quite	NULL
easily	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
parted	NULL
from	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
before	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
delighted	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
unconscious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
strangeness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
and	NULL
appeared	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
notice	NULL
any	NULL
oddness	NULL
in	NULL
being	NULL
addressed	NULL
as	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
bade	NULL
them	NULL
good-bye	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
masters	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
remarked	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
allowing	NULL
himself	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
his	NULL
train	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
round	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
cheerfully	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
distinct	NULL
embarrassment	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
wondered	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
tactless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
worse	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Fleming	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
heard	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
wife	NULL
shouted	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
ear	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
wants	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
round	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
old	NULL
shop	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Only	NULL
Tom	NULL
Perkins	NULL
was	NULL
unconscious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
humiliation	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
party	NULL
felt	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL

It	NULL

conversation	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
monologue	NULL

Perkins	NULL
had	NULL
talked	NULL
incessantly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
very	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
flow	NULL
of	NULL
easy	NULL
words	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
,	NULL
resonant	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
odd	NULL
little	NULL
laugh	NULL
which	NULL
showed	NULL
his	NULL
white	NULL
teeth	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
followed	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
difficulty	NULL

for	NULL

mind	NULL
darted	NULL
from	NULL
subject	NULL
to	NULL
subject	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
connection	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
catch	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
pedagogics	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
enough	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
of	NULL
modern	NULL
theories	NULL
in	NULL
Germany	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
and	NULL
received	NULL
with	NULL
misgiving	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
classics	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
Greece	NULL
,	NULL

he	NULL
discoursed	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
spent	NULL
a	NULL

could	NULL

how	NULL
that	NULL
helped	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL

sounded	NULL

them	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
him	NULL
compare	NULL
Lord	NULL
Beaconsfield	NULL
with	NULL
Alcibiades	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Gladstone	NULL
and	NULL
Home	NULL
Rule	NULL

They	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

Their	NULL
hearts	NULL
sank	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
German	NULL
philosophy	NULL

fiction	NULL

They	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL

was	NULL
too	NULL
tall	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
strength	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
movements	NULL
were	NULL
slow	NULL
and	NULL
languid	NULL

He	NULL
gave	NULL
an	NULL
impression	NULL
of	NULL
lassitude	NULL

and	NULL
his	NULL
nickname	NULL
was	NULL
eminently	NULL
appropriate	NULL

He	NULL
's	NULL

said	NULL
Winks	NULL

Enthusiasm	NULL
was	NULL
ill-bred	NULL

Enthusiasm	NULL
was	NULL
ungentlemanly	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL

with	NULL
its	NULL
braying	NULL
trumpets	NULL

its	NULL

XVI	NULL
A	NULL
year	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
masters	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
places	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
many	NULL
changes	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
place	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
their	NULL
stubborn	NULL
resistance	NULL
,	NULL
none	NULL
the	NULL

formidable	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
concealed	NULL
under	NULL

apparent	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
fall	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL

head	NULL
's	NULL

.	NULL

Though	NULL
the	NULL
form-masters	NULL
still	NULL
taught	NULL
French	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
another	NULL
master	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
degree	NULL
of	NULL
doctor	NULL
of	NULL
philology	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
University	NULL
of	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
record	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
spent	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
French	NULL
lycee	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
teach	NULL
French	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
upper	NULL
forms	NULL
and	NULL
German	NULL
to	NULL
anyone	NULL
who	NULL
cared	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
Greek	NULL
.	NULL

Another	NULL
master	NULL
was	NULL
engaged	NULL
to	NULL
teach	NULL
mathematics	NULL
more	NULL
systematically	NULL
than	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
found	NULL
necessary	NULL
hitherto	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
was	NULL
ordained	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
revolution	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
arrived	NULL
the	NULL
older	NULL
masters	NULL
received	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
distrust	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
laboratory	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
fitted	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
army	NULL
classes	NULL
were	NULL
instituted	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
was	NULL
changing	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
heaven	NULL
only	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
further	NULL
projects	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
turned	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
untidy	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
school	NULL
was	NULL
small	NULL
as	NULL
public	NULL
schools	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
two	NULL
hundred	NULL
boarders	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
difficult	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
larger	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
huddled	NULL
up	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
Cathedral	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
precincts	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
exception	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
masters	NULL
lodged	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
occupied	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
cathedral	NULL
clergy	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
room	NULL
for	NULL
building	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
devised	NULL
an	NULL
elaborate	NULL
scheme	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
obtain	NULL
sufficient	NULL
space	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
double	NULL
its	NULL
present	NULL
size	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
attract	NULL
boys	NULL
from	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
thrown	NULL
in	NULL
contact	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Kentish	NULL
lads	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
sharpen	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
wits	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
against	NULL
all	NULL
our	NULL
traditions	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Sighs	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Mr.	NULL

made	NULL
the	NULL
suggestion	NULL

him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
've	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
told	NULL
the	NULL
form-master	NULL
before	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
talked	NULL
nonsense	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
meditating	NULL
an	NULL
acid	NULL
reply	NULL

in	NULL
which	NULL
perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
insert	NULL
a	NULL
veiled	NULL
reference	NULL
to	NULL
hosiery	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
impetuous	NULL
way	NULL
attacked	NULL
him	NULL
outrageously	NULL

The	NULL

gasped	NULL

should	NULL
he	NULL
marry	NULL

was	NULL

the	NULL

lay	NULL

would	NULL
much	NULL
sooner	NULL

All	NULL

wanted	NULL
now	NULL
was	NULL
peace	NULL

quietness	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL

looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL

his	NULL
dark	NULL

bright	NULL
eyes	NULL

and	NULL

Mr.	NULL

laws	NULL
of	NULL
Caius	NULL
Gracchus	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
anything	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
agrarian	NULL
troubles	NULL
in	NULL
Ireland	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
all	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
about	NULL
Ireland	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Dublin	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Liffey	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
I	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
'd	NULL
ever	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
General	NULL
Gordon	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
horrid	NULL
fact	NULL
was	NULL
disclosed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
head	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
mania	NULL
for	NULL
general	NULL
information	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
doubts	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
utility	NULL
of	NULL
examinations	NULL
on	NULL
subjects	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
crammed	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
common	NULL
sense	NULL
.	NULL

Sighs	NULL
grew	NULL
more	NULL
worried	NULL
every	NULL
month	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
would	NULL
ask	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
fix	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
marriage	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
the	NULL
attitude	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
adopted	NULL
towards	NULL
classical	NULL
literature	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
scholar	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
engaged	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
work	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
tradition	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
writing	NULL
a	NULL
treatise	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
in	NULL
Latin	NULL
literature	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
flippantly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
pastime	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
great	NULL
importance	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
billiards	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
engaged	NULL
his	NULL
leisure	NULL
but	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
considered	NULL
with	NULL
seriousness	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Squirts	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
master	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Middle	NULL
Third	NULL
,	NULL
grew	NULL
more	NULL
ill-tempered	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
form	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
entering	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Rev.	NULL
B.	NULL
B.	NULL
Gordon	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
by	NULL
nature	NULL
ill-suited	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
schoolmaster	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
impatient	NULL
and	NULL
choleric	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
account	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
only	NULL
small	NULL
boys	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
lost	NULL
all	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
self-control	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
rage	NULL
and	NULL
ended	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
middle	NULL
height	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
corpulent	NULL
figure	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sandy	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
worn	NULL
very	NULL
short	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
growing	NULL
gray	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
bristly	NULL
moustache	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
large	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
indistinct	NULL
features	NULL
and	NULL
small	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
naturally	NULL
red	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
frequent	NULL
attacks	NULL
of	NULL
anger	NULL
it	NULL
grew	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
purple	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
nails	NULL
were	NULL
bitten	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
quick	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
while	NULL
some	NULL
trembling	NULL
boy	NULL
was	NULL
construing	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
sit	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
desk	NULL
shaking	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
fury	NULL
that	NULL
consumed	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gnaw	NULL
his	NULL
fingers	NULL
.	NULL

Stories	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
exaggerated	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
told	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
violence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
some	NULL
excitement	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
father	NULL
was	NULL
threatening	NULL
a	NULL
prosecution	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
boxed	NULL
the	NULL
ears	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
named	NULL
Walters	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
so	NULL
violently	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
hearing	NULL
was	NULL
affected	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
's	NULL
father	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
Tercanbury	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
much	NULL
indignation	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
local	NULL
paper	NULL
had	NULL
referred	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Walters	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
brewer	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
the	NULL
sympathy	NULL
was	NULL
divided	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
reasons	NULL
best	NULL
known	NULL
to	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
loathed	NULL
the	NULL
master	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
side	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
their	NULL
indignation	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
's	NULL
business	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
dealt	NULL
with	NULL
outside	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
things	NULL
as	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
for	NULL
Walters	NULL
'	NULL
younger	NULL
brother	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
still	NULL
remained	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Gordon	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
escaped	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
living	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
skin	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
teeth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
hit	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
since	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
right	NULL
the	NULL
masters	NULL
possessed	NULL
to	NULL
cane	NULL
boys	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Squirts	NULL
could	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
emphasize	NULL
his	NULL
anger	NULL
by	NULL
beating	NULL
his	NULL
desk	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
cane	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
did	NULL
more	NULL
now	NULL
than	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
shoulders	NULL
and	NULL
shake	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
still	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
naughty	NULL
or	NULL
refractory	NULL
lad	NULL
stand	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
arm	NULL
stretched	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
anything	NULL
from	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
to	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
violent	NULL
as	NULL
before	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
tongue	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
master	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
unfitted	NULL
to	NULL
teach	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
so	NULL
shy	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
as	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
with	NULL
fewer	NULL
terrors	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
when	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Watson	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
many	NULL
boys	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
preparatory	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
more	NULL
grownup	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
instinctively	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
larger	NULL
numbers	NULL
his	NULL
deformity	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
less	NULL
noticeable	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
day	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Gordon	NULL
struck	NULL
terror	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
master	NULL
,	NULL
quick	NULL
to	NULL
discern	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
frightened	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
account	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
dislike	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
hours	NULL
passed	NULL
in	NULL
school	NULL
with	NULL
horror	NULL
.	NULL

Rather	NULL
than	NULL
risk	NULL
an	NULL
answer	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
wrong	NULL
and	NULL
excite	NULL
a	NULL
storm	NULL
of	NULL
abuse	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
master	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
sit	NULL
stupidly	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
towards	NULL
his	NULL
turn	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
construe	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
sick	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
with	NULL
apprehension	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
happy	NULL
moments	NULL
were	NULL
those	NULL
when	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
form	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
gratify	NULL
the	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
general	NULL
knowledge	NULL
which	NULL
beset	NULL
the	NULL
headmaster	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
strange	NULL
books	NULL
beyond	NULL
his	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
often	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
stop	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
that	NULL
filled	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
with	NULL
rapture	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Now	NULL
,	NULL
Carey	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
tell	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
good	NULL
marks	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
these	NULL
occasions	NULL
increased	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Gordon	NULL
's	NULL
indignation	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
turn	NULL
to	NULL
translate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
master	NULL
sat	NULL
there	NULL
glaring	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
furiously	NULL
biting	NULL
his	NULL
thumb	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
ferocious	NULL
mood	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
mumble	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
shouted	NULL
the	NULL
master	NULL
.	NULL

Something	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
stick	NULL
in	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
throat	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Go	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Go	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Go	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Each	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
were	NULL
screamed	NULL
more	NULL
loudly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
effect	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
printed	NULL
page	NULL
vacantly	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Gordon	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
breathe	NULL
heavily	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL

you	NULL

The	NULL
master	NULL
seized	NULL
the	NULL
arms	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
and	NULL
grasped	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
falling	NULL
upon	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
past	NULL
days	NULL
he	NULL
often	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
seize	NULL
boys	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
throat	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
almost	NULL
choked	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
veins	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
forehead	NULL
stood	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
grew	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
threatening	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
insane	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
perfectly	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
remember	NULL
nothing	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL

he	NULL
gasped	NULL

Philip	NULL
stood	NULL
silent	NULL

very	NULL
white	NULL

trembling	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL

with	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
bent	NULL
down	NULL

the	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL

That	NULL
relieved	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
Philip	NULL
redden	NULL
suddenly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
fetch	NULL
the	NULL
Black	NULL
Book	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
put	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
Caesar	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
silently	NULL
out	NULL

The	NULL
Black	NULL
Book	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sombre	NULL
volume	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
names	NULL
of	NULL
boys	NULL
were	NULL
written	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL

when	NULL
a	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
down	NULL
three	NULL

it	NULL
meant	NULL
a	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
headmaster	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
knocked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
study-door	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
was	NULL
seated	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
table	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL

answered	NULL
Mr.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
look	NULL

but	NULL
without	NULL
answering	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL

Philip	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL

went	NULL
out	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL

was	NULL
up	NULL

a	NULL

brought	NULL

Mr.	NULL

looked	NULL

he	NULL

up	NULL

this	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
casually	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Look	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
Akropolis	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
explaining	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
ruin	NULL
grew	NULL
vivid	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
showed	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
theatre	NULL
of	NULL
Dionysus	NULL
and	NULL
explained	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
order	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
sat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
beyond	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
Aegean	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
suddenly	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Gordon	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
gipsy	NULL
counter-jumper	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
form	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
before	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
fixed	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
photographs	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
gather	NULL
the	NULL
meaning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
remark	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
was	NULL
showing	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
picture	NULL
of	NULL
Salamis	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
finger	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
finger	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
nail	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
black	NULL
edge	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
pointing	NULL
out	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
Greek	NULL
ships	NULL
were	NULL
placed	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
Persian	NULL
.	NULL

XVII	NULL
Philip	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
with	NULL
comfortable	NULL
monotony	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
bullied	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
other	NULL
boys	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
size	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
deformity	NULL
,	NULL
withdrawing	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
games	NULL
,	NULL
acquired	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
insignificance	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
grateful	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
popular	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
lonely	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spent	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
terms	NULL
with	NULL
Winks	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Upper	NULL
Third	NULL
.	NULL

Winks	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
weary	NULL
manner	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
drooping	NULL
eyelids	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
infinitely	NULL
bored	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
abstracted	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
gentle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
foolish	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
belief	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
honour	NULL
of	NULL
boys	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
them	NULL
truthful	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
it	NULL
enter	NULL
your	NULL
head	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
lie	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ask	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
quoted	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
much	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Life	NULL
was	NULL
easy	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Upper	NULL
Third	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
knew	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
lines	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
your	NULL
turn	NULL
to	NULL
construe	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
crib	NULL
that	NULL
passed	NULL
from	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
hand	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
all	NULL
you	NULL
wanted	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL
minutes	NULL
;	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
hold	NULL
a	NULL
Latin	NULL
Grammar	NULL
open	NULL
on	NULL
your	NULL
knees	NULL
while	NULL
questions	NULL
were	NULL
passing	NULL
round	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Winks	NULL
never	NULL
noticed	NULL
anything	NULL
odd	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
incredible	NULL
mistake	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
different	NULL
exercises	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
great	NULL
faith	NULL
in	NULL
examinations	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
boys	NULL
never	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
form	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
disappointing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
significant	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
due	NULL
course	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
moved	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
learned	NULL
little	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
cheerful	NULL
effrontery	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
distortion	NULL
of	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
possibly	NULL
of	NULL
greater	NULL
service	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
after	NULL
life	NULL
than	NULL
an	NULL
ability	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
Latin	NULL
at	NULL
sight	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
Tar	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
Turner	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
vivacious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
masters	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
immense	NULL
belly	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
beard	NULL
turning	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
gray	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
swarthy	NULL
skin	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
his	NULL
clerical	NULL
dress	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
indeed	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
suggest	NULL
the	NULL
tar-barrel	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
on	NULL
principle	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
five	NULL
hundred	NULL
lines	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
boy	NULL
on	NULL
whose	NULL
lips	NULL
he	NULL
overheard	NULL
his	NULL
nickname	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
dinner-parties	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
precincts	NULL
he	NULL
often	NULL
made	NULL
little	NULL
jokes	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
worldly	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
masters	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
dined	NULL
out	NULL
more	NULL
frequently	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
society	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
exclusively	NULL
clerical	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boys	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
dog	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
left	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
clerical	NULL
attire	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
holidays	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
seen	NULL
in	NULL
Switzerland	NULL
in	NULL
gay	NULL
tweeds	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
liked	NULL
a	NULL
bottle	NULL
of	NULL
wine	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
once	NULL
been	NULL
seen	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Cafe	NULL
Royal	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
lady	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
probably	NULL
a	NULL
near	NULL
relation	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
thenceforward	NULL
supposed	NULL
by	NULL
generations	NULL
of	NULL
schoolboys	NULL
to	NULL
indulge	NULL
in	NULL
orgies	NULL
the	NULL
circumstantial	NULL
details	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
pointed	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
unbounded	NULL
belief	NULL
in	NULL
human	NULL
depravity	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Turner	NULL
reckoned	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
term	NULL
to	NULL
lick	NULL
boys	NULL
into	NULL
shape	NULL
after	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Upper	NULL
Third	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
let	NULL
fall	NULL
a	NULL
sly	NULL
hint	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
showed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
perfectly	NULL
what	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
colleague	NULL
's	NULL
form	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
good-humouredly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
boys	NULL
as	NULL
young	NULL
ruffians	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
more	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
truthful	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
certain	NULL
a	NULL
lie	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
honour	NULL
was	NULL
peculiar	NULL
to	NULL
themselves	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
apply	NULL
to	NULL
dealings	NULL
with	NULL
masters	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
least	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
troublesome	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
learned	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
pay	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
form	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
eager	NULL
at	NULL
fifty-five	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
do	NULL
better	NULL
in	NULL
examinations	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
first	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
choler	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
obese	NULL
,	NULL
easily	NULL
roused	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
easily	NULL
calmed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
boys	NULL
soon	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
kindliness	NULL
beneath	NULL
the	NULL
invective	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
constantly	NULL
assailed	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
patience	NULL
with	NULL
fools	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
was	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
much	NULL
trouble	NULL
with	NULL
boys	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
suspected	NULL
of	NULL
concealing	NULL
intelligence	NULL
behind	NULL
their	NULL
wilfulness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
inviting	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
tea	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
vowing	NULL
they	NULL
never	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
cakes	NULL
and	NULL
muffins	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
fashion	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
corpulence	NULL
pointed	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
voracious	NULL
appetite	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
voracious	NULL
appetite	NULL
to	NULL
tapeworms	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
accepted	NULL
his	NULL
invitations	NULL
with	NULL
real	NULL
pleasure	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
more	NULL
comfortable	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
space	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
limited	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
studies	NULL
for	NULL
boys	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
upper	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
till	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
hall	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
ate	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
forms	NULL
did	NULL
preparation	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
promiscuity	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
vaguely	NULL
distasteful	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
restless	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
with	NULL
people	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
urgently	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
set	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
solitary	NULL
walks	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
stream	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
pollards	NULL
on	NULL
both	NULL
sides	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
ran	NULL
through	NULL
green	NULL
fields	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
wander	NULL
along	NULL
its	NULL
banks	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
he	NULL
lay	NULL
face-downward	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
and	NULL
watched	NULL
the	NULL
eager	NULL
scurrying	NULL
of	NULL
minnows	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
tadpoles	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
to	NULL
saunter	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
precincts	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
they	NULL
practised	NULL
at	NULL
nets	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
quiet	NULL
:	NULL
boys	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
wander	NULL
round	NULL
sometimes	NULL
arm	NULL
in	NULL
arm	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
studious	NULL
fellow	NULL
with	NULL
abstracted	NULL
gaze	NULL
walked	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
repeating	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
something	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
by	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
colony	NULL
of	NULL
rooks	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
elms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
filled	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
with	NULL
melancholy	NULL
cries	NULL
.	NULL

Along	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
Cathedral	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
great	NULL
central	NULL
tower	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
beauty	NULL
,	NULL
felt	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
troubling	NULL
delight	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
study	NULL
(	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
square	NULL
room	NULL
looking	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
slum	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
four	NULL
boys	NULL
shared	NULL
it	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
bought	NULL
a	NULL
photograph	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Cathedral	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pinned	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
desk	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Fourth	NULL
Form	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
looked	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
old	NULL
lawns	NULL
,	NULL
carefully	NULL
tended	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fine	NULL
trees	NULL
with	NULL
foliage	NULL
dense	NULL
and	NULL
rich	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
odd	NULL
feeling	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
pain	NULL
or	NULL
pleasure	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
dawn	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
aesthetic	NULL
emotion	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
accompanied	NULL
other	NULL
changes	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
voice	NULL
broke	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
quite	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
control	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
queer	NULL
sounds	NULL
issued	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
throat	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
classes	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
held	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
headmaster	NULL
's	NULL
study	NULL
,	NULL
immediately	NULL
after	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
prepare	NULL
boys	NULL
for	NULL
confirmation	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
piety	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
stood	NULL
the	NULL
test	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
since	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
nightly	NULL
reading	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Bible	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
influence	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
new	NULL
condition	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
restless	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
feelings	NULL
revived	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
reproached	NULL
himself	NULL
bitterly	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
backsliding	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fires	NULL
of	NULL
Hell	NULL
burned	NULL
fiercely	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
's	NULL
eye	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
during	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
an	NULL
infidel	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
lost	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
implicitly	NULL
in	NULL
pain	NULL
everlasting	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
in	NULL
eternal	NULL
happiness	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
shuddered	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
dangers	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
run	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
kindly	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
smarting	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
particular	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
abuse	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
least	NULL
bear	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
conceived	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
headmaster	NULL
a	NULL
dog-like	NULL
adoration	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
racked	NULL
his	NULL
brains	NULL
vainly	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
please	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
treasured	NULL
the	NULL
smallest	NULL
word	NULL
of	NULL
commendation	NULL
which	NULL
by	NULL
chance	NULL
fell	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
quiet	NULL
little	NULL
meetings	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
house	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
prepared	NULL
to	NULL
surrender	NULL
himself	NULL
entirely	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
kept	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
fixed	NULL
on	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
'	NULL
shining	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
mouth	NULL
half	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
thrown	NULL
forward	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
miss	NULL
no	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
ordinariness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
surroundings	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
matters	NULL
they	NULL
dealt	NULL
with	NULL
extraordinarily	NULL
moving	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
often	NULL
the	NULL
master	NULL
,	NULL
seized	NULL
himself	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
wonder	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
push	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
book	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
clasped	NULL
together	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
to	NULL
still	NULL
the	NULL
beating	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mysteries	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
religion	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
vaguely	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
headmaster	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
black	NULL
,	NULL
straggling	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
pale	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
those	NULL
prophets	NULL
of	NULL
Israel	NULL
who	NULL
feared	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
kings	NULL
to	NULL
task	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Redeemer	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
Him	NULL
only	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
dark	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
those	NULL
wan	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
took	NULL
this	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
seriousness	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
here	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
flashing	NULL
humour	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
masters	NULL
suspect	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
flippancy	NULL
.	NULL

Finding	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
everything	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
busy	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
at	NULL
certain	NULL
intervals	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
separately	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
twenty	NULL
minutes	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
preparing	NULL
for	NULL
confirmation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
them	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
consciously	NULL
serious	NULL
step	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
lives	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
grope	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
souls	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
instil	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
vehement	NULL
devotion	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
his	NULL
shyness	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
equal	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
's	NULL
temperament	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
essentially	NULL
religious	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
broke	NULL
off	NULL
suddenly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
talking	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Have	NULL
you	NULL
thought	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL

up	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
uncle	NULL
wants	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
ordained	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
ashamed	NULL
to	NULL
answer	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
unworthy	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
any	NULL

nearer	NULL

Him	NULL

do	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
influence	NULL
you	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
headmaster	NULL
read	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
realised	NULL
already	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
indicate	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
headmaster	NULL
hesitated	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
idly	NULL
drawing	NULL
lines	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pencil	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
blotting	NULL
paper	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL
afraid	NULL
your	NULL

n't	NULL

Philip	NULL
reddened	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
roots	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
did	NULL
when	NULL
any	NULL
reference	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
club-foot	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
gravely	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wonder	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
not	NULL
oversensitive	NULL
about	NULL

it	NULL
ever	NULL

you	NULL
to	NULL

God	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
lips	NULL
tightened	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
how	NULL
for	NULL
months	NULL
,	NULL
trusting	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
implored	NULL
God	NULL
to	NULL
heal	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
He	NULL
had	NULL
healed	NULL
the	NULL
Leper	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
Blind	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
As	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
accept	NULL
it	NULL
rebelliously	NULL
it	NULL
can	NULL
only	NULL
cause	NULL
you	NULL
shame	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
cross	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
given	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
only	NULL
because	NULL
your	NULL
shoulders	NULL
were	NULL
strong	NULL
enough	NULL

bear	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
's	NULL
favour	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
source	NULL
of	NULL
happiness	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
misery	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
hated	NULL
to	NULL
discuss	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
over	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
headmaster	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
taken	NULL
up	NULL
entirely	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
ceremony	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
mystical	NULL
rapture	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
spirit	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
free	NULL
itself	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
bonds	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
flesh	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
living	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
aspired	NULL
to	NULL
perfection	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
passion	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
surrender	NULL
himself	NULL
entirely	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
service	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
definitely	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
ordained	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
day	NULL
arrived	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
deeply	NULL
moved	NULL
by	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
preparation	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
books	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
studied	NULL
and	NULL
above	NULL
all	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
overwhelming	NULL
influence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
contain	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
fear	NULL
and	NULL
joy	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
thought	NULL
had	NULL
tormented	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
alone	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
chancel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
dreaded	NULL
showing	NULL
his	NULL
limp	NULL
thus	NULL
obviously	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
attending	NULL
the	NULL
service	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
also	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
strangers	NULL
,	NULL
people	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
or	NULL
parents	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
their	NULL
sons	NULL
confirmed	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
came	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
suddenly	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
accept	NULL
the	NULL
humiliation	NULL
joyfully	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
limped	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
chancel	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
small	NULL
and	NULL
insignificant	NULL
beneath	NULL
the	NULL
lofty	NULL
vaulting	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Cathedral	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
offered	NULL
consciously	NULL
his	NULL
deformity	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
God	NULL
who	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

XVIII	NULL
But	NULL
Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
live	NULL
long	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rarefied	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hilltops	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
seized	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
religious	NULL
emotion	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

Because	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
so	NULL
keenly	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
faith	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
self-sacrifice	NULL
burned	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
gem-like	NULL
glow	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
strength	NULL
seemed	NULL
inadequate	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
ambition	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
out	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
violence	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
passion	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
soul	NULL
was	NULL
filled	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
singular	NULL
aridity	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
forget	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
surrounding	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
religious	NULL
exercises	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
very	NULL
punctually	NULL
performed	NULL
,	NULL
grew	NULL
merely	NULL
formal	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
blamed	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
falling	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
hell-fire	NULL
urged	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
renewed	NULL
vehemence	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
passion	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gradually	NULL
other	NULL
interests	NULL
distracted	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
few	NULL
friends	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
reading	NULL
isolated	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
became	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
need	NULL
that	NULL
after	NULL
being	NULL
in	NULL
company	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
tired	NULL
and	NULL
restless	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
vain	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wider	NULL
knowledge	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
acquired	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
perusal	NULL
of	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
alert	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
skill	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
his	NULL
contempt	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
companions	NULL
'	NULL
stupidity	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
complained	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
conceited	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
excelled	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
matters	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
unimportant	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
asked	NULL
satirically	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
conceited	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
developing	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
humour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
knack	NULL
of	NULL
saying	NULL
bitter	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
caught	NULL
people	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
raw	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
them	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
amused	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
hardly	NULL
realising	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
they	NULL
hurt	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
offended	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
victims	NULL
regarded	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
active	NULL
dislike	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
humiliations	NULL
he	NULL
suffered	NULL
when	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
school	NULL
had	NULL
caused	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
shrinking	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
fellows	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
entirely	NULL
overcome	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
remained	NULL
shy	NULL
and	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
everything	NULL
to	NULL
alienate	NULL
the	NULL
sympathy	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
boys	NULL
he	NULL
longed	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
popularity	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
easily	NULL
accorded	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
distance	NULL
he	NULL
admired	NULL
extravagantly	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
sarcastic	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
than	NULL
with	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
little	NULL
jokes	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
expense	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
places	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
gladly	NULL
have	NULL
changed	NULL
places	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
dullest	NULL
boy	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL
limb	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
singular	NULL
habit	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
imagine	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
some	NULL
boy	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
particular	NULL
fancy	NULL
for	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
throw	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
's	NULL
body	NULL
,	NULL
talk	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
and	NULL
laugh	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
imagine	NULL
himself	NULL
doing	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
vivid	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
really	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
he	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
many	NULL
intervals	NULL
of	NULL
fantastic	NULL
happiness	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Christmas	NULL
term	NULL
which	NULL
followed	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
confirmation	NULL
Philip	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
moved	NULL
into	NULL
another	NULL
study	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
who	NULL
shared	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
Rose	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
form	NULL
as	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
envious	NULL
admiration	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
good-looking	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
his	NULL
large	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
big	NULL
bones	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
clumsily	NULL
made	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
charming	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
laughed	NULL
(	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
constantly	NULL
laughing	NULL
)	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
wrinkled	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
jolly	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
neither	NULL
clever	NULL
nor	NULL
stupid	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
good	NULL
enough	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
and	NULL
better	NULL
at	NULL
games	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
favourite	NULL
with	NULL
masters	NULL
and	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
turn	NULL
liked	NULL
everyone	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
study	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
seeing	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
together	NULL
for	NULL
three	NULL
terms	NULL
,	NULL
welcomed	NULL
him	NULL
coldly	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
nervous	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
himself	NULL
an	NULL
intruder	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
his	NULL
feelings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
quiet	NULL
and	NULL
unobtrusive	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
Rose	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
little	NULL
able	NULL
as	NULL
anyone	NULL
else	NULL
to	NULL
resist	NULL
his	NULL
charm	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
even	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
usually	NULL
shy	NULL
and	NULL
abrupt	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
whether	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
bent	NULL
upon	NULL
exerting	NULL
the	NULL
fascination	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
results	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
whether	NULL
from	NULL
sheer	NULL
kindness	NULL
of	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Rose	NULL
who	NULL
first	NULL
took	NULL
Philip	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
circle	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
walk	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
football	NULL
field	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
flushed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
walk	NULL
fast	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Rot	NULL
.	NULL

Come	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
setting	NULL
out	NULL
some	NULL
boy	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
study-door	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
Rose	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
already	NULL
promised	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
bother	NULL
about	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
sha	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Rot	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Rose	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
with	NULL
those	NULL
good-natured	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
and	NULL
laughed	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
tremor	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
friendship	NULL
growing	NULL
with	NULL
boyish	NULL
rapidity	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
were	NULL
inseparable	NULL
.	NULL

Other	NULL
fellows	NULL
wondered	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sudden	NULL
intimacy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Rose	NULL
was	NULL
asked	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
's	NULL
not	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
chap	NULL
really	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Soon	NULL
they	NULL
grew	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
walking	NULL
into	NULL
chapel	NULL
arm	NULL
in	NULL
arm	NULL
or	NULL
strolling	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
precincts	NULL
in	NULL
conversation	NULL
;	NULL
wherever	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
acknowledging	NULL
his	NULL
proprietorship	NULL
,	NULL
boys	NULL
who	NULL
wanted	NULL
Rose	NULL
would	NULL
leave	NULL
messages	NULL
with	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
was	NULL
reserved	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
himself	NULL
yield	NULL
entirely	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
proud	NULL
joy	NULL
that	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
presently	NULL
his	NULL
distrust	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fates	NULL
gave	NULL
way	NULL
before	NULL
a	NULL
wild	NULL
happiness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
Rose	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
wonderful	NULL
fellow	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
seen	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
books	NULL
now	NULL
were	NULL
insignificant	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bother	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
when	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
infinitely	NULL
more	NULL
important	NULL
to	NULL
occupy	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Rose	NULL
's	NULL
friends	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
tea	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
study	NULL
sometimes	NULL
or	NULL
sit	NULL
about	NULL
when	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
--	NULL
Rose	NULL
liked	NULL
a	NULL
crowd	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
rag	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
decent	NULL
fellow	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
term	NULL
came	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
Rose	NULL
arranged	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
train	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
meet	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
tea	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
before	NULL
returning	NULL
to	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Rose	NULL
all	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
holidays	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
fancy	NULL
was	NULL
active	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
together	NULL
next	NULL
term	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
bored	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
day	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
question	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
facetious	NULL
tone	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
going	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
school	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
answered	NULL
joyfully	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Rather	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

In	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
of	NULL
meeting	NULL
Rose	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
an	NULL
earlier	NULL
train	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
usually	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
platform	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
from	NULL
Faversham	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
Rose	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
ran	NULL
along	NULL
it	NULL
excitedly	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Rose	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
porter	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
another	NULL
train	NULL
was	NULL
due	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
again	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
disappointed	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
hungry	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
,	NULL
through	NULL
side-streets	NULL
and	NULL
slums	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
cut	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
Rose	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
study	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
chimney-piece	NULL
,	NULL
talking	NULL
eighteen	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dozen	NULL
with	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
boys	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
sitting	NULL
on	NULL
whatever	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
Philip	NULL
enthusiastically	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
fell	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
Rose	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
their	NULL
appointment	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
so	NULL
late	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Rose	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
never	NULL
coming	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
at	NULL
half-past	NULL
four	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
another	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
you	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
blushed	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
Rose	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
people	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
invented	NULL
readily	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
disappointment	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
sulky	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
answered	NULL
in	NULL
monosyllables	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
Rose	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
Rose	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
came	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
arm	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chair	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
lounging	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
jolly	NULL
glad	NULL
we	NULL
're	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
study	NULL
this	NULL
term	NULL
.	NULL

Ripping	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
genuinely	NULL
pleased	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
annoyance	NULL
vanished	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
began	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
separated	NULL
for	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
eagerly	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
thousand	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
interested	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

XIX	NULL
At	NULL
first	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL
grateful	NULL
for	NULL
Rose	NULL
's	NULL
friendship	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
any	NULL
demands	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
things	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
presently	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
resent	NULL
Rose	NULL
's	NULL
universal	NULL
amiability	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
exclusive	NULL
attachment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
claimed	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
what	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
accepted	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
favour	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
watched	NULL
jealously	NULL
Rose	NULL
's	NULL
companionship	NULL
with	NULL
others	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
unreasonable	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
sometimes	NULL
saying	NULL
bitter	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Rose	NULL
spent	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
playing	NULL
the	NULL
fool	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
study	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
would	NULL
receive	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sullen	NULL
frown	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
sulk	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
suffered	NULL
more	NULL
because	NULL
Rose	NULL
either	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
notice	NULL
his	NULL
ill-humour	NULL
or	NULL
deliberately	NULL
ignored	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
seldom	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
how	NULL
stupid	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
force	NULL
a	NULL
quarrel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
apologise	NULL
humbly	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
great	NULL
friends	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
Rose	NULL
often	NULL
walked	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
merely	NULL
from	NULL
old	NULL
habit	NULL
or	NULL
from	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
anger	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
as	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Rose	NULL
was	NULL
often	NULL
bored	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
lameness	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
irritate	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Towards	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
term	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
boys	NULL
caught	NULL
scarlet	NULL
fever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
sending	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
escape	NULL
an	NULL
epidemic	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
sufferers	NULL
were	NULL
isolated	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
since	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
were	NULL
attacked	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
supposed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
outbreak	NULL
was	NULL
stopped	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stricken	NULL
was	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
hospital	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
Easter	NULL
holidays	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
term	NULL
was	NULL
sent	NULL
home	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
fresh	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Vicar	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
medical	NULL
assurance	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
infectious	NULL
,	NULL
received	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
suspicion	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
inconsiderate	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
to	NULL
suggest	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
nephew	NULL
's	NULL
convalescence	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
spent	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
seaside	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
consented	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
only	NULL
because	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nowhere	NULL
else	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
school	NULL
at	NULL
half-term	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL
the	NULL
quarrels	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
with	NULL
Rose	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
remembered	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
greatest	NULL
friend	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
silly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
reasonable	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
his	NULL
illness	NULL
Rose	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
little	NULL
notes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ended	NULL
each	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Hurry	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
Rose	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
looking	NULL
forward	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
return	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
seeing	NULL
Rose	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
from	NULL
scarlet	NULL
fever	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Sixth	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
some	NULL
shifting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
studies	NULL
and	NULL
Rose	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bitter	NULL
disappointment	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
arrived	NULL
he	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
Rose	NULL
's	NULL
study	NULL
.	NULL

Rose	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
desk	NULL
,	NULL
working	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
called	NULL
Hunter	NULL

turned	NULL
round	NULL
crossly	NULL

Philip	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Who	NULL
the	NULL
devil	NULL
's	NULL
that	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
cried	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
Philip	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
stopped	NULL
in	NULL
embarrassment	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
come	NULL

see	NULL
how	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
were	NULL
just	NULL
working	NULL

"	NULL

Hunter	NULL
broke	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
When	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL
get	NULL
back	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Five	NULL
minutes	NULL
ago	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
disturbing	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
evidently	NULL
expected	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
reddened	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
be	NULL
off	NULL

You	NULL
might	NULL
look	NULL
in	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL

done	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
Rose	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
limped	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
study	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
frightfully	NULL
hurt	NULL
.	NULL

Rose	NULL
,	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
seeming	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
almost	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
might	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
acquaintances	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
study	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
leaving	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
Rose	NULL
should	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
friend	NULL
never	NULL
appeared	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
prayers	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
Rose	NULL
and	NULL
Hunter	NULL
singing	NULL
along	NULL
arm	NULL
in	NULL
arm	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
others	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL
that	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
schoolboy	NULL
's	NULL
life	NULL

and	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
solitude	NULL
Rose	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

Hunter	NULL
had	NULL
stepped	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
vacant	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
Rose	NULL
was	NULL
quietly	NULL
avoiding	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
a	NULL
situation	NULL
without	NULL
putting	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
words	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
Rose	NULL
was	NULL
alone	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
study	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
May	NULL
I	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

Rose	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
embarrassment	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

if	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
very	NULL

Philip	NULL
sarcastically	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

do	NULL

said	NULL
Rose	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
's	NULL
my	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bring	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
humiliating	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Rose	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Gym	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
Philip	NULL
forced	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

Rose	NULL

do	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL

.	NULL
"	NULL

Rose	NULL
slammed	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
Philip	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
shivered	NULL
with	NULL
rage	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
study	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
over	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hated	NULL
Rose	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
hurt	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
biting	NULL
things	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
brooded	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
friendship	NULL
and	NULL
fancied	NULL
that	NULL
others	NULL
were	NULL
talking	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
his	NULL
sensitiveness	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
sneers	NULL
and	NULL
wonderings	NULL
in	NULL
other	NULL
fellows	NULL
'	NULL
manner	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
bothering	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
imagined	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
saying	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
After	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
last	NULL
long	NULL

I	NULL
wonder	NULL
he	NULL
ever	NULL
stuck	NULL
Carey	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Blighter	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

To	NULL
show	NULL
his	NULL
indifference	NULL
he	NULL
struck	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
violent	NULL
friendship	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
called	NULL
Sharp	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
and	NULL
despised	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
London	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
loutish	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
fellow	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
beginnings	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
moustache	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
lip	NULL
and	NULL
bushy	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
that	NULL
joined	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
bridge	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
nose	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
soft	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
manners	NULL
too	NULL
suave	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
suspicion	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cockney	NULL
accent	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
boys	NULL
who	NULL
are	NULL
too	NULL
slack	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
games	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
exercised	NULL
great	NULL
ingenuity	NULL
in	NULL
making	NULL
excuses	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
were	NULL
compulsory	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
regarded	NULL
by	NULL
boys	NULL
and	NULL
masters	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
vague	NULL
dislike	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
from	NULL
arrogance	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
now	NULL
sought	NULL
his	NULL
society	NULL
.	NULL

Sharp	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
terms	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
Germany	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hated	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
indignity	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
endured	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
old	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

London	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
many	NULL
stories	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
doings	NULL
there	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
holidays	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
his	NULL
conversation	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
soft	NULL
,	NULL
deep-toned	NULL
voice	NULL
--	NULL
there	NULL
emerged	NULL
the	NULL
vague	NULL
rumour	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
London	NULL
streets	NULL
by	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
fascinated	NULL
and	NULL
repelled	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
his	NULL
vivid	NULL
fancy	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
surging	NULL
throng	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
pit-door	NULL
of	NULL
theatres	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
glitter	NULL
of	NULL
cheap	NULL
restaurants	NULL
,	NULL
bars	NULL
where	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
drunk	NULL
,	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
high	NULL
stools	NULL
talking	NULL
with	NULL
barmaids	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
lamps	NULL
the	NULL
mysterious	NULL
passing	NULL
of	NULL
dark	NULL
crowds	NULL
bent	NULL
upon	NULL
pleasure	NULL
.	NULL

Sharp	NULL
lent	NULL
him	NULL
cheap	NULL
novels	NULL
from	NULL
Holywell	NULL
Row	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
read	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
cubicle	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
wonderful	NULL
fear	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
Rose	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
effect	NULL
a	NULL
reconciliation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good-natured	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
having	NULL
enemies	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
Carey	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
being	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
silly	NULL
ass	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
any	NULL
good	NULL
cutting	NULL
me	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL
mean	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
answered	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
see	NULL
why	NULL
you	NULL
should	NULL
n't	NULL
talk	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
bore	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Please	NULL
yourself	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Rose	NULL
shrugged	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
became	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
moved	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
violently	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Rose	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
suddenly	NULL
sick	NULL
with	NULL
misery	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
answered	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
fashion	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
friends	NULL
with	NULL
Rose	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hated	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
quarrelled	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
pain	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
sorry	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
master	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
devil	NULL
had	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
forcing	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
bitter	NULL
things	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
though	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
shake	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
Rose	NULL
and	NULL
meet	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
halfway	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
wound	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL
strong	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
revenge	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
humiliation	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
endured	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
pride	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
folly	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Rose	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
suffer	NULL
bitterly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
thought	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Rose	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL

I	NULL

such	NULL
a	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
's	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
that	NULL
Rose	NULL
would	NULL
sneer	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Sharp	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
afterwards	NULL
he	NULL
seized	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
opportunity	NULL
to	NULL
quarrel	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
fiendish	NULL
instinct	NULL
for	NULL
discovering	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
's	NULL
raw	NULL
spots	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
rankled	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
true	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Sharp	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
Rose	NULL
talking	NULL
about	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
Mellor	NULL
just	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mellor	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
Why	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
kick	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
teach	NULL
him	NULL
manners	NULL

And	NULL
Rose	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

Damned	NULL
cripple	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
suddenly	NULL
became	NULL
scarlet	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lump	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
throat	NULL
that	NULL
almost	NULL
choked	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

XX	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
moved	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
Sixth	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
school	NULL
now	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
lost	NULL
his	NULL
ambition	NULL
,	NULL
cared	NULL
nothing	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
ill	NULL
or	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
awoke	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sinking	NULL
heart	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
through	NULL
another	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
drudgery	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
things	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
told	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
restrictions	NULL
irked	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
unreasonable	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
restrictions	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
yearned	NULL
for	NULL
freedom	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
weary	NULL
of	NULL
repeating	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
already	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hammering	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
thick-witted	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
understood	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
work	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
chose	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
eager	NULL
and	NULL
abstracted	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Sixth	NULL
Form	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
abbey	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
restored	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
gothic	NULL
window	NULL

Philip	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
cheat	NULL
his	NULL
boredom	NULL
by	NULL
drawing	NULL
this	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
he	NULL
drew	NULL
the	NULL

tower	NULL

the	NULL
Cathedral	NULL

the	NULL
gateway	NULL
that	NULL
led	NULL
into	NULL

had	NULL
a	NULL
knack	NULL
for	NULL
drawing	NULL

Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
during	NULL

youth	NULL

painted	NULL

churches	NULL
,	NULL
old	NULL
bridges	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
picturesque	NULL
cottages	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
often	NULL
shown	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
tea-parties	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
given	NULL
Philip	NULL
a	NULL
paint-box	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
Christmas	NULL
present	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
started	NULL
by	NULL
copying	NULL
her	NULL
pictures	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
copied	NULL
them	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
anyone	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
little	NULL
pictures	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
encouraged	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
mischief	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
later	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
sketches	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
useful	NULL
for	NULL
bazaars	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
framed	NULL
and	NULL
hung	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
bed-room	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
stopped	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
lounging	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
form-room	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
waited	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
ran	NULL
his	NULL
lean	NULL
fingers	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
beard	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
thinking	NULL
over	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
Carey	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
abruptly	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
flushing	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
knowing	NULL
him	NULL
well	NULL
by	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
answering	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
been	NULL
dissatisfied	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
lately	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
've	NULL
been	NULL
slack	NULL
and	NULL
inattentive	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
no	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
your	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
been	NULL
slovenly	NULL
and	NULL
bad	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
very	NULL
sorry	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
for	NULL
yourself	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
sulkily	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
answer	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
bored	NULL
to	NULL
death	NULL
?	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
term	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
instead	NULL

up	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
sha	NULL
n't	NULL
give	NULL
you	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
report	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
report	NULL
was	NULL
treated	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
breakfast	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
indifferently	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
's	NULL
your	NULL
report	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
'd	NULL
better	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
says	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
remarked	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
ran	NULL
his	NULL
fingers	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
wrapper	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
catalogue	NULL
of	NULL
second-hand	NULL
books	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
it	NULL
good	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
so	NULL
good	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
deserve	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
answered	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
giving	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
afterwards	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
after	NULL
breakfast	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
the	NULL
butcher	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
generally	NULL
forgot	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
disappointed	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
understand	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
things	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL

you	NULL

n't	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL

a	NULL
bit	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
flushed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
passed	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tightened	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
there	NULL
's	NULL
something	NULL
else	NULL

You	NULL

anything	NULL

very	NULL
seriously	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
irritated	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
lecture	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
headmaster	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
going	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
Oxford	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
not	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
thought	NULL
your	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
,	NULL
holding	NULL
himself	NULL
oddly	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
figure	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Perugino	NULL
's	NULL
pictures	NULL
,	NULL
drew	NULL
his	NULL
fingers	NULL
thoughtfully	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
beard	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
abruptly	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

Apparently	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
satisfied	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
study	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
papers	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
resumed	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
adopted	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
method	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
schoolmaster	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
human	NULL
being	NULL
with	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
care	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
ran	NULL
small	NULL
chance	NULL
against	NULL
keen	NULL
rivals	NULL
of	NULL
carrying	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
scholarship	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Oxford	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
important	NULL
matter	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
changed	NULL
intention	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
afterwards	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
set	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
revive	NULL
his	NULL
eagerness	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
ordained	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
infinite	NULL
skill	NULL
he	NULL
worked	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
feelings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
easier	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
himself	NULL
genuinely	NULL
moved	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
caused	NULL
him	NULL
bitter	NULL
distress	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
really	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
throwing	NULL
away	NULL
his	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
happiness	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
what	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
voice	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
persuasive	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
easily	NULL
moved	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
emotion	NULL
of	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
emotional	NULL
himself	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
a	NULL
placid	NULL
exterior	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
partly	NULL
by	NULL
nature	NULL
but	NULL
also	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
years	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
seldom	NULL
except	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
quick	NULL
flushing	NULL
showed	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
--	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
deeply	NULL
touched	NULL
by	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
master	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
grateful	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
interest	NULL
he	NULL
showed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
conscience-stricken	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
grief	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
behaviour	NULL
caused	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
subtly	NULL
flattering	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
school	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
about	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
should	NULL
trouble	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
something	NULL
else	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
another	NULL
person	NULL
standing	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
elbow	NULL
,	NULL
clung	NULL
desperately	NULL
to	NULL
two	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
slipping	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
powerless	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
weakness	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
well	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
that	NULL
rises	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
empty	NULL
bottle	NULL
held	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
full	NULL
basin	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
set	NULL
his	NULL
teeth	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
shoulder	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
influence	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
must	NULL
decide	NULL
for	NULL
yourself	NULL
.	NULL

Pray	NULL
to	NULL
Almighty	NULL
God	NULL
for	NULL
help	NULL
and	NULL
guidance	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

When	NULL
Philip	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
headmaster	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
rain	NULL
falling	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
archway	NULL
that	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
precincts	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
soul	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rooks	NULL
were	NULL
silent	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
elms	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
round	NULL
slowly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
hot	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rain	NULL
did	NULL
him	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
over	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
calmly	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
withdrawn	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
fervour	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
personality	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thankful	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
given	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
but	NULL
vaguely	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Cathedral	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
it	NULL
now	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
irksomeness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
services	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
attend	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
anthem	NULL
was	NULL
interminable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
drearily	NULL
while	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
sung	NULL
;	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
droning	NULL
sermon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
your	NULL
body	NULL
twitched	NULL
because	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
still	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
services	NULL
every	NULL
Sunday	NULL
at	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
church	NULL
was	NULL
bare	NULL
and	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
smell	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
pomade	NULL
and	NULL
starched	NULL
clothes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
curate	NULL
preached	NULL
once	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
preached	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
up	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
;	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
downright	NULL
and	NULL
intolerant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
might	NULL
sincerely	NULL
say	NULL
things	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
acted	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
deception	NULL
outraged	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
uncle	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
weak	NULL
and	NULL
selfish	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
chief	NULL
desire	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
saved	NULL
trouble	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
life	NULL
dedicated	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
service	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
lives	NULL
the	NULL
clergy	NULL
led	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
East	NULL
Anglia	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
of	NULL
Whitestone	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
parish	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
way	NULL
from	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bachelor	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
himself	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
had	NULL
lately	NULL
taken	NULL
up	NULL
farming	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
local	NULL
paper	NULL
constantly	NULL
reported	NULL
the	NULL
cases	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL
court	NULL
against	NULL
this	NULL
one	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
labourers	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
pay	NULL
their	NULL
wages	NULL
to	NULL
or	NULL
tradesmen	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
accused	NULL
of	NULL
cheating	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
scandal	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
starved	NULL
his	NULL
cows	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
some	NULL
general	NULL
action	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
of	NULL
Ferne	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
bearded	NULL
,	NULL
fine	NULL
figure	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
:	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
him	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
cruelty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
filled	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
with	NULL
stories	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
immorality	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Vicar	NULL
of	NULL
Surle	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
tiny	NULL
hamlet	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
every	NULL
evening	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
house	NULL
a	NULL
stone	NULL
's	NULL
throw	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
vicarage	NULL

the	NULL
churchwardens	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL

ask	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL

in	NULL
his	NULL

he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
offer	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL

He	NULL
shivered	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
wanted	NULL

XXI	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
soon	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
effect	NULL
on	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
term	NULL
ignored	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wrote	NULL
a	NULL
report	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
vitriolic	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
it	NULL
arrived	NULL
and	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
cheerfully	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL

Sharp	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
left	NULL
King	NULL
's	NULL

had	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
from	NULL
Hanover	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
starting	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
Philip	NULL
more	NULL
restless	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
another	NULL

"	NULL

Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
in	NULL
dismay	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
that	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
startled	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
self-restraint	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
another	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
tea	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
tears	NULL
slowly	NULL
falling	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
suddenly	NULL
wrung	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
caused	NULL
her	NULL
pain	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
her	NULL
tight	NULL
black	NULL

made	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

strangely	NULL
pathetic	NULL
figure	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
was	NULL
shut	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL

the	NULL

Philip	NULL
shivered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
seized	NULL
with	NULL
panic	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL
easily	NULL
alter	NULL
any	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
Oxford	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
little	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
continuation	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
immensely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
master	NULL

Besides	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
known	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
extent	NULL
among	NULL
old	NULL
schoolfellows	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL

away	NULL
from	NULL
them	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
failure	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
start	NULL
fresh	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
happened	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Germany	NULL
fell	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
certain	NULL
ideas	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
discussed	NULL
at	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
friends	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL

brought	NULL
news	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
outside	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
visitors	NULL
spending	NULL
August	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
had	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Vicar	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
the	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
education	NULL
so	NULL
useful	NULL
nowadays	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
modern	NULL
languages	NULL
were	NULL
gaining	NULL
an	NULL
importance	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
youth	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
own	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
divided	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
younger	NULL
brother	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sent	NULL
to	NULL
Germany	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
failed	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
examination	NULL
,	NULL
thus	NULL
creating	NULL
a	NULL
precedent	NULL
but	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
there	NULL
died	NULL
of	NULL
typhoid	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
experiment	NULL
as	NULL
other	NULL
than	NULL
dangerous	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
innumerable	NULL
conversations	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Tercanbury	NULL
for	NULL
another	NULL
term	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL

With	NULL
this	NULL
agreement	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
dissatisfied	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
back	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
the	NULL
headmaster	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
astounded	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
furious	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
guardian	NULL
for	NULL
going	NULL
back	NULL

word	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

away	NULL

Philip	NULL
immediately	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
wrote	NULL
a	NULL
violent	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
measure	NULL
his	NULL
language	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
angry	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
till	NULL
quite	NULL
late	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
awoke	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
morning	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
brooding	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
treated	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
waited	NULL
impatiently	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
answer	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mild	NULL
,	NULL
pained	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
write	NULL
such	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
distressed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
unkind	NULL
and	NULL
unchristian	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
know	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
their	NULL
best	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
judges	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
clenched	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
statement	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
why	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
conditions	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
should	NULL
they	NULL
accept	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
self-evident	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
greater	NULL
age	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
greater	NULL
wisdom	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
letter	NULL
ended	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
information	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
had	NULL
withdrawn	NULL
the	NULL
notice	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL

Philip	NULL
nursed	NULL
his	NULL
wrath	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL

had	NULL
them	NULL
on	NULL
Tuesdays	NULL

Saturday	NULL
afternoons	NULL

had	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL

service	NULL

stopped	NULL
behind	NULL

out	NULL

went	NULL
out	NULL

felt	NULL
almost	NULL
sick	NULL

the	NULL

never	NULL
vouchsafed	NULL
a	NULL
reason	NULL

the	NULL
most	NULL
tyrannous	NULL
act	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
angry	NULL

care	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL

after	NULL
dinner	NULL
walked	NULL
down	NULL

walked	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
Vicar	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
clear	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
pleased	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
uneasy	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

frightened	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL

his	NULL

forced	NULL
himself	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

got	NULL
up	NULL

out	NULL

something	NULL

pathetic	NULL
in	NULL

A	NULL

suddenly	NULL
in	NULL

Philip	NULL
forgot	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
clock	NULL
struck	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
bolt	NULL
off	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL

catch	NULL
the	NULL

train	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
get	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL

Tercanbury	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL

the	NULL
railway	NULL

he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL

done	NULL
nothing	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
weakness	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
despicable	NULL

from	NULL

the	NULL

as	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
what	NULL
conversations	NULL

another	NULL

Mr.	NULL

read	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
impatient	NULL
shrug	NULL

He	NULL
showed	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL

It	NULL
ran	NULL

both	NULL

his	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
difficult	NULL

us	NULL

what	NULL

He	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL

think	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
doing	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL

he	NULL
feels	NULL
it	NULL

wasting	NULL

I	NULL

obliged	NULL

it	NULL

Philip	NULL

felt	NULL
a	NULL
thrill	NULL

pride	NULL

triumph	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
his	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
satisfied	NULL

the	NULL
headmaster	NULL
irritably	NULL

Philip	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL

his	NULL
face	NULL

perfectly	NULL

eyes	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
noticed	NULL
it	NULL

broke	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
laugh	NULL

said	NULL

Then	NULL
Philip	NULL
smiled	NULL
outright	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
conceal	NULL
his	NULL
exultation	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

it	NULL
true	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL

Philip	NULL
blushed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hated	NULL
instinctively	NULL
any	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
feelings	NULL

"	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
,	NULL
slowly	NULL
dragging	NULL
his	NULL
fingers	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
beard	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
thoughtfully	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
almost	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL

Then	NULL
suddenly	NULL
he	NULL
addressed	NULL
himself	NULL

Philip	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
gained	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mind	NULL
the	NULL
extra	NULL
term	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
school	NULL
seemed	NULL
less	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
prison	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
before	NULL
Easter	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
danced	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
evening	NULL
in	NULL
chapel	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL

standing	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
forms	NULL

each	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
due	NULL

he	NULL
chuckled	NULL
with	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
soon	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL
again	NULL

It	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
regard	NULL
them	NULL
almost	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
friendly	NULL
feeling	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
eyes	NULL
rested	NULL
on	NULL
Rose	NULL
.	NULL

Rose	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
monitor	NULL
very	NULL
seriously	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
quite	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL

being	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL

it	NULL

read	NULL
the	NULL

evening	NULL

he	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL

Philip	NULL
smiled	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL

it	NULL

matter	NULL

six	NULL

Rose	NULL

tall	NULL

straight-limbed	NULL

where	NULL

the	NULL
importance	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL

Turner	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
writhed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
subjection	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
held	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
matter	NULL
either	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
praise	NULL
would	NULL
mean	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
shrug	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
censure	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
express	NULL
his	NULL
emotions	NULL
by	NULL
outward	NULL
signs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shyness	NULL
still	NULL
tormented	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
very	NULL
high	NULL
spirits	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
limped	NULL
about	NULL
demurely	NULL
,	NULL
silent	NULL
and	NULL
reserved	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
hallooing	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
more	NULL
lightly	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
ideas	NULL
danced	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
fancies	NULL
chased	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
so	NULL
furiously	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
catch	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
their	NULL
coming	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
going	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
exhilaration	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
remaining	NULL
weeks	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
term	NULL
set	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
long	NULL
neglect	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
brain	NULL
worked	NULL
easily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
keen	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
activity	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
intellect	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
examinations	NULL
that	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
term	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Perkins	NULL
made	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
remark	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
an	NULL
essay	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
criticisms	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
So	NULL
you	NULL
've	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
your	NULL

He	NULL
smiled	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
shining	NULL
teeth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
down	NULL

gave	NULL
an	NULL
embarrassed	NULL

The	NULL
half	NULL
dozen	NULL
boys	NULL
who	NULL
expected	NULL

divide	NULL
between	NULL

various	NULL
prizes	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
given	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
term	NULL
had	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
Philip	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
serious	NULL
rival	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
they	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
regard	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
uneasiness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
leaving	NULL
at	NULL
Easter	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
no	NULL
sense	NULL
a	NULL
competitor	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
left	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
anxieties	NULL

knew	NULL

spent	NULL
two	NULL

expected	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
Dean	NULL

Prize	NULL
for	NULL
English	NULL
essay	NULL
;	NULL
Philip	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
in	NULL
watching	NULL
his	NULL
dismay	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
subjects	NULL
than	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Another	NULL

Norton	NULL

could	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL

got	NULL
one	NULL

the	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL

going	NULL
in	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Have	NULL
you	NULL
any	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL

It	NULL
entertained	NULL
him	NULL

think	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
someone	NULL
else	NULL

in	NULL
his	NULL

There	NULL

something	NULL

in	NULL
getting	NULL
these	NULL

rewards	NULL
actually	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
leaving	NULL
them	NULL

he	NULL
disdained	NULL
them	NULL

At	NULL

Mr.	NULL

Philip	NULL
walked	NULL
out	NULL

the	NULL
wild	NULL

to	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
at	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
precincts	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
profound	NULL
depression	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL

had	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL

he	NULL
knew	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
humiliation	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
dissatisfied	NULL
with	NULL

were	NULL
thick	NULL
with	NULL
leaves	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
fresh	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
mingled	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
timidity	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
at	NULL
entering	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
among	NULL
strangers	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
exhilaration	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
disconsolate	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
very	NULL
shy	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
porter	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
big	NULL
white	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
untidy	NULL
lad	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
suite	NULL
covered	NULL
in	NULL
green	NULL
velvet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
round	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
this	NULL
in	NULL
water	NULL
stood	NULL
a	NULL
bouquet	NULL
of	NULL
flowers	NULL
tightly	NULL
packed	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
paper	NULL
frill	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
bone	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mutton	NULL
chop	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
carefully	NULL
spaced	NULL
round	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
books	NULL
in	NULL
leather	NULL
bindings	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
musty	NULL
smell	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
odour	NULL
of	NULL
cooking	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
stout	NULL
woman	NULL
with	NULL
tightly	NULL
dressed	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
red	NULL
face	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
little	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
sparkling	NULL
like	NULL
beads	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
effusive	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
both	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
twice	NULL
spent	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
spoke	NULL
in	NULL
German	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
broken	NULL
English	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
her	NULL
two	NULL
daughters	NULL
appeared	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
seemed	NULL
hardly	NULL
young	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
perhaps	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
twenty-five	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
elder	NULL
,	NULL
Thekla	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
short	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
shifty	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
abundant	NULL
dark	NULL
hair	NULL
;	NULL
Anna	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
younger	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
tall	NULL
and	NULL
plain	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
smile	NULL
Philip	NULL
immediately	NULL
preferred	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
of	NULL
polite	NULL
conversation	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
took	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
turret	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
tops	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Anlage	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
alcove	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
sat	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
desk	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bed-room	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
unpacked	NULL
his	NULL
things	NULL
and	NULL
set	NULL
out	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
books	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
master	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
bell	NULL
summoned	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
o'clock	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
's	NULL
guests	NULL
assembled	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
introduced	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
middle	NULL
age	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
fair	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
gray	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
mild	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
in	NULL
correct	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
archaic	NULL
English	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
learned	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
study	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
classics	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
from	NULL
conversation	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
odd	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
him	NULL
use	NULL
words	NULL
colloquially	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
met	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
plays	NULL
of	NULL
Shakespeare	NULL
.	NULL

Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
Erlin	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
establishment	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
pension	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
required	NULL
the	NULL
subtlety	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
metaphysician	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
exactly	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
lay	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
dark	NULL
apartment	NULL
that	NULL
led	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
very	NULL
shy	NULL
,	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
sixteen	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
sat	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
end	NULL
and	NULL
carved	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
service	NULL
was	NULL
conducted	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
clattering	NULL
of	NULL
plates	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
clumsy	NULL
lout	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
quick	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
persons	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
served	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
had	NULL
received	NULL
their	NULL
appointed	NULL
portions	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
insisted	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
German	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
spoken	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
bashfulness	NULL
had	NULL
permitted	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
talkative	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
his	NULL
tongue	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
among	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
sat	NULL
several	NULL
old	NULL
ladies	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
give	NULL
them	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
attention	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
young	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
fair	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
very	NULL
pretty	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
Philip	NULL
heard	NULL
addressed	NULL
as	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Hedwig	NULL
and	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
.	NULL

Fraulein	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
pig-tail	NULL
hanging	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL
side	NULL
by	NULL
side	NULL
and	NULL
chattered	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
smothered	NULL
laughter	NULL
:	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
they	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
said	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
undertone	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
both	NULL
giggled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
blushed	NULL
awkwardly	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
making	NULL
fun	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Near	NULL
them	NULL
sat	NULL
a	NULL
Chinaman	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
yellow	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
expansive	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
studying	NULL
Western	NULL
conditions	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
University	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
so	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
accent	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
understand	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
they	NULL
burst	NULL
out	NULL
laughing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
laughed	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
good-humouredly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
almond	NULL
eyes	NULL
almost	NULL
closed	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
American	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
black	NULL
coats	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
yellow	NULL
and	NULL
dry	NULL
of	NULL
skin	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
theological	NULL
students	NULL
;	NULL
Philip	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
twang	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
New	NULL
England	NULL
accent	NULL
through	NULL
their	NULL
bad	NULL
German	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
suspicion	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
taught	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
Americans	NULL
as	NULL
wild	NULL
and	NULL
desperate	NULL
barbarians	NULL
.	NULL

Afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
sat	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stiff	NULL
green	NULL
velvet	NULL
chairs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Anna	NULL
asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
walk	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
accepted	NULL
the	NULL
invitation	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
party	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
daughters	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
other	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
American	NULL
students	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
walked	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
Anna	NULL
and	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Hedwig	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
fluttered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
known	NULL
any	NULL
girls	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
farmers	NULL
'	NULL
daughters	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
local	NULL
tradesmen	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
them	NULL
by	NULL
name	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
sight	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
timid	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
they	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
deformity	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
accepted	NULL
willingly	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
put	NULL
between	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
exalted	NULL
rank	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
farmers	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
doctor	NULL
had	NULL
two	NULL
daughters	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
both	NULL
much	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
Philip	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
married	NULL
to	NULL
successive	NULL
assistants	NULL
while	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
school	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
girls	NULL
of	NULL
more	NULL
boldness	NULL
than	NULL
modesty	NULL
whom	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
knew	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
desperate	NULL
stories	NULL
,	NULL
due	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
probability	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
masculine	NULL
imagination	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
told	NULL
of	NULL
intrigues	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
concealed	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
lofty	NULL
contempt	NULL
the	NULL
terror	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
imagination	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
books	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
had	NULL
inspired	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Byronic	NULL
attitude	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
torn	NULL
between	NULL
a	NULL
morbid	NULL
self-consciousness	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
owed	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
gallant	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
bright	NULL
and	NULL
amusing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
brain	NULL
seemed	NULL
empty	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

Fraulein	NULL
Anna	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
's	NULL
daughter	NULL
,	NULL
addressed	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
frequently	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
said	NULL
little	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
sparkling	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
confusion	NULL
laughed	NULL
outright	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
him	NULL
perfectly	NULL
ridiculous	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
walked	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hill	NULL
among	NULL
pine-trees	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
pleasant	NULL
odour	NULL
caused	NULL
Philip	NULL
a	NULL
keen	NULL
delight	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
day	NULL
was	NULL
warm	NULL
and	NULL
cloudless	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
eminence	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
valley	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Rhine	NULL
spread	NULL
out	NULL
before	NULL
them	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
vast	NULL
stretch	NULL
of	NULL
country	NULL
,	NULL
sparkling	NULL
with	NULL
golden	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
cities	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
through	NULL
it	NULL
meandered	NULL
the	NULL
silver	NULL
ribband	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
.	NULL

Wide	NULL
spaces	NULL
are	NULL
rare	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
Kent	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
offers	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
broad	NULL
horizon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
immense	NULL
distance	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
now	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
indescribable	NULL
thrill	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
suddenly	NULL
elated	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
experienced	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
undiluted	NULL
with	NULL
foreign	NULL
emotions	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
bench	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
talked	NULL
in	NULL
rapid	NULL
German	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
indifferent	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
proximity	NULL
,	NULL
feasted	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
By	NULL
Jove	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
.	NULL

XXIII	NULL
Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
occasionally	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
King	NULL
's	NULL
School	NULL
at	NULL
Tercanbury	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
laughed	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
what	NULL
at	NULL
some	NULL
particular	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
doing	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
dreamed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
awaking	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
realise	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
little	NULL
room	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
turret	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
cumulus	NULL
clouds	NULL
that	NULL
hung	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
sky	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
revelled	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
freedom	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
fancy	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
order	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
need	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
lies	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
arranged	NULL
that	NULL
Professor	NULL
Erlin	NULL
should	NULL
teach	NULL
him	NULL
Latin	NULL
and	NULL
German	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
Frenchman	NULL
came	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
lessons	NULL
in	NULL
French	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
had	NULL
recommended	NULL
for	NULL
mathematics	NULL
an	NULL
Englishman	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
philological	NULL
degree	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
university	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
named	NULL
Wharton	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
every	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
room	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
floor	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
shabby	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
dirty	NULL
and	NULL
untidy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pungent	NULL
odour	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
different	NULL
stinks	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
generally	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
ten	NULL
o'clock	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
jumped	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
filthy	NULL
dressing-gown	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
slippers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
instruction	NULL
,	NULL
ate	NULL
his	NULL
simple	NULL
breakfast	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
stout	NULL
from	NULL
excessive	NULL
beer	NULL
drinking	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
moustache	NULL
and	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
unkempt	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
Germany	NULL
for	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
become	NULL
very	NULL
Teutonic	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
with	NULL
scorn	NULL
of	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
his	NULL
degree	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
horror	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
which	NULL
awaited	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
taken	NULL
his	NULL
doctorate	NULL
in	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
England	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
pedagogic	NULL
career	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
adored	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
German	NULL
university	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
happy	NULL
freedom	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
jolly	NULL
companionships	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
member	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Burschenschaft	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
Kneipe	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
poor	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
secret	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
lessons	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
giving	NULL
Philip	NULL
meant	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL
meat	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
dinner	NULL
and	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
cheese	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
night	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
headache	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
drink	NULL
his	NULL
coffee	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
his	NULL
lesson	NULL
with	NULL
heaviness	NULL
of	NULL
spirit	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
these	NULL
occasions	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
bottles	NULL
of	NULL
beer	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
pipe	NULL
would	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
the	NULL
burden	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
A	NULL
hair	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dog	NULL
that	NULL
bit	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
beer	NULL
,	NULL
carefully	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
foam	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
wait	NULL
too	NULL
long	NULL
to	NULL
drink	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
university	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
quarrels	NULL
between	NULL
rival	NULL
corps	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
duels	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
merits	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
professor	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
learnt	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
than	NULL
of	NULL
mathematics	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
Wharton	NULL
would	NULL
sit	NULL
back	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
laugh	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Look	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
've	NULL
not	NULL
done	NULL
anything	NULL
today	NULL

You	NULL
need	NULL
n't	NULL
pay	NULL
me	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
lesson	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
new	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
interesting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
greater	NULL
import	NULL
than	NULL
trigonometry	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
could	NULL
understand	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
window	NULL
on	NULL
life	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
peeping	NULL
through	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
wildly	NULL
beating	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
keep	NULL
your	NULL
dirty	NULL
money	NULL

said	NULL
Wharton	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
how	NULL
about	NULL
your	NULL
dinner	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
exactly	NULL
how	NULL
his	NULL
master	NULL
's	NULL
finances	NULL
stood	NULL
.	NULL

Wharton	NULL
had	NULL
even	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
shillings	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
lesson	NULL
cost	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
things	NULL
less	NULL
complicated	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
mind	NULL
my	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL

I	NULL

my	NULL
mind	NULL
's	NULL
never	NULL
clearer	NULL

when	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
dived	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
(	NULL
the	NULL
sheets	NULL
were	NULL
gray	NULL
with	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
washing	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fished	NULL
out	NULL
another	NULL
bottle	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
young	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
things	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
share	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
drank	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
long	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
here	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Wharton	NULL
.	NULL

Both	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
relief	NULL
the	NULL
pretence	NULL
of	NULL
mathematics	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL

Then	NULL
my	NULL
people	NULL

Oxford	NULL

"	NULL

Wharton	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
contemptuous	NULL
shrug	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shoulders	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
experience	NULL
for	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
persons	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
that	NULL
seat	NULL
of	NULL
learning	NULL

awe	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
d'you	NULL

You	NULL
'll	NULL
only	NULL

n't	NULL
you	NULL

A	NULL
year	NULL

no	NULL
good	NULL

Spend	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
here	NULL

You	NULL
know	NULL

there	NULL
are	NULL
two	NULL
good	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
freedom	NULL
of	NULL
thought	NULL

freedom	NULL

In	NULL
France	NULL
you	NULL
get	NULL
freedom	NULL

action	NULL

you	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL

nobody	NULL

you	NULL

In	NULL
Germany	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
do	NULL
what	NULL
everybody	NULL

you	NULL
may	NULL
think	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL

They	NULL
're	NULL
both	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
personally	NULL
prefer	NULL
freedom	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
you	NULL

neither	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
sat	NULL

He	NULL
interrupted	NULL
himself	NULL

Philip	NULL

very	NULL
neatly	NULL

Philip	NULL
reddened	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
spruceness	NULL
an	NULL
intolerable	NULL
reproach	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
some	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
toilet	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
England	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
selection	NULL
of	NULL
ties	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
summer	NULL
came	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
conqueror	NULL
.	NULL

Each	NULL
day	NULL
was	NULL
beautiful	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sky	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
arrogant	NULL
blue	NULL
which	NULL
goaded	NULL
the	NULL
nerves	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
spur	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
green	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Anlage	NULL
was	NULL
violent	NULL
and	NULL
crude	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
houses	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
caught	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
dazzling	NULL
white	NULL
which	NULL
stimulated	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
hurt	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
Wharton	NULL
Philip	NULL
would	NULL
sit	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shade	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
benches	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Anlage	NULL
,	NULL
enjoying	NULL
the	NULL
coolness	NULL
and	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
patterns	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
,	NULL
shining	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
leaves	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
soul	NULL
danced	NULL
with	NULL
delight	NULL
as	NULL
gaily	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
sunbeams	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
revelled	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
moments	NULL
of	NULL
idleness	NULL
stolen	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
sauntered	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
with	NULL
awe	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
students	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
corps	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
cheeks	NULL
gashed	NULL
and	NULL
red	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
swaggered	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
coloured	NULL
caps	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
afternoons	NULL
he	NULL
wandered	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
hills	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
tea	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
leafy	NULL
beer-garden	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
evenings	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
round	NULL
and	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
Stadtgarten	NULL
,	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
band	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
soon	NULL
learned	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
interests	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
household	NULL
.	NULL

Fraulein	NULL
Thekla	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
professor	NULL
's	NULL
elder	NULL
daughter	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
engaged	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
twelve	NULL
months	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
German	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
marriage	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
place	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
wrote	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
india-rubber	NULL
merchant	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
Slough	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
approve	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
union	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Thekla	NULL
was	NULL
often	NULL
in	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
stern	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
determined	NULL
mouths	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
letters	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
reluctant	NULL
lover	NULL
.	NULL

Thekla	NULL
painted	NULL
in	NULL
water	NULL
colour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
occasionally	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
another	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
them	NULL
company	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
paint	NULL
little	NULL
pictures	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pretty	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Hedwig	NULL
had	NULL
amorous	NULL
troubles	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
daughter	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
merchant	NULL
in	NULL
Berlin	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
dashing	NULL
hussar	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
von	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
please	NULL
:	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
parents	NULL
opposed	NULL
a	NULL
marriage	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
condition	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sent	NULL
to	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
to	NULL
forget	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
corresponded	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
continually	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
every	NULL
effort	NULL
to	NULL
induce	NULL
an	NULL
exasperating	NULL
father	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
with	NULL
pretty	NULL
sighs	NULL
and	NULL
becoming	NULL
blushes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
showed	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
photograph	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
gay	NULL
lieutenant	NULL

Philip	NULL
liked	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL

girls	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL

and	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
walks	NULL
always	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL

He	NULL
blushed	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
chaffed	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
obvious	NULL

made	NULL

declaration	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
to	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Hedwig	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
unfortunately	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
accident	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
evenings	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
women	NULL
sang	NULL
little	NULL
songs	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
velvet	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Anna	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
always	NULL
made	NULL
herself	NULL
useful	NULL
,	NULL
industriously	NULL
accompanied	NULL
.	NULL

Fraulein	NULL
Hedwig	NULL
's	NULL
favourite	NULL
song	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
Ich	NULL
liebe	NULL
dich	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
love	NULL
you	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
evening	NULL
after	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
sung	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
balcony	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
stars	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
some	NULL
remark	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Ich	NULL
liebe	NULL
dich	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

His	NULL
German	NULL
was	NULL
halting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
about	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pause	NULL
was	NULL
infinitesimal	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Hedwig	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Ach	NULL
,	NULL
Herr	NULL
Carey	NULL
,	NULL
Sie	NULL
mussen	NULL
mir	NULL

n't	NULL
talk	NULL

me	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
person	NULL
singular	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
grow	NULL
hot	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
dared	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
so	NULL
familiar	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
on	NULL
earth	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
ungallant	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
making	NULL
an	NULL
observation	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
merely	NULL
mentioning	NULL
the	NULL
title	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
song	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Entschuldigen	NULL
Sie	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
beg	NULL
your	NULL
pardon	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
whispered	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
smiled	NULL
pleasantly	NULL
,	NULL
quietly	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
pressed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
turned	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
shyness	NULL
did	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
walk	NULL
he	NULL
refused	NULL
because	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Hedwig	NULL
seized	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
behaving	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
kindly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL
said	NULL
last	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
love	NULL
me	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL
flattered	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
although	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
exactly	NULL
engaged	NULL
to	NULL
Hermann	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
never	NULL
love	NULL
anyone	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
myself	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
bride	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
blushed	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
quite	NULL
the	NULL
expression	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
rejected	NULL
lover	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
hope	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

XXIV	NULL
Professor	NULL
Erlin	NULL
gave	NULL
Philip	NULL
a	NULL
lesson	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
list	NULL
of	NULL
books	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
final	NULL
achievement	NULL
of	NULL
Faust	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
meanwhile	NULL
,	NULL
ingeniously	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
started	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
German	NULL
translation	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
plays	NULL
by	NULL
Shakespeare	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
studied	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
period	NULL
in	NULL
Germany	NULL
of	NULL
Goethe	NULL
's	NULL
highest	NULL
fame	NULL
.	NULL

Notwithstanding	NULL
his	NULL
rather	NULL
condescending	NULL
attitude	NULL
towards	NULL
patriotism	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
adopted	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
national	NULL
poet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seemed	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
of	NULL
seventy	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
significant	NULL
glories	NULL
of	NULL
national	NULL
unity	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
enthusiastic	NULL
seemed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wildness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Walpurgisnacht	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
rattle	NULL
of	NULL
artillery	NULL
at	NULL
Gravelotte	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
one	NULL
mark	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
writer	NULL
's	NULL
greatness	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
different	NULL
minds	NULL
can	NULL
find	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
different	NULL
inspirations	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Professor	NULL
Erlin	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
hated	NULL
the	NULL
Prussians	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
his	NULL
enthusiastic	NULL
admiration	NULL
to	NULL
Goethe	NULL
because	NULL
his	NULL
works	NULL
,	NULL
Olympian	NULL
and	NULL
sedate	NULL
,	NULL
offered	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
refuge	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
sane	NULL
mind	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
onslaughts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
generation	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dramatist	NULL
whose	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
much	NULL
heard	NULL
at	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
before	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
plays	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
given	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
theatre	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
cheers	NULL
of	NULL
adherents	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
hisses	NULL
of	NULL
decent	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
heard	NULL
discussions	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
's	NULL
long	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
these	NULL
Professor	NULL
Erlin	NULL
lost	NULL
his	NULL
wonted	NULL
calm	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
beat	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
fist	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
drowned	NULL
all	NULL
opposition	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
roar	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fine	NULL
deep	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
nonsense	NULL
and	NULL
obscene	NULL
nonsense	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
forced	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
bored	NULL
or	NULL
nauseated	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
theatre	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
high	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
police	NULL
stepped	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
playhouses	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
prude	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
laugh	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
anyone	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
witty	NULL
immorality	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
farce	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Palais	NULL
Royal	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
filth	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
an	NULL
emphatic	NULL
gesture	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
his	NULL
nose	NULL
and	NULL
whistled	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
teeth	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
ruin	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
uprooting	NULL
of	NULL
morals	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
destruction	NULL
of	NULL
Germany	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

from	NULL

the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Calm	NULL

He	NULL
shook	NULL
his	NULL
fist	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
mildest	NULL
of	NULL
creatures	NULL

ventured	NULL

no	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
mentioned	NULL
it	NULL
Professor	NULL

leaned	NULL

his	NULL
sides	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL

lifted	NULL

threw	NULL

The	NULL
oddest	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
masters	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
teacher	NULL
of	NULL
French	NULL
.	NULL

Monsieur	NULL
Ducroz	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
citizen	NULL
of	NULL
Geneva	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sallow	NULL
skin	NULL
and	NULL
hollow	NULL
cheeks	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
gray	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
thin	NULL
and	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wore	NULL
shabby	NULL
black	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
holes	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
elbows	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
coat	NULL
and	NULL
frayed	NULL
trousers	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
linen	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
dirty	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
clean	NULL
collar	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
few	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
gave	NULL
his	NULL
lesson	NULL
conscientiously	NULL
but	NULL
without	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
,	NULL
arriving	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
clock	NULL
struck	NULL
and	NULL
leaving	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
minute	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
charges	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
small	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
taciturn	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
Philip	NULL
learnt	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
learnt	NULL
from	NULL
others	NULL

it	NULL
appeared	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
fought	NULL
with	NULL
Garibaldi	NULL

the	NULL
Pope	NULL

but	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
Italy	NULL
in	NULL
disgust	NULL

clear	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
efforts	NULL
for	NULL
freedom	NULL

by	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
the	NULL
establishment	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
puzzled	NULL
surprise	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
unlike	NULL
his	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
revolutionary	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
voice	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
extraordinarily	NULL
polite	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
on	NULL
rare	NULL
occasions	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
Philip	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL

never	NULL

1848	NULL

remembering	NULL
their	NULL

went	NULL
about	NULL

an	NULL
uneasy	NULL

their	NULL
necks	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
that	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
liberty	NULL
which	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
Europe	NULL

sweeping	NULL
before	NULL
it	NULL
what	NULL

its	NULL

taught	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
men	NULL
are	NULL
unfit	NULL
for	NULL
liberty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pursuit	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
worth	NULL
the	NULL
finding	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
maybe	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
only	NULL
with	NULL
indifference	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
release	NULL
of	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
bluntness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
with	NULL
Garibaldi	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
attach	NULL
any	NULL
importance	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
answered	NULL
quite	NULL
quietly	NULL
in	NULL
as	NULL
low	NULL
a	NULL
voice	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oui	NULL
,	NULL
monsieur	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
say	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Commune	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
they	NULL
?	NULL

Shall	NULL
we	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
our	NULL
work	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
held	NULL
the	NULL
book	NULL
open	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
intimidated	NULL
,	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
translate	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
prepared	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
Monsieur	NULL
Ducroz	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
great	NULL
pain	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
scarcely	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
drag	NULL
himself	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
many	NULL
stairs	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
:	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
arrived	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
heavily	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
sallow	NULL
face	NULL
drawn	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
beads	NULL
of	NULL
sweat	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
forehead	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
recover	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
afraid	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
ill	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
consequence	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
suffering	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
asked	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
prefer	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
lessons	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
even	NULL
low	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
prefer	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
while	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
able	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
morbidly	NULL
nervous	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
any	NULL
reference	NULL
to	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
reddened	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
it	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
make	NULL
any	NULL
difference	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
pay	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
lessons	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
you	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
for	NULL
next	NULL
week	NULL
in	NULL
advance	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Monsieur	NULL
Ducroz	NULL
charged	NULL
eighteen	NULL
pence	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
ten-mark	NULL
piece	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
and	NULL
shyly	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bring	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
beggar	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
In	NULL
that	NULL
case	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
come	NULL
again	NULL
till	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
coin	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
anything	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
elaborate	NULL
bow	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
leave	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Bonjour	NULL
,	NULL
monsieur	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
vaguely	NULL
disappointed	NULL
.	NULL

Thinking	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
a	NULL
generous	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
that	NULL
Monsieur	NULL
Ducroz	NULL
would	NULL
overwhelm	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
expressions	NULL
of	NULL
gratitude	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
aback	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
teacher	NULL
accepted	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
his	NULL
due	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
realise	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
less	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
obligation	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
receive	NULL
favours	NULL
than	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
grant	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Monsieur	NULL
Ducroz	NULL
appeared	NULL
again	NULL
five	NULL
or	NULL
six	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tottered	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
weak	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
overcome	NULL
the	NULL
severity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
attack	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
communicative	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remained	NULL
mysterious	NULL
,	NULL
aloof	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dirty	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
reference	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
illness	NULL
till	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
lesson	NULL
:	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
leaving	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
paused	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hesitated	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
were	NULL
difficult	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
you	NULL
gave	NULL
me	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
starved	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
solemn	NULL
,	NULL
obsequious	NULL
bow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
lump	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
throat	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
realise	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fashion	NULL
the	NULL
hopeless	NULL
bitterness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
struggle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
hard	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
pleasant	NULL
.	NULL

XXVI	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
in	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
when	NULL
one	NULL
morning	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
an	NULL
Englishman	NULL
named	NULL
Hayward	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
evening	NULL
at	NULL
supper	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
some	NULL
days	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
excitement	NULL
.	NULL

First	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
heaven	NULL
knows	NULL
what	NULL
scheming	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
dint	NULL
of	NULL
humble	NULL
prayers	NULL
and	NULL
veiled	NULL
threats	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
parents	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
Englishman	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Thekla	NULL
was	NULL
engaged	NULL
had	NULL
invited	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
visit	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
set	NULL
off	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
album	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
colours	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
how	NULL
accomplished	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
bundle	NULL
of	NULL
letters	NULL
to	NULL
prove	NULL
how	NULL
deeply	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
compromised	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
week	NULL
later	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Hedwig	NULL
with	NULL
radiant	NULL
smiles	NULL
announced	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
lieutenant	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
affections	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

Exhausted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
importunity	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
son	NULL
and	NULL
touched	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
dowry	NULL
which	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Hedwig	NULL
's	NULL
father	NULL
offered	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
lieutenant	NULL
's	NULL
parents	NULL
had	NULL
consented	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
through	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
interview	NULL
was	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
and	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Hedwig	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
of	NULL
showing	NULL
her	NULL
lover	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Stadtgarten	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
Erlin	NULL
's	NULL
household	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
silent	NULL
old	NULL
ladies	NULL
who	NULL
sat	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
flutter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Hedwig	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
home	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
formal	NULL
engagement	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
,	NULL
regardless	NULL
of	NULL
expense	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
Maibowle	NULL
.	NULL

Professor	NULL
Erlin	NULL
prided	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
skill	NULL
in	NULL
preparing	NULL
this	NULL
mild	NULL
intoxicant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
supper	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
bowl	NULL
of	NULL
hock	NULL
and	NULL
soda	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
scented	NULL
herbs	NULL
floating	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
wild	NULL
strawberries	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
placed	NULL
with	NULL
solemnity	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
round	NULL
table	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
.	NULL

Fraulein	NULL
Anna	NULL
teased	NULL
Philip	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
departure	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
lady-love	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
very	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
and	NULL
rather	NULL
melancholy	NULL
.	NULL

Fraulein	NULL
Hedwig	NULL
sang	NULL
several	NULL
songs	NULL
,	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Anna	NULL
played	NULL
the	NULL
Wedding	NULL
March	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Professor	NULL
sang	NULL
Die	NULL
Wacht	NULL
am	NULL
Rhein	NULL
.	NULL

Amid	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
jollification	NULL
Philip	NULL
paid	NULL
little	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
arrival	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
sat	NULL
opposite	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
at	NULL
supper	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
chattering	NULL
busily	NULL
with	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Hedwig	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
stranger	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
no	NULL
German	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
eaten	NULL
his	NULL
food	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
observing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
pale	NULL
blue	NULL
tie	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
account	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
dislike	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
twenty-six	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
fair	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
wavy	NULL
hair	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
passed	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
frequently	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
careless	NULL
gesture	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
large	NULL
and	NULL
blue	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
looked	NULL
rather	NULL
tired	NULL
already	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
clean-shaven	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
its	NULL
thin	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
well-shaped	NULL
.	NULL

Fraulein	NULL
Anna	NULL
took	NULL
an	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
physiognomy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
Philip	NULL
notice	NULL
afterwards	NULL
how	NULL
finely	NULL
shaped	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
skull	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
weak	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
remarked	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
thinker	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
jaw	NULL
lacked	NULL
character	NULL
.	NULL

Fraulein	NULL
Anna	NULL
,	NULL
foredoomed	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
spinster	NULL
's	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
high	NULL
cheek-bones	NULL
and	NULL
large	NULL
misshapen	NULL
nose	NULL
,	NULL
laid	NULL
great	NULL
stress	NULL
upon	NULL
character	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
they	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
apart	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
noisy	NULL
party	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
good-humoured	NULL
but	NULL
faintly	NULL
supercilious	NULL
expression	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
tall	NULL
and	NULL
slim	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
held	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
deliberate	NULL
grace	NULL
.	NULL

Weeks	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
American	NULL
students	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
him	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pair	NULL
were	NULL
oddly	NULL
contrasted	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
American	NULL
very	NULL
neat	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
black	NULL
coat	NULL
and	NULL
pepper-and-salt	NULL
trousers	NULL
,	NULL
thin	NULL
and	NULL
dried-up	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
ecclesiastical	NULL
unction	NULL
already	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
manner	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Englishman	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
loose	NULL
tweed	NULL
suit	NULL
,	NULL
large-limbed	NULL
and	NULL
slow	NULL
of	NULL
gesture	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
newcomer	NULL
till	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
found	NULL
themselves	NULL
alone	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
balcony	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
before	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

Hayward	NULL
addressed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
English	NULL
,	NULL
are	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
the	NULL
food	NULL

bad	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
last	NULL
night	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

"	NULL
Beastly	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Beastly	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
nothing	NULL
wrong	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
food	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
had	NULL
eaten	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
large	NULL
quantities	NULL
with	NULL
appetite	NULL
and	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
of	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
discrimination	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
a	NULL
dinner	NULL
good	NULL
which	NULL
another	NULL
thought	NULL
execrable	NULL
.	NULL

Fraulein	NULL
Thekla	NULL
's	NULL
visit	NULL
to	NULL
England	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
more	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
often	NULL
spare	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
long	NULL
walks	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
long	NULL
plait	NULL
of	NULL
fair	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
snub-nosed	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
shown	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
disinclination	NULL
for	NULL
society	NULL

Fraulein	NULL
Hedwig	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Weeks	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
American	NULL
who	NULL
generally	NULL
accompanied	NULL
them	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
rambles	NULL

had	NULL
set	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
tour	NULL
of	NULL
South	NULL
Germany	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL

Hayward	NULL
sought	NULL
his	NULL
acquaintance	NULL

but	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
unfortunate	NULL
trait	NULL

from	NULL
shyness	NULL
or	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
atavistic	NULL
inheritance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cave-dweller	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
listener	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
often	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
clever	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
seldom	NULL
till	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
them	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Hayward	NULL
was	NULL
communicative	NULL
;	NULL
anyone	NULL
more	NULL
experienced	NULL
than	NULL
Philip	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
himself	NULL
talk	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
supercilious	NULL
attitude	NULL
impressed	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
admiring	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
being	NULL
awed	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
faintly	NULL
despised	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
as	NULL
almost	NULL
sacred	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
cast	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
fetish	NULL
of	NULL
exercise	NULL
,	NULL
damning	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
contemptuous	NULL
word	NULL
pot-hunters	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
devoted	NULL
themselves	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
various	NULL
forms	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
realise	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
merely	NULL
putting	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
stead	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
fetish	NULL
of	NULL
culture	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
wandered	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
castle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
terrace	NULL
that	NULL
overlooked	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
nestled	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
valley	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
pleasant	NULL
Neckar	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
comfortable	NULL
friendliness	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
smoke	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
chimneys	NULL
hung	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
pale	NULL
blue	NULL
haze	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tall	NULL
roofs	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
spires	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
churches	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
pleasantly	NULL
medieval	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
homeliness	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
which	NULL
warmed	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

Hayward	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
Richard	NULL
Feverel	NULL
and	NULL
Madame	NULL
Bovary	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
Verlaine	NULL
,	NULL
Dante	NULL
,	NULL

Matthew	NULL
Arnold	NULL

In	NULL
those	NULL
days	NULL
Fitzgerald	NULL
's	NULL
translation	NULL
of	NULL
Omar	NULL
Khayyam	NULL
was	NULL
known	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
elect	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Hayward	NULL
repeated	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
reciting	NULL
poetry	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
monotonous	NULL
sing-song	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
they	NULL
reached	NULL
home	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
distrust	NULL
of	NULL
Hayward	NULL
was	NULL
changed	NULL
to	NULL
enthusiastic	NULL
admiration	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
practice	NULL
of	NULL
walking	NULL
together	NULL
every	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
learned	NULL
presently	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
Hayward	NULL
's	NULL
circumstances	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
son	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
country	NULL
judge	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
whose	NULL
death	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
inherited	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
record	NULL
at	NULL
Charterhouse	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
brilliant	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
the	NULL
Master	NULL
of	NULL
Trinity	NULL
Hall	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
express	NULL
his	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
college	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
prepared	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
distinguished	NULL
career	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
moved	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
intellectual	NULL
circles	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
Browning	NULL
with	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
well-shaped	NULL
nose	NULL
at	NULL
Tennyson	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
details	NULL
of	NULL
Shelley	NULL
's	NULL
treatment	NULL
of	NULL
Harriet	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
dabbled	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
history	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL
(	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
rooms	NULL
were	NULL
reproductions	NULL
of	NULL
pictures	NULL
by	NULL
G.	NULL
F.	NULL
Watts	NULL
,	NULL
Burne-Jones	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Botticelli	NULL
)	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wrote	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
distinction	NULL
verses	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
pessimistic	NULL
character	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
friends	NULL
told	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
excellent	NULL
gifts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
willingly	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
prophesied	NULL
his	NULL
future	NULL
eminence	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
an	NULL
authority	NULL
on	NULL
art	NULL
and	NULL
literature	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
influence	NULL
of	NULL
Newman	NULL
's	NULL
Apologia	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
picturesqueness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Roman	NULL
Catholic	NULL
faith	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
esthetic	NULL
sensibility	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
wrath	NULL
(	NULL
a	NULL
plain	NULL
,	NULL
blunt	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
narrow	NULL
ideas	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
read	NULL
Macaulay	NULL
)	NULL
which	NULL
prevented	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
'	NULL
going	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL
'	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
pass	NULL
degree	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
were	NULL
astonished	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
shrugged	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
and	NULL
delicately	NULL
insinuated	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
dupe	NULL
of	NULL
examiners	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
one	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
first	NULL
class	NULL
was	NULL
ever	NULL
so	NULL
slightly	NULL
vulgar	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
described	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vivas	NULL
with	NULL
tolerant	NULL
humour	NULL
;	NULL
some	NULL
fellow	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
outrageous	NULL
collar	NULL
was	NULL
asking	NULL
him	NULL
questions	NULL
in	NULL
logic	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
infinitely	NULL
tedious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
suddenly	NULL
he	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wore	NULL
elastic-sided	NULL
boots	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
grotesque	NULL
and	NULL
ridiculous	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
withdrew	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
gothic	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Chapel	NULL
at	NULL
King	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
some	NULL
delightful	NULL
days	NULL
at	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
better	NULL
dinners	NULL
than	NULL
anyone	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
rooms	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
often	NULL
memorable	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
quoted	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
the	NULL
exquisite	NULL
epigram	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
They	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
Herakleitus	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
related	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
picturesque	NULL
little	NULL
anecdote	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
examiner	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
boots	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
laughed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Of	NULL
course	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
folly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
folly	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
fine	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
thrill	NULL
,	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
magnificent	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Hayward	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Bar	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
charming	NULL
rooms	NULL
in	NULL
Clement	NULL
's	NULL
Inn	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
panelled	NULL
walls	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
them	NULL
look	NULL
like	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
rooms	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Hall	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
ambitions	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
vaguely	NULL
political	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
described	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
Whig	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
club	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
Liberal	NULL
but	NULL
gentlemanly	NULL
flavour	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
idea	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
practise	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Bar	NULL
(	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
the	NULL
Chancery	NULL
side	NULL
as	NULL
less	NULL
brutal	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
seat	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
pleasant	NULL
constituency	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
promises	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
were	NULL
carried	NULL
out	NULL
;	NULL
meanwhile	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
opera	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
charming	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
admired	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
admired	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
joined	NULL
a	NULL
dining-club	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
motto	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
The	NULL
Whole	NULL
,	NULL
The	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
The	NULL
Beautiful	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
formed	NULL
a	NULL
platonic	NULL
friendship	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
lady	NULL
some	NULL
years	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
Kensington	NULL
Square	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
nearly	NULL
every	NULL
afternoon	NULL
he	NULL
drank	NULL
tea	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
shaded	NULL
candles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
George	NULL
Meredith	NULL
and	NULL
Walter	NULL
Pater	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
notorious	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
fool	NULL
could	NULL
pass	NULL
the	NULL
examinations	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Bar	NULL
Council	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
pursued	NULL
his	NULL
studies	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dilatory	NULL
fashion	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ploughed	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
final	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
personal	NULL
affront	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
in	NULL
Kensington	NULL
Square	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
home	NULL
from	NULL
India	NULL
on	NULL
leave	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
worthy	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
commonplace	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
frequent	NULL
visits	NULL
.	NULL

Hayward	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
ugliness	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
revolted	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
affronting	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
cynicism	NULL
of	NULL
examiners	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
something	NULL
rather	NULL
splendid	NULL
in	NULL
kicking	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
ball	NULL
which	NULL
lay	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
in	NULL
debt	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
on	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
yearned	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Venice	NULL
and	NULL
Florence	NULL
which	NULL
John	NULL
Ruskin	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
magically	NULL
described	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
unsuited	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
vulgar	NULL
bustle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Bar	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sufficient	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
your	NULL
name	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
door	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
briefs	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
modern	NULL
politics	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
lack	NULL
nobility	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
poet	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
disposed	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
rooms	NULL
in	NULL
Clement	NULL
's	NULL
Inn	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Italy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
a	NULL
winter	NULL
in	NULL
Florence	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
winter	NULL
in	NULL
Rome	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
was	NULL
passing	NULL
his	NULL
second	NULL
summer	NULL
abroad	NULL
in	NULL
Germany	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
read	NULL
Goethe	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
original	NULL
.	NULL

Hayward	NULL
had	NULL
one	NULL
gift	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
precious	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
feeling	NULL
for	NULL
literature	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
impart	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
passion	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
admirable	NULL
fluency	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
throw	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
sympathy	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
writer	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
best	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
understanding	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
without	NULL
discrimination	NULL
everything	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
across	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
someone	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
guide	NULL
his	NULL
taste	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
borrowed	NULL
books	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
lending	NULL
library	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
possessed	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
reading	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
wonderful	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
Hayward	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
read	NULL
always	NULL
with	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
but	NULL
invariably	NULL
with	NULL
perseverance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
eager	NULL
for	NULL
self-improvement	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
very	NULL
ignorant	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
humble	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Weeks	NULL
returned	NULL
from	NULL
South	NULL
Germany	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
completely	NULL
under	NULL
Hayward	NULL
's	NULL
influence	NULL
.	NULL

Hayward	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
Weeks	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
deplored	NULL
the	NULL
American	NULL
's	NULL
black	NULL
coat	NULL
and	NULL
pepper-and-salt	NULL
trousers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
spoke	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
scornful	NULL
shrug	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
New	NULL
England	NULL
conscience	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
listened	NULL
complacently	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
abuse	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
Weeks	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
turn	NULL
made	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
remarks	NULL
about	NULL
Hayward	NULL
he	NULL
lost	NULL
his	NULL
temper	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Your	NULL
new	NULL
friend	NULL
looks	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
poet	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Weeks	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
thin	NULL
smile	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL

a	NULL

could	NULL
never	NULL

offered	NULL
him	NULL

regaining	NULL
ground	NULL

was	NULL
able	NULL

draw	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL

discussion	NULL

up	NULL

seemed	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
delight	NULL

his	NULL
ignorance	NULL

said	NULL
something	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL

tried	NULL
sometimes	NULL

put	NULL
in	NULL
something	NULL

help	NULL

Weeks	NULL
gently	NULL
crushed	NULL
him	NULL

so	NULL
kindly	NULL
,	NULL
differently	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL

answered	NULL

that	NULL

Philip	NULL

outrageously	NULL

himself	NULL

settled	NULL
it	NULL

was	NULL

welcomed	NULL

had	NULL
now	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL

still	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL

had	NULL
much	NULL

was	NULL
some	NULL

it	NULL

hope	NULL
of	NULL
eternal	NULL
happiness	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
definitely	NULL
stated	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
unbeliever	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
wicked	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
vicious	NULL
man	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Weeks	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
hardly	NULL
anything	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
believed	NULL
,	NULL
led	NULL
a	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
Christian	NULL
purity	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
received	NULL
little	NULL
kindness	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
touched	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
American	NULL
's	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
once	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
kept	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
for	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
Weeks	NULL
nursed	NULL
him	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
neither	NULL
vice	NULL
nor	NULL
wickedness	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
sincerity	NULL
and	NULL
loving-kindness	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
virtuous	NULL
and	NULL
unbelieving	NULL
.	NULL

Also	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
people	NULL
adhered	NULL
to	NULL
other	NULL
faiths	NULL
only	NULL
from	NULL
obstinacy	NULL
or	NULL
self-interest	NULL
:	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
hearts	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
false	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
deliberately	NULL
sought	NULL
to	NULL
deceive	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
German	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
accustomed	NULL
on	NULL
Sunday	NULL
mornings	NULL
to	NULL
attend	NULL
the	NULL
Lutheran	NULL
service	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
Hayward	NULL
arrived	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
instead	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
Mass	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
whereas	NULL
the	NULL
Protestant	NULL
church	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
empty	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
congregation	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
listless	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Jesuit	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
was	NULL
crowded	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
worshippers	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
pray	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
their	NULL
hearts	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
hypocrites	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
contrast	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Lutherans	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
faith	NULL
was	NULL
closer	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
account	NULL
were	NULL
nearer	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
Roman	NULL
Catholics	NULL
.	NULL

Most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
largely	NULL
a	NULL
masculine	NULL
congregation	NULL
--	NULL
were	NULL
South	NULL
Germans	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
saying	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
born	NULL
in	NULL
South	NULL
Germany	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
certainly	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
Roman	NULL
Catholic	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
might	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
born	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
Roman	NULL
Catholic	NULL
country	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
Wesleyan	NULL
,	NULL
Baptist	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
Methodist	NULL
family	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
that	NULL
fortunately	NULL
belonged	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
by	NULL
law	NULL
established	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
breathless	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
danger	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
run	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
friendly	NULL
terms	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
Chinaman	NULL
who	NULL
sat	NULL
at	NULL
table	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
twice	NULL
each	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
Sung	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
smiling	NULL
,	NULL
affable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
polite	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
strange	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
frizzle	NULL
in	NULL
hell	NULL
merely	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Chinaman	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
salvation	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
whatever	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
faith	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
any	NULL
particular	NULL
advantage	NULL
in	NULL
belonging	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
puzzled	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
sounded	NULL
Weeks	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
careful	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
sensitive	NULL
to	NULL
ridicule	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
acidulous	NULL
humour	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
American	NULL
treated	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
disconcerted	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Weeks	NULL
only	NULL
puzzled	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
Philip	NULL
acknowledge	NULL
that	NULL
those	NULL
South	NULL
Germans	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Jesuit	NULL
church	NULL
were	NULL
every	NULL
bit	NULL
as	NULL
firmly	NULL
convinced	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
of	NULL
Roman	NULL
Catholicism	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
led	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
admit	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Mahommedan	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Buddhist	NULL
were	NULL
convinced	NULL
also	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
respective	NULL
religions	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
knowing	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
right	NULL
meant	NULL
nothing	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
knew	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

Weeks	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
undermining	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
's	NULL
faith	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
deeply	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
religion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
an	NULL
absorbing	NULL
topic	NULL
of	NULL
conversation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
described	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
views	NULL
accurately	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
very	NULL
earnestly	NULL
disbelieved	NULL
in	NULL
almost	NULL
everything	NULL
that	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
believed	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
Philip	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
put	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
upon	NULL
some	NULL
mildly	NULL
rationalistic	NULL
work	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
exciting	NULL
discussion	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
newspapers	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
why	NULL
should	NULL
you	NULL
be	NULL
right	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
fellows	NULL

St.	NULL
Anselm	NULL
and	NULL
St.	NULL
Augustine	NULL
be	NULL
wrong	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
clever	NULL
and	NULL

while	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
grave	NULL
doubts	NULL
whether	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
either	NULL

"	NULL

asked	NULL
Weeks	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
answered	NULL
Philip	NULL
uncertainly	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
way	NULL
his	NULL
question	NULL
seemed	NULL
impertinent	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
St.	NULL
Augustine	NULL
believed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
was	NULL
flat	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
proves	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
believe	NULL
with	NULL
your	NULL
generation	NULL
.	NULL

Your	NULL
saints	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
age	NULL
of	NULL
faith	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
practically	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
disbelieve	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL

positively	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
how	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
this	NULL
over	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Neither	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
how	NULL
can	NULL
you	NULL
believe	NULL
anything	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
asked	NULL
Weeks	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Hayward	NULL
's	NULL
religion	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Men	NULL
have	NULL
always	NULL
formed	NULL
gods	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
image	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Weeks	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
believes	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
picturesque	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
paused	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
see	NULL
why	NULL
one	NULL
should	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
God	NULL

all	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
words	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
sooner	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
breath	NULL
away	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
plunge	NULL
into	NULL
cold	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Weeks	NULL
with	NULL
startled	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
afraid	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
left	NULL
Weeks	NULL
as	NULL
quickly	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
startling	NULL
experience	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
out	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
exciting	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
his	NULL
whole	NULL
life	NULL
seemed	NULL
concerned	NULL
(	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
his	NULL
decision	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
matter	NULL
must	NULL
profoundly	NULL
affect	NULL
its	NULL
course	NULL
)	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
mistake	NULL
might	NULL
lead	NULL
to	NULL
eternal	NULL
damnation	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
he	NULL
reflected	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
convinced	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
aids	NULL
to	NULL
scepticism	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
eager	NULL
interest	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
confirm	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
instinctively	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fact	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
reason	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
religious	NULL
temperament	NULL
.	NULL

Faith	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
forced	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
outside	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
environment	NULL
and	NULL
example	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
new	NULL
environment	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
example	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
faith	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
childhood	NULL
quite	NULL
simply	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
cloak	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
needed	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
life	NULL
seemed	NULL
strange	NULL
and	NULL
lonely	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
belief	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
realised	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
an	NULL
unfailing	NULL
support	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
leaned	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
stick	NULL
and	NULL
finds	NULL
himself	NULL
forced	NULL
suddenly	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
without	NULL
assistance	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
really	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
were	NULL
colder	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
nights	NULL
more	NULL
solitary	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
upheld	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
excitement	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
life	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
thrilling	NULL
adventure	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
stick	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thrown	NULL
aside	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
cloak	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
an	NULL
intolerable	NULL
burden	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
eased	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
religious	NULL
exercises	NULL
which	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
forced	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
were	NULL
part	NULL
and	NULL
parcel	NULL
of	NULL
religion	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
collects	NULL
and	NULL
epistles	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
by	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
services	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Cathedral	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sat	NULL
when	NULL
every	NULL
limb	NULL
itched	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
movement	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
those	NULL
walks	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
through	NULL
muddy	NULL
roads	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
parish	NULL
church	NULL
at	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
coldness	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
bleak	NULL
building	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
like	NULL
ice	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
fingers	NULL
numb	NULL
and	NULL
heavy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
around	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
sickly	NULL
odour	NULL
of	NULL
pomatum	NULL
.	NULL

Oh	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
bored	NULL
!	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
leaped	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
at	NULL
himself	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
so	NULL
easily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
knowing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
subtle	NULL
workings	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
inmost	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
ascribed	NULL
the	NULL
certainty	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
reached	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
cleverness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
unduly	NULL
pleased	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
youth	NULL
's	NULL
lack	NULL
of	NULL
sympathy	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
attitude	NULL
other	NULL
than	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
he	NULL
despised	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
Weeks	NULL
and	NULL
Hayward	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
content	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
vague	NULL
emotion	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
called	NULL
God	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
further	NULL
step	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
obvious	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
alone	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
hill	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
view	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
always	NULL
with	NULL
wild	NULL
exhilaration	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
autumn	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
often	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
were	NULL
cloudless	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
glow	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
splendid	NULL
light	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
nature	NULL
consciously	NULL
sought	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
a	NULL
fuller	NULL
vehemence	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
remaining	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
fair	NULL
weather	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
plain	NULL
,	NULL
a-quiver	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
,	NULL
stretching	NULL
vastly	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
roofs	NULL
of	NULL
Mannheim	NULL
and	NULL
ever	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
dimness	NULL
of	NULL
Worms	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
piercing	NULL
glitter	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
Rhine	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
tremendous	NULL
spaciousness	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
glowing	NULL
with	NULL
rich	NULL
gold	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
beating	NULL
with	NULL
sheer	NULL
joy	NULL
,	NULL
thought	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
tempter	NULL
had	NULL
stood	NULL
with	NULL
Jesus	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
high	NULL
mountain	NULL
and	NULL
shown	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
kingdoms	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
intoxicated	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
world	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
spread	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
eager	NULL
to	NULL
step	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
enjoy	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
degrading	NULL
fears	NULL
and	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
prejudice	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
intolerable	NULL
dread	NULL
of	NULL
hell-fire	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
he	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
burden	NULL
of	NULL
responsibility	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
every	NULL
action	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
urgent	NULL
consequence	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
breathe	NULL
more	NULL
freely	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
lighter	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
responsible	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

Freedom	NULL
!	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
master	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
old	NULL
habit	NULL
,	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
he	NULL
thanked	NULL
God	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
Him	NULL
.	NULL

Drunk	NULL
with	NULL
pride	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
intelligence	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
fearlessness	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
entered	NULL
deliberately	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
faith	NULL
made	NULL
less	NULL
difference	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
behaviour	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
expected	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thrown	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
the	NULL
Christian	NULL
dogmas	NULL
it	NULL
never	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
criticise	NULL
the	NULL
Christian	NULL
ethics	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
accepted	NULL
the	NULL
Christian	NULL
virtues	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
indeed	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
fine	NULL
to	NULL
practise	NULL
them	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
sake	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
reward	NULL
or	NULL
punishment	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
small	NULL
occasion	NULL
for	NULL
heroism	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
exactly	NULL
truthful	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
forced	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
commonly	NULL
attentive	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dull	NULL
,	NULL
elderly	NULL
ladies	NULL
who	NULL
sometimes	NULL
engaged	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
conversation	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
gentle	NULL
oath	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
violent	NULL
adjective	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
typical	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
language	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
cultivated	NULL
before	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
manliness	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
now	NULL
elaborately	NULL
eschewed	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
settled	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
matter	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
he	NULL
sought	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
easily	NULL
said	NULL
than	NULL
done	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
prevent	NULL
the	NULL
regrets	NULL
nor	NULL
stifle	NULL
the	NULL
misgivings	NULL
which	NULL
sometimes	NULL
tormented	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
young	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
few	NULL
friends	NULL
that	NULL
immortality	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
particular	NULL
attractions	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
without	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
belief	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
wretched	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
unreasonable	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
laugh	NULL
himself	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
pathos	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
tears	NULL
really	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
see	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
mother	NULL
whose	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
more	NULL
precious	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
years	NULL
since	NULL
her	NULL
death	NULL
passed	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
influence	NULL
of	NULL
innumerable	NULL
ancestors	NULL
,	NULL
Godfearing	NULL
and	NULL
devout	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
working	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
panic	NULL
fear	NULL
that	NULL
perhaps	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
up	NULL
there	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
sky	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
jealous	NULL
God	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
punish	NULL
in	NULL
everlasting	NULL
flames	NULL
the	NULL
atheist	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
these	NULL
times	NULL
his	NULL
reason	NULL
could	NULL
offer	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
help	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
imagined	NULL
the	NULL
anguish	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
physical	NULL
torment	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
last	NULL
endlessly	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
quite	NULL
sick	NULL
with	NULL
fear	NULL
and	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
violent	NULL
sweat	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
desperately	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
After	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
not	NULL
my	NULL
fault	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
force	NULL
myself	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL

If	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
God	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
punishes	NULL
me	NULL
because	NULL
I	NULL
honestly	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
Him	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
help	NULL

XXIX	NULL
Winter	NULL
set	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Weeks	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Berlin	NULL
to	NULL
attend	NULL
the	NULL
lectures	NULL
of	NULL
Paulssen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Hayward	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
South	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
local	NULL
theatre	NULL
opened	NULL
its	NULL
doors	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
and	NULL
Hayward	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
praiseworthy	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
improving	NULL
their	NULL
German	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
diverting	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
perfecting	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
language	NULL
than	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
sermons	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
found	NULL
themselves	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
revival	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
drama	NULL
.	NULL

Several	NULL
of	NULL
Ibsen	NULL
's	NULL
plays	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
repertory	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
;	NULL
Sudermann	NULL
's	NULL
Die	NULL
Ehre	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
play	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL
production	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
quiet	NULL
university	NULL
town	NULL
caused	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
excitement	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
extravagantly	NULL
praised	NULL
and	NULL
bitterly	NULL
attacked	NULL
;	NULL
other	NULL
dramatists	NULL
followed	NULL
with	NULL
plays	NULL
written	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
modern	NULL
influence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
witnessed	NULL
a	NULL
series	NULL
of	NULL
works	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
vileness	NULL
of	NULL
mankind	NULL
was	NULL
displayed	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
play	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
till	NULL
then	NULL
(	NULL
poor	NULL
touring	NULL
companies	NULL
sometimes	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Assembly	NULL
Rooms	NULL
at	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
,	NULL
partly	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
profession	NULL
,	NULL
partly	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
vulgar	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL
)	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
passion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stage	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
thrill	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
shabby	NULL
,	NULL
ill-lit	NULL
theatre	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
peculiarities	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
company	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
casting	NULL
could	NULL
tell	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
what	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
characteristics	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
persons	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
drama	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
difference	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
him	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
real	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
tortured	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
women	NULL
showed	NULL
to	NULL
remorseless	NULL
eyes	NULL
the	NULL
evil	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
hearts	NULL
:	NULL
a	NULL
fair	NULL
face	NULL
concealed	NULL
a	NULL
depraved	NULL
mind	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
virtuous	NULL
used	NULL
virtue	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
mask	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
their	NULL
secret	NULL
vice	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
seeming-strong	NULL
fainted	NULL
within	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
weakness	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
honest	NULL
were	NULL
corrupt	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
chaste	NULL
were	NULL
lewd	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
dwell	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
an	NULL
orgy	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
place	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
opened	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
was	NULL
foul	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
dregs	NULL
of	NULL
beer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stale	NULL
smoke	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
flaring	NULL
gas	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
laughter	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
most	NULL
you	NULL
sniggered	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hypocrite	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
fool	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
characters	NULL
expressed	NULL
themselves	NULL
in	NULL
cruel	NULL
words	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
wrung	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
hearts	NULL
by	NULL
shame	NULL
and	NULL
anguish	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
carried	NULL
away	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sordid	NULL
intensity	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
too	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
tavern	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bright	NULL
warmth	NULL
with	NULL
Hayward	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
a	NULL
sandwich	NULL
and	NULL
drink	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL
of	NULL
beer	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
round	NULL
were	NULL
little	NULL
groups	NULL
of	NULL
students	NULL
,	NULL
talking	NULL
and	NULL
laughing	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
sons	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
said	NULL
a	NULL
sharp	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
father	NULL
leaned	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
and	NULL
laughed	NULL
,	NULL
laughed	NULL
heartily	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
friendly	NULL
and	NULL
innocent	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
homeliness	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
thoughts	NULL
ran	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
do	NULL
feel	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
excitedly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
stay	NULL
here	NULL
much	NULL
longer	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
really	NULL
begin	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
experiences	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL
so	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
preparing	NULL
for	NULL
life	NULL
:	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
it	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
Hayward	NULL
left	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
home	NULL
by	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
exactly	NULL
reply	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
eager	NULL
questioning	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
merry	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
stupid	NULL
laugh	NULL
,	NULL
hinted	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
romantic	NULL
amour	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
quoted	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
lines	NULL
of	NULL
Rossetti	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
once	NULL
showed	NULL
Philip	NULL
a	NULL
sonnet	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
passion	NULL
and	NULL
purple	NULL
,	NULL
pessimism	NULL
and	NULL
pathos	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
packed	NULL
together	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
lady	NULL
called	NULL
Trude	NULL
.	NULL

Hayward	NULL
surrounded	NULL
his	NULL
sordid	NULL
and	NULL
vulgar	NULL
little	NULL
adventures	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
glow	NULL
of	NULL
poetry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
touched	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
Pericles	NULL
and	NULL
Pheidias	NULL
because	NULL
to	NULL
describe	NULL
the	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
attentions	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
hetaira	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
blunt	NULL
and	NULL
apt	NULL
,	NULL
provided	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
language	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
daytime	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
led	NULL
by	NULL
curiosity	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
street	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
bridge	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
neat	NULL
white	NULL
houses	NULL
and	NULL
green	NULL
shutters	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
Hayward	NULL
the	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Trude	NULL
lived	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
brutal	NULL
faces	NULL
and	NULL
painted	NULL
cheeks	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
doors	NULL
and	NULL
cried	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
fear	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
fled	NULL
in	NULL
horror	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
rough	NULL
hands	NULL
that	NULL
sought	NULL
to	NULL
detain	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
yearned	NULL
above	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
for	NULL
experience	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
ridiculous	NULL
because	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
age	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
all	NULL
fiction	NULL
taught	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
important	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
unfortunate	NULL
gift	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
things	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
reality	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
offered	NULL
him	NULL
differed	NULL
too	NULL
terribly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
ideal	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
dreams	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
wide	NULL
a	NULL
country	NULL

arid	NULL

precipitous	NULL

must	NULL
be	NULL
crossed	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
traveller	NULL
through	NULL
life	NULL
comes	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
acceptance	NULL
of	NULL
reality	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
an	NULL
illusion	NULL
that	NULL
youth	NULL
is	NULL
happy	NULL

an	NULL
illusion	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL

each	NULL
time	NULL
they	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
contact	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
bruised	NULL
and	NULL
wounded	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
looks	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
victims	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
conspiracy	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
books	NULL
they	NULL
read	NULL
,	NULL
ideal	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
necessity	NULL
of	NULL
selection	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
elders	NULL

who	NULL
look	NULL
back	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
rosy	NULL
haze	NULL
of	NULL
forgetfulness	NULL
,	NULL
prepare	NULL
them	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
unreal	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
must	NULL
discover	NULL
for	NULL
themselves	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
read	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
told	NULL
are	NULL
lies	NULL

lies	NULL

and	NULL
each	NULL
discovery	NULL
is	NULL
another	NULL
nail	NULL
driven	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
cross	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
strange	NULL
thing	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
each	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
gone	NULL
through	NULL
that	NULL
bitter	NULL
disillusionment	NULL
adds	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
turn	NULL
,	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
stronger	NULL
than	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
companionship	NULL
of	NULL
Hayward	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
possible	NULL
thing	NULL
for	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
saw	NULL
nothing	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
literary	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dangerous	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
deceived	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
sincerity	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
honestly	NULL
mistook	NULL
his	NULL
sensuality	NULL
for	NULL
romantic	NULL
emotion	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
vacillation	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
artistic	NULL
temperament	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
idleness	NULL
for	NULL
philosophic	NULL
calm	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
vulgar	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
effort	NULL
at	NULL
refinement	NULL
,	NULL
saw	NULL
everything	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
larger	NULL
than	NULL
life	NULL
size	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
outlines	NULL
blurred	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
golden	NULL
mist	NULL
of	NULL
sentimentality	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
lied	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
lied	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
lies	NULL
were	NULL
beautiful	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
idealist	NULL
.	NULL

XXX	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
restless	NULL
and	NULL
dissatisfied	NULL
.	NULL

Hayward	NULL
's	NULL
poetic	NULL
allusions	NULL
troubled	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
yearned	NULL
for	NULL
romance	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
least	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
that	NULL
an	NULL
incident	NULL
was	NULL
taking	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
Frau	NULL
Erlin	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
which	NULL
increased	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
preoccupation	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
sex	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
walks	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
hills	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
wandering	NULL
by	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
bow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
yards	NULL
further	NULL
on	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
the	NULL
Chinaman	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
evening	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
night	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
fallen	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
passed	NULL
two	NULL
people	NULL
walking	NULL
very	NULL
close	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

Hearing	NULL
his	NULL
footstep	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
separated	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
well	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
certain	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
and	NULL
Herr	NULL
Sung	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
rapid	NULL
movement	NULL
apart	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
walking	NULL
arm	NULL
in	NULL
arm	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
puzzled	NULL
and	NULL
surprised	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
paid	NULL
much	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
plain	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
square	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
blunt	NULL
features	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
sixteen	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
still	NULL
wore	NULL
her	NULL
long	NULL
fair	NULL
hair	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
plait	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
evening	NULL
at	NULL
supper	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
curiously	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
talked	NULL
little	NULL
at	NULL
meals	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
addressed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Where	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL
go	NULL
for	NULL
your	NULL
walk	NULL
today	NULL
,	NULL
Herr	NULL
Carey	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
walked	NULL
up	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
Konigstuhl	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
volunteered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
headache	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
Chinaman	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
sat	NULL
next	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
so	NULL
sorry	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
hope	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
better	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Fraulein	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
uneasy	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Did	NULL
you	NULL
meet	NULL
many	NULL
people	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
reddening	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
a	NULL
downright	NULL
lie	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
living	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
fancied	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
relief	NULL
passed	NULL
across	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
saw	NULL
them	NULL
lurking	NULL
in	NULL
dark	NULL
places	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
elderly	NULL
ladies	NULL
who	NULL
sat	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
discuss	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
a	NULL
scandal	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL
and	NULL
harassed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
winter	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
easy	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
then	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
her	NULL
house	NULL
full	NULL
.	NULL

Herr	NULL
Sung	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
customer	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
two	NULL
rooms	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
drank	NULL
a	NULL
bottle	NULL
of	NULL
Moselle	NULL
at	NULL
each	NULL
meal	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
charged	NULL
him	NULL
three	NULL
marks	NULL
a	NULL
bottle	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
profit	NULL
.	NULL

None	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
other	NULL
guests	NULL
drank	NULL
wine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
drink	NULL
beer	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
lose	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
parents	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
business	NULL
in	NULL
South	NULL
America	NULL
and	NULL
paid	NULL
well	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
's	NULL
motherly	NULL
care	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
uncle	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
Berlin	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
immediately	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
contented	NULL
herself	NULL
with	NULL
giving	NULL
them	NULL
both	NULL
severe	NULL
looks	NULL
at	NULL
table	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
rude	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Chinaman	NULL
,	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
incivility	NULL
to	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
elderly	NULL
ladies	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
content	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
were	NULL
widows	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
Dutchwoman	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
spinster	NULL
of	NULL
masculine	NULL
appearance	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
paid	NULL
the	NULL
smallest	NULL
possible	NULL
sum	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
pension	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
trouble	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
permanent	NULL
and	NULL
therefore	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
disgraceful	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
was	NULL
ceasing	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
respectable	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
tried	NULL
obstinacy	NULL
,	NULL
anger	NULL
,	NULL
tears	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
old	NULL
ladies	NULL
routed	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
assumption	NULL
of	NULL
virtuous	NULL
indignation	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
put	NULL
a	NULL
stop	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
luncheon	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
bed-room	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
very	NULL
seriously	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
amazement	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
adopted	NULL
a	NULL
brazen	NULL
attitude	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
proposed	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
about	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
chose	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Chinaman	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
anybody	NULL
's	NULL
business	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
threatened	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
uncle	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
Onkel	NULL
Heinrich	NULL
will	NULL
put	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
in	NULL
Berlin	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
much	NULL
nicer	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Herr	NULL
Sung	NULL
will	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
Berlin	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
tears	NULL
rolled	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
coarse	NULL
,	NULL
red	NULL
,	NULL
fat	NULL
cheeks	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
will	NULL
mean	NULL
three	NULL
rooms	NULL
empty	NULL
all	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
tried	NULL
another	NULL
plan	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
's	NULL
better	NULL
nature	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
sensible	NULL
,	NULL
tolerant	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
treated	NULL
her	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
grown	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
dreadful	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
Chinaman	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
yellow	NULL
skin	NULL
and	NULL
flat	NULL
nose	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
little	NULL
pig	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
!	NULL

That	NULL
's	NULL
what	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
horrible	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
filled	NULL
one	NULL
with	NULL
disgust	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Bitte	NULL
,	NULL
bitte	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
rapid	NULL
intake	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
breath	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
listen	NULL
to	NULL
anything	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
not	NULL
serious	NULL

"	NULL

gasped	NULL
Frau	NULL
Erlin	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
love	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL
Gott	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
horrified	NULL
surprise	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
naughtiness	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
's	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
innocent	NULL
,	NULL
folly	NULL
.	NULL

but	NULL
the	NULL
passion	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
revealed	NULL
everything	NULL
.	NULL

Cacilie	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
with	NULL
flaming	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
shrug	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Frau	NULL
Erlin	NULL
kept	NULL
the	NULL
details	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
interview	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
later	NULL
altered	NULL
the	NULL
arrangement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
asked	NULL
Herr	NULL
Sung	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
sit	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
unfailing	NULL
politeness	NULL
accepted	NULL
with	NULL
alacrity	NULL
.	NULL

Cacilie	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
indifferently	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
discovery	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
relations	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
known	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
household	NULL
made	NULL
them	NULL
more	NULL
shameless	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
secret	NULL
now	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
walks	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
afternoon	NULL
quite	NULL
openly	NULL
set	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
wander	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
hills	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
plain	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
said	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
placidity	NULL
of	NULL
Professor	NULL
Erlin	NULL
was	NULL
moved	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
insisted	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
should	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Chinaman	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
aside	NULL

he	NULL

The	NULL

there	NULL

snow	NULL

a	NULL

the	NULL

The	NULL

gave	NULL
an	NULL
exclamation	NULL

she	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
daughter	NULL

dismay	NULL

The	NULL

went	NULL
slowly	NULL
downstairs	NULL

The	NULL
Frau	NULL

left	NULL
the	NULL

listened	NULL

Presently	NULL

come	NULL
up	NULL

they	NULL
called	NULL
him	NULL

That	NULL

at	NULL

Fraulein	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
,	NULL
redder	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL

her	NULL

took	NULL
her	NULL

Herr	NULL

did	NULL

for	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
shirk	NULL
the	NULL
ordeal	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
smiling	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
little	NULL
eyes	NULL
dancing	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
apologies	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
late	NULL
arrival	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
insisted	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
on	NULL
pouring	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
Moselle	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
offered	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL
to	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Forster	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
hot	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
stove	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
alight	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
were	NULL
seldom	NULL
opened	NULL
.	NULL

Emil	NULL
blundered	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
succeeded	NULL
somehow	NULL
in	NULL
serving	NULL
everyone	NULL
quickly	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
order	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
three	NULL
old	NULL
ladies	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
visibly	NULL
disapproving	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
had	NULL
scarcely	NULL
recovered	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
tears	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
and	NULL
oppressed	NULL
.	NULL

Conversation	NULL
languished	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
dreadful	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
gathering	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
looked	NULL
different	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
hanging	NULL
lamps	NULL
from	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
looked	NULL
before	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
vaguely	NULL
uneasy	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
he	NULL
caught	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
's	NULL
eye	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
hatred	NULL
and	NULL
contempt	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
stifling	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
beastly	NULL
passion	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
pair	NULL
troubled	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
Oriental	NULL
depravity	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL
savour	NULL
of	NULL
joss-sticks	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
mystery	NULL
of	NULL
hidden	NULL
vices	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
their	NULL
breath	NULL
heavy	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
could	NULL
feel	NULL
the	NULL
beating	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
arteries	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
forehead	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
what	NULL
strange	NULL
emotion	NULL
distracted	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
something	NULL
infinitely	NULL
attractive	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
repelled	NULL
and	NULL
horrified	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
several	NULL
days	NULL
things	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
air	NULL
was	NULL
sickly	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
unnatural	NULL
passion	NULL
which	NULL
all	NULL
felt	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
nerves	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
household	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
exasperated	NULL
.	NULL

Only	NULL
Herr	NULL
Sung	NULL
remained	NULL
unaffected	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
less	NULL
smiling	NULL
,	NULL
affable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
polite	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
before	NULL
:	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
whether	NULL
his	NULL
manner	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
triumph	NULL
of	NULL
civilisation	NULL
or	NULL
an	NULL
expression	NULL
of	NULL
contempt	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Oriental	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
vanquished	NULL
West	NULL
.	NULL

Cacilie	NULL
was	NULL
flaunting	NULL
and	NULL
cynical	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
could	NULL
bear	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
panic	NULL
seized	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
Professor	NULL
Erlin	NULL
with	NULL
brutal	NULL
frankness	NULL
had	NULL
suggested	NULL
the	NULL
possible	NULL
consequences	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
intrigue	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
manifest	NULL
to	NULL
everyone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
good	NULL
name	NULL
in	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
repute	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
house	NULL
ruined	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
scandal	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
possibly	NULL
be	NULL
hidden	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
some	NULL
reason	NULL
,	NULL
blinded	NULL
perhaps	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
interests	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
possibility	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
wits	NULL
muddled	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
terrible	NULL
fear	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
be	NULL
prevented	NULL
from	NULL
turning	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
Anna	NULL
's	NULL
good	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
cautious	NULL
letter	NULL
was	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
uncle	NULL
in	NULL
Berlin	NULL
suggesting	NULL
that	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
having	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
lose	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
lodgers	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Frau	NULL
Professor	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
resist	NULL
the	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
of	NULL
giving	NULL
rein	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ill-temper	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
curbed	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
free	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
anything	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

Her	NULL
little	NULL

notwithstanding	NULL
her	NULL

she	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL

the	NULL

hurried	NULL
along	NULL

the	NULL

a	NULL
sofa	NULL

There	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL

The	NULL

gone	NULL
off	NULL

Emil	NULL

XXXI	NULL
Hayward	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
saying	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
South	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
delaying	NULL
from	NULL
week	NULL
to	NULL
week	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
inability	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bother	NULL
of	NULL
packing	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tedium	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
journey	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
been	NULL
driven	NULL
off	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
Christmas	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
preparations	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
festival	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
support	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Teutonic	NULL
merry-making	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
goose-flesh	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
's	NULL
aggressive	NULL
cheerfulness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
the	NULL
obvious	NULL
he	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
travel	NULL
on	NULL
Christmas	NULL
Eve	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sorry	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
downright	NULL
person	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
irritated	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
anybody	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
much	NULL
under	NULL
Hayward	NULL
's	NULL
influence	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
grant	NULL
that	NULL
indecision	NULL
pointed	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
charming	NULL
sensitiveness	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
resented	NULL
the	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sneer	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
Hayward	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
straight	NULL
ways	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
corresponded	NULL
.	NULL

Hayward	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
admirable	NULL
letter-writer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
knowing	NULL
his	NULL
talent	NULL
took	NULL
pains	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
letters	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
temperament	NULL
was	NULL
receptive	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
influences	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
contact	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
letters	NULL
from	NULL
Rome	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
a	NULL
subtle	NULL
fragrance	NULL
of	NULL
Italy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ancient	NULL
Romans	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
vulgar	NULL
,	NULL
finding	NULL
distinction	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
decadence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Empire	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
Rome	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Popes	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
sympathy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
chosen	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
exquisitely	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
appeared	NULL
a	NULL
rococo	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wrote	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
church	NULL
music	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Alban	NULL
Hills	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
languor	NULL
of	NULL
incense	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
charm	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
by	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rain	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
pavements	NULL
shone	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
lamps	NULL
was	NULL
mysterious	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
repeated	NULL
these	NULL
admirable	NULL
letters	NULL
to	NULL
various	NULL
friends	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
troubling	NULL
effect	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
upon	NULL
Philip	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
very	NULL
humdrum	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
Hayward	NULL
grew	NULL
dithyrambic	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
proposed	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
should	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Italy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
wasting	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
at	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Germans	NULL
were	NULL
gross	NULL
and	NULL
life	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
common	NULL
;	NULL
how	NULL
could	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
prim	NULL
landscape	NULL
?	NULL

In	NULL
Tuscany	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
was	NULL
scattering	NULL
flowers	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
nineteen	NULL
;	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
wander	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
mountain	NULL
towns	NULL
of	NULL
Umbria	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
names	NULL
sang	NULL
in	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
lover	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
Italy	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
seized	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
restlessness	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
account	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
cursed	NULL
his	NULL
fate	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
travel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
send	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
fifteen	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
agreed	NULL
upon	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
managed	NULL
his	NULL
allowance	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
pension	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
price	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
lessons	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
going	NULL
about	NULL
with	NULL
Hayward	NULL
expensive	NULL
.	NULL

Hayward	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
suggested	NULL
excursions	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
visit	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
bottle	NULL
of	NULL
wine	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
month	NULL
's	NULL
money	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
folly	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
age	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
unwilling	NULL
to	NULL
confess	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
afford	NULL
an	NULL
extravagance	NULL
.	NULL

Luckily	NULL
Hayward	NULL
's	NULL
letters	NULL
came	NULL
seldom	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
intervals	NULL
Philip	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
industrious	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
matriculated	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
university	NULL
and	NULL
attended	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
courses	NULL
of	NULL
lectures	NULL
.	NULL

Kuno	NULL
Fischer	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
height	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fame	NULL
and	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
lecturing	NULL
brilliantly	NULL
on	NULL
Schopenhauer	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
introduction	NULL
to	NULL
philosophy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
practical	NULL
mind	NULL
and	NULL
moved	NULL
uneasily	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
abstract	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
an	NULL
unexpected	NULL
fascination	NULL
in	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
metaphysical	NULL
disquisitions	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
breathless	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
like	NULL
watching	NULL
a	NULL
tight-rope	NULL
dancer	NULL
doing	NULL
perilous	NULL
feats	NULL
over	NULL
an	NULL
abyss	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
exciting	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pessimism	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
attracted	NULL
his	NULL
youth	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
pitiless	NULL
woe	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
none	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
eager	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
due	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
,	NULL
acting	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
correspondent	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
guardian	NULL
's	NULL
views	NULL
,	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
England	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
agreed	NULL
with	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
now	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
July	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
talk	NULL
things	NULL
over	NULL
during	NULL
August	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
arrangements	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
date	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
departure	NULL
was	NULL
settled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
reminded	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
,	NULL
through	NULL
whose	NULL
kindness	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
Frau	NULL
Erlin	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
at	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
arranged	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
crossing	NULL
from	NULL
Flushing	NULL
on	NULL
such	NULL
and	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
travelled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
come	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
company	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
shyness	NULL
immediately	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
leave	NULL
till	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
afterwards	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
pictured	NULL
himself	NULL
looking	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
embarrassment	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
asking	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
she	NULL
(	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
so	NULL
easily	NULL
address	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
person	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
snubbed	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
difficulty	NULL
of	NULL
knowing	NULL
whether	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
or	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
ignore	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
read	NULL
his	NULL
book	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
without	NULL
regret	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
happy	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

Fraulein	NULL
Anna	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
copy	NULL
of	NULL
Der	NULL
Trompeter	NULL
von	NULL
Sackingen	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
return	NULL
he	NULL
presented	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
volume	NULL
of	NULL
William	NULL
Morris	NULL
.	NULL

Very	NULL
wisely	NULL
neither	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
ever	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
's	NULL
present	NULL
.	NULL

XXXII	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
and	NULL
aunt	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
noticed	NULL
before	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
quite	NULL
old	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Vicar	NULL
received	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
unamiable	NULL
indifference	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
stouter	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
balder	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
grayer	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
how	NULL
insignificant	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
weak	NULL
and	NULL
self-indulgent	NULL
.	NULL

Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
tears	NULL
of	NULL
happiness	NULL
flowed	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
touched	NULL
and	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
known	NULL
with	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
hungry	NULL
love	NULL
she	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
has	NULL
seemed	NULL
long	NULL
since	NULL
you	NULL
've	NULL
been	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
cried	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stroked	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
glad	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
've	NULL
grown	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
're	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
small	NULL
moustache	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
upper	NULL
lip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
a	NULL
razor	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
infinite	NULL
care	NULL
shaved	NULL
the	NULL
down	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
smooth	NULL
chin	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
've	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
lonely	NULL
without	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
shyly	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
break	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
are	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
your	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
are	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
thin	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
almost	NULL
transparent	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
arms	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
round	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL
were	NULL
frail	NULL
bones	NULL
that	NULL
reminded	NULL
you	NULL
of	NULL
chicken	NULL
bones	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
faded	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
oh	NULL
!	NULL

so	NULL
wrinkled	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
gray	NULL
curls	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
still	NULL
wore	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fashion	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
youth	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
,	NULL
pathetic	NULL
look	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
withered	NULL
body	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
autumn	NULL
leaf	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
blown	NULL
away	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
sharp	NULL
wind	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
with	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
quiet	NULL
little	NULL
people	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
belonged	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
past	NULL
generation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
waiting	NULL
there	NULL
patiently	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
stupidly	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
death	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
vigour	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
youth	NULL
,	NULL
thirsting	NULL
for	NULL
excitement	NULL
and	NULL
adventure	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
appalled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
waste	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
pity	NULL
for	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
suddenly	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
kept	NULL
discreetly	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
Careys	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
welcoming	NULL
their	NULL
nephew	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
This	NULL
is	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
prodigal	NULL
has	NULL
returned	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
holding	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
brought	NULL
a	NULL
rose	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
prodigal	NULL
's	NULL
buttonhole	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
gay	NULL
smile	NULL
she	NULL
pinned	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
coat	NULL
the	NULL
flower	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
picked	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
blushed	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
foolish	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
daughter	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
Uncle	NULL
William	NULL
's	NULL
last	NULL
rector	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
wide	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
daughters	NULL
of	NULL
clergymen	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
wore	NULL
ill-cut	NULL
clothes	NULL
and	NULL
stout	NULL
boots	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
generally	NULL
dressed	NULL
in	NULL
black	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
in	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
early	NULL
years	NULL
at	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
homespuns	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
reached	NULL
East	NULL
Anglia	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
ladies	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
clergy	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
favour	NULL
colours	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
very	NULL
untidily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
smelt	NULL
aggressively	NULL
of	NULL
starched	NULL
linen	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
considered	NULL
the	NULL
feminine	NULL
graces	NULL
unbecoming	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
whether	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
old	NULL
or	NULL
young	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
bore	NULL
their	NULL
religion	NULL
arrogantly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
closeness	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
connection	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
made	NULL
them	NULL
adopt	NULL
a	NULL
slightly	NULL
dictatorial	NULL
attitude	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
mankind	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
different	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
muslin	NULL
gown	NULL
stamped	NULL
with	NULL
gay	NULL
little	NULL
bunches	NULL
of	NULL
flowers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pointed	NULL
,	NULL
high-heeled	NULL
shoes	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
open-work	NULL
stockings	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
inexperience	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
wonderfully	NULL
dressed	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
frock	NULL
was	NULL
cheap	NULL
and	NULL
showy	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
elaborately	NULL
dressed	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
neat	NULL
curl	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
forehead	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
black	NULL
,	NULL
shiny	NULL
and	NULL
hard	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
disarranged	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
large	NULL
black	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
nose	NULL
was	NULL
slightly	NULL
aquiline	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
profile	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
somewhat	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bird	NULL
of	NULL
prey	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
full	NULL
face	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
prepossessing	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
smiled	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
was	NULL
large	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
smiled	NULL
she	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
her	NULL
teeth	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
big	NULL
and	NULL
rather	NULL
yellow	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
what	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
Philip	NULL
most	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
heavily	NULL
powdered	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
very	NULL
strict	NULL
views	NULL
on	NULL
feminine	NULL
behaviour	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
a	NULL
lady	NULL
ever	NULL
powdered	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lady	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
's	NULL
daughter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
dislike	NULL
her	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
spoke	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
French	NULL
accent	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
born	NULL
and	NULL
bred	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
her	NULL
smile	NULL
affected	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
coy	NULL
sprightliness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
manner	NULL
irritated	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
he	NULL
remained	NULL
silent	NULL
and	NULL
hostile	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
apparently	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
notice	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
affable	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
addressed	NULL
her	NULL
conversation	NULL
almost	NULL
exclusively	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
flattering	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
she	NULL
appealed	NULL
constantly	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
sane	NULL
judgment	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
laugh	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
resist	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
amused	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
gift	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
of	NULL
saying	NULL
neat	NULL
things	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
appreciative	NULL
listener	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
nor	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
humour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
never	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
anything	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
shyness	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
like	NULL
her	NULL
better	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
French	NULL
accent	NULL
picturesque	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
garden	NULL
party	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
gave	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
dressed	NULL
than	NULL
anyone	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
blue	NULL
foulard	NULL
with	NULL
large	NULL
white	NULL
spots	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
tickled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sensation	NULL
it	NULL
caused	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
certain	NULL
they	NULL
think	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
no	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
you	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
laughing	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
dream	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
life	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
abandoned	NULL
hussy	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
how	NULL
old	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
should	NULL
never	NULL
ask	NULL
a	NULL
lady	NULL
's	NULL
age	NULL

but	NULL
she	NULL
's	NULL
certainly	NULL
too	NULL
old	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
Vicar	NULL
gave	NULL
his	NULL
slow	NULL
,	NULL
obese	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
's	NULL
no	NULL
chicken	NULL
,	NULL
Louisa	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
grown	NULL
up	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
Lincolnshire	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
pigtail	NULL
hanging	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
may	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
ten	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
was	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
near	NULL
twenty	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
no	NULL
,	NULL
William	NULL
.	NULL

Sixteen	NULL
or	NULL
seventeen	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
outside	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
well	NULL
over	NULL
thirty	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
tripped	NULL
downstairs	NULL
,	NULL
singing	NULL
a	NULL
song	NULL
by	NULL
Benjamin	NULL
Goddard	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
hat	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
walk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
held	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
button	NULL
her	NULL
glove	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
awkwardly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
but	NULL
gallant	NULL
.	NULL

Conversation	NULL
went	NULL
easily	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
strolled	NULL
along	NULL
they	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
about	NULL
Berlin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
year	NULL
in	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
,	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
appeared	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
importance	NULL
gained	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
interest	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
described	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
at	NULL
Frau	NULL
Erlin	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conversations	NULL
between	NULL
Hayward	NULL
and	NULL
Weeks	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
significant	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
twist	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
looked	NULL
absurd	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
flattered	NULL
at	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
's	NULL
laughter	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
quite	NULL
frightened	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
so	NULL
sarcastic	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
playfully	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
love	NULL
affairs	NULL
at	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
.	NULL

Without	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
frankly	NULL
answered	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
secretive	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
At	NULL
your	NULL
age	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
likely	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
blushed	NULL
and	NULL
laughed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ah	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
laughed	NULL
triumphantly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Look	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
blushing	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
pleased	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
sad	NULL
dog	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
changed	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
believe	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
romantic	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
conceal	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
no	NULL
opportunity	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
was	NULL
dissatisfied	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
lot	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
resented	NULL
having	NULL
to	NULL
earn	NULL
her	NULL
living	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
uncle	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
fortune	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
his	NULL
cook	NULL
and	NULL
changed	NULL
his	NULL
will	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
hinted	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
luxury	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
compared	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
Lincolnshire	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
horses	NULL
to	NULL
ride	NULL
and	NULL
carriages	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
mean	NULL
dependence	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
present	NULL
state	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
puzzled	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
mentioned	NULL
this	NULL
afterwards	NULL
to	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
Wilkinsons	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
anything	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
pony	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
dog-cart	NULL
;	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rich	NULL
uncle	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
married	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
children	NULL
before	NULL
Emily	NULL
was	NULL
born	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
much	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
inheriting	NULL
his	NULL
fortune	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
had	NULL
little	NULL
good	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
of	NULL
Berlin	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
situation	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
complained	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vulgarity	NULL
of	NULL
German	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
compared	NULL
it	NULL
bitterly	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
brilliance	NULL
of	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
a	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
how	NULL
many	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
governess	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fashionable	NULL
portrait-painter	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
a	NULL
Jewish	NULL
wife	NULL
of	NULL
means	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
house	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
many	NULL
distinguished	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
dazzled	NULL
Philip	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
names	NULL
.	NULL

Actors	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Comedie	NULL
Francaise	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
frequently	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Coquelin	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
next	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
met	NULL
a	NULL
foreigner	NULL
who	NULL
spoke	NULL
such	NULL
perfect	NULL
French	NULL
.	NULL

Alphonse	NULL
Daudet	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
copy	NULL
of	NULL
Sappho	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
her	NULL
name	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL
to	NULL
remind	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
treasured	NULL
the	NULL
volume	NULL
none	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
lend	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
Maupassant	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
rippling	NULL
laugh	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
knowingly	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
writer	NULL
!	NULL

Hayward	NULL
had	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
Maupassant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
reputation	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
unknown	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Did	NULL
he	NULL
make	NULL
love	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
words	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
stick	NULL
funnily	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
throat	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
them	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
liked	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
thrilled	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
conversation	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
imagine	NULL
anyone	NULL
making	NULL
love	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL

she	NULL
cried	NULL

"	NULL

made	NULL
love	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL
habit	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
break	NULL
himself	NULL
of	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
sighed	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
back	NULL
tenderly	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
charming	NULL
man	NULL

she	NULL
murmured	NULL

A	NULL
greater	NULL
experience	NULL

Philip	NULL

all	NULL
about	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
excitedly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
's	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
truthfully	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
manner	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
convey	NULL
that	NULL
three	NULL
volumes	NULL
would	NULL
scarcely	NULL
have	NULL
contained	NULL
the	NULL
lurid	NULL
facts	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
must	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
curious	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
Paris	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
loved	NULL
the	NULL
boulevards	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Bois	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
grace	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
street	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Champs	NULL
Elysees	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
distinction	NULL
which	NULL
trees	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
elsewhere	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
sitting	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
stile	NULL
now	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
high-road	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
looked	NULL
with	NULL
disdain	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
stately	NULL
elms	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
theatres	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
plays	NULL
were	NULL
brilliant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
acting	NULL
was	NULL
incomparable	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
often	NULL
went	NULL
with	NULL
Madame	NULL
Foyot	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
mother	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
educating	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
on	NULL
clothes	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
misery	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
poor	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
cried	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
These	NULL
beautiful	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
they	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
afford	NULL
them	NULL
!	NULL

Poor	NULL
Madame	NULL
Foyot	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
figure	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
the	NULL
dressmaker	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
whisper	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
:	NULL
'	NULL
Ah	NULL
,	NULL
Mademoiselle	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
only	NULL
had	NULL
your	NULL
figure	NULL

'	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
noticed	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
robust	NULL
form	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Men	NULL
are	NULL
so	NULL
stupid	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
only	NULL

The	NULL
French	NULL

who	NULL
are	NULL
a	NULL
nation	NULL
of	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
things	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
observed	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
's	NULL
ankles	NULL
were	NULL
thick	NULL
and	NULL
ungainly	NULL

He	NULL
withdrew	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL

Why	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL

You	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
laughed	NULL
slyly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
must	NULL
look	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL

how	NULL

are	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
absurd	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
evidently	NULL
expected	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
behave	NULL
very	NULL
differently	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
delighted	NULL

things	NULL

they	NULL
never	NULL

him	NULL

when	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
afraid	NULL

himself	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

sighed	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL

Philip	NULL
nodded	NULL

not	NULL
knowing	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL

but	NULL
vaguely	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL

she	NULL
spoke	NULL
well	NULL

"	NULL
Once	NULL

She	NULL
paused	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL

Philip	NULL

her	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
laugh	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
art-student	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
her	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
paid	NULL
no	NULL
particular	NULL
attention	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
fine	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
very	NULL
politely	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
slipped	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
adored	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
months	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
.	NULL

Oh	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
charming	NULL
letter	NULL
!	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
reply	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
what	NULL
woman	NULL
could	NULL
help	NULL
being	NULL
flattered	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
another	NULL
letter	NULL
!	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
wonderful	NULL
,	NULL
passionate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
touching	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
next	NULL
she	NULL
met	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
which	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
the	NULL
letters	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
begged	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL

vers	NULL
neuf	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
ring	NULL
and	NULL
ring	NULL

she	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
open	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL

then	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
tinkling	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL

suddenly	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL

door	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

what	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
replied	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
ripple	NULL
of	NULL
laughter	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
quickly	NULL

and	NULL
strange	NULL
emotions	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
hustling	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
staircase	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
chance	NULL
meetings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
admired	NULL
the	NULL
boldness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
letters	NULL
--	NULL
oh	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
dared	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
mysterious	NULL
entrance	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
soul	NULL
of	NULL
romance	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
like	NULL

Oh	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
irritation	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
treated	NULL

abominably	NULL

are	NULL
always	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
embarrassment	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
us	NULL
go	NULL
home	NULL

said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
.	NULL

XXXIII	NULL
Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
's	NULL
story	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
enough	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
even	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
cut	NULL
it	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
shocked	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
for	NULL
married	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
enough	NULL
French	NULL
novels	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
France	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
indeed	NULL
the	NULL
rule	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
was	NULL
English	NULL
and	NULL
unmarried	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
it	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
art-student	NULL
probably	NULL
was	NULL
neither	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
nor	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
lovers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
gasped	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
incredible	NULL
that	NULL
anyone	NULL
should	NULL
make	NULL
love	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
his	NULL
ingenuousness	NULL
he	NULL
doubted	NULL
her	NULL
story	NULL
as	NULL
little	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
doubted	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
in	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL
that	NULL
such	NULL
wonderful	NULL
things	NULL
never	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
humiliating	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
insisted	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
telling	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
adventures	NULL
in	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
invention	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sure	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
persuade	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
steeped	NULL
in	NULL
vice	NULL
;	NULL
women	NULL
were	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
intuition	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
easily	NULL
discover	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
fibbing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
blushed	NULL
scarlet	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
laughing	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
sleeve	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
played	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
and	NULL
sang	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
tired	NULL
voice	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
songs	NULL
,	NULL
Massenet	NULL
,	NULL

were	NULL

and	NULL
together	NULL
they	NULL
spent	NULL
many	NULL
hours	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
she	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
voice	NULL
and	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
trying	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
baritone	NULL
and	NULL
offered	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
lessons	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
bashfulness	NULL
he	NULL
refused	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
insisted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
every	NULL
morning	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
convenient	NULL
time	NULL
after	NULL
breakfast	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
's	NULL
lesson	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
natural	NULL
gift	NULL
for	NULL
teaching	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
governess	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
method	NULL
and	NULL
firmness	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
her	NULL
French	NULL
accent	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
remained	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
mellifluousness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
manner	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
engaged	NULL
in	NULL
teaching	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
nonsense	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
voice	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
peremptory	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
instinctively	NULL
she	NULL
suppressed	NULL
inattention	NULL
and	NULL
corrected	NULL
slovenliness	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
scales	NULL
and	NULL
exercises	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
lesson	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
she	NULL
resumed	NULL
without	NULL
effort	NULL
her	NULL
seductive	NULL
smiles	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
became	NULL
again	NULL
soft	NULL
and	NULL
winning	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
easily	NULL
put	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
pupil	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
the	NULL
pedagogue	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
impression	NULL
convicted	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
feelings	NULL
her	NULL
stories	NULL
had	NULL
aroused	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
more	NULL
narrowly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
liked	NULL
her	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
than	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
lined	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
skin	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
neck	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
rough	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
hide	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
warm	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
wore	NULL
blouses	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
cut	NULL
low	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
white	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
suit	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
night	NULL
she	NULL
often	NULL
looked	NULL
very	NULL
attractive	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
gown	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
a	NULL
dinner	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
chain	NULL
of	NULL
garnets	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
neck	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
lace	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
bosom	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
elbows	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
softness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
scent	NULL
she	NULL
wore	NULL
(	NULL
at	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
used	NULL
anything	NULL
but	NULL
Eau	NULL
de	NULL
Cologne	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
only	NULL
on	NULL
Sundays	NULL
or	NULL
when	NULL
suffering	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
sick	NULL
headache	NULL
)	NULL
was	NULL
troubling	NULL
and	NULL
exotic	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
really	NULL
looked	NULL
very	NULL
young	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
exercised	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
age	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
added	NULL
twenty	NULL
and	NULL
seventeen	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bring	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
total	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
was	NULL
thirty-seven	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
look	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
thirty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
everyone	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
foreigners	NULL
aged	NULL
more	NULL
rapidly	NULL
than	NULL
English	NULL
women	NULL
;	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
abroad	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
almost	NULL
be	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
foreigner	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
personally	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL
her	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
twenty-six	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
's	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
accuracy	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Careys	NULL
'	NULL
statements	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
they	NULL
distinctly	NULL
remembered	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
got	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
time	NULL
they	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
Lincolnshire	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
twelve	NULL
then	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
so	NULL
unreliable	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
people	NULL
used	NULL
round	NULL
figures	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
eighteen	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
seventeen	NULL
.	NULL

Seventeen	NULL
and	NULL
twelve	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
twenty-nine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hang	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

Cleopatra	NULL
was	NULL
forty-eight	NULL
when	NULL
Antony	NULL
threw	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
sake	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
summer	NULL
.	NULL

Day	NULL
after	NULL
day	NULL
was	NULL
hot	NULL
and	NULL
cloudless	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
heat	NULL
was	NULL
tempered	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
exhilaration	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
excited	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
oppressed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
August	NULL
sunshine	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pond	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
fountain	NULL
played	NULL
;	NULL
water	NULL
lilies	NULL
grew	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
gold	NULL
fish	NULL
sunned	NULL
themselves	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
surface	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
rugs	NULL
and	NULL
cushions	NULL
there	NULL
after	NULL
dinner	NULL
and	NULL
lie	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
lawn	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shade	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
hedge	NULL
of	NULL
roses	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
talked	NULL
and	NULL
read	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
smoked	NULL
cigarettes	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
allow	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
smoking	NULL
a	NULL
disgusting	NULL
habit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
used	NULL
frequently	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
disgraceful	NULL
for	NULL
anyone	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
a	NULL
slave	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
habit	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
forgot	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
slave	NULL
to	NULL
afternoon	NULL
tea	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
gave	NULL
Philip	NULL
La	NULL
Vie	NULL
de	NULL
Boheme	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
by	NULL
accident	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
rummaging	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
books	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
's	NULL
study	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
bought	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
with	NULL
something	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
wanted	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
remained	NULL
undiscovered	NULL
for	NULL
ten	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
Murger	NULL
's	NULL
fascinating	NULL
,	NULL
ill-written	NULL
,	NULL
absurd	NULL
masterpiece	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
under	NULL
its	NULL
spell	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
soul	NULL
danced	NULL
with	NULL
joy	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
picture	NULL
of	NULL
starvation	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
good-humoured	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
squalor	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
picturesque	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
sordid	NULL
love	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
romantic	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL

which	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
moving	NULL

Rodolphe	NULL
and	NULL
Mimi	NULL
,	NULL
Musette	NULL
and	NULL
Schaunard	NULL
!	NULL

They	NULL
wander	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
streets	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Latin	NULL
Quarter	NULL
,	NULL
finding	NULL
refuge	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
attic	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
quaint	NULL
costumes	NULL
of	NULL
Louis	NULL
Philippe	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
tears	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
smiles	NULL
,	NULL
happy-go-lucky	NULL
and	NULL
reckless	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
can	NULL
resist	NULL
them	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
book	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sounder	NULL
judgment	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
find	NULL
how	NULL
gross	NULL
their	NULL
pleasures	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
vulgar	NULL
their	NULL
minds	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
feel	NULL
the	NULL
utter	NULL
worthlessness	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
artists	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
human	NULL
beings	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
gay	NULL
procession	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
enraptured	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
wish	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
,	NULL
smiling	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL
now	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
fortnight	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
Germany	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
much	NULL
discussion	NULL
between	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
future	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
refused	NULL
definitely	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Oxford	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
getting	NULL
scholarships	NULL
even	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
afford	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
entire	NULL
fortune	NULL
had	NULL
consisted	NULL
of	NULL
only	NULL
two	NULL
thousand	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
invested	NULL
in	NULL
mortgages	NULL
at	NULL
five	NULL
per	NULL
cent	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
interest	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
reduced	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
absurd	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
two	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
live	NULL
on	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
university	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
at	NULL
Oxford	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
lead	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
nearer	NULL
to	NULL
earning	NULL
his	NULL
living	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
straight	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
thought	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
four	NULL
professions	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Army	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Navy	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Law	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
added	NULL
medicine	NULL
because	NULL
her	NULL
brother-in-law	NULL
practised	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
forget	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
young	NULL
days	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
ever	NULL
considered	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
two	NULL
were	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
firm	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
refusal	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
ordained	NULL
.	NULL

Only	NULL
the	NULL
law	NULL
remained	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
local	NULL
doctor	NULL
had	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
many	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
now	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
for	NULL
engineering	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
opposed	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
trade	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
profession	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
answered	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
doctor	NULL
like	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
hate	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sorry	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Bar	NULL
seemed	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
Oxford	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Careys	NULL
were	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
degree	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
success	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
calling	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
finally	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
become	NULL
articled	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
solicitor	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
lawyer	NULL
,	NULL
Albert	NULL
Nixon	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
co-executor	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
of	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
late	NULL
Henry	NULL
Carey	NULL
's	NULL
estate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
the	NULL
answer	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
vacancy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
opposed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
scheme	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
profession	NULL
was	NULL
greatly	NULL
overcrowded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
capital	NULL
or	NULL
connections	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
small	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
becoming	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
managing	NULL
clerk	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
suggested	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
should	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
chartered	NULL
accountant	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
nor	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
knew	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
what	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
anyone	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
chartered	NULL
accountant	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
another	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
solicitor	NULL
explained	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
growth	NULL
of	NULL
modern	NULL
businesses	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
increase	NULL
of	NULL
companies	NULL
had	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
formation	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
firms	NULL
of	NULL
accountants	NULL
to	NULL
examine	NULL
the	NULL
books	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
financial	NULL
affairs	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
clients	NULL
an	NULL
order	NULL
which	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
methods	NULL
had	NULL
lacked	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
a	NULL
Royal	NULL
Charter	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
obtained	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
profession	NULL
was	NULL
becoming	NULL
every	NULL
year	NULL
more	NULL
respectable	NULL
,	NULL
lucrative	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
important	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
chartered	NULL
accountants	NULL
whom	NULL
Albert	NULL
Nixon	NULL
had	NULL
employed	NULL
for	NULL
thirty	NULL
years	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
vacancy	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
articled	NULL
pupil	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
Philip	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
fee	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

Half	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
returned	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
the	NULL
articles	NULL
lasted	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
salary	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
prospect	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
exciting	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
decide	NULL
on	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
living	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
over-balanced	NULL
the	NULL
slight	NULL
shrinking	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Vicar	NULL
of	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Nixon	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
profession	NULL
suited	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Nixon	NULL
replied	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
Charter	NULL
,	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
into	NULL
it	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
public	NULL
schools	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
university	NULL
;	NULL
moreover	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
Philip	NULL
disliked	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
,	NULL
Herbert	NULL
Carter	NULL

for	NULL

half	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
paid	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
articles	NULL

This	NULL
settled	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
arranged	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
should	NULL
start	NULL
work	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
fifteenth	NULL
of	NULL
September	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
full	NULL
month	NULL
before	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
then	NULL
you	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
freedom	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
to	NULL
bondage	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
returned	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
holidays	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
last	NULL
six	NULL
weeks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
leaving	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
before	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wonder	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
shall	NULL
ever	NULL
meet	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
speak	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
practical	NULL
way	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
knew	NULL
anyone	NULL
so	NULL
unsentimental	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
reddened	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
would	NULL
think	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
milksop	NULL
:	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
sometimes	NULL
quite	NULL
pretty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
on	NULL
for	NULL
twenty	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
absurd	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
art	NULL
and	NULL
literature	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
love	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
talked	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
art-student	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Rue	NULL
Breda	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
painter	NULL
in	NULL
whose	NULL
family	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
love	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
violently	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
invent	NULL
excuses	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
enough	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
was	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
attentions	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
straw	NULL
hat	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
hot	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
hottest	NULL
day	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
beads	NULL
of	NULL
sweat	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
line	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
upper	NULL
lip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
called	NULL
to	NULL
mind	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
and	NULL
Herr	NULL
Sung	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
amorous	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
plain	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
seemed	NULL
very	NULL
romantic	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
romance	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
was	NULL
practically	NULL
French	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
added	NULL
zest	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
possible	NULL
adventure	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
by	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
reading	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thrilled	NULL
by	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
less	NULL
picturesque	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
all	NULL
events	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
surprised	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
love	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
odd	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
no	NULL
sign	NULL
:	NULL
perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
his	NULL
fancy	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
suspicion	NULL
of	NULL
contempt	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
A	NULL
penny	NULL
for	NULL
your	NULL
thoughts	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
her	NULL
there	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
expected	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
preliminary	NULL
business	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
just	NULL
think	NULL
him	NULL
mad	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
slap	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
complain	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
how	NULL
Herr	NULL
Sung	NULL
had	NULL
started	NULL
with	NULL
Fraulein	NULL
Cacilie	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
beastly	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
and	NULL
Josiah	NULL
Graves	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
look	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL
fool	NULL
.	NULL

Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
kept	NULL
on	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
was	NULL
thirty-seven	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
shuddered	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ridicule	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
exposed	NULL
to	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
old	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Twopence	NULL
for	NULL
your	NULL
thoughts	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
smiled	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
about	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
boldly	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
events	NULL
committed	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
were	NULL
you	NULL
thinking	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Ah	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
you	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Naughty	NULL
boy	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
again	NULL
!	NULL

Whenever	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
working	NULL
himself	NULL
up	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
reminded	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
governess	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
called	NULL
him	NULL
playfully	NULL
a	NULL
naughty	NULL
boy	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
sing	NULL
his	NULL
exercises	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
quite	NULL
sulky	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
treat	NULL
me	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL
cross	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Very	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
lately	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
fancied	NULL
she	NULL
slightly	NULL
pressed	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
next	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
adventure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
ordinary	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
more	NULL
glamour	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
many	NULL
descriptions	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
in	NULL
himself	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
uprush	NULL
of	NULL
emotion	NULL
which	NULL
novelists	NULL
described	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
carried	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
in	NULL
wave	NULL
upon	NULL
wave	NULL
of	NULL
passion	NULL
;	NULL
nor	NULL
was	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
the	NULL
ideal	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
pictured	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
violet	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
alabaster	NULL
skin	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
lovely	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
burying	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rippling	NULL
masses	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
auburn	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
imagine	NULL
himself	NULL
burying	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
in	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
's	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
always	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
sticky	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
intrigue	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thrilled	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
legitimate	NULL
pride	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
enjoy	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
conquest	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
owed	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
seduce	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
;	NULL
not	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
easier	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
would	NULL
follow	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
kiss	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
swore	NULL
an	NULL
oath	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
effect	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
laid	NULL
his	NULL
plans	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
supper	NULL
he	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
stroll	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
accepted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
sauntered	NULL
side	NULL
by	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
nervous	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
lead	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
direction	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
waist	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
suddenly	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
waist	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
regatta	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
held	NULL
next	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
led	NULL
her	NULL
artfully	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
darkest	NULL
parts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
having	NULL
arrived	NULL
there	NULL
his	NULL
courage	NULL
failed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
bench	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
really	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
opportunity	NULL
when	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
earwigs	NULL
and	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
moving	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
walked	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
promised	NULL
himself	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
plunge	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
bench	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
saw	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
standing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Had	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
young	NULL
people	NULL
better	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL
sure	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
air	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Perhaps	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
go	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
of	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
attempt	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
alone	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
furious	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL
fool	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
expected	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
otherwise	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
only	NULL
Frenchmen	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
treat	NULL
women	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
French	NULL
novels	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
Frenchman	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
seized	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
passionately	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
adored	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
pressed	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
nuque	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
Frenchmen	NULL
always	NULL
kissed	NULL
ladies	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
nuque	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
himself	NULL
see	NULL
anything	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
attractive	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
nape	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
neck	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
easier	NULL
for	NULL
Frenchmen	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
language	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
aid	NULL
;	NULL
Philip	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
help	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
passionate	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
English	NULL
sounded	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
absurd	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
undertaken	NULL
the	NULL
siege	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
's	NULL
virtue	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
fortnight	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
jolly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
wretched	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
respect	NULL
himself	NULL
again	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
irrevocably	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
night	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
kiss	NULL
her	NULL
without	NULL
fail	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
raining	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
thought	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
high	NULL
spirits	NULL
at	NULL
breakfast	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
sent	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
headache	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
remain	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
till	NULL
tea-time	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
appeared	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
becoming	NULL
wrapper	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
pale	NULL
face	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
recovered	NULL
by	NULL
supper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
meal	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
cheerful	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
prayers	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
straight	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
kissed	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Good	NULL
gracious	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
cried	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
you	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
laughed	NULL
and	NULL
held	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
distinctly	NULL
pressed	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
following	NULL
day	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
cloud	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
was	NULL
sweet	NULL
and	NULL
fresh	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
rain	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
beach	NULL
to	NULL
bathe	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
home	NULL
ate	NULL
a	NULL
magnificent	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
tennis	NULL
party	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
dress	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
certainly	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
wear	NULL
her	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
noticing	NULL
how	NULL
elegant	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
beside	NULL
the	NULL
curate	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
's	NULL
married	NULL
daughter	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
roses	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
waistband	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
garden	NULL
chair	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lawn	NULL
,	NULL
holding	NULL
a	NULL
red	NULL
parasol	NULL
over	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
becoming	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
tennis	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
served	NULL
well	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
ran	NULL
clumsily	NULL
played	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
net	NULL
:	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
his	NULL
club-foot	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
quick	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
ball	NULL
past	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
pleased	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
won	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
sets	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
tea	NULL
he	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
's	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
hot	NULL
and	NULL
panting	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Flannels	NULL
suit	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
look	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL
this	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
blushed	NULL
with	NULL
delight	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
honestly	NULL
return	NULL
the	NULL
compliment	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
look	NULL
perfectly	NULL
ravishing	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
smiled	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
look	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
black	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
supper	NULL
he	NULL
insisted	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Have	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
enough	NULL
exercise	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
'll	NULL
be	NULL
lovely	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
tonight	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
stars	NULL
are	NULL
all	NULL
out	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
high	NULL
spirits	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
D'you	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
scolding	NULL
me	NULL
on	NULL
your	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
sauntering	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
garden	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
says	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
n't	NULL
flirt	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Have	NULL
you	NULL
been	NULL
flirting	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
noticed	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
joking	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
unkind	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
refuse	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
me	NULL
last	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
your	NULL
uncle	NULL
gave	NULL
me	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Was	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
prevented	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
prefer	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
people	NULL
without	NULL
witnesses	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
are	NULL
no	NULL
witnesses	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
waist	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
only	NULL
laughed	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
withdraw	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
quite	NULL
naturally	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
easiest	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
not	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Because	NULL
I	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
laughed	NULL
.	NULL

XXXIV	NULL
Next	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
dinner	NULL
they	NULL
took	NULL
their	NULL
rugs	NULL
and	NULL
cushions	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fountain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
books	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
read	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
made	NULL
herself	NULL
comfortable	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
red	NULL
sun-shade	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
shy	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
kiss	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
wrong	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
last	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
wrong	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
nonsense	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
cried	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
sure	NULL
you	NULL
slept	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
top	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
think	NULL
your	NULL
uncle	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
's	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
leaned	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
went	NULL
pit-a-pat	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
d'you	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
me	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
reply	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Because	NULL
I	NULL
love	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bring	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
think	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
instead	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
smiling	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
touched	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
tips	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
fingers	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
smooth	NULL
your	NULL
face	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
murmured	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
shaving	NULL
awfully	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
astonishing	NULL
how	NULL
difficult	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
romantic	NULL
speeches	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
silence	NULL
helped	NULL
him	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
look	NULL
inexpressible	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
sighed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
you	NULL
like	NULL
me	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
awfully	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
resist	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
pretended	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
passionate	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
really	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
playing	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
which	NULL
looked	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
rather	NULL
frightened	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
'll	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
after	NULL
supper	NULL
,	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
begged	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
unless	NULL
you	NULL
promise	NULL
to	NULL
behave	NULL
yourself	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
promise	NULL
anything	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
catching	NULL
fire	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
flame	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
partly	NULL
simulating	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
tea-time	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
obstreperously	NULL
merry	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
nervously	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
must	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
those	NULL
shining	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
afterwards	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
will	NULL
your	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
think	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
care	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
thinks	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
laugh	NULL
of	NULL
pleasure	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
sooner	NULL
finished	NULL
supper	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
me	NULL
company	NULL
while	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL

you	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL

I	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
acidly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
After	NULL
dinner	NULL
walk	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL

after	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Your	NULL
aunt	NULL

she	NULL

said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
side-door	NULL
behind	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
threw	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
cigarette	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
lighted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
flung	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
push	NULL
him	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
promised	NULL
you	NULL
'd	NULL
be	NULL
good	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
so	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Supposing	NULL
someone	NULL
should	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
suddenly	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
led	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
garden	NULL
where	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
earwigs	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
passionately	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
puzzled	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
moderately	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
the	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
thrilled	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL
himself	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
saying	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
certainly	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
broad	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
wonder	NULL
and	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
beautifully	NULL
you	NULL
make	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
say	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
burn	NULL
my	NULL
heart	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
murmured	NULL
passionately	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
splendid	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
thrilling	NULL
game	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
played	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
wonderful	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
almost	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
exaggerated	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
tremendously	NULL
interested	NULL
and	NULL
excited	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
obviously	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
she	NULL
suggested	NULL
going	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

do	NULL
n't	NULL
go	NULL
yet	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
cried	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
muttered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
frightened	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
intuition	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
go	NULL

stay	NULL
here	NULL

My	NULL
cheeks	NULL

burning	NULL

I	NULL
want	NULL
the	NULL
night-air	NULL

Good-night	NULL

He	NULL
held	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
seriously	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
stifled	NULL
a	NULL
sob	NULL
.	NULL

Oh	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
magnificent	NULL
!	NULL

When	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
decent	NULL
interval	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
rather	NULL
bored	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
garden	NULL
by	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL

After	NULL
that	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
different	NULL

The	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL

the	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
Philip	NULL
showed	NULL
himself	NULL
an	NULL
eager	NULL
lover	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
deliciously	NULL
flattered	NULL
to	NULL

was	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL

him	NULL

in	NULL
English	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
in	NULL
French	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
paid	NULL
him	NULL
compliments	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
informed	NULL
him	NULL
before	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
charming	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
sensual	NULL
mouth	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
bothered	NULL
much	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
personal	NULL
appearance	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
occasion	NULL
presented	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
glass	NULL
with	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
wonderful	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
the	NULL
passion	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
thrill	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
easier	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
he	NULL
instinctively	NULL
felt	NULL
she	NULL
expected	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
still	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
he	NULL
worshipped	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
someone	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
boast	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
willingly	NULL
have	NULL
discussed	NULL
minute	NULL
points	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
conduct	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
enigmatic	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
puzzled	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
Hayward	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
there	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
ask	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
do	NULL
next	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
rush	NULL
things	NULL
or	NULL
let	NULL
them	NULL
take	NULL
their	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
breaks	NULL
my	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
perhaps	NULL
we	NULL
shall	NULL
never	NULL
see	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
unkind	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
whispered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
be	NULL
content	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
it	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
?	NULL

Men	NULL
are	NULL
always	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
're	NULL
never	NULL
satisfied	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
pressed	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
But	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
impossible	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
can	NULL
we	NULL
here	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
proposed	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
schemes	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
dare	NULL
n't	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
risk	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
too	NULL
dreadful	NULL
if	NULL
your	NULL
aunt	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

A	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
later	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
brilliant	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Look	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
headache	NULL
on	NULL
Sunday	NULL
evening	NULL
and	NULL
offered	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Generally	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
on	NULL
Sunday	NULL
evening	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
allow	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
welcome	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
of	NULL
attending	NULL
evensong	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
impart	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
relations	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
views	NULL
on	NULL
Christianity	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
occurred	NULL
in	NULL
Germany	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
less	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
quietly	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
regarded	NULL
this	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
graceful	NULL
concession	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
prejudices	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
refusal	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
time	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
adequate	NULL
assertion	NULL
of	NULL
free	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
suggestion	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
shook	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
on	NULL
Sunday	NULL
at	NULL
tea-time	NULL
she	NULL
surprised	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
this	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
suddenly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
really	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
dreadful	NULL
headache	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
concerned	NULL
,	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
giving	NULL
her	NULL
some	NULL
'	NULL
drops	NULL
'	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
using	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
thanked	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
immediately	NULL
after	NULL
tea	NULL
announced	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
lie	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL
sure	NULL
there	NULL
's	NULL
nothing	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL
want	NULL

"	NULL

asked	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
anxiously	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Quite	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
thank	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Because	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
often	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
wants	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
can	NULL
always	NULL
call	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
'd	NULL
better	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
door	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
rings	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL
hear	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Certainly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
after	NULL
six	NULL
o'clock	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
alone	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
with	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
sick	NULL
with	NULL
apprehension	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
suggested	NULL
the	NULL
plan	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL
now	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
would	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
!	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
sound	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
really	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
headache	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL
his	NULL
suggestion	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
painfully	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
crept	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
as	NULL
softly	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
stopped	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
start	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
creaked	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
outside	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
knob	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
door-handle	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
waited	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
trembled	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
willingly	NULL
have	NULL
bolted	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
remorse	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
would	NULL
seize	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
getting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
highest	NULL
diving-board	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
swimming-bath	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
looked	NULL
nothing	NULL
from	NULL
below	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
there	NULL
and	NULL
stared	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
your	NULL
heart	NULL
sank	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
forced	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
dive	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
shame	NULL
of	NULL
coming	NULL
down	NULL
meekly	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
steps	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
climbed	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
screwed	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
courage	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
the	NULL
handle	NULL
softly	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
trembling	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
leaf	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
dressing-table	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
quickly	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
it	NULL
open	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
d'you	NULL
want	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
skirt	NULL
and	NULL
blouse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
petticoat	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
short	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
came	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
boots	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
upper	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
black	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
shiny	NULL
material	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
red	NULL
flounce	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
camisole	NULL
of	NULL
white	NULL
calico	NULL
with	NULL
short	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
grotesque	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
sank	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
unattractive	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
locked	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

XXXV	NULL
Philip	NULL
woke	NULL
early	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
sleep	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
restless	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
stretched	NULL
his	NULL
legs	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sunshine	NULL
that	NULL
slid	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
Venetian	NULL
blinds	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
patterns	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
sighed	NULL
with	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
delighted	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
her	NULL
Emily	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
she	NULL
chid	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
addressing	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
avoided	NULL
using	NULL
her	NULL
name	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
his	NULL
childhood	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
sister	NULL
of	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
widow	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
naval	NULL
officer	NULL
,	NULL
spoken	NULL
of	NULL
as	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Emily	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
suited	NULL
her	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
as	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
inseparable	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
impression	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
frowned	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
:	NULL
somehow	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
now	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
worst	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
forget	NULL
his	NULL
dismay	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
camisole	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
short	NULL
petticoat	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
slight	NULL
roughness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
skin	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sharp	NULL
,	NULL
long	NULL
lines	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
neck	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
triumph	NULL
was	NULL
short-lived	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
reckoned	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
age	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
forty	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
ridiculous	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
plain	NULL
and	NULL
old	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
quick	NULL
fancy	NULL
showed	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
wrinkled	NULL
,	NULL
haggard	NULL
,	NULL
made-up	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
frocks	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
showy	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
position	NULL
and	NULL
too	NULL
young	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
shuddered	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
suddenly	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
kissing	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
horrified	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
that	NULL
love	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
over	NULL
dressing	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sinking	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

Prayers	NULL
were	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
sitting	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
breakfast	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Lazybones	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
cried	NULL
gaily	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
gasp	NULL
of	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
quite	NULL
nice	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
such	NULL
things	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
self-satisfaction	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
aback	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
voice	NULL
thrilling	NULL
with	NULL
emotion	NULL
immediately	NULL
after	NULL
breakfast	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
later	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
singing	NULL
lesson	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
music-stool	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
scale	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Embrasse-moi	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
bent	NULL
down	NULL
she	NULL
flung	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
round	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
slightly	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
held	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
position	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
rather	NULL
choked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ah	NULL
,	NULL
je	NULL
t	NULL
'	NULL
aime	NULL

Je	NULL
t	NULL
'	NULL
aime	NULL
.	NULL

Je	NULL
t	NULL
'	NULL
aime	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
cried	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
extravagantly	NULL
French	NULL
accent	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
wished	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
speak	NULL
English	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL

you	NULL
that	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
French	NULL
novel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
it	NULL
slightly	NULL
irritated	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
tootle	NULL
along	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
beach	NULL

have	NULL
a	NULL
dip	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

you	NULL

not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
me	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL

of	NULL
all	NULL
mornings	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Would	NULL
you	NULL
like	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
smiled	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
darling	NULL
!	NULL

But	NULL
no	NULL
,	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

Go	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
mastering	NULL
the	NULL
salt	NULL
sea	NULL
waves	NULL
,	NULL
bathing	NULL
your	NULL
limbs	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
broad	NULL
ocean	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
sauntered	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
rot	NULL
women	NULL
talk	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
thought	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
pleased	NULL
and	NULL
happy	NULL
and	NULL
flattered	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
frightfully	NULL
gone	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
limped	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
street	NULL
of	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
tinge	NULL
of	NULL
superciliousness	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
he	NULL
passed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
many	NULL
to	NULL
nod	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
of	NULL
recognition	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
only	NULL
knew	NULL
!	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
want	NULL
someone	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
very	NULL
badly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
Hayward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
composed	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
roses	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
French	NULL
governess	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
exotic	NULL
flower	NULL
amongst	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
scented	NULL
and	NULL
perverse	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
French	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
--	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
France	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
almost	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
besides	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
shabby	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
thing	NULL
away	NULL
too	NULL
exactly	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
Hayward	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
pretty	NULL
muslin	NULL
dress	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
flower	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
delicate	NULL
idyl	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
sunshine	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
gave	NULL
it	NULL
passion	NULL
and	NULL
magic	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
stars	NULL
added	NULL
poetry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
vicarage	NULL
garden	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fit	NULL
and	NULL
exquisite	NULL
setting	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
Meredithian	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
Lucy	NULL
Feverel	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
Clara	NULL
Middleton	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
inexpressibly	NULL
charming	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
delighted	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
fancies	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
again	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
crawled	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
dripping	NULL
and	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
bathing-machine	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
affections	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
adorable	NULL
little	NULL
nose	NULL
and	NULL
large	NULL
brown	NULL
eyes	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
describe	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
Hayward	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
masses	NULL
of	NULL
soft	NULL
brown	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
hair	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
delicious	NULL
to	NULL
bury	NULL
your	NULL
face	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
skin	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
ivory	NULL
and	NULL
sunshine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
cheek	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
red	NULL
,	NULL
red	NULL
rose	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
old	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
?	NULL

Eighteen	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
Musette	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
laughter	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
rippling	NULL
brook	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
soft	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
low	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
sweetest	NULL
music	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
heard	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
ARE	NULL
you	NULL
thinking	NULL
about	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
stopped	NULL
suddenly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
walking	NULL
slowly	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
been	NULL
waving	NULL
at	NULL
you	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
ARE	NULL
absent-minded	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
laughing	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
surprise	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
meet	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
's	NULL
awfully	NULL
nice	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Did	NULL
I	NULL
startle	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
did	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
admitted	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wrote	NULL
his	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
Hayward	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
eight	NULL
pages	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fortnight	NULL
that	NULL
remained	NULL
passed	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
each	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
after	NULL
supper	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
remarked	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
more	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
too	NULL
cheerful	NULL
spirits	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
depress	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
night	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
delightful	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
exchange	NULL
her	NULL
situation	NULL
in	NULL
Berlin	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
constantly	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
jolly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
aroused	NULL
no	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
wonderful	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
preferred	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
hampered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
too	NULL
freely	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
allowed	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
already	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
longing	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
talk	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
loved	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
cried	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
aback	NULL
and	NULL
remained	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
muttered	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
his	NULL
surprise	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
crying	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
tender	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hated	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
anyone	NULL
miserable	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
awfully	NULL
sorry	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
have	NULL
I	NULL
done	NULL
?	NULL

Do	NULL
n't	NULL
cry	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
leave	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
wretched	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
've	NULL
made	NULL
me	NULL
so	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
silently	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
really	NULL
was	NULL
anguish	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
tone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
frightened	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
quite	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
seriously	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
awfully	NULL
sorry	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
know	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
frightfully	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL

I	NULL
wish	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
know	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL

Places	NULL
are	NULL
almost	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
hate	NULL
English	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Almost	NULL
unconscious	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
acting	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
moved	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
distress	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
pressed	NULL
her	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
tears	NULL
vaguely	NULL
flattered	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
real	NULL
passion	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
later	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
scene	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
tennis-party	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
girls	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
daughters	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
retired	NULL
major	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
Indian	NULL
regiment	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
lately	NULL
settled	NULL
in	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
pretty	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
age	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
younger	NULL
.	NULL

Being	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
society	NULL
of	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
(	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
stories	NULL
of	NULL
hill-stations	NULL
in	NULL
India	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
stories	NULL
of	NULL
Rudyard	NULL
Kipling	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
hand	NULL
)	NULL
they	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
chaff	NULL
Philip	NULL
gaily	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
pleased	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
novelty	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
at	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
treated	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
's	NULL
nephew	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
seriousness	NULL
--	NULL
was	NULL
gay	NULL
and	NULL
jolly	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
devil	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
prompted	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
start	NULL
a	NULL
violent	NULL
flirtation	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
both	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
quite	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
him	NULL
half-way	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
happened	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
played	NULL
tennis	NULL
quite	NULL
well	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
pat-ball	NULL
with	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
(	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
arranged	NULL
the	NULL
sets	NULL
after	NULL
tea	NULL
he	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
should	NULL
play	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
curate	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
curate	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
partner	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
play	NULL
later	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
new-comers	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
elder	NULL
Miss	NULL
O'Connor	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
undertone	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
We	NULL
'll	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
duffers	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
we	NULL
'll	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
jolly	NULL
set	NULL
afterwards	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Apparently	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
overheard	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
threw	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
racket	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
headache	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
plain	NULL
to	NULL
everyone	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
offended	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
annoyed	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
public	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
set	NULL
was	NULL
arranged	NULL
without	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
presently	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
called	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Philip	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
right	NULL

He	NULL
knocked	NULL
at	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
's	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
receiving	NULL
no	NULL
answer	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
lying	NULL
face	NULL
downwards	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
bed	NULL

weeping	NULL

He	NULL
touched	NULL

She	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL

towards	NULL
the	NULL

after	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

sank	NULL
into	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL

Philip	NULL
stood	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
rather	NULL
sulkily	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
her	NULL
behaviour	NULL
childish	NULL

was	NULL
vexed	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
put	NULL
away	NULL
her	NULL
handkerchief	NULL

Her	NULL
tears	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
marks	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
powdered	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
somewhat	NULL
disarranged	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
white	NULL
dress	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
suit	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
with	NULL
hungry	NULL

passionate	NULL
eyes	NULL

"	NULL
Because	NULL

Philip	NULL
reddened	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
anguish	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
tone	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
strangely	NULL
uneasy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
anything	NULL

do	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

n't	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
awkwardly	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
'd	NULL
better	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
quarrel	NULL
was	NULL
quickly	NULL
followed	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
reconciliation	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
that	NULL
remained	NULL
were	NULL
sometimes	NULL
irksome	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
invariably	NULL
reduced	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
to	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
her	NULL
weeping	NULL
affected	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
feeling	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
beast	NULL
he	NULL
redoubled	NULL
his	NULL
protestations	NULL
of	NULL
undying	NULL
passion	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
it	NULL
irritated	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
silly	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
grown-up	NULL
woman	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
never	NULL
ceased	NULL
reminding	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
debt	NULL
of	NULL
gratitude	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
repay	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
acknowledge	NULL
this	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
really	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
grateful	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
his	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
obligation	NULL
in	NULL
ways	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
nuisance	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
solitude	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
necessity	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
sometimes	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
unkindness	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
beck	NULL
and	NULL
call	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Miss	NULL
O'Connors	NULL
asked	NULL
them	NULL
both	NULL
to	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
only	NULL
had	NULL
five	NULL
days	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
wanted	NULL
him	NULL
entirely	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
flattering	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
bore	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
stories	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
exquisite	NULL
delicacy	NULL
of	NULL
Frenchmen	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
relation	NULL
to	NULL
fair	NULL
ladies	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
praised	NULL
their	NULL
courtesy	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
self-sacrifice	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
perfect	NULL
tact	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
want	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
enumeration	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
qualities	NULL
which	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
possessed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
perfect	NULL
lover	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
feeling	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
Berlin	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
will	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL

Write	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL

I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
everything	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
doing	NULL

You	NULL
must	NULL
keep	NULL
nothing	NULL
from	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
awfully	NULL
,	NULL
busy	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
write	NULL
as	NULL
often	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
flung	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
passionately	NULL
round	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
sometimes	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
demonstrations	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
affection	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
preferred	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
passive	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
shocked	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
marked	NULL
a	NULL
lead	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
tally	NULL
altogether	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
prepossessions	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
modesty	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
feminine	NULL
temperament	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
length	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
came	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
breakfast	NULL
,	NULL
pale	NULL
and	NULL
subdued	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
serviceable	NULL
travelling	NULL
dress	NULL
of	NULL
black	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
check	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
competent	NULL
governess	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
fit	NULL
the	NULL
circumstance	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
terribly	NULL
afraid	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
something	NULL
flippant	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
would	NULL
break	NULL
down	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
scene	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
their	NULL
last	NULL
good-bye	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
relieved	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
no	NULL
opportunity	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
after	NULL
breakfast	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
should	NULL
insist	NULL
on	NULL
kissing	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
hard	NULL
upon	NULL
middle	NULL
age	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sharp	NULL
tongue	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
compromising	NULL
position	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
Ann	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
cat	NULL
.	NULL

Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
was	NULL
leaving	NULL
she	NULL
leaned	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
kiss	NULL
you	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
blushing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
up	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
step	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
kissed	NULL
him	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
train	NULL
started	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
sank	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
carriage	NULL
and	NULL
wept	NULL
disconsolately	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
,	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
distinct	NULL
sensation	NULL
of	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
safely	NULL
off	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
rather	NULL
weepy	NULL

She	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
kissing	NULL
me	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
age	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
pointed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sideboard	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL

It	NULL
came	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
post	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
from	NULL
Hayward	NULL
and	NULL
ran	NULL
as	NULL
follows	NULL
:	NULL
My	NULL
dear	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
answer	NULL
your	NULL
letter	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL

I	NULL
ventured	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
friend	NULL
of	NULL
mine	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
charming	NULL
woman	NULL
whose	NULL
help	NULL
and	NULL
sympathy	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
precious	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL

a	NULL
woman	NULL
withal	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
feeling	NULL
for	NULL
art	NULL
and	NULL
literature	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
agreed	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
charming	NULL

You	NULL
wrote	NULL
from	NULL
your	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
delightful	NULL
naivete	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
line	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
because	NULL
you	NULL
love	NULL
you	NULL
write	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
poet	NULL

Ah	NULL
,	NULL
dear	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
thing	NULL
:	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
glow	NULL
of	NULL
your	NULL
young	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
your	NULL
prose	NULL
was	NULL
musical	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
sincerity	NULL
of	NULL
your	NULL
emotion	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
happy	NULL

I	NULL
wish	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL

with	NULL
your	NULL

you	NULL
told	NULL

oddly	NULL
enough	NULL
had	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
read	NULL
Romeo	NULL
and	NULL
Juliet	NULL
together	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
firmly	NULL
declined	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
little	NULL
pang	NULL
of	NULL
bitterness	NULL
because	NULL
reality	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
ideal	NULL
.	NULL

XXXVI	NULL
A	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
curate	NULL
had	NULL
recommended	NULL
rooms	NULL
in	NULL
Barnes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
these	NULL
Philip	NULL
engaged	NULL
by	NULL
letter	NULL
at	NULL
fourteen	NULL
shillings	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
reached	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
landlady	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
funny	NULL
little	NULL
old	NULL
woman	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
shrivelled	NULL
body	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
deeply	NULL
wrinkled	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
prepared	NULL
high	NULL
tea	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sideboard	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
square	NULL
table	NULL
;	NULL
against	NULL
one	NULL
wall	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sofa	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
horsehair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fireplace	NULL
an	NULL
arm-chair	NULL
to	NULL
match	NULL
:	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
antimacassar	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
seat	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
springs	NULL
were	NULL
broken	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
cushion	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
having	NULL
his	NULL
tea	NULL
he	NULL
unpacked	NULL
and	NULL
arranged	NULL
his	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
depressed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
silence	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
slightly	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
early	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
tail-coat	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tall	NULL
hat	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
worn	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
shabby	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
stop	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Stores	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
and	NULL
buy	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
walked	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
Strand	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
office	NULL
of	NULL
Messrs.	NULL
Herbert	NULL
Carter	NULL
&	NULL
Co.	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
street	NULL
off	NULL
Chancery	NULL
Lane	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
once	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
whether	NULL
by	NULL
chance	NULL
the	NULL
label	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
left	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
arrived	NULL
he	NULL
knocked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
watch	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
barely	NULL
half	NULL
past	NULL
nine	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
supposed	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
early	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
later	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
an	NULL
office-boy	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
nose	NULL
,	NULL
pimply	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
Scotch	NULL
accent	NULL
,	NULL
opening	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Herbert	NULL
Carter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
yet	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
When	NULL
will	NULL
he	NULL
be	NULL
here	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Between	NULL
ten	NULL
and	NULL
half	NULL
past	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL

,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
wanting	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
the	NULL
office-boy	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
nervous	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
jocose	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
here	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL

objection	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

you	NULL
're	NULL

You	NULL
'd	NULL

.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
'll	NULL
be	NULL
here	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
walked	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
office-boy	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
age	NULL
as	NULL
Philip	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
junior	NULL
clerk	NULL
--	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
foot	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
flushed	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
hid	NULL
it	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
dingy	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
lit	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
skylight	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
three	NULL
rows	NULL
of	NULL
desks	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
against	NULL
them	NULL
high	NULL
stools	NULL
.	NULL

Over	NULL
the	NULL
chimney-piece	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dirty	NULL
engraving	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
prize-fight	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
a	NULL
clerk	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
another	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
undertone	NULL
asked	NULL
the	NULL
office-boy	NULL
(	NULL
Philip	NULL
found	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
Macdougal	NULL
)	NULL
who	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
whistle	NULL
blew	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Macdougal	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
's	NULL
come	NULL

He	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
managing	NULL
clerk	NULL

Shall	NULL
I	NULL

him	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
please	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
office-boy	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
returned	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Will	NULL
you	NULL
come	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
followed	NULL
him	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
shown	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
small	NULL
and	NULL
barely	NULL
furnished	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
thin	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fireplace	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
below	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
height	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
large	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
hang	NULL
loosely	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
body	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
odd	NULL
ungainliness	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
features	NULL
were	NULL
wide	NULL
and	NULL
flattened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
prominent	NULL
,	NULL
pale	NULL
eyes	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
thin	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
sandy	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wore	NULL
whiskers	NULL
that	NULL
grew	NULL
unevenly	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
places	NULL
where	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
expected	NULL
the	NULL
hair	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
thickly	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
hair	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
skin	NULL
was	NULL
pasty	NULL
and	NULL
yellow	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
held	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
smiled	NULL
showed	NULL
badly	NULL
decayed	NULL
teeth	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
patronising	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
a	NULL
timid	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
sought	NULL
to	NULL
assume	NULL
an	NULL
importance	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
hoped	NULL
Philip	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
drudgery	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
got	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
interesting	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL

money	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
chief	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
laughed	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
odd	NULL
mixture	NULL
of	NULL
superiority	NULL
and	NULL
shyness	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carter	NULL

went	NULL

after	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL

came	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL

It	NULL
contained	NULL
a	NULL

he	NULL
told	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
led	NULL
Philip	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
dingy	NULL
office	NULL

where	NULL
now	NULL
six	NULL
or	NULL
eight	NULL
clerks	NULL
were	NULL
working	NULL

into	NULL
a	NULL
narrow	NULL
room	NULL
behind	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
separate	NULL
apartment	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL

here	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
Watson	NULL
sitting	NULL

reading	NULL

He	NULL

He	NULL
asserted	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL

calling	NULL

The	NULL

objected	NULL

pointedly	NULL
called	NULL
him	NULL

Watson	NULL

instead	NULL

Philip	NULL

looked	NULL
with	NULL

His	NULL

fitted	NULL

himself	NULL

Watson	NULL
began	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
asked	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
bother	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
much	NULL

you	NULL

said	NULL
Watson	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Carter	NULL
's	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL

We	NULL
have	NULL
him	NULL

now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL

awful	NULL

"	NULL

Presently	NULL
Watson	NULL
applied	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
work	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
set	NULL
about	NULL
sorting	NULL
his	NULL
letters	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carter	NULL
had	NULL
arrived	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
Philip	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
room	NULL
next	NULL
door	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
big	NULL
desk	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
big	NULL
arm-chairs	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
Turkey	NULL
carpet	NULL
adorned	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL
were	NULL
decorated	NULL
with	NULL
sporting	NULL
prints	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carter	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
desk	NULL
and	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
shake	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
dressed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
frock	NULL
coat	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
military	NULL
man	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
moustache	NULL
was	NULL
waxed	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
gray	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
short	NULL
and	NULL
neat	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
himself	NULL
upright	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
talked	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
breezy	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
lived	NULL
at	NULL
Enfield	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
keen	NULL
on	NULL
games	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
officer	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Hertfordshire	NULL
Yeomanry	NULL
and	NULL
chairman	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Conservative	NULL
Association	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
told	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
local	NULL
magnate	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
City	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
vain	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
,	NULL
off-hand	NULL
fashion	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
would	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Watson	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
nice	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
perfect	NULL
gentleman	NULL
,	NULL
good	NULL
sportsman	NULL
--	NULL
did	NULL
Philip	NULL
hunt	NULL
?	NULL

Pity	NULL
,	NULL
THE	NULL
sport	NULL
for	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
.	NULL

Did	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
much	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
hunting	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
son	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
'd	NULL
sent	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
Rugby	NULL
,	NULL
fine	NULL
school	NULL
Rugby	NULL

nice	NULL
class	NULL
of	NULL
boys	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
years	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
articled	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
nice	NULL
for	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
'd	NULL
like	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL
thorough	NULL
sportsman	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hoped	NULL
Philip	NULL
would	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
well	NULL
and	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
n't	NULL
miss	NULL
his	NULL
lectures	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
getting	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
tone	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
profession	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
wanted	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
anything	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
handwriting	NULL
like	NULL
?	NULL

Ah	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
about	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
overwhelmed	NULL
by	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
gentlemanliness	NULL
:	NULL
in	NULL
East	NULL
Anglia	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

XXXVII	NULL
At	NULL
first	NULL
the	NULL
novelty	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
kept	NULL
Philip	NULL
interested	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carter	NULL
dictated	NULL
letters	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
fair	NULL
copies	NULL
of	NULL
statements	NULL
of	NULL
accounts	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carter	NULL
preferred	NULL
to	NULL
conduct	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
on	NULL
gentlemanly	NULL
lines	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
typewriting	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
shorthand	NULL
with	NULL
disfavour	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
office-boy	NULL
knew	NULL
shorthand	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
who	NULL
made	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
accomplishment	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
Philip	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
experienced	NULL
clerks	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
audit	NULL
the	NULL
accounts	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
firm	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
clients	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
treated	NULL
with	NULL
respect	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
low	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
long	NULL
lists	NULL
of	NULL
figures	NULL
were	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
add	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
attended	NULL
lectures	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
examination	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
repeated	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
dull	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
grow	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
at	NULL
six	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
to	NULL
Waterloo	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
supper	NULL
was	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
reached	NULL
his	NULL
lodgings	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
spent	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
reading	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
Saturday	NULL
afternoons	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
National	NULL
Gallery	NULL
.	NULL

Hayward	NULL
had	NULL
recommended	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
guide	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
compiled	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
Ruskin	NULL
's	NULL
works	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
industriously	NULL
through	NULL
room	NULL
after	NULL
room	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
carefully	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
critic	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
picture	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
determined	NULL
fashion	NULL
set	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
Sundays	NULL
were	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
through	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
and	NULL
spent	NULL
them	NULL
by	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Nixon	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
solicitor	NULL
,	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
a	NULL
Sunday	NULL
at	NULL
Hampstead	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
passed	NULL
a	NULL
happy	NULL
day	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
set	NULL
of	NULL
exuberant	NULL
strangers	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
ate	NULL
and	NULL
drank	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
walk	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
heath	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
invitation	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
again	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
morbidly	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
formal	NULL
invitation	NULL
.	NULL

Naturally	NULL
enough	NULL
it	NULL
never	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
with	NULL
numbers	NULL
of	NULL
friends	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
the	NULL
Nixons	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lonely	NULL
,	NULL
silent	NULL
boy	NULL
whose	NULL
claim	NULL
upon	NULL
their	NULL
hospitality	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
small	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
on	NULL
Sundays	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
late	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
walk	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
tow-path	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
Barnes	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
is	NULL
muddy	NULL
,	NULL
dingy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tidal	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
has	NULL
neither	NULL
the	NULL
graceful	NULL
charm	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Thames	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
locks	NULL
nor	NULL
the	NULL
romance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
crowded	NULL
stream	NULL
below	NULL
London	NULL
Bridge	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
common	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
gray	NULL
and	NULL
dingy	NULL
too	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
neither	NULL
country	NULL
nor	NULL
town	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
gorse	NULL
is	NULL
stunted	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
litter	NULL
of	NULL
civilisation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
play	NULL
every	NULL
Saturday	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
cheerfully	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
gallery-door	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
worth	NULL
while	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Barnes	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
interval	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
closing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Museum	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
meal	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
A.	NULL
B.	NULL
C.	NULL
shop	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
hung	NULL
heavily	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
strolled	NULL
up	NULL
Bond	NULL
Street	NULL
or	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
Burlington	NULL
Arcade	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
went	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Park	NULL
or	NULL
in	NULL
wet	NULL
weather	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
library	NULL
in	NULL
St.	NULL
Martin	NULL
's	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
walking	NULL
about	NULL
and	NULL
envied	NULL
them	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
friends	NULL
;	NULL
sometimes	NULL
his	NULL
envy	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
hatred	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
happy	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
miserable	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
lonely	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
city	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
gallery-door	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
next	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
would	NULL
attempt	NULL
a	NULL
conversation	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
boy	NULL
's	NULL
suspicion	NULL
of	NULL
strangers	NULL
and	NULL
answered	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
any	NULL
further	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
hurried	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
bridge	NULL
to	NULL
Waterloo	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
for	NULL
economy	NULL
no	NULL
fire	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
lit	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
sank	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
horribly	NULL
cheerless	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
loathe	NULL
his	NULL
lodgings	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
solitary	NULL
evenings	NULL
he	NULL
spent	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
so	NULL
lonely	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
read	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
looking	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
hour	NULL
after	NULL
hour	NULL
in	NULL
bitter	NULL
wretchedness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
except	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
Sunday	NULL
at	NULL
Hampstead	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
anyone	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
fellow-clerks	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
evening	NULL
Watson	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
restaurant	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
music-hall	NULL
together	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
shy	NULL
and	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
.	NULL

Watson	NULL
talked	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
Watson	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
Philistine	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
admiring	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL
because	NULL
Watson	NULL
obviously	NULL
set	NULL
no	NULL
store	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
culture	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
taking	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
estimate	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
others	NULL
held	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
despise	NULL
the	NULL
acquirements	NULL
which	NULL
till	NULL
then	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
not	NULL
unimportant	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
humiliation	NULL
of	NULL
poverty	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
uncle	NULL
sent	NULL
him	NULL
fourteen	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
many	NULL
clothes	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
evening	NULL
suit	NULL
cost	NULL
him	NULL
five	NULL
guineas	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
dared	NULL
tell	NULL
Watson	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
bought	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Strand	NULL
.	NULL

Watson	NULL
said	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
tailor	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
dance	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Watson	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
club-foot	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Pity	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
've	NULL
been	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
some	NULL
dancing	NULL
men	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
ball	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
introduced	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
jolly	NULL
girls	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
,	NULL
hating	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Barnes	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
late	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
wandered	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
West	NULL
End	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
some	NULL
house	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
party	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
shabby	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
footmen	NULL
,	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
guests	NULL
arrive	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
music	NULL
that	NULL
floated	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
the	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
came	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
balcony	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
some	NULL
fresh	NULL
air	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
imagining	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
limped	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
hurt	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
woman	NULL
could	NULL
ever	NULL
really	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
without	NULL
distaste	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
deformity	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
reminded	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
without	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
parting	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
arrangement	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
Charing	NULL
Cross	NULL
Post	NULL
Office	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
her	NULL
an	NULL
address	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
there	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
three	NULL
letters	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wrote	NULL
on	NULL
blue	NULL
paper	NULL
with	NULL
violet	NULL
ink	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
wrote	NULL
in	NULL
French	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
wondered	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
write	NULL
in	NULL
English	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
sensible	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
passionate	NULL
expressions	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
reminded	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
French	NULL
novel	NULL
,	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
upbraided	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
not	NULL
having	NULL
written	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
he	NULL
excused	NULL
himself	NULL
by	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
busy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
start	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bring	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
dearest	NULL
or	NULL
darling	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
to	NULL
address	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
Emily	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
finally	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
dear	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
looked	NULL
odd	NULL
,	NULL
standing	NULL
by	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rather	NULL
silly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
love	NULL
letter	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
written	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
tameness	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
say	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
vehement	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
every	NULL
minute	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
longed	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
her	NULL
beautiful	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
trembled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
red	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
some	NULL
inexplicable	NULL
modesty	NULL
prevented	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
instead	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
new	NULL
rooms	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
office	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
answer	NULL
came	NULL
by	NULL
return	NULL
of	NULL
post	NULL
,	NULL
angry	NULL
,	NULL
heart-broken	NULL
,	NULL
reproachful	NULL
:	NULL
how	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
cold	NULL
?	NULL

Did	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
hung	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
letters	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
could	NULL
give	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
reward	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
he	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
already	NULL
?	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
reply	NULL
for	NULL
several	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
bombarded	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
letters	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
his	NULL
unkindness	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
post	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
never	NULL
brought	NULL
her	NULL
his	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
cried	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
night	NULL
after	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
so	NULL
ill	NULL
that	NULL
everyone	NULL
remarked	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
:	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
love	NULL
her	NULL
why	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
so	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
added	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
live	NULL
without	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
commit	NULL
suicide	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
selfish	NULL
and	NULL
ungrateful	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
French	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
wrote	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
language	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
worried	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
unhappy	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
wrote	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
the	NULL
separation	NULL
any	NULL
longer	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
arrange	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
for	NULL
Christmas	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
wrote	NULL
back	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
nothing	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
an	NULL
engagement	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
Christmas	NULL
with	NULL
friends	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
break	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
answered	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
force	NULL
herself	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
evident	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
deeply	NULL
hurt	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
repay	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
cruelty	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
kindness	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
letter	NULL
was	NULL
touching	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
marks	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
tears	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wrote	NULL
an	NULL
impulsive	NULL
reply	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
sorry	NULL
and	NULL
imploring	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
relief	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
received	NULL
her	NULL
answer	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
when	NULL
her	NULL
letters	NULL
came	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
sank	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
delayed	NULL
opening	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
contain	NULL
,	NULL
angry	NULL
reproaches	NULL
and	NULL
pathetic	NULL
appeals	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL
beast	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
with	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
blame	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
answer	NULL
from	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
another	NULL
letter	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
ill	NULL
and	NULL
lonely	NULL
and	NULL
miserable	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
God	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
admired	NULL
Watson	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
arranged	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
so	NULL
easily	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
engaged	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
intrigue	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
who	NULL
played	NULL
in	NULL
touring	NULL
companies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
filled	NULL
Philip	NULL
with	NULL
envious	NULL
amazement	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
Watson	NULL
's	NULL
young	NULL
affections	NULL
changed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
described	NULL
the	NULL
rupture	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
making	NULL
any	NULL
bones	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
just	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
had	NULL
enough	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Did	NULL
n't	NULL
she	NULL
make	NULL
an	NULL
awful	NULL
scene	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
usual	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
trying	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Did	NULL
she	NULL
cry	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
stand	NULL
women	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
cry	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
'd	NULL
better	NULL
hook	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
humour	NULL
was	NULL
growing	NULL
keener	NULL
with	NULL
advancing	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
hook	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
smiling	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
the	NULL
Christmas	NULL
holidays	NULL
approached	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
ill	NULL
all	NULL
through	NULL
November	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Cornwall	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
weeks	NULL
round	NULL
Christmas	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
get	NULL
back	NULL
her	NULL
strength	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
result	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
nowhere	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
spent	NULL
Christmas	NULL
Day	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
lodgings	NULL
.	NULL

Under	NULL
Hayward	NULL
's	NULL
influence	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
persuaded	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
festivities	NULL
that	NULL
attend	NULL
this	NULL
season	NULL
were	NULL
vulgar	NULL
and	NULL
barbaric	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
no	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
jollity	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
around	NULL
affected	NULL
him	NULL
strangely	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
landlady	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
were	NULL
spending	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
married	NULL
daughter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
trouble	NULL
Philip	NULL
announced	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
his	NULL
meals	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
towards	NULL
mid-day	NULL
and	NULL
ate	NULL
a	NULL
slice	NULL
of	NULL
turkey	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
Christmas	NULL
pudding	NULL
by	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
Gatti	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
afterwards	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Westminster	NULL
Abbey	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
service	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
streets	NULL
were	NULL
almost	NULL
empty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
went	NULL
along	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
preoccupied	NULL
look	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
saunter	NULL
but	NULL
walked	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
definite	NULL
goal	NULL
in	NULL
view	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hardly	NULL
anyone	NULL
was	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
Philip	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
seemed	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
more	NULL
solitary	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
intention	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
kill	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
somehow	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
dine	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
restaurant	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
face	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
cheerful	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
talking	NULL
,	NULL
laughing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
making	NULL
merry	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Waterloo	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
Westminster	NULL
Bridge	NULL
Road	NULL
bought	NULL
some	NULL
ham	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
mince	NULL
pies	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Barnes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
ate	NULL
his	NULL
food	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
lonely	NULL
little	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
spent	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
depression	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
intolerable	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
back	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
very	NULL
sore	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL
to	NULL
Watson	NULL
's	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
short	NULL
holiday	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
jolly	NULL
girls	NULL
staying	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
dinner	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
cleared	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
dance	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
get	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
till	NULL
three	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
there	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
George	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
squiffy	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
Philip	NULL
asked	NULL
desperately	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
How	NULL
does	NULL
one	NULL
get	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Watson	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
surprise	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
slightly	NULL
contemptuous	NULL
amusement	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
just	NULL
knows	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
you	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
dances	NULL
you	NULL
soon	NULL
get	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
as	NULL
many	NULL
people	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
hated	NULL
Watson	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
places	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
's	NULL
skin	NULL
,	NULL
imagining	NULL
what	NULL
life	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
Watson	NULL
.	NULL

XXXVIII	NULL
At	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
various	NULL
places	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
clerk	NULL
named	NULL
Thompson	NULL
and	NULL
spent	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
monotonously	NULL
calling	NULL
out	NULL
items	NULL
of	NULL
expenditure	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
checked	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
given	NULL
long	NULL
pages	NULL
of	NULL
figures	NULL
to	NULL
add	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
head	NULL
for	NULL
figures	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
slowly	NULL
.	NULL

Thompson	NULL
grew	NULL
irritated	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
mistakes	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
fellow-clerk	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
lean	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
forty	NULL
,	NULL
sallow	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
black	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
ragged	NULL
moustache	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
hollow	NULL
cheeks	NULL
and	NULL
deep	NULL
lines	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
nose	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
dislike	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
articled	NULL
clerk	NULL
.	NULL

Because	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
put	NULL
down	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
guineas	NULL
and	NULL
keep	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
career	NULL
;	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
experience	NULL
and	NULL
ability	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
ever	NULL
being	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
clerk	NULL
at	NULL
thirty-five	NULL
shillings	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
cross-grained	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
oppressed	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
resented	NULL
the	NULL
superciliousness	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
fancied	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sneered	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
educated	NULL
than	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
mocked	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
pronunciation	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
forgive	NULL
him	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
cockney	NULL
accent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
sarcastically	NULL
exaggerated	NULL
his	NULL
aitches	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
his	NULL
manner	NULL
was	NULL
merely	NULL
gruff	NULL
and	NULL
repellent	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
gift	NULL
for	NULL
accountancy	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
humiliating	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
attacks	NULL
were	NULL
gross	NULL
and	NULL
silly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
wounded	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
self-defence	NULL
he	NULL
assumed	NULL
an	NULL
attitude	NULL
of	NULL
superiority	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Had	NULL
a	NULL
bath	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL

Thompson	NULL
said	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
late	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
early	NULL
punctuality	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
lasted	NULL

I	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Your	NULL

very	NULL

"	NULL

But	NULL
Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
conceal	NULL
from	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
clerks	NULL
,	NULL
ill-paid	NULL
and	NULL
uncouth	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
more	NULL
useful	NULL
than	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
grew	NULL
impatient	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
really	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
this	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
as	NULL
smart	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
office-boy	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
listened	NULL
sulkily	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
being	NULL
blamed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
humiliated	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
given	NULL
accounts	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
fair	NULL
copies	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
satisfied	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
another	NULL
clerk	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
tolerable	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
novelty	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
it	NULL
grew	NULL
irksome	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
aptitude	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
hate	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Often	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
doing	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wasted	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
drawing	NULL
little	NULL
pictures	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
note-paper	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
sketches	NULL
of	NULL
Watson	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
conceivable	NULL
attitude	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Watson	NULL
was	NULL
impressed	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
talent	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
drawings	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
praises	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wonder	NULL
you	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
painter	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Only	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
there	NULL
's	NULL
no	NULL
money	NULL
in	NULL

"	NULL

It	NULL
chanced	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carter	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL
was	NULL
dining	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Watsons	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sketches	NULL
were	NULL
shown	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
following	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
seldom	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
awe	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Look	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
young	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
care	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
office-hours	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
seen	NULL
those	NULL
sketches	NULL
of	NULL
yours	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
're	NULL
on	NULL
office-paper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
tells	NULL
me	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL

and	NULL
we	NULL
're	NULL
getting	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
class	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL

but	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
profession	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
termination	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
phrase	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
finished	NULL
rather	NULL
tamely	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
alive	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
Philip	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
agreement	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
leave	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
back	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
paid	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
articles	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
fit	NULL
for	NULL
something	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
add	NULL
up	NULL
accounts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
humiliating	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
ill	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
contemptible	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
vulgar	NULL
scenes	NULL
with	NULL
Thompson	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
nerves	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
March	NULL
Watson	NULL
ended	NULL
his	NULL
year	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
regret	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
clerks	NULL
disliked	NULL
them	NULL
equally	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
belonged	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
class	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
higher	NULL
than	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bond	NULL
of	NULL
union	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
spend	NULL
over	NULL
four	NULL
years	NULL
more	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
dreary	NULL
set	NULL
of	NULL
fellows	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
sank	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
wonderful	NULL
things	NULL
from	NULL
London	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hated	NULL
it	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
a	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
anyone	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
everywhere	NULL
by	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
stand	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
lie	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
joy	NULL
of	NULL
never	NULL
seeing	NULL
again	NULL
that	NULL
dingy	NULL
office	NULL
or	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
those	NULL
drab	NULL
lodgings	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
great	NULL
disappointment	NULL
befell	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
.	NULL

Hayward	NULL
had	NULL
announced	NULL
his	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
seeing	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
lately	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
ideas	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
discuss	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
nobody	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
interest	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
abstract	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
excited	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
talking	NULL
his	NULL
fill	NULL
with	NULL
someone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
wretched	NULL
when	NULL
Hayward	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
was	NULL
lovelier	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
Italy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
tear	NULL
himself	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
why	NULL
Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
squandering	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
youth	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
office	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
beautiful	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
letter	NULL
proceeded	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wonder	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
bear	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
Fleet	NULL
Street	NULL
and	NULL
Lincoln	NULL
's	NULL
Inn	NULL
now	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
shudder	NULL
of	NULL
disgust	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
only	NULL
two	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
that	NULL
make	NULL
life	NULL
worth	NULL
living	NULL
,	NULL
love	NULL
and	NULL
art	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
imagine	NULL
you	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
office	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
ledger	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
wear	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
umbrella	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
black	NULL
bag	NULL
?	NULL

My	NULL
feeling	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
should	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
life	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
adventure	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
should	NULL
burn	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
hard	NULL
,	NULL
gem-like	NULL
flame	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
risks	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
should	NULL
expose	NULL
oneself	NULL
to	NULL
danger	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
and	NULL
study	NULL
art	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
always	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
talent	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
suggestion	NULL
fell	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
vaguely	NULL
turning	NULL
over	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
startled	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
constant	NULL
rumination	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
his	NULL
only	NULL
escape	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
wretchedness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
present	NULL
state	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
all	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
talent	NULL
;	NULL
at	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
admired	NULL
his	NULL
water	NULL
colours	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
again	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
chasing	NULL
;	NULL
even	NULL
strangers	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
Watsons	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
struck	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
sketches	NULL
.	NULL

La	NULL
Vie	NULL
de	NULL
Boheme	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
impression	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
most	NULL
depressed	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
pages	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
transported	NULL
into	NULL
those	NULL
chasing	NULL
attics	NULL
where	NULL
Rodolphe	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
danced	NULL
and	NULL
loved	NULL
and	NULL
sang	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
Paris	NULL
as	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
disillusion	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
yearned	NULL
for	NULL
romance	NULL
and	NULL
beauty	NULL
and	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Paris	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
pictures	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
why	NULL
should	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
paint	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
anybody	NULL
else	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
live	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
manage	NULL
easily	NULL
on	NULL
eighty	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
enthusiastically	NULL
approved	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
project	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
good	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
wasted	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
office	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
clerk	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
artist	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
dramatically	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
besought	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
himself	NULL
:	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
cautious	NULL
nature	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
for	NULL
Hayward	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
taking	NULL
risks	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
in	NULL
gilt-edged	NULL
securities	NULL
;	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
entire	NULL
fortune	NULL
amounted	NULL
to	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
eighteen-hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hesitated	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
it	NULL
chanced	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
suddenly	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
firm	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
accounts	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
hotel	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Faubourg	NULL
St.	NULL
Honore	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
owned	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
English	NULL
company	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
twice	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
clerk	NULL
went	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
clerk	NULL
who	NULL
generally	NULL
went	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
ill	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
press	NULL
of	NULL
work	NULL
prevented	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
from	NULL
getting	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
best	NULL
be	NULL
spared	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
articles	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
some	NULL
claim	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
job	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pleasures	NULL
of	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
delighted	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
'll	NULL
'	NULL
ave	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
we	NULL
get	NULL
our	NULL
evenings	NULL
to	NULL
ourselves	NULL

Paris	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
smiled	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
knowing	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
do	NULL
us	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL

they	NULL
give	NULL
us	NULL
all	NULL
our	NULL
meals	NULL

so	NULL
it	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
cost	NULL
one	NULL
anything	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
I	NULL
like	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL

expense	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
Calais	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
crowd	NULL
of	NULL
gesticulating	NULL
porters	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
leaped	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
This	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
eyes	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
sped	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
adored	NULL
the	NULL
sand	NULL
dunes	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
colour	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
lovely	NULL
than	NULL
anything	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
seen	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
enchanted	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
canals	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
lines	NULL
of	NULL
poplars	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Gare	NULL
du	NULL
Nord	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
trundled	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
cobbled	NULL
streets	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
ramshackle	NULL
,	NULL
noisy	NULL
cab	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
breathing	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
air	NULL
so	NULL
intoxicating	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
restrain	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
shouting	NULL
aloud	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
met	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
manager	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
stout	NULL
,	NULL
pleasant	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
spoke	NULL
tolerable	NULL
English	NULL
;	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
friend	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
greeted	NULL
them	NULL
effusively	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
dined	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
private	NULL
room	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
eaten	NULL
anything	NULL
so	NULL
delicious	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
beefsteak	NULL
aux	NULL
pommes	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
drunk	NULL
such	NULL
nectar	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
vin	NULL
ordinaire	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
set	NULL
before	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
respectable	NULL
householder	NULL
with	NULL
excellent	NULL
principles	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
capital	NULL
of	NULL
France	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
paradise	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
joyously	NULL
obscene	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
the	NULL
manager	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
what	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
'	NULL
thick	NULL
.	NULL
'	NULL

He	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
these	NULL
visits	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
they	NULL
kept	NULL
you	NULL
from	NULL
growing	NULL
rusty	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
evenings	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
their	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
dined	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Moulin	NULL
Rouge	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Folies	NULL
Bergeres	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
little	NULL
eyes	NULL
twinkled	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
sly	NULL
,	NULL
sensual	NULL
smile	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
sought	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
pornographic	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
haunts	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
specially	NULL
arranged	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
foreigner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
afterwards	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
nation	NULL
could	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
which	NULL
permitted	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
nudged	NULL
Philip	NULL
when	NULL
at	NULL
some	NULL
revue	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
appeared	NULL
with	NULL
practically	NULL
nothing	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
strapping	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
courtesans	NULL
who	NULL
walked	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
vulgar	NULL
Paris	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
showed	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
eyes	NULL
blinded	NULL
with	NULL
illusion	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
rush	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Champs	NULL
Elysees	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stand	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Place	NULL
de	NULL
la	NULL
Concorde	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
June	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Paris	NULL
was	NULL
silvery	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
delicacy	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
was	NULL
romance	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
spent	NULL
the	NULL
inside	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
on	NULL
Sunday	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
late	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
reached	NULL
his	NULL
dingy	NULL
rooms	NULL
in	NULL
Barnes	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
surrender	NULL
his	NULL
articles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
to	NULL
study	NULL
art	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
should	NULL
think	NULL
him	NULL
unreasonable	NULL
he	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
till	NULL
his	NULL
year	NULL
was	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
his	NULL
holiday	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
fortnight	NULL
in	NULL
August	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
Herbert	NULL
Carter	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
returning	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
though	NULL
Philip	NULL
could	NULL
force	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
pretend	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
any	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
July	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
escaped	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
by	NULL
pretending	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
lectures	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
examination	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
he	NULL
spent	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
National	NULL
Gallery	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
read	NULL
books	NULL
about	NULL
Paris	NULL
and	NULL
books	NULL
about	NULL
painting	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
steeped	NULL
in	NULL
Ruskin	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
read	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
Vasari	NULL
's	NULL
lives	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
painters	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
liked	NULL
that	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
Correggio	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
fancied	NULL
himself	NULL
standing	NULL
before	NULL
some	NULL
great	NULL
masterpiece	NULL
and	NULL
crying	NULL
:	NULL
Anch	NULL
'	NULL
io	NULL
son	NULL
'	NULL
pittore	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
hesitation	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
makings	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
painter	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
After	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
only	NULL
try	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
great	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
risks	NULL

"	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carter	NULL
was	NULL
spending	NULL
the	NULL
month	NULL
in	NULL
Scotland	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
managing	NULL
clerk	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
charge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Goodworthy	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
pleasantly	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
since	NULL
their	NULL
trip	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL

now	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL

All	NULL
day	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
telling	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL
Vicar	NULL

would	NULL
have	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
scheme	NULL

Philip	NULL
laid	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL

had	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL

should	NULL
stick	NULL
to	NULL
whatever	NULL

had	NULL
begun	NULL

all	NULL
weak	NULL

laid	NULL
an	NULL

not	NULL
changing	NULL

Mr.	NULL

were	NULL
frankly	NULL
shocked	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
an	NULL
artist	NULL

He	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL

said	NULL

painting	NULL
was	NULL

a	NULL

then	NULL

grew	NULL
more	NULL
violent	NULL

was	NULL
another	NULL

Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
sat	NULL
by	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL

anxious	NULL

unhappy	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
beside	NULL
himself	NULL

and	NULL
anything	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
then	NULL
would	NULL

increase	NULL
his	NULL

Finally	NULL
the	NULL

nothing	NULL

neither	NULL

Philip	NULL

made	NULL
up	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

turned	NULL
the	NULL

incessantly	NULL

loved	NULL
him	NULL

he	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL

She	NULL

that	NULL
they	NULL

right	NULL

At	NULL
his	NULL
suggestion	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
solicitor	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
discontented	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL

and	NULL
asking	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Nixon	NULL
answered	NULL
as	NULL
follows	NULL
:	NULL
Dear	NULL
Mrs.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Herbert	NULL

Philip	NULL
has	NULL
not	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
wished	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
strongly	NULL
set	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL

perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
better	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
break	NULL
his	NULL
articles	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
naturally	NULL
very	NULL
disappointed	NULL

as	NULL
you	NULL

The	NULL
letter	NULL
was	NULL
shown	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL

served	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
increase	NULL

obstinacy	NULL

was	NULL
willing	NULL
enough	NULL
that	NULL

suggested	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL

nothing	NULL

him	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL

when	NULL

said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
very	NULL

.	NULL
"	NULL

A	NULL
smile	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
tired	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
of	NULL
pure	NULL
happiness	NULL
.	NULL

Oh	NULL

I	NULL

XL	NULL
A	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Philip	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stood	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
back	NULL
her	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
restless	NULL
and	NULL
eager	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Kiss	NULL
me	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
leaned	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
train	NULL
started	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
wooden	NULL
platform	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
station	NULL
,	NULL
waving	NULL
her	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
sight	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
heavy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
seemed	NULL
very	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
enough	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
eager	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
beckoned	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
clenched	NULL
her	NULL
teeth	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
cry	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
uttered	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
inward	NULL
prayer	NULL
that	NULL
God	NULL
would	NULL
guard	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
keep	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
temptation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
happiness	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
fortune	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Philip	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
carriage	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
only	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Otter	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
massiere	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
Hayward	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
introduction	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
an	NULL
invitation	NULL
to	NULL
tea	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
arrived	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
luggage	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
cab	NULL
and	NULL
trundled	NULL
off	NULL
slowly	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
gay	NULL
streets	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
bridge	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
narrow	NULL
ways	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Latin	NULL
Quarter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Hotel	NULL
des	NULL
Deux	NULL
Ecoles	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
shabby	NULL
street	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
Boulevard	NULL
du	NULL
Montparnasse	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
convenient	NULL
for	NULL
Amitrano	NULL
's	NULL
School	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
waiter	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
box	NULL
up	NULL
five	NULL
flights	NULL
of	NULL
stairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
shown	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
tiny	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
fusty	NULL
from	NULL
unopened	NULL
windows	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
wooden	NULL
bed	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
canopy	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
of	NULL
red	NULL
rep	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
heavy	NULL
curtains	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
dingy	NULL
material	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
chest	NULL
of	NULL
drawers	NULL
served	NULL
also	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
washing-stand	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
massive	NULL
wardrobe	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
style	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
connected	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
King	NULL
Louis	NULL
Philippe	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wall-paper	NULL
was	NULL
discoloured	NULL
with	NULL
age	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
dark	NULL
gray	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
vaguely	NULL
seen	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
garlands	NULL
of	NULL
brown	NULL
leaves	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
Philip	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
seemed	NULL
quaint	NULL
and	NULL
charming	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
late	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
too	NULL
excited	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
boulevard	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
led	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
square	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
vivid	NULL
with	NULL
arc-lamps	NULL
,	NULL
noisy	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
yellow	NULL
trams	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
cross	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
directions	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
laugh	NULL
aloud	NULL
with	NULL
joy	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
cafes	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
chance	NULL
,	NULL
thirsty	NULL
and	NULL
eager	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
nearer	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
crowd	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
installed	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
table	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
Cafe	NULL
de	NULL
Versailles	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
other	NULL
table	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
night	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
curiously	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
here	NULL
little	NULL
family	NULL
groups	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
a	NULL
knot	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
with	NULL
odd-shaped	NULL
hats	NULL
and	NULL
beards	NULL
talking	NULL
loudly	NULL
and	NULL
gesticulating	NULL
;	NULL
next	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
painters	NULL
with	NULL
women	NULL
who	NULL
Philip	NULL
hoped	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
their	NULL
lawful	NULL
wives	NULL
;	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
Americans	NULL
loudly	NULL
arguing	NULL
on	NULL
art	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
soul	NULL
was	NULL
thrilled	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
till	NULL
very	NULL
late	NULL
,	NULL
tired	NULL
out	NULL
but	NULL
too	NULL
happy	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
wide	NULL
awake	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
manifold	NULL
noise	NULL
of	NULL
Paris	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
about	NULL
tea-time	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Lion	NULL
de	NULL
Belfort	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
street	NULL
that	NULL
led	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Boulevard	NULL
Raspail	NULL
found	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Otter	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
insignificant	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
thirty	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
provincial	NULL
air	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
deliberately	NULL
lady-like	NULL
manner	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
introduced	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
discovered	NULL
presently	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
studying	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
for	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
and	NULL
later	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
separated	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
small	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
portraits	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
painted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
inexperience	NULL
they	NULL
seemed	NULL
extremely	NULL
accomplished	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wonder	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
ever	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
paint	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
expect	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
replied	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
self-satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
expect	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
everything	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL

course	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
kind	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
address	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
shop	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
portfolio	NULL
,	NULL
drawing-paper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
charcoal	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
Amitrano	NULL
's	NULL
about	NULL
nine	NULL
tomorrow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL
be	NULL
there	NULL
then	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
place	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
vague	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
first	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
so	NULL
glad	NULL

hear	NULL

that	NULL

want	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
hurry	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
touched	NULL

till	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
been	NULL
here	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
portrait	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sticky	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
painting	NULL
that	NULL
hung	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
were	NULL
you	NULL

I	NULL
would	NULL

Philip	NULL
thanked	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
suggestion	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
odd	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
particularly	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
careful	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Otter	NULL

had	NULL
spoken	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
massive	NULL
suite	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL

white	NULL

curtains	NULL
which	NULL
Aunt	NULL

put	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
in	NULL
summer	NULL

The	NULL
piano	NULL
was	NULL
draped	NULL
in	NULL
Liberty	NULL
silk	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
chimney-piece	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Otter	NULL
followed	NULL
his	NULL
wandering	NULL
eye	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Otter	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
drawing	NULL
materials	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
stroke	NULL
of	NULL
nine	NULL

trying	NULL
to	NULL
seem	NULL
self-assured	NULL

he	NULL
presented	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Otter	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
there	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
forward	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
friendly	NULL
smile	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
anxious	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
reception	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
nouveau	NULL

for	NULL

had	NULL
read	NULL
a	NULL

the	NULL

to	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
newcomer	NULL

exposed	NULL
at	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Otter	NULL
had	NULL
reassured	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

there	NULL

nothing	NULL

The	NULL
studio	NULL
was	NULL
large	NULL

bare	NULL

with	NULL
gray	NULL
walls	NULL

on	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
pinned	NULL
the	NULL

A	NULL

Philip	NULL
placed	NULL
an	NULL

where	NULL
she	NULL
indicated	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Otter	NULL
introduced	NULL
him	NULL

When	NULL
Philip	NULL
entered	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
studio	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
curiously	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
model	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
indifferent	NULL
glance	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
they	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
beautiful	NULL
sheet	NULL
of	NULL
paper	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
stared	NULL
awkwardly	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
model	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
a	NULL
naked	NULL
woman	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
young	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
breasts	NULL
were	NULL
shrivelled	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
colourless	NULL
,	NULL
fair	NULL
hair	NULL
that	NULL
fell	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
forehead	NULL
untidily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
large	NULL
freckles	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
Miss	NULL
Price	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
been	NULL
working	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
trouble	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
paper	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
mess	NULL

out	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL

looked	NULL
strangely	NULL

I	NULL

could	NULL
do	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL

that	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
work	NULL
slowly	NULL
downwards	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
infinitely	NULL
more	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
a	NULL
head	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
model	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
one	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
difficulties	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
Miss	NULL
Price	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
working	NULL
with	NULL
vehement	NULL
gravity	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
brow	NULL
was	NULL
wrinkled	NULL
with	NULL
eagerness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
anxious	NULL
look	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
hot	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
studio	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
drops	NULL
of	NULL
sweat	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
forehead	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
of	NULL
twenty-six	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
dull	NULL
gold	NULL
hair	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
handsome	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
carelessly	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
dragged	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
forehead	NULL
and	NULL
tied	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
hurried	NULL
knot	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
broad	NULL
,	NULL
flat	NULL
features	NULL
and	NULL
small	NULL
eyes	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
skin	NULL
was	NULL
pasty	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
singular	NULL
unhealthiness	NULL
of	NULL
tone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
colour	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
unwashed	NULL
air	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
wondering	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
slept	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
clothes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
serious	NULL
and	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
pause	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
stepped	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
having	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
bother	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
it	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
getting	NULL
on	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
rueful	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
expect	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
that	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
must	NULL
take	NULL
measurements	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
square	NULL
out	NULL
your	NULL
paper	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
showed	NULL
him	NULL
rapidly	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
impressed	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
earnestness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
repelled	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
charm	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
grateful	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
hints	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
mostly	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
always	NULL
arrived	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
studio	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
year	NULL
(	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
early	NULL
yet	NULL
)	NULL
was	NULL
fairly	NULL
full	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
black	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
enormous	NULL
nose	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
face	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
reminded	NULL
you	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
horse	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
next	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
and	NULL
nodded	NULL
across	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Price	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
very	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL

up	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL

Philip	NULL
smiled	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Miss	NULL
Price	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
remark	NULL
seriously	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
gravely	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
inclined	NULL

work	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
canvas	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
working	NULL
in	NULL
colour	NULL

had	NULL
sketched	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL

the	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL

was	NULL
long	NULL

desperately	NULL

his	NULL

seemed	NULL

protrude	NULL

a	NULL

They	NULL
laughed	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
conversation	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
thousand	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
talked	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL

No	NULL

the	NULL

They	NULL
talked	NULL

summer	NULL

Philip	NULL
listened	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
ears	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
leaped	NULL
with	NULL
exultation	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
time	NULL
flew	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Clutton	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL

XLI	NULL
Philip	NULL
walked	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
Boulevard	NULL
du	NULL
Montparnasse	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
Paris	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
visit	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
the	NULL
accounts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Hotel	NULL
St.	NULL
Georges	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
already	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
shudder	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
reminded	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
a	NULL
provincial	NULL
town	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
easy-going	NULL
air	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
sunny	NULL
spaciousness	NULL
which	NULL
invited	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
day-dreaming	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
trimness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
vivid	NULL
whiteness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
houses	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
breadth	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
agreeable	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
already	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sauntered	NULL
along	NULL
,	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
seemed	NULL
an	NULL
elegance	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
ordinary	NULL
,	NULL
workmen	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
broad	NULL
red	NULL
sashes	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
wide	NULL
trousers	NULL
,	NULL
little	NULL
soldiers	NULL
in	NULL
dingy	NULL
,	NULL
charming	NULL
uniforms	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
presently	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Avenue	NULL
de	NULL
l'Observatoire	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
of	NULL
pleasure	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
magnificent	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
so	NULL
graceful	NULL
,	NULL
vista	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
gardens	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Luxembourg	NULL
:	NULL
children	NULL
were	NULL
playing	NULL
,	NULL
nurses	NULL
with	NULL
long	NULL
ribbons	NULL
walked	NULL
slowly	NULL
two	NULL
by	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
busy	NULL
men	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
with	NULL
satchels	NULL
under	NULL
their	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
youths	NULL
strangely	NULL
dressed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
scene	NULL
was	NULL
formal	NULL
and	NULL
dainty	NULL
;	NULL
nature	NULL
was	NULL
arranged	NULL
and	NULL
ordered	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
so	NULL
exquisitely	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
nature	NULL
unordered	NULL
and	NULL
unarranged	NULL
seemed	NULL
barbaric	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
enchanted	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
excited	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
spot	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
classic	NULL
ground	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
awe	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
delight	NULL
which	NULL
some	NULL
old	NULL
don	NULL
might	NULL
feel	NULL
when	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
smiling	NULL
plain	NULL
of	NULL
Sparta	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
wandered	NULL
he	NULL
chanced	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Miss	NULL
Price	NULL
sitting	NULL
by	NULL
herself	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
bench	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hesitated	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
anyone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
uncouth	NULL
way	NULL
seemed	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
place	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
happiness	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
around	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
divined	NULL
her	NULL
sensitiveness	NULL
to	NULL
affront	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
polite	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
doing	NULL
here	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
May	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

That	NULL

he	NULL
laughed	NULL

'm	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
disconcerted	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
lit	NULL
a	NULL
cigarette	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Did	NULL
Clutton	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
suddenly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

do	NULL
n't	NULL

said	NULL
Philip	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
spoke	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
passionate	NULL
strenuousness	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
striking	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
sailor	NULL
hat	NULL
of	NULL
black	NULL
straw	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
blouse	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
clean	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
brown	NULL
skirt	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
gloves	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
wanted	NULL
washing	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
unattractive	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
wished	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
whether	NULL

him	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
reference	NULL
to	NULL
anything	NULL

gone	NULL
before	NULL

in	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
quickly	NULL
and	NULL
flushed	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
reddened	NULL
her	NULL
pasty	NULL
skin	NULL
acquired	NULL
a	NULL
curiously	NULL

thought	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

she	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL

They	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL

walked	NULL

the	NULL
studio	NULL

Philip	NULL
could	NULL

remained	NULL
from	NULL
sheer	NULL
embarrassment	NULL

not	NULL
knowing	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
her	NULL

she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
talk	NULL

she	NULL
answered	NULL
his	NULL
questions	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
ungracious	NULL
manner	NULL

A	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
studio	NULL
door	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
dish	NULL
into	NULL
which	NULL
each	NULL
person	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
dropped	NULL
his	NULL
half	NULL

The	NULL
studio	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
fuller	NULL

it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL

there	NULL

large	NULL

proportion	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
assemblage	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
warm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
quickly	NULL
grew	NULL
fetid	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
sat	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
vast	NULL
gray	NULL

Philip	NULL
tried	NULL

put	NULL

practice	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
job	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
draw	NULL
nearly	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
glanced	NULL
enviously	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
sketches	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
sat	NULL
near	NULL
him	NULL

wondered	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
ever	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
the	NULL
charcoal	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
mastery	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hour	NULL
passed	NULL
quickly	NULL

Not	NULL
wishing	NULL

press	NULL
himself	NULL
upon	NULL
Miss	NULL

sat	NULL
down	NULL

she	NULL
answered	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
till	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
eager	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
something	NULL
characteristic	NULL
.	NULL

Absinthe	NULL
!	NULL

of	NULL
course	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
indicated	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
sauntering	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
seated	NULL
himself	NULL
outside	NULL
a	NULL
cafe	NULL
and	NULL
ordered	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
drank	NULL
with	NULL
nausea	NULL
and	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
taste	NULL
disgusting	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
moral	NULL
effect	NULL
magnificent	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
every	NULL
inch	NULL
an	NULL
art-student	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
drank	NULL
on	NULL
an	NULL
empty	NULL
stomach	NULL
his	NULL
spirits	NULL
presently	NULL
grew	NULL
very	NULL
high	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
watched	NULL
the	NULL
crowds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
all	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
his	NULL
brothers	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
reached	NULL
Gravier	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
Clutton	NULL
sat	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
Philip	NULL
limping	NULL
along	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
made	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dinner	NULL
was	NULL
frugal	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
plate	NULL
of	NULL
soup	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
dish	NULL
of	NULL
meat	NULL
,	NULL
fruit	NULL
,	NULL
cheese	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
bottle	NULL
of	NULL
wine	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
paid	NULL
no	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
ate	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
note	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

Flanagan	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
again	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
American	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
snub-nosed	NULL
youth	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
jolly	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
laughing	NULL
mouth	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
Norfolk	NULL
jacket	NULL
of	NULL
bold	NULL
pattern	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
blue	NULL
stock	NULL
round	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
tweed	NULL
cap	NULL
of	NULL
fantastic	NULL
shape	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
impressionism	NULL
reigned	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Latin	NULL
Quarter	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
its	NULL
victory	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
older	NULL
schools	NULL

Carolus-Duran	NULL

were	NULL
set	NULL
up	NULL
against	NULL
Manet	NULL

Monet	NULL

Degas	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
appreciate	NULL
these	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
a	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
grace	NULL

Whistler	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
influence	NULL
strong	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL

his	NULL
compatriots	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL

Japanese	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
masters	NULL
were	NULL
tested	NULL
by	NULL
new	NULL
standards	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
esteem	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Raphael	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
centuries	NULL
held	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
derision	NULL
to	NULL
wise	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
offered	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
all	NULL

for	NULL
Velasquez	NULL
'	NULL

of	NULL
Philip	NULL
IV	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
National	NULL
Gallery	NULL

Philip	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
discussion	NULL
on	NULL
art	NULL
was	NULL
raging	NULL
.	NULL

Lawson	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
at	NULL
luncheon	NULL
,	NULL
sat	NULL
opposite	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
thin	NULL
youth	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
freckled	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
red	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
very	NULL
bright	NULL
green	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
Philip	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
he	NULL
fixed	NULL
them	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
remarked	NULL
suddenly	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Raphael	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
tolerable	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
painted	NULL

When	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL

Raphael	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Lawson	NULL
spoke	NULL
so	NULL
aggressively	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
aback	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
answer	NULL
because	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
broke	NULL
in	NULL
impatiently	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
hell	NULL
with	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
cried	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

"	NULL
Nothing	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Fancy	NULL

Pa-ris	NULL

thinking	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
broad	NULL
Western	NULL
accent	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
gathered	NULL
himself	NULL
together	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
banged	NULL
his	NULL
fist	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
Clutton	NULL
severely	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
another	NULL
American	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
dressed	NULL
like	NULL
those	NULL
fine	NULL
fellows	NULL
whom	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Luxembourg	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
handsome	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
ascetic	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
dark	NULL
eyes	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wore	NULL
his	NULL
fantastic	NULL
garb	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
dashing	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
buccaneer	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
vast	NULL
quantity	NULL
of	NULL
dark	NULL
hair	NULL
which	NULL
fell	NULL
constantly	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
most	NULL
frequent	NULL
gesture	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
back	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
dramatically	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
some	NULL
long	NULL
wisp	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Olympia	NULL
by	NULL
Manet	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
then	NULL
hung	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Luxembourg	NULL

Lawson	NULL
put	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
knife	NULL
and	NULL
fork	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
green	NULL
eyes	NULL
flashed	NULL
fire	NULL

he	NULL
gasped	NULL
with	NULL
rage	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL

Before	NULL
the	NULL

could	NULL

vehemently	NULL

Hayward	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
disdained	NULL
humanity	NULL

he	NULL
adopted	NULL
the	NULL

Clutton	NULL

Lawson	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
multitude	NULL
with	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL

They	NULL
described	NULL

that	NULL
filled	NULL
the	NULL

What	NULL
they	NULL
said	NULL

looked	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL

with	NULL
contempt	NULL

with	NULL
tolerance	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
practised	NULL
an	NULL

with	NULL
awe	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
cafe	NULL
Lawson	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
in	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
hardly	NULL
a	NULL
bite	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
autumn	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
morbid	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
draughts	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
warmest	NULL
weather	NULL
sat	NULL
inside	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL

The	NULL

sat	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
sheltered	NULL

the	NULL
cafe	NULL

with	NULL
his	NULL
coat	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL

collar	NULL
turned	NULL
up	NULL

He	NULL
wore	NULL
his	NULL

well	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
forehead	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
avoid	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

head	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL

enough	NULL

body	NULL

It	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL

on	NULL

was	NULL
playing	NULL

greeted	NULL
the	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL

went	NULL
on	NULL

The	NULL

a	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL

This	NULL

translated	NULL
literally	NULL

the	NULL

He	NULL
poured	NULL
himself	NULL
out	NULL

Lawson	NULL

Clutton	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
's	NULL
remark	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
answer	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
about	NULL
Mallarme	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
often	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
gatherings	NULL
on	NULL
Tuesday	NULL
evenings	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
poet	NULL
received	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
letters	NULL

discoursed	NULL
with	NULL

on	NULL
any	NULL

him	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL

evidently	NULL
been	NULL
there	NULL
lately	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
talked	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL

he	NULL
talked	NULL
nonsense	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
about	NULL

the	NULL

thing	NULL

If	NULL

what	NULL

we	NULL
here	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
here	NULL

It	NULL

no	NULL
business	NULL
of	NULL
mine	NULL

But	NULL
art	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
luxury	NULL

attach	NULL
importance	NULL

self-preservation	NULL

the	NULL

only	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
stopped	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
to	NULL
drink	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
pondered	NULL
for	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
the	NULL
problem	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
loved	NULL
liquor	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
talk	NULL
or	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
loved	NULL
conversation	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
thirsty	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
wrote	NULL
a	NULL
poem	NULL
yesterday	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Without	NULL
being	NULL
asked	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
recite	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
marking	NULL
the	NULL
rhythm	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
extended	NULL
forefinger	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
possibly	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
fine	NULL
poem	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
scarlet	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
plain	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
vivid	NULL
colour	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
vulgarity	NULL
of	NULL
nature	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
blackened	NULL
her	NULL
eyelashes	NULL
and	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
painted	NULL
both	NULL
eyelids	NULL
a	NULL
bold	NULL
blue	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
triangle	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
fantastic	NULL
and	NULL
amusing	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
dark	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
ears	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fashion	NULL
made	NULL
popular	NULL
by	NULL
Mlle.	NULL
Cleo	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
wandered	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
finished	NULL
the	NULL
recitation	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
verses	NULL
,	NULL
smiled	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
indulgently	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

She	NULL
passed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
at	NULL

he	NULL
took	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
filled	NULL
his	NULL
glass	NULL
again	NULL

and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL

spoke	NULL

rotund	NULL
delivery	NULL

chose	NULL

words	NULL
carefully	NULL

mingled	NULL
wisdom	NULL

the	NULL
most	NULL

gravely	NULL
making	NULL
fun	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
hearers	NULL

one	NULL
moment	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
playfully	NULL
giving	NULL
them	NULL
sound	NULL
advice	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
by	NULL
turns	NULL
devout	NULL

obscene	NULL

merry	NULL

lachrymose	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
grew	NULL
remarkably	NULL
drunk	NULL

then	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL

At	NULL

exhausted	NULL

up	NULL

go	NULL
home	NULL

"	NULL

accompanied	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL

got	NULL
to	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL

All	NULL
these	NULL

that	NULL

flung	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
carelessly	NULL
seethed	NULL
in	NULL

was	NULL
tremendously	NULL
excited	NULL

felt	NULL

On	NULL

these	NULL
were	NULL
an	NULL
object	NULL

derision	NULL

the	NULL
students	NULL

instructed	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL
disciple	NULL
of	NULL
Ingres	NULL

impervious	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
progress	NULL

art	NULL
and	NULL
angrily	NULL
impatient	NULL
with	NULL

names	NULL
were	NULL
Manet	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
teacher	NULL

studio	NULL
on	NULL
Fridays	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL
difficult	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL

shrivelled	NULL

with	NULL
bad	NULL
teeth	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
bilious	NULL
air	NULL

an	NULL
untidy	NULL
gray	NULL
beard	NULL

and	NULL
savage	NULL
eyes	NULL

his	NULL
voice	NULL
was	NULL
high	NULL

tone	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
pictures	NULL
bought	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Luxembourg	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
twenty-five	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
career	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
talent	NULL
was	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
youth	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
personality	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
repeat	NULL
the	NULL
landscape	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
early	NULL
success	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
reproached	NULL
with	NULL
monotony	NULL

answered	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
envious	NULL
of	NULL
everyone	NULL

and	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL

personal	NULL
loathing	NULL
of	NULL

impressionists	NULL

for	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL

fashion	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
attracted	NULL

Michel	NULL
Rollin	NULL

who	NULL
called	NULL

was	NULL
answered	NULL
by	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
vituperation	NULL

of	NULL
which	NULL

canaille	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL

items	NULL

amused	NULL
himself	NULL

and	NULL
with	NULL
sardonic	NULL
humour	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
blasphemous	NULL

attacked	NULL

accentuate	NULL

ribald	NULL
scorn	NULL

contempt	NULL

students	NULL

examined	NULL

By	NULL
them	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
hated	NULL

feared	NULL

the	NULL

by	NULL
his	NULL
brutal	NULL
sarcasm	NULL
he	NULL
reduced	NULL
often	NULL
to	NULL
tears	NULL

which	NULL
again	NULL
aroused	NULL
his	NULL
ridicule	NULL

he	NULL
remained	NULL
at	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL

Philip	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL

the	NULL

hopelessly	NULL
out	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

Clutton	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

nodded	NULL

Clutton	NULL
dryly	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Luxembourg	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
sore	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
rudeness	NULL

which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
his	NULL
well-meant	NULL
attempt	NULL

say	NULL
something	NULL

and	NULL
passed	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
caught	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

understood	NULL
that	NULL

bring	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL

directly	NULL

Miss	NULL

led	NULL
Philip	NULL
straight	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL

he	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL

contemplate	NULL
the	NULL

took	NULL
him	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
haughty	NULL
air	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Fanny	NULL
Price	NULL
had	NULL
picked	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
glib	NULL
chatter	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

had	NULL
no	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
impressing	NULL
Philip	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
extent	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
knowledge	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
proceeded	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
the	NULL
pictures	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
superciliously	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
insight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
showed	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
painters	NULL
had	NULL
attempted	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
look	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
talked	NULL
with	NULL
much	NULL
gesticulation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
thumb	NULL

and	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
was	NULL
new	NULL

listened	NULL
with	NULL
profound	NULL

bewildered	NULL
interest	NULL

Till	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
worshipped	NULL
Watts	NULL

Burne-Jones	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pretty	NULL
colour	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
affected	NULL
drawing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL

had	NULL
entirely	NULL
satisfied	NULL
his	NULL
aesthetic	NULL
sensibilities	NULL

Their	NULL
vague	NULL
idealism	NULL

the	NULL
suspicion	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
philosophical	NULL
idea	NULL
which	NULL
underlay	NULL
the	NULL
titles	NULL
they	NULL
gave	NULL
their	NULL
pictures	NULL

accorded	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
functions	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL
as	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
diligent	NULL
perusal	NULL
of	NULL
Ruskin	NULL
he	NULL
understood	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
quite	NULL
different	NULL

here	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
moral	NULL
appeal	NULL

the	NULL
contemplation	NULL

could	NULL
help	NULL
no	NULL

lead	NULL
a	NULL

was	NULL
puzzled	NULL

elated	NULL
Philip	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
towards	NULL
mid-day	NULL
they	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

court-yard	NULL

he	NULL
suggested	NULL

Miss	NULL

gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
suspicious	NULL

she	NULL
answered	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
me	NULL
pleasure	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
replied	NULL
,	NULL
smiling	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
crossed	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Boulevard	NULL
St.	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL

n't	NULL

it	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
walked	NULL
on	NULL
firmly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
steps	NULL
brought	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
smaller	NULL
restaurant	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
already	NULL
lunching	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
pavement	NULL
under	NULL
an	NULL
awning	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL

We	NULL

n't	NULL

anything	NULL

this	NULL

it	NULL
looks	NULL
quite	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL

"	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
vacant	NULL
table	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
omelette	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
article	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bill	NULL
of	NULL
fare	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
gazed	NULL
with	NULL
delight	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
passers-by	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
but	NULL
very	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
blouse	NULL

n't	NULL
he	NULL
ripping	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
Miss	NULL
Price	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
astonishment	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
plate	NULL
,	NULL
regardless	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
passing	NULL
spectacle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
heavy	NULL
tears	NULL
were	NULL
rolling	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
on	NULL
earth	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
say	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
entirely	NULL
puzzled	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
fortunately	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
omelette	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
divided	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
his	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
indifferent	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
Miss	NULL
Price	NULL
were	NULL
making	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
agreeable	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
luncheon	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
altogether	NULL
a	NULL
success	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
squeamish	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Miss	NULL
Price	NULL
ate	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
appetite	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
ate	NULL
noisily	NULL
,	NULL
greedily	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
wild	NULL
beast	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
menagerie	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
each	NULL
course	NULL
rubbed	NULL
the	NULL
plate	NULL
with	NULL
pieces	NULL
of	NULL
bread	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
white	NULL
and	NULL
shining	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
lose	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
drop	NULL
of	NULL
gravy	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
Camembert	NULL
cheese	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
disgusted	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
ate	NULL
rind	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
portion	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
eaten	NULL
more	NULL
ravenously	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
starving	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Price	NULL
was	NULL
unaccountable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
parted	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
with	NULL
friendliness	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
tell	NULL
whether	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
sulky	NULL
and	NULL
uncivil	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
learned	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
:	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
draw	NULL
well	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
taught	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
constant	NULL
suggestions	NULL
helped	NULL
his	NULL
progress	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Otter	NULL
was	NULL
useful	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
Miss	NULL
Chalice	NULL
criticised	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
learned	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
glib	NULL
loquacity	NULL
of	NULL
Lawson	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
example	NULL
of	NULL
Clutton	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Fanny	NULL
Price	NULL
hated	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
suggestions	NULL
from	NULL
anyone	NULL
but	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
help	NULL
after	NULL
someone	NULL
else	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
refuse	NULL
with	NULL
brutal	NULL
rudeness	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
other	NULL
fellows	NULL
,	NULL
Lawson	NULL
,	NULL
Clutton	NULL
,	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
,	NULL
chaffed	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
be	NULL
careful	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
lad	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
they	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
's	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
nonsense	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
laughed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Price	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
anyone	NULL
was	NULL
preposterous	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
shudder	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
uncomeliness	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
bedraggled	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
dirty	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
brown	NULL
dress	NULL
she	NULL
always	NULL
wore	NULL
,	NULL
stained	NULL
and	NULL
ragged	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hem	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
supposed	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
hard	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
hard	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
be	NULL
clean	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
surely	NULL
possible	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
needle	NULL
and	NULL
thread	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
skirt	NULL
tidy	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
sort	NULL
his	NULL
impressions	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thrown	NULL
in	NULL
contact	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
ingenuous	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
days	NULL
which	NULL
now	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
at	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
deliberate	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
humanity	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
examine	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
criticise	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
Clutton	NULL
any	NULL
better	NULL
after	NULL
seeing	NULL
him	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
for	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
than	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
general	NULL
impression	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
studio	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
supposed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
great	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
shared	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
opinion	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
what	NULL
exactly	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
neither	NULL
he	NULL
nor	NULL
anybody	NULL
else	NULL
quite	NULL
knew	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
worked	NULL
at	NULL
several	NULL
studios	NULL
before	NULL
Amitrano	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
Julian	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Beaux	NULL
Arts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
MacPherson	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
remaining	NULL
longer	NULL
at	NULL
Amitrano	NULL
's	NULL
than	NULL
anywhere	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
more	NULL
left	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
showing	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
unlike	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
studying	NULL
art	NULL
neither	NULL
sought	NULL
nor	NULL
gave	NULL
advice	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
studio	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Rue	NULL
Campagne	NULL
Premiere	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
served	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
work-room	NULL
and	NULL
bed-room	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
wonderful	NULL
pictures	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
his	NULL
reputation	NULL
if	NULL
only	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
induced	NULL
to	NULL
exhibit	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
afford	NULL
a	NULL
model	NULL
but	NULL
painted	NULL
still	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Lawson	NULL
constantly	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
plate	NULL
of	NULL
apples	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
declared	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
masterpiece	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
fastidious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
aiming	NULL
at	NULL
something	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
fully	NULL
grasp	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
constantly	NULL
dissatisfied	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
whole	NULL
:	NULL
perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
would	NULL
please	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
forearm	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
leg	NULL
and	NULL
foot	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
figure	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
cup	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
still-life	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
cut	NULL
this	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
keep	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
destroying	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
canvas	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
people	NULL
invited	NULL
themselves	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
truthfully	NULL
answer	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
picture	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
Brittany	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
across	NULL
a	NULL
painter	NULL
whom	NULL
nobody	NULL
else	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
fellow	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
stockbroker	NULL
and	NULL
taken	NULL
up	NULL
painting	NULL
at	NULL
middle-age	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
greatly	NULL
influenced	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
turning	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
impressionists	NULL
and	NULL
working	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
painfully	NULL
an	NULL
individual	NULL
way	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
of	NULL
painting	NULL
but	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
something	NULL
strangely	NULL
original	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
Gravier	NULL
's	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
ate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Versailles	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Closerie	NULL
des	NULL
Lilas	NULL
Clutton	NULL
was	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
taciturnity	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
quietly	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sardonic	NULL
expression	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
gaunt	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
spoke	NULL
only	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
witticism	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
liked	NULL
a	NULL
butt	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
most	NULL
cheerful	NULL
when	NULL
someone	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
on	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
exercise	NULL
his	NULL
sarcasm	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seldom	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
but	NULL
painting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
only	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
persons	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
worth	NULL
while	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
really	NULL
anything	NULL
:	NULL
his	NULL
reticence	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
haggard	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
pungent	NULL
humour	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
suggest	NULL
personality	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
an	NULL
effective	NULL
mask	NULL
which	NULL
covered	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
Lawson	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
Philip	NULL
soon	NULL
grew	NULL
intimate	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
variety	NULL
of	NULL
interests	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
agreeable	NULL
companion	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
read	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
students	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
his	NULL
income	NULL
was	NULL
small	NULL
,	NULL
loved	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
books	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
lent	NULL
them	NULL
willingly	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
became	NULL
acquainted	NULL
with	NULL
Flaubert	NULL
and	NULL
Balzac	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
Verlaine	NULL
,	NULL
Heredia	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Villiers	NULL
de	NULL
l'Isle	NULL
Adam	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
plays	NULL
together	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
gallery	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Opera	NULL
Comique	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
Odeon	NULL
quite	NULL
near	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
soon	NULL
shared	NULL
his	NULL
friend	NULL
's	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
tragedians	NULL
of	NULL
Louis	NULL
XIV	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sonorous	NULL
Alexandrine	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
Rue	NULL
Taitbout	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
Concerts	NULL
Rouge	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
for	NULL
seventy-five	NULL
centimes	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL
excellent	NULL
music	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bargain	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
drink	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
seats	NULL
were	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
was	NULL
crowded	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
thick	NULL
with	NULL
caporal	NULL
horrible	NULL
to	NULL
breathe	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
young	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
indifferent	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Bal	NULL
Bullier	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
these	NULL
occasions	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
accompanied	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
excitability	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
roisterous	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
made	NULL
them	NULL
laugh	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL

round	NULL

made	NULL

The	NULL
desire	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
mistress	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
paraphernalia	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
art-student	NULL
in	NULL

It	NULL
gave	NULL
consideration	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
boast	NULL
about	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
difficulty	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
scarcely	NULL
enough	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
themselves	NULL

and	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
argued	NULL
that	NULL
French-women	NULL

so	NULL
clever	NULL
it	NULL
cost	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
two	NULL

one	NULL

they	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
difficult	NULL

meet	NULL
young	NULL
women	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
that	NULL
view	NULL

the	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL

content	NULL
themselves	NULL

the	NULL
most	NULL

envying	NULL

abusing	NULL

received	NULL
protection	NULL
from	NULL
painters	NULL
of	NULL
more	NULL
settled	NULL
respectability	NULL
than	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
how	NULL
difficult	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL

Lawson	NULL
would	NULL
become	NULL
acquainted	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
young	NULL
thing	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
an	NULL
appointment	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
twenty-four	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
all	NULL

she	NULL
never	NULL

he	NULL
sought	NULL
no	NULL

He	NULL
only	NULL
had	NULL
two	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
books	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
reading	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
plays	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
he	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
trouble	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
female	NULL
society	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
speak	NULL
French	NULL
more	NULL
glibly	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
now	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
weeks	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL
busy	NULL
to	NULL
answer	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
another	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
reproaches	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
being	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mood	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
aside	NULL
,	NULL
intending	NULL
to	NULL
open	NULL
it	NULL
later	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
forgot	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
run	NULL
across	NULL
it	NULL
till	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
turning	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
drawer	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
some	NULL
socks	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
holes	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
unopened	NULL
letter	NULL
with	NULL
dismay	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
a	NULL
brute	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
probably	NULL
got	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
suffering	NULL
by	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
events	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
suggested	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
women	NULL
were	NULL
often	NULL
very	NULL
emphatic	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
expressions	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
when	NULL
men	NULL
used	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
quite	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
would	NULL
induce	NULL
him	NULL
ever	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
written	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
hardly	NULL
worth	NULL
while	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
daresay	NULL
she	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
write	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
help	NULL

the	NULL
thing	NULL

all	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
old	NULL
enough	NULL

she	NULL
ought	NULL

"	NULL

For	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
attitude	NULL
was	NULL
obviously	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
dissatisfaction	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
write	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
nor	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
absurdly	NULL
feared	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
appear	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
ridiculous	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
clean	NULL
forgot	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
he	NULL
definitely	NULL
forsook	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
gods	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
amazement	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
works	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
impressionists	NULL
,	NULL
changed	NULL
to	NULL
admiration	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
talking	NULL
as	NULL
emphatically	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
merits	NULL
of	NULL
Manet	NULL
,	NULL
Monet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Degas	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
bought	NULL
a	NULL
photograph	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
drawing	NULL
by	NULL
Ingres	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Odalisque	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
photograph	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Olympia	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
pinned	NULL
side	NULL
by	NULL
side	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
washing-stand	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
contemplate	NULL
their	NULL
beauty	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
shaved	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
now	NULL
quite	NULL
positively	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
no	NULL
painting	NULL
of	NULL
landscape	NULL
before	NULL
Monet	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
thrill	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
Rembrandt	NULL
's	NULL
Disciples	NULL
at	NULL
Emmaus	NULL
or	NULL
Velasquez	NULL
'	NULL
Lady	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Flea-bitten	NULL
Nose	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
her	NULL
real	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
distinguished	NULL
at	NULL
Gravier	NULL
's	NULL
to	NULL
emphasise	NULL
the	NULL
picture	NULL
's	NULL
beauty	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
the	NULL
somewhat	NULL
revolting	NULL
peculiarity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sitter	NULL
's	NULL
appearance	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
Ruskin	NULL
,	NULL
Burne-Jones	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Watts	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
aside	NULL
his	NULL
bowler	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
neat	NULL
blue	NULL
tie	NULL
with	NULL
white	NULL
spots	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
worn	NULL
on	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
disported	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
soft	NULL
,	NULL
broad-brimmed	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
flowing	NULL
black	NULL
cravat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
cape	NULL
of	NULL
romantic	NULL
cut	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
Boulevard	NULL
du	NULL
Montparnasse	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
virtuous	NULL
perseverance	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
learnt	NULL
to	NULL
drink	NULL
absinthe	NULL
without	NULL
distaste	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
letting	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
grow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
because	NULL
Nature	NULL
is	NULL
unkind	NULL
and	NULL
has	NULL
no	NULL
regard	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
immortal	NULL
longings	NULL
of	NULL
youth	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
attempt	NULL
a	NULL
beard	NULL
.	NULL

XLV	NULL
Philip	NULL
soon	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
spirit	NULL
which	NULL
informed	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
was	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
Lawson	NULL
got	NULL
his	NULL
paradoxes	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
Clutton	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
strained	NULL
after	NULL
individuality	NULL
,	NULL
expressed	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
terms	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
insensibly	NULL
acquired	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
older	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
ideas	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
bandied	NULL
about	NULL
at	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
authority	NULL
they	NULL
formed	NULL
their	NULL
judgments	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
respect	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
they	NULL
treated	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
laughing	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
foibles	NULL
and	NULL
lamenting	NULL
his	NULL
vices	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
old	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
will	NULL
never	NULL
do	NULL
any	NULL

"	NULL
they	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
's	NULL
quite	NULL
hopeless	NULL

"	NULL

They	NULL
prided	NULL
themselves	NULL
on	NULL
being	NULL
alone	NULL
in	NULL
appreciating	NULL
his	NULL
genius	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
contempt	NULL
of	NULL
youth	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
follies	NULL
of	NULL
middle-age	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
patronised	NULL
him	NULL
among	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
fail	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
feather	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
caps	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
chosen	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL

only	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
never	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
Gravier	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
four	NULL
years	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
squalid	NULL
conditions	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
whom	NULL
only	NULL
Lawson	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
seen	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
tiny	NULL
apartment	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sixth	NULL
floor	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
dilapidated	NULL
houses	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Quai	NULL
des	NULL
Grands	NULL
Augustins	NULL
:	NULL
Lawson	NULL
described	NULL
with	NULL
gusto	NULL
the	NULL
filth	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
untidiness	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
litter	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
the	NULL
stink	NULL
nearly	NULL
blew	NULL
your	NULL
head	NULL
off	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
at	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
Lawson	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
expostulated	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
deny	NULL
himself	NULL
the	NULL
pleasure	NULL
of	NULL
giving	NULL
picturesque	NULL
details	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
odours	NULL
which	NULL
met	NULL
his	NULL
nostril	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
fierce	NULL
delight	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
realism	NULL
he	NULL
described	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
small	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fat	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
black	NULL
hair	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
always	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
coming	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
slatternly	NULL
blouse	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
corsets	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
her	NULL
red	NULL
cheeks	NULL
,	NULL
large	NULL
sensual	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shining	NULL
,	NULL
lewd	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
reminded	NULL
you	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Bohemienne	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Louvre	NULL
by	NULL
Franz	NULL
Hals	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
flaunting	NULL
vulgarity	NULL
which	NULL
amused	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
horrified	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
scrubby	NULL
,	NULL
unwashed	NULL
baby	NULL
was	NULL
playing	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
known	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
slut	NULL
deceived	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
worthless	NULL
ragamuffins	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Quarter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mystery	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ingenuous	NULL
youths	NULL
who	NULL
absorbed	NULL
his	NULL
wisdom	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
cafe	NULL
table	NULL
that	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
keen	NULL
intellect	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
beauty	NULL
could	NULL
ally	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
creature	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
revel	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
coarseness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
language	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
often	NULL
report	NULL
some	NULL
phrase	NULL
which	NULL
reeked	NULL

Philip	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

His	NULL

All	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
disconcerting	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
youthful	NULL
eagerness	NULL

that	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL

most	NULL

appeared	NULL
in	NULL

after	NULL
a	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
brought	NULL
down	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
aback	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
that	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
reminded	NULL
him	NULL
either	NULL

needed	NULL
the	NULL

He	NULL
expressed	NULL
his	NULL
disappointment	NULL

who	NULL
carelessly	NULL
repeated	NULL
his	NULL

leaped	NULL

There	NULL
you	NULL

see	NULL
Persian	NULL

the	NULL
most	NULL

hue	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL

pattern	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL

of	NULL
which	NULL
delights	NULL
and	NULL
amazes	NULL
the	NULL

In	NULL
them	NULL

the	NULL
sensual	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL

You	NULL

asking	NULL
just	NULL
now	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
meaning	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL

Go	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
those	NULL
Persian	NULL
carpets	NULL

and	NULL
one	NULL

XLVI	NULL
Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
living	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
as	NULL
cheap	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
February	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
started	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
proud	NULL
to	NULL
appeal	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
guardian	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
wish	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
circumstances	NULL
were	NULL
straitened	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
certain	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
him	NULL
something	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
pocket	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
little	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
afford	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
attain	NULL
his	NULL
majority	NULL
and	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
small	NULL
fortune	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tided	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
interval	NULL
by	NULL
selling	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
trinkets	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
inherited	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
about	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
Lawson	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
studio	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
vacant	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
that	NULL
led	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Boulevard	NULL
Raspail	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
cheap	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
attached	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
use	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
bed-room	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
since	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
every	NULL
morning	NULL
Lawson	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
undisturbed	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
studio	NULL
then	NULL
;	NULL
Lawson	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
wandering	NULL
from	NULL
school	NULL
to	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
work	NULL
best	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
proposed	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
model	NULL
in	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
days	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
Philip	NULL
hesitated	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
expense	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
reckoned	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
(	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
studio	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
calculated	NULL
pragmatically	NULL
)	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
cost	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
much	NULL
greater	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
living	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
hotel	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
the	NULL
rent	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
cleaning	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
concierge	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
save	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
petit	NULL
dejeuner	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
themselves	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
year	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
earlier	NULL
Philip	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
share	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
with	NULL
anyone	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
sensitive	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
deformed	NULL
foot	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
morbid	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
growing	NULL
less	NULL
marked	NULL
:	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
matter	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
chance	NULL
forgot	NULL
it	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
constantly	NULL
noticing	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
moved	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
bought	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
beds	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
washing-stand	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
chairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
thrill	NULL
of	NULL
possession	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
excited	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
night	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
call	NULL
a	NULL
home	NULL
they	NULL
lay	NULL
awake	NULL
talking	NULL
till	NULL
three	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
found	NULL
lighting	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
and	NULL
making	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
coffee	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
pyjamas	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
jolly	NULL
business	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
to	NULL
Amitrano	NULL
's	NULL
till	NULL
nearly	NULL
eleven	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
excellent	NULL
spirits	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
nodded	NULL
to	NULL
Fanny	NULL
Price	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
getting	NULL
on	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
cheerily	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
does	NULL
that	NULL
matter	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
in	NULL
reply	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
laughing	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
jump	NULL
down	NULL
my	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
mildly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Quite	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
vaguely	NULL
wondering	NULL
why	NULL
Fanny	NULL
Price	NULL
made	NULL
herself	NULL
so	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
disliked	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Everyone	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

People	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
civil	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL

fear	NULL

her	NULL

for	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
faces	NULL
and	NULL
behind	NULL
their	NULL
backs	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
abominable	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
feeling	NULL
so	NULL
happy	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
even	NULL
Miss	NULL
Price	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
ill-feeling	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
used	NULL
the	NULL
artifice	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
before	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
banishing	NULL
her	NULL
ill-humour	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

I	NULL

Philip	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
surprise	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
quickly	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
voice	NULL

savage	NULL
with	NULL
fury	NULL
.	NULL

Lawson	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
pedagogic	NULL

whenever	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
anything	NULL
out	NULL
he	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL

anything	NULL

had	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL

it	NULL
never	NULL
occurred	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
suspicion	NULL
of	NULL
truth	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL

it	NULL
made	NULL
Philip	NULL

came	NULL

his	NULL
head	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
gasp	NULL
and	NULL
threw	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
anguish	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
two	NULL
tears	NULL
rolled	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
frowsy	NULL
and	NULL
grotesque	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
knowing	NULL
what	NULL
on	NULL
earth	NULL
this	NULL
new	NULL
attitude	NULL
implied	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
uneasy	NULL
and	NULL
conscience-stricken	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

say	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sorry	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
caused	NULL
her	NULL
pain	NULL

because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL

would	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL

snub	NULL
him	NULL

For	NULL
two	NULL

three	NULL
weeks	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
discomfort	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
cut	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
somewhat	NULL
relieved	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
so	NULL
difficult	NULL
a	NULL
friendship	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
disconcerted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
proprietorship	NULL
she	NULL
assumed	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
woman	NULL

She	NULL
came	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
studio	NULL
at	NULL
eight	NULL
o'clock	NULL

and	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL

start	NULL
working	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
model	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL

she	NULL
worked	NULL
steadily	NULL

talking	NULL
to	NULL
no	NULL

struggling	NULL
hour	NULL
after	NULL
hour	NULL
with	NULL
difficulties	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
overcome	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
remained	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
clock	NULL
struck	NULL
twelve	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
hopeless	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
smallest	NULL
approach	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
mediocre	NULL
achievement	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
persons	NULL
were	NULL
able	NULL
after	NULL
some	NULL
months	NULL
to	NULL
arrive	NULL

She	NULL
wore	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
ugly	NULL
brown	NULL
dress	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
mud	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

day	NULL
still	NULL
caked	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
hem	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
raggedness	NULL

which	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
noticed	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL

he	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL

still	NULL
unmended	NULL

But	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
scarlet	NULL
face	NULL
asked	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
afterwards	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Of	NULL

smiled	NULL
Philip	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL

over	NULL

"	NULL

looking	NULL
away	NULL

him	NULL
with	NULL
embarrassment	NULL

"	NULL
Certainly	NULL

walked	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL

three	NULL

silence	NULL

asked	NULL
then	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
Philip	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

gave	NULL
a	NULL

Philip	NULL
reddened	NULL
and	NULL
instinctively	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
limp	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

because	NULL
he	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL

he	NULL
forced	NULL
himself	NULL
not	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
live	NULL
quite	NULL
near	NULL
here	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
apologetically	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
'll	NULL
only	NULL
take	NULL
you	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
walking	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
boulevard	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
side	NULL
street	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
led	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
poorer	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
cheap	NULL
shops	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
stopped	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
climbed	NULL
flight	NULL
after	NULL
flight	NULL
of	NULL
stairs	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
unlocked	NULL
a	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
tiny	NULL
attic	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sloping	NULL
roof	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
closed	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
musty	NULL
smell	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
cold	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
fire	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
sign	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bed	NULL
was	NULL
unmade	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
chest	NULL
of	NULL
drawers	NULL
which	NULL
served	NULL
also	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
wash-stand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
cheap	NULL
easel	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
furniture	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
place	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
squalid	NULL
enough	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
litter	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
untidiness	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
revolting	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
chimney-piece	NULL
,	NULL
scattered	NULL
over	NULL
with	NULL
paints	NULL
and	NULL
brushes	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
cup	NULL

a	NULL
dirty	NULL
plate	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
tea-pot	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
showed	NULL
him	NULL
twenty	NULL
small	NULL
canvases	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
eighteen	NULL
by	NULL
twelve	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
placed	NULL
them	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
watching	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
nodded	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
each	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

n't	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
anxiously	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
just	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
talk	NULL
afterwards	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
collecting	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
panic-stricken	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
ill-drawn	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
colour	NULL
was	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
amateurishly	NULL
by	NULL
someone	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
eye	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
attempt	NULL
at	NULL
getting	NULL
the	NULL
values	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
perspective	NULL
was	NULL
grotesque	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
of	NULL
five	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
naivete	NULL
and	NULL
might	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
down	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
vulgar	NULL
mind	NULL
chock	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
recollections	NULL
of	NULL
vulgar	NULL
pictures	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
talked	NULL
enthusiastically	NULL
about	NULL
Monet	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Impressionists	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
here	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
traditions	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Royal	NULL
Academy	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
lot	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
truthful	NULL
than	NULL
anybody	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
telling	NULL
a	NULL
thundering	NULL
,	NULL
deliberate	NULL
lie	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
blushed	NULL
furiously	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
they	NULL
're	NULL
most	NULL
awfully	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

A	NULL
faint	NULL
colour	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
unhealthy	NULL
cheeks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
smiled	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
need	NULL
n't	NULL

so	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Have	NULL
n't	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
helplessly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
landscape	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
typical	NULL
picturesque	NULL
'	NULL
bit	NULL
'	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
amateur	NULL

old	NULL
bridge	NULL

a	NULL

a	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
quite	NULL
sure	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
flushed	NULL
darkly	NULL
and	NULL
taking	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
picture	NULL
quickly	NULL
turned	NULL
its	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
repeated	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
self-satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL

I	NULL
say	NULL

it	NULL
's	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL

but	NULL
supposed	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
concierge	NULL
would	NULL
bring	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
hurry	NULL

get	NULL
away	NULL

The	NULL
mustiness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
ache	NULL

XLVII	NULL
In	NULL
March	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
excitement	NULL
of	NULL
sending	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Salon	NULL
.	NULL

Clutton	NULL
,	NULL
characteristically	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
ready	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
scornful	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
heads	NULL
that	NULL
Lawson	NULL
sent	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
obviously	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
student	NULL
,	NULL
straight-forward	NULL
portraits	NULL
of	NULL
models	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
force	NULL
;	NULL
Clutton	NULL
,	NULL
aiming	NULL
at	NULL
perfection	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
patience	NULL
with	NULL
efforts	NULL
which	NULL
betrayed	NULL
hesitancy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
shrug	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shoulders	NULL
told	NULL
Lawson	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
impertinence	NULL
to	NULL
exhibit	NULL
stuff	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
allowed	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
studio	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
less	NULL
contemptuous	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
heads	NULL
were	NULL
accepted	NULL
.	NULL

Flanagan	NULL
tried	NULL
his	NULL
luck	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
picture	NULL
was	NULL
refused	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Otter	NULL
sent	NULL
a	NULL
blameless	NULL
Portrait	NULL

Mere	NULL
,	NULL
accomplished	NULL
and	NULL
second-rate	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
hung	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

Hayward	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
,	NULL
arrived	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
party	NULL
which	NULL
Lawson	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
were	NULL
giving	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
studio	NULL
to	NULL
celebrate	NULL
the	NULL
hanging	NULL
of	NULL
Lawson	NULL
's	NULL
pictures	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
eager	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Hayward	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
they	NULL
met	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
experienced	NULL
some	NULL
disappointment	NULL
.	NULL

Hayward	NULL
had	NULL
altered	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
in	NULL
appearance	NULL
:	NULL
his	NULL
fine	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
thinner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
rapid	NULL
wilting	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
fair	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
becoming	NULL
wizened	NULL
and	NULL
colourless	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
paler	NULL
than	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
muzziness	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
features	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
mind	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
changed	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
culture	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
impressed	NULL
Philip	NULL
at	NULL
eighteen	NULL
aroused	NULL
somewhat	NULL
the	NULL
contempt	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
at	NULL
twenty-one	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
altered	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
regarding	NULL
with	NULL
scorn	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
opinions	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL
,	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
letters	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
patience	NULL
with	NULL
anyone	NULL
who	NULL
still	NULL
held	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
scarcely	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
off	NULL
before	NULL
Hayward	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
galleries	NULL
he	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
revolutionary	NULL
opinions	NULL
which	NULL
himself	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
recently	NULL
adopted	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
Manet	NULL
's	NULL
Olympia	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
dramatically	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL

He	NULL
dragged	NULL
Hayward	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Luxembourg	NULL
and	NULL
hurried	NULL
him	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Louvre	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL

Hayward	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Louvre	NULL
Philip	NULL
led	NULL
his	NULL

down	NULL
the	NULL
Long	NULL

an	NULL

Philip	NULL
expatiated	NULL

Like	NULL
most	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
cultivate	NULL
an	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
arts	NULL
,	NULL
Hayward	NULL
was	NULL
extremely	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
dogmatic	NULL
with	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
venture	NULL
to	NULL
assert	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
self-assertive	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
modest	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
impressed	NULL
by	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
assurance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
accepted	NULL
meekly	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL

its	NULL
impertinence	NULL
to	NULL
recommend	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
later	NULL
Philip	NULL
and	NULL
Lawson	NULL
gave	NULL
their	NULL
party	NULL
.	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
an	NULL
exception	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
favour	NULL
,	NULL
agreed	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
their	NULL
food	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Chalice	NULL
offered	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
cook	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
sex	NULL
and	NULL
declined	NULL
the	NULL
suggestion	NULL
that	NULL
other	NULL
girls	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
sake	NULL
.	NULL

Clutton	NULL
,	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
,	NULL
Potter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
others	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
party	NULL
.	NULL

Furniture	NULL
was	NULL
scarce	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
the	NULL
model	NULL
stand	NULL
was	NULL
used	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
guests	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
on	NULL
portmanteaux	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
feast	NULL
consisted	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
pot-au-feu	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Miss	NULL
Chalice	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
leg	NULL
of	NULL
mutton	NULL
roasted	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
and	NULL
brought	NULL
round	NULL
hot	NULL
and	NULL
savoury	NULL
(	NULL
Miss	NULL
Chalice	NULL
had	NULL
cooked	NULL
the	NULL
potatoes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
studio	NULL
was	NULL
redolent	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
carrots	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
fried	NULL
;	NULL
fried	NULL
carrots	NULL
were	NULL
her	NULL
specialty	NULL
)	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
followed	NULL
by	NULL
poires	NULL
flambees	NULL
,	NULL
pears	NULL
with	NULL
burning	NULL
brandy	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
had	NULL
volunteered	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
meal	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
finish	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
enormous	NULL
fromage	NULL
de	NULL
Brie	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
stood	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
and	NULL
added	NULL
fragrant	NULL
odours	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
which	NULL
filled	NULL
the	NULL
studio	NULL
.	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
honour	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
Gladstone	NULL
bag	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
legs	NULL
curled	NULL
under	NULL
him	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
Turkish	NULL
bashaw	NULL
,	NULL
beaming	NULL
good-naturedly	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
surrounded	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
habit	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
studio	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
stove	NULL
lit	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
hot	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
great-coat	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
collar	NULL
turned	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
bowler	NULL
hat	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
with	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
four	NULL
large	NULL
fiaschi	NULL
of	NULL
Chianti	NULL
which	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
row	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bottle	NULL
of	NULL
whiskey	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
reminded	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
slim	NULL
fair	NULL
Circassian	NULL
guarded	NULL
by	NULL
four	NULL
corpulent	NULL
eunuchs	NULL
.	NULL

Hayward	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
ease	NULL
had	NULL
clothed	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
tweed	NULL
suit	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
Trinity	NULL
Hall	NULL
tie	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
grotesquely	NULL
British	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
others	NULL
were	NULL
elaborately	NULL
polite	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
soup	NULL
they	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
political	NULL
situation	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pause	NULL
while	NULL
they	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
leg	NULL
of	NULL
mutton	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Chalice	NULL
lit	NULL
a	NULL
cigarette	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Rapunzel	NULL
,	NULL
Rapunzel	NULL

let	NULL
down	NULL
your	NULL
hair	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
suddenly	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
an	NULL
elegant	NULL
gesture	NULL
she	NULL
untied	NULL
a	NULL
ribbon	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
tresses	NULL
fell	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
shook	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
always	NULL
feel	NULL
more	NULL
comfortable	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
hair	NULL
down	NULL

"	NULL

With	NULL
her	NULL
large	NULL
brown	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
ascetic	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
pale	NULL
skin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
broad	NULL
forehead	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
stepped	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
picture	NULL
by	NULL
Burne-Jones	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
beautiful	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
fingers	NULL
deeply	NULL
stained	NULL
by	NULL
nicotine	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wore	NULL
sweeping	NULL
draperies	NULL
,	NULL
mauve	NULL
and	NULL
green	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
romantic	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
High	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
Kensington	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
wantonly	NULL
aesthetic	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
creature	NULL
,	NULL
kind	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
natured	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
affectations	NULL
were	NULL
but	NULL
skin-deep	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
knock	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
shout	NULL
of	NULL
exultation	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Chalice	NULL
rose	NULL
and	NULL
opened	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
leg	NULL
of	NULL
mutton	NULL
and	NULL
held	NULL
it	NULL
high	NULL
above	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
John	NULL
the	NULL
Baptist	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
platter	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
cigarette	NULL
still	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
advanced	NULL
with	NULL
solemn	NULL
,	NULL
hieratic	NULL
steps	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Hail	NULL
,	NULL
daughter	NULL
of	NULL
Herodias	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
cried	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
mutton	NULL
was	NULL
eaten	NULL
with	NULL
gusto	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
one	NULL
good	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
hearty	NULL
appetite	NULL
the	NULL
pale-faced	NULL
lady	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

Clutton	NULL
and	NULL
Potter	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
everyone	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
neither	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
unduly	NULL
coy	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
grew	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
most	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
six	NULL
weeks	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
exactly	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
treat	NULL
afterwards	NULL
the	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
laid	NULL
their	NULL
young	NULL
hearts	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
bore	NULL
them	NULL
no	NULL
ill-will	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
having	NULL
loved	NULL
them	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
treated	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
friendliness	NULL
but	NULL
without	NULL
familiarity	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Lawson	NULL
with	NULL
melancholy	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
poires	NULL
flambees	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
success	NULL
,	NULL
partly	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
brandy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
partly	NULL
because	NULL
Miss	NULL
Chalice	NULL
insisted	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
eaten	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
cheese	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
perfectly	NULL
delicious	NULL

whether	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
just	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
vomit	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
tried	NULL
the	NULL
mixture	NULL
.	NULL

Coffee	NULL
and	NULL
cognac	NULL
followed	NULL
with	NULL
sufficient	NULL
speed	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
any	NULL
untoward	NULL
consequence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
smoke	NULL
in	NULL
comfort	NULL
.	NULL

Ruth	NULL
Chalice	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
nothing	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
deliberately	NULL
artistic	NULL
,	NULL
arranged	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
graceful	NULL
attitude	NULL
by	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
rested	NULL
her	NULL
exquisite	NULL
head	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
shoulder	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
abyss	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
with	NULL
brooding	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
meditative	NULL
glance	NULL
at	NULL
Lawson	NULL
she	NULL
sighed	NULL
deeply	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
restlessness	NULL
seized	NULL
these	NULL
young	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
blue	NULL
skies	NULL
lured	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
pleasant	NULL
breeze	NULL
sighing	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
leaves	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
plane-trees	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
boulevard	NULL
drew	NULL
them	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

Everyone	NULL
made	NULL
plans	NULL
for	NULL
leaving	NULL
Paris	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
discussed	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
suitable	NULL
size	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
canvases	NULL
they	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
laid	NULL
in	NULL
stores	NULL
of	NULL
panels	NULL
for	NULL
sketching	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
argued	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
merits	NULL
of	NULL
various	NULL
places	NULL
in	NULL
Brittany	NULL
.	NULL

Flanagan	NULL
and	NULL
Potter	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Concarneau	NULL
;	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Otter	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
natural	NULL
instinct	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
obvious	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Pont-Aven	NULL
;	NULL
Philip	NULL
and	NULL
Lawson	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
their	NULL
minds	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
forest	NULL
of	NULL
Fontainebleau	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Chalice	NULL
knew	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
hotel	NULL
at	NULL
Moret	NULL
where	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
lots	NULL
of	NULL
stuff	NULL
to	NULL
paint	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
near	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
neither	NULL
Philip	NULL
nor	NULL
Lawson	NULL
was	NULL
indifferent	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
railway	NULL
fare	NULL
.	NULL

Ruth	NULL
Chalice	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Lawson	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
portrait	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
Salon	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
portraits	NULL
of	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
gardens	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
sunlight	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
blinking	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
green	NULL
reflections	NULL
of	NULL
sunlit	NULL
leaves	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
faces	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
asked	NULL
Clutton	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
preferred	NULL
spending	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
by	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
discovered	NULL
Cezanne	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
eager	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Provence	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
heavy	NULL
skies	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
hot	NULL
blue	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
drip	NULL
like	NULL
beads	NULL
of	NULL
sweat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
broad	NULL
white	NULL
dusty	NULL
roads	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pale	NULL
roofs	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
had	NULL
burnt	NULL
the	NULL
colour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
olive	NULL
trees	NULL
gray	NULL
with	NULL
heat	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
start	NULL

after	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
class	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
putting	NULL
his	NULL
things	NULL

spoke	NULL
to	NULL
Fanny	NULL
Price	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

quickly	NULL

looking	NULL

She	NULL
stopped	NULL
and	NULL
shrugged	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
guttural	NULL

her	NULL
large	NULL
face	NULL
grew	NULL
dark	NULL

Then	NULL
her	NULL

flung	NULL
back	NULL

Ruth	NULL
Chalice	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sinking	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
girls	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
deformity	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
awkward	NULL
and	NULL
clumsy	NULL
with	NULL
women	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL

this	NULL

could	NULL
mean	NULL

Fanny	NULL
Price	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
dirty	NULL
brown	NULL
dress	NULL

with	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
falling	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL

sloppy	NULL

stood	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
tears	NULL
of	NULL
anger	NULL
rolled	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
repellent	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
instinctively	NULL
hoping	NULL
that	NULL
someone	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL

end	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

Philip	NULL
shrugged	NULL
his	NULL

out	NULL

shouted	NULL
after	NULL
him	NULL

Moret	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
days	NULL
an	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
town	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
street	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
forest	NULL
of	NULL
Fontainebleau	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Ecu	NULL
d'Or	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
hotel	NULL
which	NULL
still	NULL
had	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
decrepit	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Ancien	NULL
Regime	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
faced	NULL
the	NULL
winding	NULL
river	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Loing	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Chalice	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
terrace	NULL
overlooking	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
charming	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
bridge	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
fortified	NULL
gateway	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL
here	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evenings	NULL
after	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
drinking	NULL
coffee	NULL
,	NULL
smoking	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
discussing	NULL
art	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
ran	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
way	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
narrow	NULL
canal	NULL
bordered	NULL
by	NULL
poplars	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
banks	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
after	NULL
their	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
they	NULL
often	NULL
wandered	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
spent	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
painting	NULL
.	NULL

Like	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
generation	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
obsessed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
picturesque	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
turned	NULL
their	NULL
backs	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
obvious	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
to	NULL
seek	NULL
subjects	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
devoid	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
prettiness	NULL
they	NULL
despised	NULL
.	NULL

Sisley	NULL
and	NULL
Monet	NULL
had	NULL
painted	NULL
the	NULL
canal	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
poplars	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
their	NULL
hands	NULL
at	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
typical	NULL
of	NULL
France	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
frightened	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
formal	NULL
beauty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
set	NULL
themselves	NULL
deliberately	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Chalice	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
clever	NULL
dexterity	NULL
which	NULL
impressed	NULL
Lawson	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
his	NULL
contempt	NULL
for	NULL
feminine	NULL
art	NULL
,	NULL
started	NULL
a	NULL
picture	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
circumvent	NULL
the	NULL
commonplace	NULL
by	NULL
leaving	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
tops	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Lawson	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
brilliant	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
putting	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
foreground	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
blue	NULL
advertisement	NULL
of	NULL
chocolat	NULL
Menier	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
emphasise	NULL
his	NULL
abhorrence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chocolate	NULL
box	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
began	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
paint	NULL
in	NULL
oils	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
experienced	NULL
a	NULL
thrill	NULL
of	NULL
delight	NULL
when	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
that	NULL
grateful	NULL
medium	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
Lawson	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
little	NULL
box	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
by	NULL
him	NULL
painting	NULL
a	NULL
panel	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
realise	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
copy	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
friend	NULL
's	NULL
influence	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
only	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Lawson	NULL
painted	NULL
very	NULL
low	NULL
in	NULL
tone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
both	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
emerald	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
like	NULL
dark	NULL
velvet	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
brilliance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
turned	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
hands	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
brooding	NULL
ultramarine	NULL
.	NULL

Through	NULL
July	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
one	NULL
fine	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
another	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
hot	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
heat	NULL
,	NULL
searing	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
languor	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
work	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
eager	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
thousand	NULL
thoughts	NULL
.	NULL

Often	NULL
he	NULL
spent	NULL
the	NULL
mornings	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
canal	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shade	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
poplars	NULL
,	NULL
reading	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
lines	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
dreaming	NULL
for	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
hired	NULL
a	NULL
rickety	NULL
bicycle	NULL
and	NULL
rode	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
dusty	NULL
road	NULL
that	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
forest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
clearing	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
head	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
romantic	NULL
fancies	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
ladies	NULL
of	NULL
Watteau	NULL
,	NULL
gay	NULL
and	NULL
insouciant	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
wander	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
cavaliers	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
trees	NULL
,	NULL
whispering	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
careless	NULL
,	NULL
charming	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
somehow	NULL
oppressed	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
nameless	NULL
fear	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
alone	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
fat	NULL
Frenchwoman	NULL
of	NULL
middle	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
Rabelaisian	NULL
figure	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
broad	NULL
,	NULL
obscene	NULL
laugh	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
spent	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
patiently	NULL
fishing	NULL
for	NULL
fish	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
caught	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
sometimes	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
belonged	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
profession	NULL
whose	NULL
most	NULL
notorious	NULL
member	NULL
for	NULL
our	NULL
generation	NULL
was	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Warren	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
competence	NULL
she	NULL
now	NULL
lived	NULL
the	NULL
quiet	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bourgeoise	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
lewd	NULL
stories	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Seville	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
broken	NULL
English	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
most	NULL
beautiful	NULL
women	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
leered	NULL
and	NULL
nodded	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
triple	NULL
chin	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
large	NULL
belly	NULL
,	NULL
shook	NULL
with	NULL
inward	NULL
laughter	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
grew	NULL
so	NULL
hot	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
heat	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
linger	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
material	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
starlit	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
would	NULL
sit	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
terrace	NULL
of	NULL
Ruth	NULL
Chalice	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
hour	NULL
after	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
tired	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
voluptuous	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stillness	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
murmur	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
church	NULL
clock	NULL
struck	NULL
one	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
three	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
drag	NULL
themselves	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
Philip	NULL
became	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
Ruth	NULL
Chalice	NULL
and	NULL
Lawson	NULL
were	NULL
lovers	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
divined	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
painter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
possession	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
Philip	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
effluence	NULL
surrounding	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
were	NULL
heavy	NULL
with	NULL
something	NULL
strange	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
revelation	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
shock	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
Miss	NULL
Chalice	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
fellow	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
closer	NULL
relationship	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
Sunday	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
gone	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
tea-basket	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
forest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
glade	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
suitably	NULL
sylvan	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Chalice	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
idyllic	NULL
,	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
taking	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
shoes	NULL
and	NULL
stockings	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
charming	NULL
only	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
were	NULL
rather	NULL
large	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
on	NULL
both	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
corn	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
toe	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
proceeding	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
ridiculous	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
quite	NULL
differently	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
softly	NULL
feminine	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
large	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
olive	NULL
skin	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
attractive	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
detected	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
contempt	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
Lawson	NULL
a	NULL
suspicion	NULL
of	NULL
superiority	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
envious	NULL
of	NULL
Lawson	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
jealous	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
individual	NULL
concerned	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
shoes	NULL
and	NULL
feeling	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
troubled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fear	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
love	NULL
would	NULL
pass	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
to	NULL
seize	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
swept	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
and	NULL
borne	NULL
powerless	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
mighty	NULL
rush	NULL
he	NULL
cared	NULL
not	NULL
whither	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Chalice	NULL
and	NULL
Lawson	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
somehow	NULL
different	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
constant	NULL
companionship	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
restless	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
dissatisfied	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Life	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
giving	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
uneasy	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
losing	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
stout	NULL
Frenchwoman	NULL
soon	NULL
guessed	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
relations	NULL
were	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
couple	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
frankness	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
tolerant	NULL
smile	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
fattened	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
lust	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
fellows	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
have	NULL
you	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
petite	NULL
amie	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
blushing	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
why	NULL
not	NULL
?	NULL

C'est	NULL
de	NULL
votre	NULL
age	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
shrugged	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
volume	NULL
of	NULL
Verlaine	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wandered	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
passion	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
strong	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stray	NULL
amours	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
introduced	NULL
by	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sly	NULL
visits	NULL
to	NULL
houses	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cul-de-sac	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
in	NULL
Utrecht	NULL
velvet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
mercenary	NULL
graces	NULL
of	NULL
painted	NULL
women	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
shuddered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
threw	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
,	NULL
stretching	NULL
his	NULL
limbs	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
animal	NULL
freshly	NULL
awaked	NULL
from	NULL
sleep	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rippling	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
poplars	NULL
gently	NULL
tremulous	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
faint	NULL
breeze	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
sky	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
almost	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
bear	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
his	NULL
fancy	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
kiss	NULL
of	NULL
warm	NULL
lips	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
around	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL
the	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
soft	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
imagined	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
arms	NULL
of	NULL
Ruth	NULL
Chalice	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
dark	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
wonderful	NULL
texture	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
skin	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
mad	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
let	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
wonderful	NULL
adventure	NULL
slip	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
fingers	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
if	NULL
Lawson	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
why	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
he	NULL
?	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
lay	NULL
awake	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
or	NULL
dreamed	NULL
idly	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
canal	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
suddenly	NULL
quite	NULL
different	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
imagine	NULL
himself	NULL
kissing	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
curious	NULL
.	NULL

Away	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
her	NULL
beautiful	NULL
,	NULL
remembering	NULL
only	NULL
her	NULL
magnificent	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
creamy	NULL
pallor	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
flat-chested	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
teeth	NULL
were	NULL
slightly	NULL
decayed	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
forget	NULL
the	NULL
corns	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
toes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Would	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
love	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
absence	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
prevented	NULL
from	NULL
enjoying	NULL
anything	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
chance	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
deformity	NULL
of	NULL
vision	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
exaggerate	NULL
the	NULL
revolting	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sorry	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
,	NULL
announcing	NULL
the	NULL
definite	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
summer	NULL
,	NULL
drove	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
.	NULL

XLVIII	NULL
When	NULL
Philip	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
Amitrano	NULL
's	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
Fanny	NULL
Price	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
working	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
key	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
locker	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Otter	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Otter	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
shrug	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
answered	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
probably	NULL
gone	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
England	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
relieved	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
profoundly	NULL
bored	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
ill-temper	NULL
.	NULL

Moreover	NULL
she	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
advising	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
follow	NULL
her	NULL
precepts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
the	NULL
duffer	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
he	NULL
forgot	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
working	NULL
in	NULL
oils	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hoped	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
something	NULL
done	NULL
of	NULL
sufficient	NULL
importance	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
year	NULL
's	NULL
Salon	NULL
.	NULL

Lawson	NULL
was	NULL
painting	NULL
a	NULL
portrait	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Chalice	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
paintable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
victims	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
charm	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
portraits	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
natural	NULL
indolence	NULL
,	NULL
joined	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
picturesque	NULL
attitude	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
sitter	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
enough	NULL
technical	NULL
knowledge	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
useful	NULL
criticisms	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
her	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
art	NULL
was	NULL
chiefly	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
artists	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
content	NULL
to	NULL
neglect	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
liked	NULL
the	NULL
warmth	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
studio	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
to	NULL
smoke	NULL
innumerable	NULL
cigarettes	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
,	NULL
pleasant	NULL
voice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
love	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
art	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
clear	NULL
distinction	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

Lawson	NULL
was	NULL
painting	NULL
with	NULL
infinite	NULL
labour	NULL
,	NULL
working	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
stand	NULL
for	NULL
days	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
scraping	NULL
out	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
exhausted	NULL
the	NULL
patience	NULL
of	NULL
anyone	NULL
but	NULL
Ruth	NULL
Chalice	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
hopeless	NULL
muddle	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL

start	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

exactly	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL

it	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
present	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Chalice	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Why	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL
always	NULL
addressed	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
care	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Lawson	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
set	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
portrait	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
with	NULL
trepidation	NULL
but	NULL
also	NULL
with	NULL
pride	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
by	NULL
Lawson	NULL
and	NULL
painted	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
paint	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
profited	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
example	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
advice	NULL
which	NULL
both	NULL
Lawson	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Chalice	NULL
freely	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
Lawson	NULL
finished	NULL
and	NULL
invited	NULL
Clutton	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
criticise	NULL
.	NULL

Clutton	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
just	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
Provence	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
drifted	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Spain	NULL
,	NULL
eager	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Velasquez	NULL
at	NULL
Madrid	NULL

and	NULL
thence	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
Toledo	NULL

He	NULL
stayed	NULL
there	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
returned	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
name	NULL
new	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
wonderful	NULL
things	NULL

a	NULL

called	NULL

who	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL

Clutton	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
taciturn	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
sardonic	NULL
air	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
straining	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
just	NULL
audible	NULL

There	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL

force	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
himself	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL

which	NULL

struggling	NULL
obscurely	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
an	NULL

His	NULL
strength	NULL
impressed	NULL
you	NULL

Lawson	NULL
dreaded	NULL
the	NULL
criticism	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL

had	NULL
discounted	NULL
the	NULL

thought	NULL

Clutton	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

then	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL

turned	NULL

Lawson	NULL
smiled	NULL
with	NULL
delight	NULL

shook	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
clothes	NULL
like	NULL

Lawson	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
fell	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
Clutton	NULL
with	NULL
astonishment	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
notion	NULL
what	NULL

no	NULL

he	NULL
spoke	NULL
as	NULL

What	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
was	NULL
confused	NULL

halting	NULL

verbose	NULL

Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
text	NULL

his	NULL

Clutton	NULL

who	NULL

Philip	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL

went	NULL
up	NULL

the	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
pretence	NULL
that	NULL

"	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL

the	NULL

consented	NULL

they	NULL
went	NULL
off	NULL

The	NULL

spoke	NULL
broken	NULL

fluent	NULL

difficult	NULL

follow	NULL

Philip	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL

enough	NULL

him	NULL

found	NULL
out	NULL

make	NULL
money	NULL

well	NULL
paid	NULL

what	NULL
he	NULL

during	NULL

enough	NULL

keep	NULL
him	NULL

he	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL

amazed	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
live	NULL
easily	NULL
on	NULL
two	NULL
francs	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
shame	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
his	NULL
body	NULL

he	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
sitting	NULL

degradation	NULL

only	NULL

Philip	NULL
explained	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
figure	NULL

only	NULL
for	NULL

answered	NULL

thought	NULL

all	NULL

it	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
legends	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Latin	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
students	NULL

this	NULL

it	NULL

difficult	NULL

know	NULL
more	NULL

superficially	NULL

Indeed	NULL

many	NULL

after	NULL
living	NULL

Paris	NULL
for	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
knew	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL

served	NULL
them	NULL

lived	NULL
as	NULL

South	NULL
Kensington	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL

passion	NULL

welcomed	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
to	NULL

used	NULL
all	NULL

expostulated	NULL

at	NULL

every	NULL

it	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
paid	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL

not	NULL
earning	NULL
his	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
brought	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
manuscript	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
bad	NULL
French	NULL
,	NULL
translating	NULL
excitedly	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
along	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
could	NULL
scarcely	NULL
understand	NULL

he	NULL
read	NULL
passages	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
lamentable	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
puzzled	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
picture	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
painting	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
behind	NULL
that	NULL
broad	NULL
brow	NULL
was	NULL
trivial	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
flashing	NULL
,	NULL
passionate	NULL
eyes	NULL
saw	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
obvious	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
satisfied	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
portrait	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sitting	NULL
he	NULL
nearly	NULL
always	NULL
scraped	NULL
out	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
to	NULL
aim	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
:	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
tell	NULL
what	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
when	NULL
people	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
contradictions	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
liked	NULL
Miguel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
distressed	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
realise	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
magnificent	NULL
struggle	NULL
was	NULL
futile	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
everything	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
writer	NULL
but	NULL
talent	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
you	NULL
tell	NULL
whether	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
anything	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
or	NULL
whether	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
wasting	NULL
your	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
will	NULL
to	NULL
achieve	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
you	NULL

confidence	NULL
in	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL

a	NULL
vehement	NULL
belief	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL

Then	NULL
one	NULL
morning	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
concierge	NULL
called	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL

Nobody	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

his	NULL
Aunt	NULL

sometimes	NULL
Hayward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
handwriting	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

The	NULL
letter	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
follows	NULL
:	NULL

at	NULL

n't	NULL

days	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
sick	NULL
with	NULL
fear	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hurried	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
lived	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
astonished	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
months	NULL
and	NULL
imagined	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
since	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
England	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
arrived	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
the	NULL
concierge	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

Philip	NULL
ran	NULL
upstairs	NULL
and	NULL
knocked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
reply	NULL

He	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
name	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
door	NULL
was	NULL
locked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
bending	NULL
down	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
key	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lock	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
cried	NULL
aloud	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
ran	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
the	NULL
porter	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
feared	NULL
a	NULL
terrible	NULL
accident	NULL

He	NULL
suggested	NULL
breaking	NULL

the	NULL
door	NULL

The	NULL
porter	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sullen	NULL

disinclined	NULL

became	NULL

could	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
responsibility	NULL

the	NULL
room	NULL

must	NULL
go	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
commissaire	NULL

They	NULL
walked	NULL
together	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bureau	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
they	NULL
fetched	NULL
a	NULL
locksmith	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Price	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
paid	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
quarter	NULL
's	NULL
rent	NULL
:	NULL
on	NULL

's	NULL
Day	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
given	NULL
the	NULL
concierge	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
which	NULL
old-established	NULL
custom	NULL
led	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
regard	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
four	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
went	NULL
upstairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
knocked	NULL
again	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
reply	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
locksmith	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
they	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
cry	NULL
and	NULL
instinctively	NULL
covered	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wretched	NULL
woman	NULL
was	NULL
hanging	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
rope	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
neck	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
tied	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
hook	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ceiling	NULL
fixed	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
previous	NULL
tenant	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
curtains	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
moved	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
little	NULL
bed	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
kicked	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL
side	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
cut	NULL
her	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
body	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

XLIX	NULL
The	NULL
story	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
made	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
way	NULL
and	NULL
another	NULL
was	NULL
terrible	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
grievances	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
women-students	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Fanny	NULL
Price	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
share	NULL
their	NULL
gay	NULL
meals	NULL
in	NULL
restaurants	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
reason	NULL
was	NULL
obvious	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
oppressed	NULL
by	NULL
dire	NULL
poverty	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
luncheon	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
eaten	NULL
together	NULL
when	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
ghoulish	NULL
appetite	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
disgusted	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
realised	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
ate	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
manner	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
ravenous	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
concierge	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
her	NULL
food	NULL
had	NULL
consisted	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
bottle	NULL
of	NULL
milk	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
loaf	NULL
of	NULL
bread	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
ate	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
loaf	NULL
and	NULL
drank	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
milk	NULL
at	NULL
mid-day	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
consumed	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
with	NULL
anguish	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
endured	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
given	NULL
anyone	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
poorer	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
money	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
afford	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
studio	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
little	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
bare	NULL
of	NULL
furniture	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
clothes	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
shabby	NULL
brown	NULL
dress	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
worn	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
searched	NULL
among	NULL
her	NULL
things	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
address	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
friend	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
communicate	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
paper	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
written	NULL
a	NULL
score	NULL
of	NULL
times	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
shock	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
supposed	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
emaciated	NULL
body	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
brown	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
hanging	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
nail	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ceiling	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
shuddered	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
why	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
help	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
so	NULL
gladly	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
remorseful	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
any	NULL
particular	NULL
feeling	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
these	NULL
words	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
letter	NULL
were	NULL
infinitely	NULL
pathetic	NULL
:	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
bear	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
anyone	NULL
else	NULL
should	NULL
touch	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
of	NULL
starvation	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
found	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
signed	NULL
:	NULL
your	NULL
loving	NULL
brother	NULL
,	NULL
Albert	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
dated	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
road	NULL
in	NULL
Surbiton	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
refused	NULL
a	NULL
loan	NULL
of	NULL
five	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
writer	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
and	NULL
family	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
feel	NULL
justified	NULL
in	NULL
lending	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
advice	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Fanny	NULL
should	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
and	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
situation	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
telegraphed	NULL
to	NULL
Albert	NULL
Price	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
an	NULL
answer	NULL
came	NULL
:	NULL

Philip	NULL
wired	NULL
a	NULL
succinct	NULL
affirmative	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
a	NULL
stranger	NULL
presented	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
studio	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
commonish	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
black	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
band	NULL
round	NULL
his	NULL
bowler	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
something	NULL

he	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
stubbly	NULL
moustache	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
cockney	NULL
accent	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
cast	NULL
sidelong	NULL
glances	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
studio	NULL
while	NULL
Philip	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
details	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
accident	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

asked	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
freely	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
rubber-merchant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
and	NULL
three	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

Fanny	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
governess	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
stuck	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Me	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
plain	NULL
enough	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
on	NULL
friendly	NULL
terms	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL

he	NULL
resented	NULL
her	NULL
suicide	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL

He	NULL

to	NULL
it	NULL

that	NULL

him	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
brother	NULL

address	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
reading	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
refused	NULL

he	NULL
shrugged	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL

He	NULL
hated	NULL
the	NULL

and	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

Albert	NULL
Price	NULL
also	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
necessary	NULL
business	NULL
quickly	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
back	NULL

They	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tiny	NULL
room	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
poor	NULL
Fanny	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
.	NULL

Albert	NULL

looked	NULL

Philip	NULL

Albert	NULL
Price	NULL
knew	NULL
no	NULL
French	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
everything	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
interminable	NULL
process	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
body	NULL
safely	NULL
hidden	NULL
away	NULL
under	NULL

For	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
occupied	NULL
from	NULL
morning	NULL
till	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
Albert	NULL
Price	NULL
followed	NULL
the	NULL
hearse	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
cemetery	NULL
at	NULL
Montparnasse	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

there	NULL
's	NULL
no	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
short	NULL
ceremony	NULL
was	NULL
infinitely	NULL
dreadful	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cold	NULL
gray	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

Half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
worked	NULL
with	NULL
Fanny	NULL
Price	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
studio	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
funeral	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Otter	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
massiere	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL

Ruth	NULL
Chalice	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
heart	NULL

Lawson	NULL

Clutton	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Flanagan	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
disliked	NULL
her	NULL
during	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
cemetery	NULL
crowded	NULL
on	NULL
all	NULL
sides	NULL
with	NULL
monuments	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
poor	NULL
and	NULL
simple	NULL
,	NULL
others	NULL
vulgar	NULL
,	NULL
pretentious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ugly	NULL
,	NULL
shuddered	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
horribly	NULL
sordid	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
Albert	NULL
Price	NULL
asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
lunch	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
loathed	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
sleeping	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
dreamed	NULL
constantly	NULL
of	NULL
Fanny	NULL
Price	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
torn	NULL
brown	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
hanging	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
nail	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ceiling	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
excuse	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

take	NULL
me	NULL
somewhere	NULL

"	NULL
Lavenue	NULL

"	NULL
answered	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Albert	NULL
Price	NULL
settled	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
velvet	NULL
seat	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
of	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
ordered	NULL
a	NULL
substantial	NULL
luncheon	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
bottle	NULL
of	NULL
wine	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
glad	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
over	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
threw	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
artful	NULL
questions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
eager	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
painter	NULL
's	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
represented	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
deplorable	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
anxious	NULL
for	NULL
details	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
orgies	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
fancy	NULL
suggested	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
sly	NULL
winks	NULL
and	NULL
discreet	NULL
sniggering	NULL
he	NULL
conveyed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
Philip	NULL
confessed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
places	NULL
in	NULL
Montmartre	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
celebrated	NULL
from	NULL
Temple	NULL
Bar	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Royal	NULL
Exchange	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Moulin	NULL
Rouge	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
luncheon	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
wine	NULL
excellent	NULL
.	NULL

Albert	NULL
Price	NULL
expanded	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
processes	NULL
of	NULL
digestion	NULL
went	NULL
satisfactorily	NULL
forwards	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
's	NULL
'	NULL
ave	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
brandy	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
coffee	NULL
was	NULL
brought	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
blow	NULL
the	NULL
expense	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
rubbed	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
know	NULL

I	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL

I	NULL

said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
quite	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
answer	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
so	NULL
seriously	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
tickled	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Besides	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
rotten	NULL
for	NULL
your	NULL
nerves	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
gravely	NULL
.	NULL

Albert	NULL
Price	NULL
concluded	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
four	NULL
o'clock	NULL
train	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
leave	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
good-bye	NULL
,	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
what	NULL

then	NULL
we	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
'	NULL

razzle	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
restless	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
jumped	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
bus	NULL
and	NULL
crossed	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
whether	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
any	NULL
pictures	NULL
on	NULL
view	NULL
at	NULL
Durand-Ruel	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
strolled	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
boulevard	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
wind-swept	NULL
.	NULL

People	NULL
hurried	NULL
by	NULL
wrapped	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
coats	NULL
,	NULL
shrunk	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
faces	NULL
were	NULL
pinched	NULL
and	NULL
careworn	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
icy	NULL
underground	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cemetery	NULL
at	NULL
Montparnasse	NULL
among	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
white	NULL
tombstones	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
lonely	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
and	NULL
strangely	NULL
homesick	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
company	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
hour	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
working	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Clutton	NULL
never	NULL
welcomed	NULL
visitors	NULL
;	NULL
Lawson	NULL
was	NULL
painting	NULL
another	NULL
portrait	NULL
of	NULL
Ruth	NULL
Chalice	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
disturbed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
painting	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
delighted	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
and	NULL
talk	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
studio	NULL
was	NULL
comfortable	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
American	NULL
had	NULL
more	NULL
money	NULL
than	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
warm	NULL
;	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
set	NULL
about	NULL
making	NULL
tea	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
heads	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sending	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Salon	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
awful	NULL
cheek	NULL
my	NULL
sending	NULL
anything	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
care	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL

D'you	NULL
think	NULL

're	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
so	NULL
rotten	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
showed	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
an	NULL
astounding	NULL
cleverness	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
difficulties	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
avoided	NULL
with	NULL
skill	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dash	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
paint	NULL
was	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
surprising	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
attractive	NULL
.	NULL

Flanagan	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
knowledge	NULL
or	NULL
technique	NULL
,	NULL
painted	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
loose	NULL
brush	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
spent	NULL
a	NULL
lifetime	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
practice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
art	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
one	NULL
were	NULL
forbidden	NULL

seconds	NULL
you	NULL
'd	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
master	NULL
,	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
smiled	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
young	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
spoiling	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
with	NULL
excessive	NULL
flattery	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL
got	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
America	NULL

more	NULL
than	NULL
thirty	NULL
seconds	NULL
in	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
picture	NULL

"	NULL
laughed	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

Flanagan	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
scatter-brained	NULL
person	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
tenderness	NULL
of	NULL
heart	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
unexpected	NULL
and	NULL
charming	NULL
.	NULL

Whenever	NULL
anyone	NULL
was	NULL
ill	NULL
he	NULL
installed	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
sick-nurse	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
gaiety	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
medicine	NULL
.	NULL

Like	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
countrymen	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
dread	NULL
of	NULL
sentimentality	NULL
which	NULL
keeps	NULL
so	NULL
tight	NULL
a	NULL
hold	NULL
on	NULL
emotion	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
finding	NULL
nothing	NULL
absurd	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
show	NULL
of	NULL
feeling	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
offer	NULL
an	NULL
exuberant	NULL
sympathy	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
often	NULL
grateful	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
in	NULL
distress	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
depressed	NULL
by	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
through	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
unaffected	NULL
kindliness	NULL
set	NULL
himself	NULL
boisterously	NULL
to	NULL
cheer	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
exaggerated	NULL
the	NULL
Americanisms	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
always	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
Englishmen	NULL
laugh	NULL
and	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
breathless	NULL
stream	NULL
of	NULL
conversation	NULL
,	NULL
whimsical	NULL
,	NULL
high-spirited	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
jolly	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
due	NULL
course	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
and	NULL
afterwards	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Gaite	NULL
Montparnasse	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
's	NULL
favourite	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
amusement	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
most	NULL
extravagant	NULL
humour	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
drunk	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
any	NULL
inebriety	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
suffered	NULL
was	NULL
due	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
vivacity	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
alcohol	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
proposed	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Bal	NULL
Bullier	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
too	NULL
tired	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
willingly	NULL
enough	NULL
consented	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
table	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
platform	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
raised	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
level	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
watch	NULL
the	NULL
dancing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
drank	NULL
a	NULL
bock	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
wild	NULL
shout	NULL
leaped	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
barrier	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
space	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
dancing	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
watched	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

Bullier	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
resort	NULL
of	NULL
fashion	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Thursday	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
was	NULL
crowded	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
students	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
faculties	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
clerks	NULL
or	NULL
assistants	NULL
in	NULL
shops	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
wore	NULL
their	NULL
everyday	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
ready-made	NULL
tweeds	NULL
or	NULL
queer	NULL
tail-coats	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
hats	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
danced	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
place	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
them	NULL
but	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
servant-girls	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
were	NULL
painted	NULL
hussies	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
part	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
shop-girls	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
poorly-dressed	NULL
in	NULL
cheap	NULL
imitation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fashions	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hussies	NULL
were	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
resemble	NULL
the	NULL
music-hall	NULL
artiste	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
dancer	NULL
who	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
notoriety	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
;	NULL
their	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
heavy	NULL
with	NULL
black	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
cheeks	NULL
impudently	NULL
scarlet	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hall	NULL
was	NULL
lit	NULL
by	NULL
great	NULL
white	NULL
lights	NULL
,	NULL
low	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
emphasised	NULL
the	NULL
shadows	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
faces	NULL
;	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
lines	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
harden	NULL
under	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
colours	NULL
were	NULL
most	NULL
crude	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sordid	NULL
scene	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
leaned	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
rail	NULL
,	NULL
staring	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
music	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
danced	NULL
furiously	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
danced	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
talking	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
their	NULL
attention	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dance	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
hot	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
faces	NULL
shone	NULL
with	NULL
sweat	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
thrown	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
guard	NULL
which	NULL
people	NULL
wear	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
expression	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
homage	NULL
to	NULL
convention	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
them	NULL
now	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
really	NULL
were	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
abandon	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
strangely	NULL
animal	NULL
:	NULL
some	NULL
were	NULL
foxy	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
were	NULL
wolf-like	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
others	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
foolish	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
sheep	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
skins	NULL
were	NULL
sallow	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
unhealthy	NULL
life	NULL
they	NULL
led	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
food	NULL
they	NULL
ate	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
features	NULL
were	NULL
blunted	NULL
by	NULL
mean	NULL
interests	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
little	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
shifty	NULL
and	NULL
cunning	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
nobility	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
bearing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
succession	NULL
of	NULL
petty	NULL
concerns	NULL
and	NULL
sordid	NULL
thoughts	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
air	NULL
was	NULL
heavy	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
musty	NULL
smell	NULL
of	NULL
humanity	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
they	NULL
danced	NULL
furiously	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
impelled	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
strange	NULL
power	NULL
within	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
driven	NULL
forward	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
rage	NULL
for	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
seeking	NULL
desperately	NULL
to	NULL
escape	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
world	NULL
of	NULL
horror	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
pleasure	NULL
which	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
said	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
motive	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
action	NULL
urged	NULL
them	NULL
blindly	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
vehemence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
desire	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
rob	NULL
it	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
pleasure	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
hurried	NULL
on	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
wind	NULL
,	NULL
helplessly	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
why	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
whither	NULL
.	NULL

Fate	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
tower	NULL
above	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
danced	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
everlasting	NULL
darkness	NULL
were	NULL
beneath	NULL
their	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
silence	NULL
was	NULL
vaguely	NULL
alarming	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
life	NULL
terrified	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
robbed	NULL
them	NULL
of	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
speech	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
shriek	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
hearts	NULL
died	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
throats	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
haggard	NULL
and	NULL
grim	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
the	NULL
beastly	NULL
lust	NULL
that	NULL
disfigured	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
meanness	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
faces	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
cruelty	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
the	NULL
stupidness	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
worst	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
anguish	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
fixed	NULL
eyes	NULL
made	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
crowd	NULL
terrible	NULL
and	NULL
pathetic	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
loathed	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
ached	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
infinite	NULL
pity	NULL
which	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
coat	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
cloak-room	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bitter	NULL
coldness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

L	NULL
Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
unhappy	NULL
event	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
troubled	NULL
him	NULL
most	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
uselessness	NULL
of	NULL
Fanny	NULL
's	NULL
effort	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
worked	NULL
harder	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
sincerity	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
herself	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
plain	NULL
that	NULL
self-confidence	NULL
meant	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
Miguel	NULL
Ajuria	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
shocked	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
contrast	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
Spaniard	NULL
's	NULL
heroic	NULL
endeavour	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
triviality	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
he	NULL
attempted	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
unhappiness	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
life	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
had	NULL
called	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
self-analysis	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
vice	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
subtle	NULL
as	NULL
drug-taking	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
keenness	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dissection	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
feelings	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
seeing	NULL
that	NULL
art	NULL
affected	NULL
him	NULL
differently	NULL
from	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
fine	NULL
picture	NULL
gave	NULL
Lawson	NULL
an	NULL
immediate	NULL
thrill	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
appreciation	NULL
was	NULL
instinctive	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
felt	NULL
certain	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
own	NULL
appreciation	NULL
was	NULL
intellectual	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
artistic	NULL
temperament	NULL
(	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
the	NULL
phrase	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
could	NULL
discover	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
)	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
feel	NULL
beauty	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
emotional	NULL
,	NULL
unreasoning	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
wonder	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
anything	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
superficial	NULL
cleverness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
which	NULL
enabled	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
copy	NULL
objects	NULL
with	NULL
accuracy	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
to	NULL
despise	NULL
technical	NULL
dexterity	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
important	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
in	NULL
terms	NULL
of	NULL
paint	NULL
.	NULL

Lawson	NULL
painted	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
way	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
nature	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
imitativeness	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
student	NULL
sensitive	NULL
to	NULL
every	NULL
influence	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
pierced	NULL
individuality	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
portrait	NULL
of	NULL
Ruth	NULL
Chalice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
he	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
servile	NULL
copy	NULL
of	NULL
Lawson	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
barren	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
painted	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
brain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
knowing	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
painting	NULL
worth	NULL
anything	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
barely	NULL
sixteen	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
practise	NULL
the	NULL
severest	NULL
economy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
count	NULL
on	NULL
earning	NULL
anything	NULL
for	NULL
ten	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
history	NULL
of	NULL
painting	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
artists	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
earned	NULL
nothing	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
resign	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
penury	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
while	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
produced	NULL
work	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
immortal	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
terrible	NULL
fear	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
second-rate	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
worth	NULL
while	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
youth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
gaiety	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
manifold	NULL
chances	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
existence	NULL
of	NULL
foreign	NULL
painters	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
lives	NULL
they	NULL
led	NULL
were	NULL
narrowly	NULL
provincial	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
some	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
dragged	NULL
along	NULL
for	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pursuit	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fame	NULL
which	NULL
always	NULL
escaped	NULL
them	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
sunk	NULL
into	NULL
sordidness	NULL
and	NULL
alcoholism	NULL
.	NULL

Fanny	NULL
's	NULL
suicide	NULL
had	NULL
aroused	NULL
memories	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
heard	NULL
ghastly	NULL
stories	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
one	NULL
person	NULL
or	NULL
another	NULL
had	NULL
escaped	NULL
from	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
scornful	NULL
advice	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
master	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
poor	NULL
Fanny	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
well	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
an	NULL
attempt	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
hopeless	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
finished	NULL
his	NULL
portrait	NULL
of	NULL
Miguel	NULL
Ajuria	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Salon	NULL
.	NULL

Flanagan	NULL
was	NULL
sending	NULL
two	NULL
pictures	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
paint	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
worked	NULL
so	NULL
hard	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
portrait	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
feeling	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
merit	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
wrong	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
what	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL
his	NULL
spirits	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
dissatisfied	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sent	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Salon	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
refused	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mind	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
to	NULL
persuade	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
chance	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL
rushed	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
Lawson	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
pictures	NULL
was	NULL
accepted	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
blank	NULL
face	NULL
Philip	NULL
offered	NULL
his	NULL
congratulations	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
busy	NULL
congratulating	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
catch	NULL
the	NULL
note	NULL
of	NULL
irony	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
prevent	NULL
from	NULL
coming	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

Lawson	NULL
,	NULL
quicker-witted	NULL
,	NULL
observed	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
curiously	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
own	NULL
picture	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
vaguely	NULL
resentful	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
attitude	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sudden	NULL
question	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
American	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
place	NULL
would	NULL
you	NULL
chuck	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
thing	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
mean	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wonder	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
worth	NULL
while	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
second-rate	NULL
painter	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
a	NULL
doctor	NULL
or	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
in	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
does	NULL

matter	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL

you	NULL
're	NULL
mediocre	NULL

You	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
living	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL

along	NULL

But	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
of	NULL
turning	NULL
out	NULL
second-rate	NULL
pictures	NULL

"	NULL

Lawson	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
seriously	NULL
distressed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
refusal	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
picture	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
set	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
console	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
notorious	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Salon	NULL
had	NULL
refused	NULL
pictures	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
afterwards	NULL
famous	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
expect	NULL
a	NULL
rebuff	NULL
;	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
's	NULL
success	NULL
was	NULL
explicable	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
picture	NULL
was	NULL
showy	NULL

superficial	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
a	NULL
languid	NULL
jury	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
merit	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
grew	NULL
impatient	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
humiliating	NULL
that	NULL
Lawson	NULL
should	NULL
think	NULL
him	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
seriously	NULL
disturbed	NULL
by	NULL
so	NULL
trivial	NULL
a	NULL
calamity	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
realise	NULL

late	NULL
Clutton	NULL
had	NULL
withdrawn	NULL
himself	NULL
somewhat	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
group	NULL
who	NULL
took	NULL
their	NULL
meals	NULL
at	NULL
Gravier	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lived	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
by	NULL
himself	NULL

Flanagan	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Clutton	NULL
's	NULL
austere	NULL
countenance	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
suggest	NULL
passion	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
more	NULL
probable	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
separated	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
grow	NULL
clear	NULL
with	NULL

him	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL

had	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
restaurant	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
play	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
Clutton	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
ordered	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finding	NULL
Clutton	NULL
more	NULL
loquacious	NULL
and	NULL
less	NULL
sardonic	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
good	NULL
humour	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL

"	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
reddening	NULL

The	NULL
request	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL

and	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
ever	NULL
thought	NULL

Clutton	NULL
shrugged	NULL

shoulders	NULL

"	NULL
People	NULL

you	NULL

The	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL

the	NULL

So	NULL
the	NULL
Barbizon	NULL
people	NULL
taught	NULL
our	NULL

to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
trees	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL

when	NULL
Monet	NULL

people	NULL
said	NULL

But	NULL
trees	NULL

It	NULL
never	NULL
struck	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
trees	NULL
are	NULL
exactly	NULL
how	NULL
a	NULL

chooses	NULL

We	NULL
paint	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pause	NULL
while	NULL
Clutton	NULL
with	NULL
voracious	NULL
appetite	NULL
devoured	NULL
the	NULL
food	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
set	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
smoking	NULL
a	NULL
cheap	NULL

observed	NULL
him	NULL
closely	NULL

yet	NULL
Philip	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL

the	NULL
mask	NULL
concealed	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
weakness	NULL
.	NULL

Clutton	NULL
's	NULL
refusal	NULL

himself	NULL

During	NULL

Philip	NULL

Philip	NULL

too	NULL

saw	NULL
Clutton	NULL
in	NULL
twenty	NULL

bitter	NULL

lonely	NULL

still	NULL

perhaps	NULL
sinking	NULL
at	NULL

into	NULL
drunkenness	NULL

Of	NULL
late	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
captivated	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
since	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
life	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
important	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
success	NULL

it	NULL

he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
count	NULL
success	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
acquiring	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL

the	NULL
achieving	NULL
of	NULL
fame	NULL

he	NULL
did	NULL

quite	NULL
know	NULL

what	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL

perhaps	NULL
variety	NULL

the	NULL
making	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
plain	NULL
anyway	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
which	NULL
Clutton	NULL
seemed	NULL
destined	NULL
to	NULL
was	NULL
failure	NULL

Its	NULL
only	NULL
justification	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
painting	NULL
of	NULL
imperishable	NULL

recollected	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
faun-like	NULL
humour	NULL

refused	NULL

repeated	NULL
that	NULL

none	NULL

Philip	NULL
pondered	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
everything	NULL
,	NULL
comfort	NULL
,	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
honour	NULL
,	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
canvas	NULL
with	NULL
paint	NULL
the	NULL
emotion	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
magnificent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
his	NULL
courage	NULL
failed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Thinking	NULL
of	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
recalled	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Clutton	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wandered	NULL
along	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
cafe	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
certain	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
writer	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
few	NULL
months	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
stay	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
accepted	NULL
as	NULL
gospel	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
practical	NULL
outlook	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
impatient	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
theories	NULL
which	NULL
resulted	NULL
in	NULL
no	NULL
action	NULL
.	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
's	NULL
slim	NULL
bundle	NULL
of	NULL
poetry	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
a	NULL
substantial	NULL
result	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
life	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
sordid	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
wrench	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
nature	NULL
the	NULL
instincts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
middle-class	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
penury	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
hack	NULL
work	NULL
which	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
did	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
body	NULL
and	NULL
soul	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
monotony	NULL
of	NULL
existence	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
slovenly	NULL
attic	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
cafe	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
jarred	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
respectability	NULL
.	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
was	NULL
astute	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
disapproved	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
attacked	NULL
his	NULL
philistinism	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
irony	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
sometimes	NULL
playful	NULL
but	NULL
often	NULL
very	NULL
keen	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
a	NULL
tradesman	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
you	NULL
want	NULL

invest	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
metaphor	NULL
irritated	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
assumed	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
speaker	NULL
a	NULL
romantic	NULL
attitude	NULL
and	NULL
cast	NULL
a	NULL
slur	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
instinctively	NULL
felt	NULL
had	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
evening	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
undecided	NULL
,	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Fortunately	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
late	NULL
already	NULL
and	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
's	NULL
pile	NULL
of	NULL
saucers	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
indicating	NULL
a	NULL
drink	NULL
,	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
prepared	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
an	NULL
independent	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wonder	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
'd	NULL
give	NULL
me	NULL
some	NULL
advice	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
suddenly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
will	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
shrugged	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
impatiently	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
believe	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
ever	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
should	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
hesitated	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
I	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL

"	NULL

A	NULL
change	NULL
came	NULL
over	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
's	NULL
placid	NULL
,	NULL
round	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
corners	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mouth	NULL
were	NULL
suddenly	NULL
depressed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
sunk	NULL
dully	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
orbits	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
strangely	NULL
bowed	NULL
and	NULL
old	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
This	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
cried	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
cafe	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
sat	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
voice	NULL
really	NULL
trembled	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL

there	NULL

time	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
astonishment	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
emotion	NULL
always	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
shy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
dropped	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
tragedy	NULL
of	NULL
failure	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
life	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
considered	NULL
his	NULL
youth	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
bright	NULL
hopes	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
disappointments	NULL
which	NULL
wore	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
radiancy	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
wretched	NULL
monotony	NULL
of	NULL
pleasure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
future	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
rested	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
pile	NULL
of	NULL
saucers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
's	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
them	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

LI	NULL
Two	NULL
months	NULL
passed	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
brooding	NULL
over	NULL
these	NULL
matters	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
true	NULL
painters	NULL
,	NULL
writers	NULL
,	NULL
musicians	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
power	NULL
which	NULL
drove	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
complete	NULL
absorption	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
work	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
inevitable	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
subordinate	NULL
life	NULL
to	NULL
art	NULL
.	NULL

Succumbing	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
influence	NULL
they	NULL
never	NULL
realised	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
merely	NULL
dupes	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
instinct	NULL
that	NULL
possessed	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
life	NULL
slipped	NULL
through	NULL
their	NULL
fingers	NULL
unlived	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
lived	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
portrayed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
search	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
experiences	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
wring	NULL
from	NULL
each	NULL
moment	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
emotion	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
offered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
step	NULL
and	NULL
abide	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
step	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

Luckily	NULL
enough	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Foinet	NULL
's	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
him	NULL
point-blank	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
his	NULL
while	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
study	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
forgotten	NULL
the	NULL
master	NULL
's	NULL
brutal	NULL
advice	NULL
to	NULL
Fanny	NULL
Price	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sound	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
get	NULL
Fanny	NULL
entirely	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
studio	NULL
seemed	NULL
strange	NULL
without	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
gesture	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
working	NULL
there	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
tone	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
voice	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
start	NULL
,	NULL
reminding	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
:	NULL
her	NULL
presence	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
noticable	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
during	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
often	NULL
dreamed	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
waking	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
cry	NULL
of	NULL
terror	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
horrible	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
suffering	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
endured	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
Foinet	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
studio	NULL
he	NULL
lunched	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
restaurant	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Rue	NULL
d'Odessa	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
hurried	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
meal	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
wait	NULL
outside	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
painter	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
walked	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
crowded	NULL
street	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
saw	NULL
Monsieur	NULL
Foinet	NULL
walking	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
bent	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
nervous	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
forced	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Pardon	NULL

,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL

moment	NULL

Foinet	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
rapid	NULL
glance	NULL
,	NULL
recognised	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
smile	NULL
a	NULL
greeting	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Speak	NULL

said	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
was	NULL
trembling	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

Foinet	NULL
walked	NULL
on	NULL
without	NULL
looking	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
watching	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
trace	NULL
of	NULL
expression	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL

I	NULL

"	NULL

Foinet	NULL
's	NULL
bitter	NULL
mouth	NULL
outlined	NULL
the	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Do	NULL
you	NULL
live	NULL
near	NULL
here	NULL

Philip	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
where	NULL
his	NULL
studio	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

Foinet	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
us	NULL
go	NULL
there	NULL

You	NULL
shall	NULL
show	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

cried	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
not	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
silently	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
master	NULL
's	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
horribly	NULL
sick	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
Foinet	NULL
would	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
things	NULL
there	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
prepare	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
mind	NULL
coming	NULL
at	NULL
some	NULL
future	NULL
date	NULL
or	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
bring	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
Foinet	NULL
's	NULL
studio	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
trembling	NULL
with	NULL
anxiety	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
he	NULL
hoped	NULL
that	NULL
Foinet	NULL
would	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
picture	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
rare	NULL
smile	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
shake	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Pas	NULL
mal	NULL

Go	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
lad	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
have	NULL
talent	NULL
,	NULL
real	NULL
talent	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
swelled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
relief	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
joy	NULL
!	NULL

Now	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
courage	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
did	NULL
hardship	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
privation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
disappointment	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
worked	NULL
very	NULL
hard	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
too	NULL
cruel	NULL
if	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
industry	NULL
were	NULL
futile	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
start	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
Fanny	NULL
Price	NULL
say	NULL
just	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
seized	NULL
with	NULL
fear	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
dared	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
asked	NULL
Foinet	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
concierge	NULL
handed	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
passed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
envelope	NULL
and	NULL
recognised	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
handwriting	NULL
.	NULL

Foinet	NULL
followed	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
;	NULL
Foinet	NULL
was	NULL
mute	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
nerves	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
professor	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
placed	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
picture	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
Salon	NULL
had	NULL
rejected	NULL
;	NULL
Foinet	NULL
nodded	NULL
but	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
Philip	NULL
showed	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
portraits	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL

said	NULL
presently	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
nervous	NULL

Monsieur	NULL
Foinet	NULL
rolled	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL

it	NULL

You	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Very	NULL

"	NULL
answered	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
cold	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
on	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
is	NULL
nothing	NULL
so	NULL
degrading	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
constant	NULL
anxiety	NULL
about	NULL
one	NULL

of	NULL
livelihood	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
contempt	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
despise	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
are	NULL
hypocrites	NULL
or	NULL
fools	NULL
.	NULL

Money	NULL
is	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
sixth	NULL
sense	NULL
without	NULL
which	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
complete	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

five	NULL

Without	NULL
an	NULL
adequate	NULL
income	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
possibilities	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
are	NULL
shut	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
careful	NULL
about	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
pay	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
shilling	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
shilling	NULL
you	NULL
earn	NULL

You	NULL
will	NULL
hear	NULL
people	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
poverty	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
spur	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
artist	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
iron	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
flesh	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
mean	NULL
it	NULL
makes	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
exposes	NULL
you	NULL

endless	NULL
humiliation	NULL

it	NULL
cuts	NULL
your	NULL
wings	NULL

it	NULL
eats	NULL
into	NULL

It	NULL

not	NULL

one	NULL
asks	NULL

just	NULL
enough	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
quietly	NULL
put	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
shown	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

Monsieur	NULL
Foinet	NULL
slightly	NULL
shrugged	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

a	NULL

With	NULL

there	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
you	NULL

Philip	NULL
obliged	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL

quite	NULL
steadily	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL

Monsieur	NULL
Foinet	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL

go	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
changed	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
stopping	NULL

put	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
shoulder	NULL

if	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
surprise	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
master	NULL
forced	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
remained	NULL
grave	NULL
and	NULL
sad	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
cruel	NULL
to	NULL
discover	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
mediocrity	NULL
only	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
improve	NULL
the	NULL
temper	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
laugh	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
words	NULL
and	NULL
quickly	NULL
walked	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
mechanically	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
handwriting	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
anxious	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
who	NULL
always	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
ill	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
offered	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
England	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
fearing	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
interfere	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
refused	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
inconvenience	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
wait	NULL
till	NULL
August	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
hoped	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
stay	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
chance	NULL
she	NULL
grew	NULL
worse	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
without	NULL
seeing	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
ill	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
a	NULL
pen	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
ran	NULL
as	NULL
follows	NULL
:	NULL
My	NULL
dear	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
regret	NULL
to	NULL
inform	NULL
you	NULL
that	NULL
your	NULL
dear	NULL
Aunt	NULL
departed	NULL
this	NULL
life	NULL
early	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
died	NULL
very	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
quite	NULL
peacefully	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
change	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
worse	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
rapid	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
fully	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
and	NULL
entered	NULL
into	NULL
rest	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
complete	NULL
assurance	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
blessed	NULL
resurrection	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
resignation	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
divine	NULL
will	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
blessed	NULL
Lord	NULL
Jesus	NULL
Christ	NULL

Your	NULL
Aunt	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL

the	NULL
funeral	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
trust	NULL
you	NULL

come	NULL

you	NULL
can	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
is	NULL
naturally	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
work	NULL
thrown	NULL
upon	NULL
my	NULL
shoulders	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
upset	NULL

I	NULL
trust	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL

everything	NULL

LII	NULL
Next	NULL
day	NULL
Philip	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
lost	NULL
anyone	NULL
closely	NULL
connected	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
shocked	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
also	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
fear	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
mortality	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
realise	NULL
what	NULL
life	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
constant	NULL
companionship	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
loved	NULL
and	NULL
tended	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
forty	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
him	NULL
broken	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
hopeless	NULL
grief	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
dreaded	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
meeting	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
say	NULL
nothing	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
of	NULL
use	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
rehearsed	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
apposite	NULL
speeches	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
side-door	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
.	NULL

Uncle	NULL
William	NULL
was	NULL
reading	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Your	NULL
train	NULL
was	NULL
late	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
prepared	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
emotion	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
matter-of-fact	NULL
reception	NULL
startled	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
uncle	NULL
,	NULL
subdued	NULL
but	NULL
calm	NULL
,	NULL
handed	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL
little	NULL
paragraph	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
The	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
Times	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
mechanically	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Would	NULL
you	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
nodded	NULL
and	NULL
together	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
upstairs	NULL
.	NULL

Aunt	NULL
Louisa	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
flowers	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Would	NULL
you	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
prayer	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sank	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
expected	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
Philip	NULL
followed	NULL
his	NULL
example	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
shrivelled	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
emotion	NULL
:	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
wasted	NULL
life	NULL
!	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
cough	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
pointed	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
wreath	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
's	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Squire	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
voice	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
quite	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
expect	NULL
tea	NULL
is	NULL
ready	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
drawn	NULL
blinds	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
lugubrious	NULL
aspect	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Vicar	NULL
sat	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
sat	NULL
and	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
tea	NULL
with	NULL
ceremony	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
neither	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
appetite	NULL
was	NULL
unimpaired	NULL
he	NULL
fell	NULL
to	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
heartiness	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
set	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
cake	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
grief	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
was	NULL
decent	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Things	NULL
have	NULL
changed	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
presently	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL

with	NULL
disapproval	NULL

he	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL

Josiah	NULL

came	NULL
back	NULL

the	NULL

The	NULL

up	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
will	NULL

felt	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
sensation	NULL

relief	NULL

The	NULL
body	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

made	NULL
him	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL

in	NULL
life	NULL
the	NULL

all	NULL
that	NULL

The	NULL

Philip	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
like	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
Vicar	NULL
answered	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
acidity	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Graves	NULL
replied	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
tone	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
widower	NULL
thought	NULL
too	NULL
authoritative	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL

Things	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
rather	NULL
far	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
choose	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
text	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
wife	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pause	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
drifted	NULL
to	NULL
parish	NULL
matters	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
to	NULL
smoke	NULL
his	NULL
pipe	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
bench	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
suddenly	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
laugh	NULL
hysterically	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
expressed	NULL
the	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
spend	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
at	NULL
Blackstable	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL

go	NULL
back	NULL

September	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
reply	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
Foinet	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
so	NULL
undecided	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
something	NULL
fine	NULL
in	NULL
giving	NULL
up	NULL
art	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
excel	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
unfortunately	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
seem	NULL
so	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
:	NULL
to	NULL
others	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
an	NULL
admission	NULL
of	NULL
defeat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
confess	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
beaten	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
obstinate	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
suspicion	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
talent	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
lie	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
direction	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
force	NULL
circumstances	NULL
and	NULL
aim	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
precisely	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
direction	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
should	NULL
laugh	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
prevented	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
ever	NULL
taking	NULL
the	NULL
definite	NULL
step	NULL
of	NULL
abandoning	NULL
the	NULL
study	NULL
of	NULL
painting	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
different	NULL
environment	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
see	NULL
things	NULL
differently	NULL
.	NULL

Like	NULL
many	NULL
another	NULL
he	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
crossing	NULL
the	NULL
Channel	NULL
makes	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
important	NULL
singularly	NULL
futile	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
life	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
charming	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
it	NULL
now	NULL
seemed	NULL
inept	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
seized	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
distaste	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
cafes	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
restaurants	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
ill-cooked	NULL
food	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
shabby	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
lived	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
what	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
thought	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
rhetoric	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Otter	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
respectability	NULL
,	NULL
Ruth	NULL
Chalice	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
affectations	NULL
,	NULL
Lawson	NULL
and	NULL
Clutton	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
quarrels	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
revulsion	NULL
from	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
Lawson	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
over	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
belongings	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
week	NULL
later	NULL
they	NULL
arrived	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
unpacked	NULL
his	NULL
canvases	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
examine	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
without	NULL
emotion	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
noticed	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
with	NULL
interest	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
uncle	NULL
was	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
pictures	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
greatly	NULL
disapproved	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
accepted	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
now	NULL
with	NULL
equanimity	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
students	NULL
and	NULL
constantly	NULL
put	NULL
Philip	NULL
questions	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
painter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
present	NULL
made	NULL
attempts	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
eagerly	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
studies	NULL
of	NULL
models	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
showed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
set	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
portrait	NULL
of	NULL
Miguel	NULL
Ajuria	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL
paint	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
wanted	NULL
a	NULL
model	NULL

"	NULL
As	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
would	NULL
bore	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL

should	NULL
like	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
must	NULL
see	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
amused	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
vanity	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dying	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
his	NULL
portrait	NULL
painted	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
get	NULL
something	NULL
for	NULL
nothing	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
missed	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
he	NULL
threw	NULL
out	NULL
little	NULL
hints	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
reproached	NULL
Philip	NULL
for	NULL
laziness	NULL
,	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
start	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finally	NULL
began	NULL
telling	NULL
everyone	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
paint	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
rainy	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
breakfast	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
said	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
annoyed	NULL

Philip	NULL
hated	NULL
that	NULL

it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
perfectly	NULL

it	NULL

Taking	NULL
the	NULL

him	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
retired	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
study	NULL

Philip	NULL
changed	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sitting	NULL
(	NULL
it	NULL

comfortable	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL

looked	NULL
out	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL
pouring	NULL

was	NULL
something	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL

Two	NULL
years	NULL

France	NULL
had	NULL
opened	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
lucky	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
turn	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
tended	NULL

flippancy	NULL

what	NULL
a	NULL

loss	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sustained	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL

father	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
differences	NULL

prevented	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
seeing	NULL
things	NULL

the	NULL

other	NULL
people	NULL

The	NULL
love	NULL

parents	NULL

children	NULL

the	NULL
only	NULL
emotion	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
quite	NULL
disinterested	NULL

had	NULL
grown	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
best	NULL

could	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
seldom	NULL
been	NULL
used	NULL
with	NULL
patience	NULL

forbearance	NULL

prided	NULL
himself	NULL

him	NULL
by	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
called	NULL
him	NULL
cynical	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
acquired	NULL
calmness	NULL

under	NULL
most	NULL
circumstances	NULL
an	NULL
unruffled	NULL
exterior	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL
now	NULL

his	NULL
emotions	NULL

an	NULL
accidental	NULL
kindness	NULL
touched	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
venture	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
betray	NULL
the	NULL
unsteadiness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
bitterness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
humiliation	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
endured	NULL

banter	NULL
which	NULL

made	NULL
him	NULL
morbidly	NULL

he	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

what	NULL

When	NULL
Philip	NULL
ceased	NULL

he	NULL
knew	NULL
now	NULL

he	NULL
put	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
religion	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL

brought	NULL
up	NULL

kept	NULL
unimpaired	NULL

morality	NULL

was	NULL
part	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
therefore	NULL

think	NULL
things	NULL
out	NULL

He	NULL
determined	NULL

be	NULL
swayed	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL

He	NULL
swept	NULL
away	NULL

idea	NULL

finding	NULL
out	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL

necessary	NULL

all	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL

wanted	NULL
to	NULL
discover	NULL

Clearly	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL

only	NULL

him	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
gained	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
complete	NULL
liberty	NULL
of	NULL
spirit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
absolutely	NULL
free	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
desultory	NULL
way	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
philosophy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
with	NULL
delight	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
leisure	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
few	NULL
months	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
at	NULL
haphazard	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
entered	NULL
upon	NULL
each	NULL
system	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
thrill	NULL
of	NULL
excitement	NULL
,	NULL
expecting	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
in	NULL
each	NULL
some	NULL
guide	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
rule	NULL
his	NULL
conduct	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
traveller	NULL
in	NULL
unknown	NULL
countries	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
pushed	NULL
forward	NULL
the	NULL
enterprise	NULL
fascinated	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
emotionally	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
other	NULL
men	NULL
read	NULL
pure	NULL
literature	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
leaped	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
discovered	NULL
in	NULL
noble	NULL
words	NULL
what	NULL
himself	NULL
had	NULL
obscurely	NULL
felt	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
concrete	NULL
and	NULL
moved	NULL
with	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
regions	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
abstract	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
follow	NULL
the	NULL
reasoning	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
pleasure	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
the	NULL
tortuosities	NULL
of	NULL
thoughts	NULL
that	NULL
threaded	NULL
their	NULL
nimble	NULL
way	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
incomprehensible	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
great	NULL
philosophers	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
others	NULL
he	NULL
recognised	NULL
a	NULL
mind	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
explorer	NULL
in	NULL
Central	NULL
Africa	NULL
who	NULL
comes	NULL
suddenly	NULL
upon	NULL
wide	NULL
uplands	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
trees	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
stretches	NULL
of	NULL
meadow	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
fancy	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
English	NULL
park	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
delighted	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
robust	NULL
common	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
Thomas	NULL
Hobbes	NULL
;	NULL
Spinoza	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
awe	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
before	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
contact	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
mind	NULL
so	NULL
noble	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
unapproachable	NULL
and	NULL
austere	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
reminded	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
statue	NULL
by	NULL
Rodin	NULL
,	NULL
L'Age	NULL
d'Airain	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
passionately	NULL
admired	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
Hume	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
scepticism	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
charming	NULL
philosopher	NULL
touched	NULL
a	NULL
kindred	NULL
note	NULL
in	NULL
Philip	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
revelling	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lucid	NULL
style	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
complicated	NULL
thought	NULL
into	NULL
simple	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
musical	NULL
and	NULL
measured	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
read	NULL
a	NULL
novel	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
of	NULL
pleasure	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
none	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
find	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
somewhere	NULL
that	NULL
every	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
born	NULL
a	NULL
Platonist	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
Aristotelian	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
Stoic	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
an	NULL
Epicurean	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
history	NULL
of	NULL
George	NULL
Henry	NULL
Lewes	NULL
(	NULL
besides	NULL
telling	NULL
you	NULL
that	NULL
philosophy	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
moonshine	NULL
)	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
philosopher	NULL
was	NULL
inseparably	NULL
connected	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
you	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
guess	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
extent	NULL
the	NULL
philosophy	NULL
he	NULL
wrote	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
you	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
act	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
way	NULL
because	NULL
you	NULL
thought	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
rather	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
thought	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
way	NULL
because	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
made	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

Truth	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
such	NULL
thing	NULL
as	NULL
truth	NULL
.	NULL

Each	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
philosopher	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
elaborate	NULL
systems	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
had	NULL
composed	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
valid	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
writers	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
thing	NULL
then	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
discover	NULL
what	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
system	NULL
of	NULL
philosophy	NULL
would	NULL
devise	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
three	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
:	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
relation	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
he	NULL
lives	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
relation	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
among	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
lives	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finally	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
relation	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
elaborate	NULL
plan	NULL
of	NULL
study	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
living	NULL
abroad	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
coming	NULL
in	NULL
contact	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
manners	NULL
and	NULL
customs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
among	NULL
whom	NULL
you	NULL
live	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
observe	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
outside	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
necessity	NULL
which	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
practise	NULL
them	NULL
believe	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
fail	NULL
to	NULL
discover	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
beliefs	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
self-evident	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
foreigner	NULL
are	NULL
absurd	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
year	NULL
in	NULL
Germany	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
stay	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
prepared	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
the	NULL
sceptical	NULL
teaching	NULL
which	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
was	NULL
good	NULL
and	NULL
nothing	NULL
was	NULL
evil	NULL
;	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
merely	NULL
adapted	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
read	NULL
The	NULL
Origin	NULL
of	NULL
Species	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
an	NULL
explanation	NULL
of	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
troubled	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
explorer	NULL
now	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
reasoned	NULL
that	NULL
certain	NULL
natural	NULL
features	NULL
must	NULL
present	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
beating	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
broad	NULL
river	NULL
,	NULL
finds	NULL
here	NULL
the	NULL
tributary	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
the	NULL
fertile	NULL
,	NULL
populated	NULL
plains	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
further	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
mountains	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
some	NULL
great	NULL
discovery	NULL
is	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
is	NULL
surprised	NULL
afterwards	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
accepted	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
on	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
acknowledge	NULL
its	NULL
truth	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
is	NULL
unimportant	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
readers	NULL
of	NULL
The	NULL
Origin	NULL
of	NULL
Species	NULL
accepted	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
reason	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
their	NULL
emotions	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
of	NULL
conduct	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
untouched	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
born	NULL
a	NULL
generation	NULL
after	NULL
this	NULL
great	NULL
book	NULL
was	NULL
published	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
horrified	NULL
its	NULL
contemporaries	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
joyful	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
intensely	NULL
moved	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
grandeur	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
struggle	NULL
for	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
ethical	NULL
rule	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
suggested	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
fit	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
predispositions	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

Society	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
organism	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
laws	NULL
of	NULL
growth	NULL
and	NULL
self-preservation	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
individual	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
actions	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
it	NULL
termed	NULL
virtuous	NULL
and	NULL
those	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
it	NULL
called	NULL
vicious	NULL
.	NULL

Good	NULL
and	NULL
evil	NULL
meant	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

Sin	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
prejudice	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
free	NULL
man	NULL
should	NULL
rid	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Society	NULL
had	NULL
three	NULL
arms	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
contest	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
individual	NULL
,	NULL
laws	NULL
,	NULL
public	NULL
opinion	NULL

and	NULL
conscience	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
two	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
met	NULL
by	NULL
guile	NULL

guile	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
weapon	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
weak	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
strong	NULL
:	NULL
common	NULL

put	NULL
the	NULL

well	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
stated	NULL
that	NULL
sin	NULL
consisted	NULL
in	NULL
being	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
conscience	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
traitor	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
gates	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
fought	NULL
in	NULL
each	NULL
heart	NULL
the	NULL
battle	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
caused	NULL
the	NULL
individual	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
wanton	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
prosperity	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
enemy	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
were	NULL
irreconcilable	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
state	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
individual	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL

with	NULL
good-humoured	NULL

The	NULL

no	NULL

He	NULL
does	NULL
everything	NULL
he	NULL
likes	NULL

if	NULL
he	NULL

His	NULL
power	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL

morality	NULL

He	NULL
recognises	NULL
the	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
can	NULL
break	NULL
them	NULL
without	NULL
sense	NULL

but	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
punished	NULL
he	NULL
accepts	NULL
the	NULL
punishment	NULL
without	NULL

Society	NULL
has	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
if	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
individual	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
right	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
wrong	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
conscience	NULL
lost	NULL
its	NULL
power	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
cry	NULL
of	NULL
triumph	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
seized	NULL
the	NULL
knave	NULL
and	NULL
flung	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
breast	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
nearer	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
meaning	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
men	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
existence	NULL
for	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
inexplicable	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

Surely	NULL
there	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
some	NULL
reason	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
's	NULL
parable	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Persian	NULL
carpet	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
offered	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
solution	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
riddle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
mysteriously	NULL
he	NULL
stated	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
answer	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
unless	NULL
you	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
yourself	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wonder	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
devil	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL

"	NULL
Philip	NULL
smiled	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
September	NULL
,	NULL
eager	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL

Philip	NULL

before	NULL

He	NULL
chose	NULL

got	NULL
a	NULL

from	NULL
him	NULL

took	NULL
lodgings	NULL
in	NULL

had	NULL

Philip	NULL

the	NULL
like	NULL

and	NULL
these	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
idly	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
seem	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
ease	NULL
.	NULL

Young	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
boys	NULL
dribbled	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
for	NULL
letters	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rack	NULL
,	NULL
chatted	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
downstairs	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
basement	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
student	NULL
's	NULL
reading-room	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
several	NULL
fellows	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
desultory	NULL
,	NULL
timid	NULL
look	NULL
dawdling	NULL
around	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
surmised	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
there	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
exhausted	NULL
the	NULL
notices	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL
door	NULL
which	NULL
led	NULL
into	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
apparently	NULL
a	NULL
museum	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
still	NULL
twenty	NULL
minutes	NULL
to	NULL
spare	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
collection	NULL
of	NULL
pathological	NULL
specimens	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
of	NULL
about	NULL
eighteen	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
first	NULL
year	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
answered	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Where	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
lecture	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
d'you	NULL
know	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
getting	NULL
on	NULL
for	NULL

.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
'd	NULL
better	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
walked	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
museum	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
dark	NULL
corridor	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL
painted	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL
shades	NULL
of	NULL
red	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
youths	NULL
walking	NULL
along	NULL
suggested	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
door	NULL
marked	NULL
Anatomy	NULL
Theatre	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
many	NULL
people	NULL
already	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
seats	NULL
were	NULL
arranged	NULL
in	NULL
tiers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
Philip	NULL
entered	NULL
an	NULL
attendant	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
well	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lecture-room	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
pelvis	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
thigh-bones	NULL
,	NULL
right	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
.	NULL

More	NULL
men	NULL
entered	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
their	NULL
seats	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
eleven	NULL
the	NULL
theatre	NULL
was	NULL
fairly	NULL
full	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
about	NULL
sixty	NULL
students	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
part	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
younger	NULL
than	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
smooth-faced	NULL
boys	NULL
of	NULL
eighteen	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
noticed	NULL
one	NULL
tall	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
fierce	NULL
red	NULL
moustache	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
thirty	NULL
;	NULL
another	NULL
little	NULL
fellow	NULL
with	NULL
black	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
younger	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
spectacles	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
beard	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
gray	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lecturer	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Cameron	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
handsome	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
white	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
clean-cut	NULL
features	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
called	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
list	NULL
of	NULL
names	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
speech	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
well-chosen	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
discreet	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
careful	NULL
arrangement	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
suggested	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
books	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
buy	NULL
and	NULL
advised	NULL
the	NULL
purchase	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
skeleton	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
anatomy	NULL
with	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
essential	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
study	NULL
of	NULL
surgery	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
appreciation	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
pricked	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
ears	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
heard	NULL
later	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Cameron	NULL
lectured	NULL
also	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
students	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Royal	NULL
Academy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
in	NULL
Japan	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
post	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
University	NULL
of	NULL
Tokyo	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
flattered	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
appreciation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
will	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
many	NULL
tedious	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
finished	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
indulgent	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
which	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
forget	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
passed	NULL
your	NULL
final	NULL
examination	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
anatomy	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
learned	NULL
and	NULL
lost	NULL
than	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
learned	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
pelvis	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
describe	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
well	NULL
and	NULL
clearly	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lecture	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pathological	NULL
museum	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
next	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
theatre	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dissecting-room	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
corridor	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
attendant	NULL
told	NULL
them	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
entered	NULL
Philip	NULL
understood	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
acrid	NULL
smell	NULL
was	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
noticed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
lit	NULL
a	NULL
pipe	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
attendant	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
laugh	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
'll	NULL
soon	NULL
get	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
smell	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
notice	NULL
it	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
name	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
list	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
board	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
leg	NULL
--	NULL
number	NULL
four	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
another	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
bracketed	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
meaning	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
're	NULL
very	NULL
short	NULL
of	NULL
bodies	NULL
just	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
've	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
two	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
part	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
dissecting-room	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
apartment	NULL
painted	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
corridors	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
upper	NULL
part	NULL
a	NULL
rich	NULL
salmon	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
dado	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
terra-cotta	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
regular	NULL
intervals	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
sides	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
right	NULL
angles	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
iron	NULL
slabs	NULL
,	NULL
grooved	NULL
like	NULL
meat-dishes	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
lay	NULL
a	NULL
body	NULL
.	NULL

Most	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
dark	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
preservative	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
kept	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
skin	NULL
had	NULL
almost	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
leather	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
extremely	NULL
emaciated	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
attendant	NULL
took	NULL
Philip	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
slabs	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
youth	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
by	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
your	NULL
name	NULL
Carey	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

then	NULL
we	NULL
've	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
generally	NULL
always	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL
attendant	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
arms	NULL
and	NULL
legs	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
thin	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
shape	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
ribs	NULL
stood	NULL
out	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
skin	NULL
over	NULL
them	NULL
was	NULL
tense	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
about	NULL
forty-five	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
gray	NULL
beard	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
skull	NULL
scanty	NULL
,	NULL
colourless	NULL
hair	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
closed	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
jaw	NULL
sunken	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
row	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
terrible	NULL
and	NULL
ghastly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
start	NULL
at	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
dissecting	NULL
with	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
right	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
instruments	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
needful	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
given	NULL
a	NULL
locker	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
accompanied	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
dissecting-room	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
white	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Make	NULL
you	NULL
feel	NULL
rotten	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
anyone	NULL
dead	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
walked	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
corridor	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
entrance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
remembered	NULL
Fanny	NULL
Price	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
dead	NULL
person	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
seen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
how	NULL
strangely	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
affected	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
immeasurable	NULL
distance	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
quick	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
belong	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
species	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
strange	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
and	NULL
moved	NULL
and	NULL
eaten	NULL
and	NULL
laughed	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
horrible	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
imagine	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
cast	NULL
an	NULL
evil	NULL
influence	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
living	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
d'you	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
having	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
his	NULL
new	NULL
friend	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
basement	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
room	NULL
fitted	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
restaurant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
the	NULL
students	NULL
were	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
fare	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
aerated	NULL
bread	NULL
shop	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
they	NULL
ate	NULL
(	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
scone	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
chocolate	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
companion	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fresh-complexioned	NULL
lad	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
pleasant	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
curly	NULL
,	NULL
dark	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
large-limbed	NULL
,	NULL
slow	NULL
of	NULL
speech	NULL

movement	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
Clifton	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL
taking	NULL
the	NULL
Conjoint	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
Philip	NULL

"	NULL

I	NULL

"	NULL

Most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
students	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
curriculum	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Conjoint	NULL
Board	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
College	NULL
of	NULL
Surgeons	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
College	NULL
of	NULL
Physicians	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
ambitious	NULL

the	NULL
more	NULL
industrious	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
the	NULL
longer	NULL
studies	NULL
which	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
degree	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
University	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
St.	NULL
Luke	NULL
's	NULL
changes	NULL
had	NULL
recently	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
regulations	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
took	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
four	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
for	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
registered	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
autumn	NULL
of	NULL
1892	NULL
.	NULL

Dunsford	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
plans	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
events	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
"	NULL
first	NULL
conjoint	NULL
"	NULL
examination	NULL
consisted	NULL
of	NULL
biology	NULL

anatomy	NULL

and	NULL
chemistry	NULL

but	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
in	NULL
sections	NULL

and	NULL
most	NULL
fellows	NULL
took	NULL
their	NULL
biology	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
after	NULL
entering	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
science	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
recently	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
list	NULL
of	NULL
subjects	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
student	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
inform	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
knowledge	NULL
required	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
small	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dissecting-room	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL

had	NULL
forgotten	NULL

buy	NULL
the	NULL
loose	NULL
sleeves	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
wore	NULL
to	NULL
protect	NULL
their	NULL
shirts	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
already	NULL
working	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
partner	NULL
had	NULL
started	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
minute	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
busy	NULL
dissecting	NULL
out	NULL
cutaneous	NULL
nerves	NULL

Two	NULL
others	NULL
were	NULL
engaged	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
leg	NULL

and	NULL
more	NULL
were	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
arms	NULL

"	NULL

That	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL

fire	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
book	NULL
,	NULL
open	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
diagram	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dissected	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
dab	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

I	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
conversation	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
dissecting-table	NULL

partly	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL

about	NULL

the	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
raw	NULL
schoolboys	NULL

But	NULL
age	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
knowledge	NULL
rather	NULL

of	NULL

Newson	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
active	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
dissecting	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
subject	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
not	NULL
sorry	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
explained	NULL
very	NULL
fully	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
his	NULL
hidden	NULL
stores	NULL
of	NULL
wisdom	NULL

listened	NULL
meekly	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Philip	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
scalpel	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tweezers	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
working	NULL

the	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
year	NULL
were	NULL
three	NULL

four	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
past	NULL
their	NULL
first	NULL
youth	NULL
:	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Navy	NULL

from	NULL
which	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
report	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
dismissed	NULL
for	NULL
drunkenness	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
thirty	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
red	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
brusque	NULL

loud	NULL
voice	NULL

was	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL

through	NULL

had	NULL
a	NULL
bowed	NULL
look	NULL

if	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL

too	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL

he	NULL
went	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
silently	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL

found	NULL

His	NULL
mind	NULL
worked	NULL
slowly	NULL

His	NULL
effort	NULL
at	NULL
application	NULL
was	NULL
painful	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
made	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
tiny	NULL
rooms	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
arranged	NULL
his	NULL
books	NULL

hung	NULL
on	NULL

called	NULL
Griffiths	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL

the	NULL
students	NULL

had	NULL
been	NULL

good	NULL
deal	NULL
together	NULL

they	NULL
used	NULL
a	NULL
variety	NULL
of	NULL
means	NULL
natural	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
impress	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
fortunate	NULL
a	NULL
proper	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
inferiority	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
quantity	NULL

curly	NULL

hair	NULL

blue	NULL
eyes	NULL

a	NULL
white	NULL
skin	NULL

a	NULL
very	NULL
red	NULL
mouth	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
fortunate	NULL
people	NULL
whom	NULL
everybody	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
high	NULL
spirits	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
constant	NULL
gaiety	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
strummed	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
and	NULL
sang	NULL
comic	NULL
songs	NULL
with	NULL
gusto	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
evening	NULL
after	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
reading	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
solitary	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
shouts	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
uproarious	NULL
laughter	NULL
of	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
'	NULL
friends	NULL
above	NULL
him	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
delightful	NULL
evenings	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
sit	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
studio	NULL
,	NULL
Lawson	NULL

he	NULL
,	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
and	NULL
Clutton	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
talk	NULL

art	NULL

the	NULL
love-affairs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL

the	NULL
fame	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
sick	NULL
at	NULL
heart	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
heroic	NULL
gesture	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
abide	NULL
by	NULL
its	NULL
results	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
worst	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
very	NULL
tedious	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
asked	NULL
questions	NULL
by	NULL
demonstrators	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
attention	NULL
wandered	NULL
at	NULL
lectures	NULL
.	NULL

Anatomy	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dreary	NULL
science	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
learning	NULL
by	NULL
heart	NULL
an	NULL
enormous	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
facts	NULL

dissection	NULL
bored	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
dissecting	NULL
out	NULL
laboriously	NULL
nerves	NULL
and	NULL
arteries	NULL
when	NULL
with	NULL
much	NULL
less	NULL
trouble	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
diagrams	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
or	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
specimens	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pathological	NULL
museum	NULL
exactly	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
friends	NULL
by	NULL
chance	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
intimate	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL

to	NULL

companions	NULL

When	NULL

interest	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
concerns	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
patronising	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
can	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
moves	NULL
them	NULL
without	NULL
caring	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
bores	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
they	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
hearing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
studied	NULL
art	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fancying	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
taste	NULL
,	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
discuss	NULL
art	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
impatient	NULL
of	NULL
views	NULL
which	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
agree	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
finding	NULL
quickly	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
's	NULL
ideas	NULL
were	NULL
conventional	NULL
,	NULL
grew	NULL
monosyllabic	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
desired	NULL
popularity	NULL
but	NULL
could	NULL
bring	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
no	NULL
advances	NULL
to	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
rebuff	NULL
prevented	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
affability	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
concealed	NULL
his	NULL
shyness	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
intense	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
frigid	NULL
taciturnity	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
experience	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
here	NULL
the	NULL
freedom	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
medical	NULL
students	NULL
'	NULL
life	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
by	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
through	NULL
no	NULL
effort	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
friendly	NULL
with	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
fresh-complexioned	NULL
,	NULL
heavy	NULL
lad	NULL
whose	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
session	NULL
.	NULL

Dunsford	NULL
attached	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
merely	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
person	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
at	NULL
St.	NULL
Luke	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
friends	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
Saturday	NULL
nights	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
together	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
pit	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
music-hall	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
gallery	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
theatre	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
stupid	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
good-humoured	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
took	NULL
offence	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
obvious	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
merely	NULL
smiled	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
sweet	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
Philip	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
butt	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
amused	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
candour	NULL
and	NULL
delighted	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
agreeable	NULL
nature	NULL
:	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
charm	NULL
which	NULL
himself	NULL
was	NULL
acutely	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
not	NULL
possessing	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
often	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
tea	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
shop	NULL
in	NULL
Parliament	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
admired	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
women	NULL
who	NULL
waited	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
anything	NULL
attractive	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
tall	NULL
and	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
narrow	NULL
hips	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
chest	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
scornfully	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
's	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
ripping	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
DOES	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
matter	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
regular	NULL
features	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
broad	NULL
low	NULL
brow	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
Victorian	NULL
painters	NULL
,	NULL
Lord	NULL
Leighton	NULL
,	NULL
Alma	NULL
Tadema	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
induced	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
they	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
type	NULL
of	NULL
Greek	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
hair	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
arranged	NULL
with	NULL
peculiar	NULL
elaboration	NULL
and	NULL
done	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
forehead	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
called	NULL
an	NULL
Alexandra	NULL
fringe	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
anaemic	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
thin	NULL
lips	NULL
were	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
skin	NULL
was	NULL
delicate	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL
green	NULL
colour	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
red	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
teeth	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
great	NULL
pains	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
from	NULL
spoiling	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
small	NULL
,	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
duties	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
bored	NULL
look	NULL
.	NULL

Dunsford	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
shy	NULL
with	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
getting	NULL
into	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
urged	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
lead	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
manage	NULL
for	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
please	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
remarks	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
with	NULL
monosyllables	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
their	NULL
measure	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
surmised	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
students	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
use	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Dunsford	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
sandy	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
bristly	NULL
moustache	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
German	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
favoured	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
attention	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
calling	NULL
her	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
induce	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
their	NULL
order	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
used	NULL
the	NULL
clients	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
with	NULL
frigid	NULL
insolence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
indifferent	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
calls	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hurried	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
art	NULL
of	NULL
treating	NULL
women	NULL
who	NULL
desired	NULL
refreshment	NULL
with	NULL
just	NULL
that	NULL
degree	NULL
of	NULL
impertinence	NULL
which	NULL
irritated	NULL
them	NULL
without	NULL
affording	NULL
them	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL
of	NULL
complaining	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
management	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
her	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
girls	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
address	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
an	NULL
odious	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
so	NULL
pretentious	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
chanced	NULL
that	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
day	NULL
the	NULL
German	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
brought	NULL
the	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
smiling	NULL
,	NULL
remarked	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Your	NULL
friend	NULL
's	NULL
not	NULL
here	NULL
today	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL
mean	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
coldly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
referring	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
nobleman	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sandy	NULL
moustache	NULL
.	NULL

Has	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
you	NULL
for	NULL
another	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Some	NULL
people	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
mind	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
retorted	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
left	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
attend	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
paper	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
customer	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
are	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
really	NULL
quite	NULL
indifferent	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
attitude	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
vertebrae	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
replied	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
piqued	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
irritated	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
agreeable	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
offence	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
bill	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
hazarded	NULL
a	NULL
remark	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
lead	NULL
further	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
we	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
on	NULL
speaking	NULL
terms	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
smiled	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
here	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
orders	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
on	NULL
customers	NULL

I	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
slip	NULL
of	NULL
paper	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
marked	NULL
the	NULL
sum	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sitting	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
flushed	NULL
with	NULL
anger	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
's	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
Carey	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
outside	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ill-mannered	NULL
slut	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
sha	NULL
n't	NULL
go	NULL
there	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

His	NULL
influence	NULL
with	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
was	NULL
strong	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
their	NULL
tea	NULL
elsewhere	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
soon	NULL
found	NULL
another	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
to	NULL
flirt	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
snub	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
waitress	NULL
had	NULL
inflicted	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
rankled	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
treated	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
civility	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
perfectly	NULL
indifferent	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
obvious	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
disliked	NULL
him	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
otherwise	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
pride	NULL
was	NULL
wounded	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
suppress	NULL
a	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
even	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
impatient	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
petty	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
days	NULL
'	NULL
firmness	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
surmount	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
least	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
certainly	NULL
cease	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Pretexting	NULL
an	NULL
appointment	NULL
one	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
weakness	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
straight	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
vowed	NULL
never	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
waitress	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
tables	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
expected	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
some	NULL
reference	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
there	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
order	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
other	NULL
customers	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
stranger	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
no	NULL
sign	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
really	NULL
forgotten	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
brought	NULL
his	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Have	NULL
you	NULL
seen	NULL
my	NULL
friend	NULL
tonight	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
's	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
here	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
days	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
this	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
conversation	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
strangely	NULL
nervous	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
opportunity	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
saying	NULL
anything	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
bill	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Filthy	NULL
weather	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
mortifying	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
prepare	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
phrase	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
embarrassment	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
make	NULL
much	NULL
difference	NULL
to	NULL

,	NULL
having	NULL
to	NULL

in	NULL
here	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
insolence	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
tone	NULL
that	NULL
peculiarly	NULL
irritated	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
sarcasm	NULL
rose	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
forced	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
silent	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
God	NULL
she	NULL
'd	NULL

he	NULL
raged	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL

well	NULL

"	NULL

LVI	NULL
He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
her	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
laughed	NULL
angrily	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
foolishness	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
absurd	NULL
to	NULL
care	NULL
what	NULL
an	NULL
anaemic	NULL
little	NULL
waitress	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
strangely	NULL
humiliated	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
knew	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
humiliation	NULL
but	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
certainly	NULL
forgotten	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
peace	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
wiped	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
over	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
obvious	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
impression	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
wits	NULL
to	NULL
eradicate	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
care	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
anything	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
susceptible	NULL
person	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
offended	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
effect	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
good-evening	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
once	NULL
he	NULL
omitted	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
murmured	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
an	NULL
expression	NULL
which	NULL
though	NULL
frequently	NULL
applicable	NULL
to	NULL
members	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
female	NULL
sex	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
often	NULL
used	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
polite	NULL
society	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
unmoved	NULL
face	NULL
he	NULL
ordered	NULL
his	NULL
tea	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
without	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
good-night	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
promised	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
at	NULL
tea-time	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
restless	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
command	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
desperately	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
After	NULL
all	NULL
there	NULL
's	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
n't	NULL
go	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
struggle	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
on	NULL
for	NULL
seven	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
n't	NULL
coming	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
leaped	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
bosom	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
reddening	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
detained	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
come	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Cutting	NULL
up	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
so	NULL
bad	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
are	NULL
a	NULL
stoodent	NULL
,	NULL
are	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
satisfy	NULL
her	NULL
curiosity	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
late	NULL
hour	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nobody	NULL
else	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
tables	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
immersed	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
novelette	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sixpenny	NULL
reprints	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
regular	NULL
supply	NULL
of	NULL
inexpensive	NULL
fiction	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
order	NULL
by	NULL
poor	NULL
hacks	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
consumption	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
illiterate	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
elated	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
addressed	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
accord	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
approaching	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
turn	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
comfort	NULL
to	NULL
express	NULL
the	NULL
immensity	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
contempt	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
profile	NULL
was	NULL
beautiful	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
how	NULL
English	NULL
girls	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
class	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
a	NULL
perfection	NULL
of	NULL
outline	NULL
which	NULL
took	NULL
your	NULL
breath	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
cold	NULL
as	NULL
marble	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
faint	NULL
green	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
delicate	NULL
skin	NULL
gave	NULL
an	NULL
impression	NULL
of	NULL
unhealthiness	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
waitresses	NULL
were	NULL
dressed	NULL
alike	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
plain	NULL
black	NULL
dresses	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
apron	NULL
,	NULL
cuffs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
cap	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
sheet	NULL
of	NULL
paper	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
Philip	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
sketch	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
leaning	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
book	NULL
(	NULL
she	NULL
outlined	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
read	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
inspiration	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
smiled	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
draw	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
art-student	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
showed	NULL
that	NULL
drawing	NULL
you	NULL
left	NULL
be'ind	NULL
you	NULL
last	NULL
night	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
manageress	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
WAS	NULL
struck	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
me	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
girls	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
picture	NULL
you	NULL
done	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Rogers	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
image	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
his	NULL
bill	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
my	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Your	NULL
friend	NULL
mentioned	NULL
it	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
about	NULL
that	NULL
drawing	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
wants	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
you	NULL
once	NULL
begin	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
'll	NULL
all	NULL
be	NULL
wanting	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
pause	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
peculiar	NULL
inconsequence	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Where	NULL
's	NULL
that	NULL
young	NULL
fellow	NULL
that	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL

Has	NULL
he	NULL
gone	NULL
away	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Fancy	NULL
your	NULL
remembering	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
nice-looking	NULL
young	NULL
fellow	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
sensation	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

Dunsford	NULL
had	NULL
jolly	NULL
curling	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
fresh	NULL
complexion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
beautiful	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
advantages	NULL
with	NULL
envy	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
's	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
laugh	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
repeated	NULL
every	NULL
word	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
limped	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
friendly	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
opportunity	NULL
arose	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
offer	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
finished	NULL
sketch	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
interesting	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
profile	NULL
was	NULL
lovely	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
curiously	NULL
fascinating	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
chlorotic	NULL
colour	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
;	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
pea	NULL
soup	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
driving	NULL
away	NULL
that	NULL
idea	NULL
angrily	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
petals	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
yellow	NULL
rosebud	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
tore	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
pieces	NULL
before	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
burst	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
ill-feeling	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
's	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
sort	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
murmured	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
silly	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
offence	NULL
at	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
doubtless	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
fault	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
herself	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
accustomed	NULL
by	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
making	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
sight	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
impression	NULL
on	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
flattered	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
success	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
drawing	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
interest	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
small	NULL
talent	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
restless	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
lunch	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
tea-shop	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
certain	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
many	NULL
people	NULL
there	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
managed	NULL
before	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
tea	NULL
with	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
punctually	NULL
at	NULL
half	NULL
past	NULL
four	NULL
(	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
watch	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
times	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
German	NULL
whom	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
there	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
till	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
ago	NULL
and	NULL
since	NULL
then	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
laughing	NULL
at	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
common	NULL
laugh	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
shudder	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
notice	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
growing	NULL
angry	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
impatient	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
rapped	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
loudly	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
stick	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
approached	NULL
sulkily	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
d'you	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
hurry	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
insolent	NULL
manner	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL
kindly	NULL
give	NULL
your	NULL
order	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
get	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL
want	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
stand	NULL
talking	NULL
all	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Tea	NULL
and	NULL
toasted	NULL
bun	NULL
,	NULL
please	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Philip	NULL
answered	NULL
briefly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
furious	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
The	NULL
Star	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
elaborately	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
brought	NULL
the	NULL
tea	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL
give	NULL
me	NULL
my	NULL
bill	NULL
now	NULL
I	NULL
need	NULL
n't	NULL
trouble	NULL
you	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
icily	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wrote	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
slip	NULL
,	NULL
placed	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
German	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
animation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
middle	NULL
height	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
round	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
nation	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
sallow	NULL
face	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
moustache	NULL
was	NULL
large	NULL
and	NULL
bristling	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
tail-coat	NULL
and	NULL
gray	NULL
trousers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
massive	NULL
gold	NULL
watch-chain	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
girls	NULL
looked	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
and	NULL
exchanged	NULL
significant	NULL
glances	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
certain	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
laughing	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
blood	NULL
boiled	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
detested	NULL
Mildred	NULL
now	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
thing	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
cease	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tea-shop	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
worsted	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
devised	NULL
a	NULL
plan	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
despised	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
another	NULL
table	NULL
and	NULL
ordered	NULL
his	NULL
tea	NULL
from	NULL
another	NULL
waitress	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
friend	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
paid	NULL
no	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
cross	NULL
his	NULL
path	NULL
:	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
passed	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
repeated	NULL
this	NULL
for	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
expected	NULL
that	NULL
presently	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
ask	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
tables	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
prepared	NULL
an	NULL
answer	NULL
charged	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
loathing	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
absurd	NULL
to	NULL
trouble	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
beaten	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
German	NULL
suddenly	NULL
disappeared	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
still	NULL
sat	NULL
at	NULL
other	NULL
tables	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
paid	NULL
no	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
he	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
complete	NULL
indifference	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
way	NULL
till	NULL
doomsday	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
effect	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
not	NULL
finished	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
seat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
said	NULL
good-evening	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
ignored	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
placid	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
prevent	NULL
the	NULL
mad	NULL
beating	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
musical	NULL
comedy	NULL
had	NULL
lately	NULL
leaped	NULL
into	NULL
public	NULL
favour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
Mildred	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
delighted	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
wonder	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
'd	NULL
dine	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
one	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
The	NULL
Belle	NULL
of	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
stalls	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
added	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
sentence	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
tempt	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
either	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pit	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
some	NULL
man	NULL
took	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
seldom	NULL
to	NULL
more	NULL
expensive	NULL
seats	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
upper	NULL
circle	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
pale	NULL
face	NULL
showed	NULL
no	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
expression	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
When	NULL
will	NULL
you	NULL
come	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
get	NULL
off	NULL
early	NULL
on	NULL
Thursdays	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
made	NULL
arrangements	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
lived	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
aunt	NULL
at	NULL
Herne	NULL
Hill	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
play	NULL
began	NULL
at	NULL
eight	NULL
so	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
dine	NULL
at	NULL
seven	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
proposed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
meet	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
second-class	NULL
waiting-room	NULL
at	NULL
Victoria	NULL
Station	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
showed	NULL
no	NULL
pleasure	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
accepted	NULL
the	NULL
invitation	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
conferred	NULL
a	NULL
favour	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
vaguely	NULL
irritated	NULL
.	NULL

LVII	NULL
Philip	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
Victoria	NULL
Station	NULL
nearly	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
which	NULL
Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
appointed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
second-class	NULL
waiting-room	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
waited	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
anxious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
incoming	NULL
suburban	NULL
trains	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
fixed	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
impatient	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
waiting-rooms	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
thud	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
never	NULL
coming	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
after	NULL
keeping	NULL
me	NULL
waiting	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
home	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
you	NULL
said	NULL
you	NULL
'd	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
second-class	NULL
waiting-room	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
say	NULL
any	NULL
such	NULL
thing	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
exactly	NULL
likely	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
sit	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
second-class	NULL
room	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
sit	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Though	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
mistake	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
cab	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Where	NULL
are	NULL
we	NULL
dining	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Adelphi	NULL
Restaurant	NULL
.	NULL

Will	NULL
that	NULL
suit	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL
where	NULL
we	NULL
dine	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
spoke	NULL
ungraciously	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
by	NULL
being	NULL
kept	NULL
waiting	NULL
and	NULL
answered	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
attempt	NULL
at	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
monosyllables	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
cloak	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
rough	NULL
,	NULL
dark	NULL
material	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
crochet	NULL
shawl	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
restaurant	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
with	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
red	NULL
shades	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
candles	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
tables	NULL

the	NULL
gold	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
looking-glasses	NULL

lent	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
a	NULL
sumptuous	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
here	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
Philip	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
cloak	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
pale	NULL
blue	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
cut	NULL
square	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
neck	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
elaborately	NULL
arranged	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
ordered	NULL
champagne	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
sparkled	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
are	NULL
going	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Because	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
ordered	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
carelessly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
drank	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
WAS	NULL
surprised	NULL
when	NULL

"	NULL

Conversation	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
very	NULL
easily	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
nervously	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
amusing	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
listened	NULL
carelessly	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
remarks	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
on	NULL
other	NULL
diners	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
pretence	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
little	NULL
jokes	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
them	NULL
quite	NULL
seriously	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
vivacity	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
was	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
girls	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
the	NULL

told	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL

Philip	NULL

Philip	NULL
filled	NULL
her	NULL
glass	NULL
,	NULL
hoping	NULL
that	NULL
champagne	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
more	NULL
affable	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
anxious	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
little	NULL
jaunt	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
success	NULL

He	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
held	NULL
her	NULL
knife	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
pen-holder	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
drank	NULL
protruded	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
finger	NULL

He	NULL
started	NULL
several	NULL
topics	NULL
of	NULL
conversation	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
little	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
with	NULL
irritation	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
talking	NULL
nineteen	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dozen	NULL
and	NULL
laughing	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
German	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
finished	NULL
dinner	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
cultured	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
musical	NULL
comedy	NULL
with	NULL
scorn	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
jokes	NULL
vulgar	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
melodies	NULL
obvious	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
in	NULL
France	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Mildred	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
herself	NULL
thoroughly	NULL

she	NULL
laughed	NULL
till	NULL
her	NULL
sides	NULL
ached	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
when	NULL
something	NULL
tickled	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
exchange	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
of	NULL
pleasure	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
applauded	NULL
rapturously	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
who	NULL
surrounded	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
stalls	NULL

She	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
those	NULL

were	NULL
painted	NULL

those	NULL
who	NULL
wore	NULL
false	NULL
hair	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

She	NULL
found	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
admire	NULL

and	NULL
whenever	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
anyone	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
something	NULL
disagreeable	NULL

It	NULL
made	NULL
Philip	NULL
uneasy	NULL

He	NULL
supposed	NULL
that	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL

taken	NULL
her	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bored	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
death	NULL

He	NULL
disliked	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
home	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
get	NULL
beyond	NULL
such	NULL
expressions	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL

Her	NULL
indifference	NULL
maddened	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL

my	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
take	NULL
you	NULL
home	NULL

it	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
gives	NULL
you	NULL
any	NULL
pleasure	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
first	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
return	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL

not	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL

you	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
carriage-door	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
pleased	NULL
or	NULL
sorry	NULL
when	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
entered	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
Herne	NULL
Hill	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
accompanied	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
lived	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
say	NULL
good-night	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
holding	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
'd	NULL
better	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
people	NULL
are	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL

anybody	NULL
talking	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
good-night	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
quickly	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
shawl	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
turn	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
which	NULL
house	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
along	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
trim	NULL
,	NULL
common	NULL
little	NULL
house	NULL
of	NULL
yellow	NULL
brick	NULL
,	NULL
exactly	NULL
like	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
little	NULL
houses	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
outside	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
floor	NULL
was	NULL
darkened	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
strolled	NULL
slowly	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
evening	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
unsatisfactory	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
irritated	NULL
,	NULL
restless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
miserable	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
still	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
railway	NULL
carriage	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
crochet	NULL
shawl	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
hours	NULL
that	NULL
must	NULL
pass	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
rested	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
drowsily	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
thin	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
delicate	NULL
features	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
greenish	NULL
pallor	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
skin	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
happy	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
unhappy	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
touch	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
...	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
finish	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
wide	NULL
awake	NULL
...	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
the	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
pale	NULL
mouth	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
narrow	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
truth	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
incredible	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
falling	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
scene	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
pictured	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
himself	NULL
coming	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
ball-room	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
fell	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
women	NULL
talking	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
eyes	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
gasp	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
throat	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
throat	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
quite	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
tall	NULL
and	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
beautiful	NULL
with	NULL
eyes	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
dressed	NULL
in	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
black	NULL
hair	NULL
shone	NULL
diamonds	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
forgetting	NULL
that	NULL
people	NULL
surrounded	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
straight	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
moved	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Both	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
formality	NULL
of	NULL
introduction	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
been	NULL
looking	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
all	NULL
my	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
've	NULL
come	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
murmured	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Will	NULL
you	NULL
dance	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
surrendered	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
outstretched	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
danced	NULL
.	NULL

(	NULL
Philip	NULL
always	NULL
pretended	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
lame	NULL
.	NULL
)	NULL

She	NULL
danced	NULL
divinely	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
never	NULL
danced	NULL
with	NULL
anyone	NULL
who	NULL
danced	NULL
like	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
tore	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
programme	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
danced	NULL
together	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
so	NULL
thankful	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
meet	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

People	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ball-room	NULL
stared	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
their	NULL
passion	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
flung	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
cloak	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
waiting	NULL
cab	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
caught	NULL
the	NULL
midnight	NULL
train	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
sped	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
star-lit	NULL
night	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
unknown	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
old	NULL
fancy	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
impossible	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
Mildred	NULL
Rogers	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
grotesque	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
her	NULL
pretty	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
the	NULL
thinness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
noticed	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
bones	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
chest	NULL
stood	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
evening-dress	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
features	NULL
one	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
unhealthiness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
colour	NULL
vaguely	NULL
repelled	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
common	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
phrases	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
bald	NULL
and	NULL
few	NULL
,	NULL
constantly	NULL
repeated	NULL
,	NULL
showed	NULL
the	NULL
emptiness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
recalled	NULL
her	NULL
vulgar	NULL
little	NULL
laugh	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
jokes	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
musical	NULL
comedy	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
finger	NULL
carefully	NULL
extended	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
held	NULL
her	NULL
glass	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
manners	NULL
like	NULL
her	NULL
conversation	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
odiously	NULL
genteel	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
her	NULL
insolence	NULL
;	NULL
sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
box	NULL
her	NULL
ears	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
hitting	NULL
her	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
recollection	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
tiny	NULL
,	NULL
beautiful	NULL
ears	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
seized	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
uprush	NULL
of	NULL
emotion	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
yearned	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
taking	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
fragile	NULL
body	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
kissing	NULL
her	NULL
pale	NULL
mouth	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
his	NULL
fingers	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
slightly	NULL
greenish	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
rapture	NULL
which	NULL
seized	NULL
one	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
seemed	NULL
spring-like	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
ecstatic	NULL
happiness	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
happiness	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
hunger	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
painful	NULL
yearning	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bitter	NULL
anguish	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
known	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
first	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
only	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
each	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
feeling	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
pain	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
curiously	NULL
breathless	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
wretchedness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stretched	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
dog	NULL
stretches	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
endure	NULL
that	NULL
ceaseless	NULL
aching	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

LVIII	NULL
Philip	NULL
woke	NULL
early	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
thought	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
meet	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
Victoria	NULL
Station	NULL
and	NULL
walk	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
shaved	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
scrambled	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
bus	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
by	NULL
twenty	NULL
to	NULL
eight	NULL
and	NULL
watched	NULL
the	NULL
incoming	NULL
trains	NULL
.	NULL

Crowds	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
clerks	NULL
and	NULL
shop-people	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
early	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thronged	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
platform	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
hurried	NULL
along	NULL
,	NULL
sometimes	NULL
in	NULL
pairs	NULL
,	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
a	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
more	NULL
often	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
ugly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
abstracted	NULL
look	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
younger	NULL
ones	NULL
walked	NULL
lightly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
cement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
platform	NULL
were	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
tread	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
went	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
impelled	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
machine	NULL
:	NULL
their	NULL
faces	NULL
were	NULL
set	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
anxious	NULL
frown	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
Mildred	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
eagerly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Good-morning	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
after	NULL
last	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
wore	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
brown	NULL
ulster	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
sailor	NULL
hat	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
clear	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
pleased	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL
got	NULL
much	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
waste	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
D'you	NULL
mind	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
walk	NULL
down	NULL
Victoria	NULL
Street	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
none	NULL
too	NULL
early	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
shall	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
fast	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
club-foot	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
scarlet	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
beg	NULL
your	NULL
pardon	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
detain	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
can	NULL
please	NULL
yourself	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sinking	NULL
heart	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
home	NULL
to	NULL
breakfast	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hated	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
to	NULL
bother	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
ever	NULL
care	NULL
two	NULL
straws	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
deformity	NULL
with	NULL
distaste	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
tea	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
hating	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
nodded	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
smiled	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
expect	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
short	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
see	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL

lifted	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
racked	NULL
his	NULL
brains	NULL
anxiously	NULL

seeking	NULL

a	NULL
remark	NULL
which	NULL

her	NULL

him	NULL

he	NULL

A	NULL

to	NULL
his	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
learning	NULL

You	NULL

He	NULL
smiled	NULL

appealingly	NULL

"	NULL
Will	NULL

something	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL

went	NULL
back	NULL

at	NULL
eight	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL

quarrelsome	NULL

"	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL

took	NULL
a	NULL
ticket	NULL

he	NULL

They	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
always	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
verge	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL

The	NULL
fact	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL

himself	NULL

Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
speaking	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL

The	NULL
gentility	NULL

at	NULL
him	NULL
suspiciously	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
resist	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

There	NULL

a	NULL

Philip	NULL
bought	NULL
tickets	NULL

Saturday	NULL
night	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
one	NULL

got	NULL
off	NULL

she	NULL

up	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
and	NULL
hurry	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
clothes	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL

If	NULL
the	NULL
manageress	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
temper	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
go	NULL
at	NULL
seven	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
agreed	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
outside	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
past	NULL
seven	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
with	NULL
painful	NULL
eagerness	NULL

for	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cab	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
theatre	NULL

the	NULL
station	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
kiss	NULL
her	NULL

The	NULL
vehicle	NULL
gave	NULL
every	NULL
facility	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
round	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
waist	NULL
(	NULL
an	NULL
advantage	NULL

the	NULL

over	NULL

the	NULL

that	NULL

cost	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL

But	NULL
on	NULL
Saturday	NULL
afternoon	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
confirm	NULL
the	NULL
arrangements	NULL

he	NULL
met	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
fair	NULL
moustache	NULL
coming	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
by	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
Miller	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
naturalized	NULL
German	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
anglicised	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
speak	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
his	NULL
English	NULL
was	NULL
fluent	NULL
and	NULL
natural	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
the	NULL
intonation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
native	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
flirting	NULL
with	NULL
Mildred	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
horribly	NULL
jealous	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
comfort	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
coldness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
temperament	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
otherwise	NULL
distressed	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
her	NULL
incapable	NULL
of	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
rival	NULL
as	NULL
no	NULL
better	NULL
off	NULL
than	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
sank	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
thought	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Miller	NULL
's	NULL
sudden	NULL
appearance	NULL
might	NULL
interfere	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
jaunt	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
entered	NULL
,	NULL
sick	NULL
with	NULL
apprehension	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
waitress	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
order	NULL
for	NULL
tea	NULL

I	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

with	NULL
an	NULL
expression	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
real	NULL
distress	NULL

said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL

look	NULL
so	NULL
stern	NULL
about	NULL

she	NULL
laughed	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
not	NULL

It	NULL

But	NULL
you	NULL

It	NULL

be	NULL
a	NULL
pity	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
them	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
and	NULL
deliberately	NULL
tore	NULL
them	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL

you	NULL
doing	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

I	NULL
only	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

n't	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL

You	NULL
're	NULL
just	NULL

You	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
not	NULL
my	NULL

my	NULL

queer	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
quickly	NULL
wrote	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
bill	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
about	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
should	NULL
accept	NULL
their	NULL
most	NULL
transparent	NULL
lies	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
watch	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
for	NULL
certain	NULL
whether	NULL
Mildred	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
German	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
unhappy	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
certainty	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
seven	NULL
he	NULL
stationed	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
opposite	NULL
pavement	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
about	NULL
for	NULL
Miller	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
cloak	NULL
and	NULL
shawl	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
worn	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Shaftesbury	NULL
Theatre	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
obvious	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
started	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
came	NULL
straight	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL

you	NULL

here	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Taking	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
answered	NULL

he	NULL
murmured	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
devil	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
which	NULL
forced	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
matters	NULL
worse	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL

hurting	NULL
him	NULL

I	NULL

"	NULL

His	NULL
mood	NULL
changed	NULL
suddenly	NULL
from	NULL
anger	NULL
to	NULL
despair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
trembled	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL

awfully	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
torn	NULL
with	NULL
anguish	NULL
.	NULL

People	NULL
were	NULL
hurrying	NULL
past	NULL
them	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
pavement	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cabs	NULL
and	NULL
omnibuses	NULL
rolled	NULL
by	NULL
noisily	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
wandering	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL

the	NULL
crowd	NULL

"	NULL

groaned	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
too	NULL
degrading	NULL

If	NULL

go	NULL

Unless	NULL
you	NULL

you	NULL

"	NULL

awful	NULL

All	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL

good	NULL
riddance	NULL
to	NULL
bad	NULL
rubbish	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
good-bye	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
nodded	NULL
and	NULL
limped	NULL
away	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
hoped	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
call	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
lamp-post	NULL
he	NULL
stopped	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
shoulder	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
beckon	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
forget	NULL
everything	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
humiliation	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
apparently	NULL
had	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
trouble	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
quit	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

LIX	NULL
Philip	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
wretchedly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
his	NULL
landlady	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Gatti	NULL
's	NULL
for	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

Afterwards	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
above	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
party	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
noisy	NULL
merriment	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
misery	NULL
more	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
music-hall	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Saturday	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
standing-room	NULL
only	NULL
:	NULL
after	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
of	NULL
boredom	NULL
his	NULL
legs	NULL
grew	NULL
tired	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
fix	NULL
his	NULL
attention	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
work	NULL
hard	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
examination	NULL
in	NULL
biology	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
easy	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
neglected	NULL
his	NULL
lectures	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
viva	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
enough	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
to	NULL
scrape	NULL
through	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
confidence	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
intelligence	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
threw	NULL
aside	NULL
his	NULL
book	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
himself	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
thinking	NULL
deliberately	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
reproached	NULL
himself	NULL
bitterly	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
behaviour	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
alternative	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
dine	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
or	NULL
else	NULL
never	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
?	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
she	NULL
refused	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
allowed	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
pride	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
burnt	NULL
his	NULL
ships	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
suffering	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
her	NULL
too	NULL
well	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
indifferent	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
pretended	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
her	NULL
story	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
strength	NULL
to	NULL
conceal	NULL
his	NULL
disappointment	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
self-control	NULL
to	NULL
master	NULL
his	NULL
temper	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
idealisation	NULL
that	NULL
takes	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
exactly	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
amusing	NULL
or	NULL
clever	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
common	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
vulgar	NULL
shrewdness	NULL
which	NULL
revolted	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
gentleness	NULL
nor	NULL
softness	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
make	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
aroused	NULL
her	NULL
admiration	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
clever	NULL
trick	NULL
played	NULL
on	NULL
an	NULL
unsuspecting	NULL
person	NULL
;	NULL
to	NULL
'	NULL
do	NULL
'	NULL
somebody	NULL
always	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
laughed	NULL
savagely	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
gentility	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
refinement	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
ate	NULL
her	NULL
food	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
a	NULL
coarse	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
limited	NULL
vocabulary	NULL
reached	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
euphemisms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
scented	NULL
indecency	NULL
everywhere	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
trousers	NULL
but	NULL
referred	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
nether	NULL
garments	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
slightly	NULL
indelicate	NULL
to	NULL
blow	NULL
her	NULL
nose	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
deprecating	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
anaemic	NULL
and	NULL
suffered	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
dyspepsia	NULL
which	NULL
accompanies	NULL
that	NULL
ailing	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
repelled	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
flat	NULL
breast	NULL
and	NULL
narrow	NULL
hips	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
the	NULL
vulgar	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
loathed	NULL
and	NULL
despised	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
loving	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fact	NULL
remained	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
helpless	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
sometimes	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bigger	NULL
boy	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
struggled	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
superior	NULL
strength	NULL
till	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
strength	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
rendered	NULL
quite	NULL
powerless	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
peculiar	NULL
languor	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
limbs	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
paralysed	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
just	NULL
that	NULL
same	NULL
weakness	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
loved	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
loved	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mind	NULL
her	NULL
faults	NULL
of	NULL
person	NULL
or	NULL
of	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
loved	NULL
them	NULL
too	NULL
:	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
events	NULL
they	NULL
meant	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
seized	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
strange	NULL
force	NULL
that	NULL
moved	NULL
him	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
contrary	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
interests	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
freedom	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
the	NULL
chains	NULL
which	NULL
bound	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
himself	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
how	NULL
often	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
longed	NULL
to	NULL
experience	NULL
the	NULL
overwhelming	NULL
passion	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
cursed	NULL
himself	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
beginnings	NULL
;	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
happened	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
gone	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
with	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
whole	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
fault	NULL
.	NULL

Except	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
ridiculous	NULL
vanity	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
troubled	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
ill-mannered	NULL
slut	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
all	NULL
events	NULL
the	NULL
occurrences	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
affair	NULL
.	NULL

Unless	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
lost	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
shame	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
passionately	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
love	NULL
that	NULL
obsessed	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
degrading	NULL
and	NULL
hateful	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
prevent	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
anguish	NULL
he	NULL
suffered	NULL
must	NULL
grow	NULL
less	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
mind	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL
Emily	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
and	NULL
Fanny	NULL
Price	NULL
had	NULL
endured	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
account	NULL
anything	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
torment	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
suffered	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
pang	NULL
of	NULL
remorse	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
then	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
slept	NULL
very	NULL
badly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
was	NULL
Sunday	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
worked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
biology	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
book	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
forming	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
fix	NULL
his	NULL
attention	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
remember	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
going	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Mildred	NULL
every	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
repeated	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
the	NULL
exact	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
quarrel	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
force	NULL
himself	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
book	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
walk	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
streets	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
South	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
were	NULL
dingy	NULL
enough	NULL
on	NULL
week-days	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
energy	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
coming	NULL
and	NULL
going	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
sordid	NULL
vivacity	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
on	NULL
Sundays	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
shops	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
carts	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
roadway	NULL
,	NULL
silent	NULL
and	NULL
depressed	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
indescribably	NULL
dreary	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
tired	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
slept	NULL
heavily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Monday	NULL
came	NULL
he	NULL
entered	NULL
upon	NULL
life	NULL
with	NULL
determination	NULL
.	NULL

Christmas	NULL
was	NULL
approaching	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
students	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
short	NULL
holiday	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
parts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
session	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
refused	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
invitation	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
the	NULL
approaching	NULL
examination	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
excuse	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
unwilling	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
London	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
neglected	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
curriculum	NULL
allowed	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
seriously	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
easier	NULL
each	NULL
day	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
congratulated	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
character	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pain	NULL
he	NULL
suffered	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
anguish	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
soreness	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
what	NULL
one	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
if	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
thrown	NULL
off	NULL
a	NULL
horse	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
no	NULL
bones	NULL
were	NULL
broken	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
bruised	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
shaken	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
observe	NULL
with	NULL
curiosity	NULL
the	NULL
condition	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
analysed	NULL
his	NULL
feelings	NULL
with	NULL
interest	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
amused	NULL
at	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
little	NULL
under	NULL
those	NULL
circumstances	NULL
it	NULL
mattered	NULL
what	NULL
one	NULL
thought	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
system	NULL
of	NULL
personal	NULL
philosophy	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
great	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
to	NULL
devise	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
served	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
puzzled	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
sometimes	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
who	NULL
looked	NULL
so	NULL
like	NULL
Mildred	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
stop	NULL
beating	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
hurried	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
eager	NULL
and	NULL
anxious	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
total	NULL
stranger	NULL
.	NULL

Men	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
with	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
tea	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
A.	NULL
B.	NULL
C.	NULL
shop	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
well-known	NULL
uniform	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
miserable	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
thought	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
transferred	NULL
to	NULL
another	NULL
establishment	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
firm	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
worked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
suddenly	NULL
find	NULL
himself	NULL
face	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
idea	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
panic	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
feared	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
pretended	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
about	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
maddened	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
crying	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
for	NULL
Heaven	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
his	NULL
tongue	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
examination	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
turn	NULL
arrived	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
examiner	NULL
's	NULL
table	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
confidence	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
answered	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
questions	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
showed	NULL
him	NULL
various	NULL
specimens	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
very	NULL
few	NULL
lectures	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
asked	NULL
about	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
learn	NULL
from	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
floored	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
his	NULL
ignorance	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
examiner	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
insist	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
his	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
were	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
certain	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
examination	NULL
buildings	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
posted	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
astounded	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
his	NULL
number	NULL
among	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
satisfied	NULL
the	NULL
examiners	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
amazement	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
list	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
.	NULL

Dunsford	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
awfully	NULL
sorry	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
ploughed	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
inquired	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
number	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
turned	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
radiant	NULL
face	NULL
that	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL
matter	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
jolly	NULL
glad	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
shall	NULL
go	NULL
up	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
July	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
pretend	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
way	NULL
back	NULL
along	NULL
The	NULL
Embankment	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
talking	NULL
of	NULL
indifferent	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

Dunsford	NULL
good-naturedly	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
discuss	NULL
the	NULL
causes	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
failure	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
obstinately	NULL
casual	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
horribly	NULL
mortified	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
pleasant	NULL
but	NULL
quite	NULL
stupid	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
rebuff	NULL
harder	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
intelligence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
desperately	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
mistaken	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
opinion	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
session	NULL
the	NULL
students	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
joined	NULL
in	NULL
October	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
shaken	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
groups	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
brilliant	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
clever	NULL
or	NULL
industrious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
'	NULL
rotters	NULL
.	NULL
'	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
failure	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
surprise	NULL
to	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
but	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
tea-time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
having	NULL
tea	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
basement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Medical	NULL
School	NULL
:	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
examination	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
exultant	NULL
,	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
disliked	NULL
him	NULL
would	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
devils	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
failed	NULL
would	NULL
sympathise	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
sympathy	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
instinct	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
inflict	NULL
suffering	NULL
upon	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
forgot	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
his	NULL
maxim	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
his	NULL
inclinations	NULL
with	NULL
due	NULL
regard	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
policeman	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
;	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
acted	NULL
in	NULL
accordance	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
some	NULL
strange	NULL
morbidity	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
nature	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
grim	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
self-torture	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
later	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
endured	NULL
the	NULL
ordeal	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
forced	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
noisy	NULL
conversation	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
smoking-room	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
seized	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
utter	NULL
loneliness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
absurd	NULL
and	NULL
futile	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
urgent	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
consolation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
temptation	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
irresistible	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
bitterly	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
small	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
consolation	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
waitress	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
serve	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
person	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
he	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
use	NULL
in	NULL
hiding	NULL
that	NULL
fact	NULL
from	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
humiliating	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
nothing	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
self-respect	NULL
left	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
confess	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
hoped	NULL
each	NULL
day	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
addressed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
would	NULL
find	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
written	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
evident	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
cared	NULL
nothing	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
on	NULL
repeating	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
must	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
desire	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
great	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
jumped	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cab	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
thrifty	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
one	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
possibly	NULL
be	NULL
avoided	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
thought	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
terror	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
in	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
A	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
tea	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
muffin	NULL
,	NULL
please	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
ordered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
almost	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
smiling	NULL
.	NULL

Smiling	NULL
!	NULL

She	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
forgotten	NULL
completely	NULL
that	NULL
last	NULL
scene	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
repeated	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
times	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
'd	NULL

he	NULL
answered	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
a	NULL
gracious	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
cursed	NULL
the	NULL
fate	NULL
which	NULL
chained	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL

fetch	NULL
his	NULL
tea	NULL

you	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
haggard	NULL

passionate	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL

She	NULL
seemed	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
drink	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
humiliation	NULL

she	NULL
hurt	NULL
him	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

thought	NULL
how	NULL

at	NULL

grew	NULL

It	NULL

LX	NULL
They	NULL
dined	NULL
in	NULL
Soho	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
tremulous	NULL
with	NULL
joy	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
crowded	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL

the	NULL

belief	NULL
that	NULL

It	NULL

kept	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
man	NULL
from	NULL
Rouen	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
discovered	NULL
by	NULL
accident	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
attracted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Gallic	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL

in	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
generally	NULL
an	NULL

one	NULL

on	NULL
each	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL

anything	NULL

scanty	NULL
meals	NULL

Here	NULL
Mildred	NULL

Philip	NULL
were	NULL
able	NULL

get	NULL
a	NULL

themselves	NULL

Philip	NULL
sent	NULL
the	NULL

for	NULL
a	NULL
bottle	NULL

him	NULL
there	NULL
before	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL

horror	NULL

then	NULL
glanced	NULL
suspiciously	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL

laughing	NULL

She	NULL
frowned	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
gave	NULL

happy	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
their	NULL
dinner	NULL

were	NULL
drinking	NULL
coffee	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
throwing	NULL
economy	NULL

the	NULL

smoked	NULL
a	NULL
three-penny	NULL
cigar	NULL

"	NULL

Mildred	NULL
smiled	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
and	NULL
faintly	NULL
flushed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
then	NULL
suffering	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
dyspepsia	NULL
which	NULL
generally	NULL
attacked	NULL
her	NULL
immediately	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
meal	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
more	NULL
kindly	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
unaccustomed	NULL
tenderness	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
joy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
instinctively	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
madness	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
only	NULL
chance	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
treat	NULL
her	NULL
casually	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
allow	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
untamed	NULL
passions	NULL
that	NULL
seethed	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
breast	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
only	NULL
take	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
weakness	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
prudent	NULL
now	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
agony	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
endured	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
separation	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
struggles	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
succeeded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
strong	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
really	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mind	NULL
suffering	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
bared	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
showed	NULL
her	NULL
proudly	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
weakness	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
pleased	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cosy	NULL
,	NULL
shabby	NULL
restaurant	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Mildred	NULL
wanted	NULL
entertainment	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
restless	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
wherever	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
wanted	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
somewhere	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
bore	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
about	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
music-hall	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
rapidly	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
she	NULL
preferred	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
thinking	NULL

,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL
on	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
waited	NULL
impatiently	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
performance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
cab	NULL
he	NULL
passed	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
almost	NULL
by	NULL
accident	NULL
,	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
waist	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
drew	NULL
it	NULL
back	NULL
quickly	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
cry	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
pricked	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
laughed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
comes	NULL
of	NULL
putting	NULL
your	NULL
arm	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL

no	NULL
business	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
always	NULL
know	NULL
when	NULL
men	NULL

put	NULL

them	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
careful	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
round	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
objection	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
so	NULL
comfortable	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
sighed	NULL
blissfully	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
So	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
retorted	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
drove	NULL
down	NULL
St.	NULL
James	NULL
'	NULL
Street	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
Park	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
quickly	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
strangely	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
required	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
courage	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
without	NULL
speaking	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
neither	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
mind	NULL
nor	NULL
to	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
only	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
long	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
murmured	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Once	NULL
is	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
kissing	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
travelled	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Herne	NULL
Hill	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
lived	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Wo	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
give	NULL
me	NULL
another	NULL
kiss	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
indifferently	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
glanced	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
sight	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
seized	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
passionately	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
pushed	NULL
him	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mind	NULL
my	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
silly	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
are	NULL
clumsy	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

LXI	NULL
He	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
then	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
lunch	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Mildred	NULL
stopped	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
talk	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
content	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
tea	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
waited	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
they	NULL
dined	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
presents	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
gold	NULL
bangle	NULL
,	NULL
gloves	NULL
,	NULL
handkerchiefs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
like	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
spending	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
afford	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
anything	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
showed	NULL
any	NULL
affection	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
price	NULL
of	NULL
everything	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
gratitude	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
exact	NULL
proportion	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
value	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
gift	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
happy	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
volunteered	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
mind	NULL
by	NULL
what	NULL
means	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
her	NULL
demonstrativeness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
Sundays	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
tedious	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Herne	NULL
Hill	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
met	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
always	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
looks	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
scrappy	NULL
meal	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
hotel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
they	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
walk	NULL
in	NULL
Brockwell	NULL
Park	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
desperately	NULL
afraid	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
bored	NULL
(	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
easily	NULL
bored	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
racked	NULL
his	NULL
brain	NULL
for	NULL
topics	NULL
of	NULL
conversation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
these	NULL
walks	NULL
amused	NULL
neither	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
to	NULL
lengthen	NULL
them	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
became	NULL
tired	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
temper	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
force	NULL
a	NULL
love	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
reason	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
nature	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
claim	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
being	NULL
exacting	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
more	NULL
intimate	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
less	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
control	NULL
his	NULL
temper	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
often	NULL
irritable	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
saying	NULL
bitter	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

Often	NULL
they	NULL
quarrelled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
always	NULL
reduced	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
subjection	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
crawled	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
showing	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
dignity	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
grew	NULL
furiously	NULL
jealous	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
speaking	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
jealous	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
beside	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
deliberately	NULL
insult	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
and	NULL
spend	NULL
afterwards	NULL
a	NULL
sleepless	NULL
night	NULL
tossing	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
turns	NULL
angry	NULL
and	NULL
remorseful	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
and	NULL
appeal	NULL
for	NULL
forgiveness	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
so	NULL
awfully	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
help	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
One	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
days	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL
go	NULL
too	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
intimacy	NULL
should	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
advantage	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
stray	NULL
acquaintances	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
during	NULL
her	NULL
working-hours	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
aunt	NULL
would	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
funny	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
suspected	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
refusal	NULL
was	NULL
due	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
disinclination	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
represented	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
widow	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
professional	NULL
man	NULL
(	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
formula	NULL
of	NULL
distinction	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
uneasily	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
woman	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
be	NULL
called	NULL
distinguished	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
the	NULL
widow	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
tradesman	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
snob	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
no	NULL
means	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
indicate	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mind	NULL
how	NULL
common	NULL
the	NULL
aunt	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
worst	NULL
quarrel	NULL
took	NULL
place	NULL
one	NULL
evening	NULL
at	NULL
dinner	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
play	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
turned	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
grew	NULL
hard	NULL
and	NULL
stern	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL

madness	NULL

go	NULL

asking	NULL
her	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL

"	NULL

But	NULL
sometimes	NULL
she	NULL
expressed	NULL
herself	NULL
more	NULL
plainly	NULL
still	NULL

and	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL

answered	NULL

he	NULL
became	NULL
sulky	NULL

silent	NULL

hated	NULL
her	NULL

now	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL

She	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL

put	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
jacket	NULL

walked	NULL
quickly	NULL
out	NULL

the	NULL
restaurant	NULL

Philip	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL

He	NULL
determined	NULL

ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
afterwards	NULL
he	NULL
jumped	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL

followed	NULL
her	NULL

He	NULL
guessed	NULL

her	NULL

escaped	NULL

went	NULL
down	NULL

He	NULL
repeated	NULL

Then	NULL

faced	NULL
him	NULL

She	NULL
walked	NULL
on	NULL

refusing	NULL

put	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL

his	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL

She	NULL
bade	NULL
him	NULL

down	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL

Next	NULL

he	NULL

her	NULL

a	NULL
little	NULL

three	NULL

four	NULL

him	NULL
his	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
excited	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL

talked	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
willingly	NULL

Philip	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL

did	NULL
so	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
pain	NULL
him	NULL

merely	NULL
because	NULL

was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

felt	NULL

he	NULL
clenched	NULL
his	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Tivoli	NULL

saw	NULL
Mildred	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL

a	NULL

hair	NULL

the	NULL

sitting	NULL

the	NULL

Mildred	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
picture	NULL
hat	NULL
with	NULL
ostrich	NULL
feathers	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
became	NULL
her	NULL
well	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
host	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
quiet	NULL
smile	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
vivacity	NULL

expression	NULL

it	NULL
required	NULL
broad	NULL

excite	NULL

but	NULL
Philip	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL

thought	NULL

himself	NULL
bitterly	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL

exactly	NULL
suited	NULL
her	NULL

Her	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL

no	NULL

his	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
inferiority	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
shy	NULL
and	NULL
awkward	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
interested	NULL
him	NULL
bored	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
expected	NULL
men	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
football	NULL
and	NULL
racing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
either	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
catchwords	NULL
which	NULL
only	NULL
need	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
excite	NULL
a	NULL
laugh	NULL
.	NULL

Printed	NULL
matter	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
fetish	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
himself	NULL
more	NULL
interesting	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
industriously	NULL
The	NULL
Sporting	NULL
Times	NULL
.	NULL

LXII	NULL
Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
surrender	NULL
himself	NULL
willingly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
passion	NULL
that	NULL
consumed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
human	NULL
are	NULL
transitory	NULL
and	NULL
therefore	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
cease	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
with	NULL
eager	NULL
longing	NULL
.	NULL

Love	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
parasite	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
nourishing	NULL
a	NULL
hateful	NULL
existence	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
's	NULL
blood	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
absorbed	NULL
his	NULL
existence	NULL
so	NULL
intensely	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
take	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
nothing	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
delight	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
grace	NULL
of	NULL
St.	NULL
James	NULL
'	NULL
Park	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
often	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
branches	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
tree	NULL
silhouetted	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
Japanese	NULL
print	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
continual	NULL
magic	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
Thames	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
barges	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
wharfs	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
changing	NULL
sky	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
had	NULL
filled	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
with	NULL
pleasant	NULL
fancies	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
beauty	NULL
meant	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
bored	NULL
and	NULL
restless	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
with	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
console	NULL
his	NULL
sorrow	NULL
by	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
pictures	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
National	NULL
Gallery	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
sight-seer	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
picture	NULL
called	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
thrill	NULL
of	NULL
emotion	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
ever	NULL
care	NULL
again	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
loved	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
devoted	NULL
to	NULL
reading	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
books	NULL
were	NULL
meaningless	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
spent	NULL
his	NULL
spare	NULL
hours	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
smoking-room	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
club	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
over	NULL
innumerable	NULL
periodicals	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
love	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
torment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
resented	NULL
bitterly	NULL
the	NULL
subjugation	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
held	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
prisoner	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
longed	NULL
for	NULL
freedom	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
awoke	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
nothing	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
leaped	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
free	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
loved	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
wide	NULL
awake	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
settled	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
cured	NULL
yet	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
he	NULL
yearned	NULL
for	NULL
Mildred	NULL
so	NULL
madly	NULL
he	NULL
despised	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
greater	NULL
torture	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
than	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
contemn	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
burrowing	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
habit	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
feelings	NULL
,	NULL
discussing	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
continually	NULL
his	NULL
condition	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
cure	NULL
himself	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
degrading	NULL
passion	NULL
by	NULL
making	NULL
Mildred	NULL
his	NULL
mistress	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
sexual	NULL
hunger	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
suffered	NULL
from	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
satisfy	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
free	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
intolerable	NULL
chains	NULL
that	NULL
bound	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Mildred	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
passionately	NULL
she	NULL
withdrew	NULL
herself	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
instinctive	NULL
distaste	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
sensuality	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
jealous	NULL
by	NULL
talking	NULL
of	NULL
adventures	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
interest	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sat	NULL
at	NULL
other	NULL
tables	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tea-shop	NULL
and	NULL
affected	NULL
to	NULL
flirt	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
waitress	NULL
who	NULL
attended	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
entirely	NULL
indifferent	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
pretence	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
part	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL
my	NULL
not	NULL
sitting	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
your	NULL
tables	NULL
this	NULL
afternoon	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
walking	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yours	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
all	NULL
full	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
contradict	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
desertion	NULL
meant	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
grateful	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
pretended	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
reproach	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
balm	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
silly	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
table	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
girls	NULL
a	NULL
turn	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
complete	NULL
surrender	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
part	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
only	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
freedom	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
knight	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
metamorphosed	NULL
by	NULL
magic	NULL
spells	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
sought	NULL
the	NULL
potions	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
restore	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
fair	NULL
and	NULL
proper	NULL
form	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
hope	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
greatly	NULL
desired	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
most	NULL
English	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
gaiety	NULL
and	NULL
fashion	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Magasin	NULL
du	NULL
Louvre	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
latest	NULL
thing	NULL
for	NULL
about	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
price	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
her	NULL
honeymoon	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Louvre	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
never	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
till	NULL
six	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
there	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
Moulin	NULL
Rouge	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
yielded	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
desires	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
only	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
unwilling	NULL
price	NULL
she	NULL
paid	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
gratification	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
wish	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
upon	NULL
what	NULL
terms	NULL
he	NULL
satisfied	NULL
his	NULL
passion	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
even	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
mad	NULL
,	NULL
melodramatic	NULL
idea	NULL
to	NULL
drug	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
plied	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
liquor	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
exciting	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
taste	NULL
for	NULL
wine	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
order	NULL
champagne	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
looked	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
drank	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
untouched	NULL

large	NULL
glass	NULL
filled	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
brim	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
shows	NULL
the	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
chose	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
usually	NULL
friendly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
examination	NULL
in	NULL
anatomy	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
March	NULL
.	NULL

Easter	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
Mildred	NULL
three	NULL
whole	NULL
days	NULL
holiday	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
come	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
suggested	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
'd	NULL

a	NULL

time	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL

you	NULL

It	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
cost	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
five-and-twenty	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
sum	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
penny	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
does	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
next	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL

such	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
does	NULL
it	NULL
matter	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
enlarged	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
glories	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Rue	NULL
de	NULL
la	NULL
Paix	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
garish	NULL
splendour	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Folies	NULL
Bergeres	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
described	NULL
the	NULL
Louvre	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Bon	NULL
Marche	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
Cabaret	NULL

the	NULL
Abbaye	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL

He	NULL
painted	NULL
in	NULL
glowing	NULL
colours	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
Paris	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
despised	NULL

He	NULL
pressed	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
marriage	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
shrank	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
Paris	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
opinion	NULL
that	NULL
marriage	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
ridiculous	NULL
institution	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
philistines	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
permanent	NULL
tie	NULL
would	NULL
ruin	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
middle-class	NULL
instincts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
dreadful	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
a	NULL
waitress	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
common	NULL
wife	NULL
would	NULL
prevent	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
getting	NULL
a	NULL
decent	NULL
practice	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
just	NULL
enough	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
last	NULL
him	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
qualified	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
keep	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
arranged	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
vulgar	NULL
slattern	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
shuddered	NULL
with	NULL
dismay	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
foresaw	NULL
what	NULL
Mildred	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
genteel	NULL
ideas	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
mean	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
become	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
decided	NULL
only	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
reason	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
her	NULL
whatever	NULL
happened	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
her	NULL
without	NULL
marrying	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
could	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
might	NULL
end	NULL
in	NULL
disaster	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
it	NULL
obsessed	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
else	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
common	NULL
power	NULL
to	NULL
persuade	NULL
himself	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
reasonableness	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
overthrowing	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
sensible	NULL
arguments	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
against	NULL
marriage	NULL

Each	NULL

he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL

LXIII	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL
pass	NULL
the	NULL
examination	NULL
in	NULL
anatomy	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
March	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
and	NULL
Dunsford	NULL
had	NULL
worked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
together	NULL
on	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
skeleton	NULL
,	NULL
asking	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
questions	NULL
till	NULL
both	NULL
knew	NULL
by	NULL
heart	NULL
every	NULL
attachment	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
meaning	NULL
of	NULL
every	NULL
nodule	NULL
and	NULL
groove	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
human	NULL
bones	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
examination	NULL
room	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
seized	NULL
with	NULL
panic	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
failed	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
right	NULL
answers	NULL
to	NULL
questions	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
fear	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
wrong	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ploughed	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
building	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
whether	NULL
his	NULL
number	NULL
was	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
second	NULL
failure	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
definitely	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
incompetent	NULL
and	NULL
idle	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
Mildred	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
senses	NULL
like	NULL
anybody	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
awakening	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
theories	NULL
about	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
rip	NULL
at	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
must	NULL
come	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
with	NULL
everyone	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
yield	NULL
to	NULL
persistence	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
watching	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
,	NULL
keeping	NULL
his	NULL
temper	NULL
,	NULL
wearing	NULL
her	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
small	NULL
attentions	NULL
,	NULL
taking	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
physical	NULL
exhaustion	NULL
which	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
to	NULL
tenderness	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
refuge	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
petty	NULL
vexations	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
relations	NULL
between	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fair	NULL
ladies	NULL
they	NULL
admired	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
life	NULL
he	NULL
described	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
charm	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
easy	NULL
gaiety	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
grossness	NULL
.	NULL

Weaving	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
recollections	NULL
the	NULL
adventures	NULL
of	NULL
Mimi	NULL
and	NULL
Rodolphe	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
Musette	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
poured	NULL
into	NULL
Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
ears	NULL
a	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
poverty	NULL
made	NULL
picturesque	NULL
by	NULL
song	NULL
and	NULL
laughter	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
lawless	NULL
love	NULL
made	NULL
romantic	NULL
by	NULL
beauty	NULL
and	NULL
youth	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
attacked	NULL
her	NULL
prejudices	NULL
directly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
sought	NULL
to	NULL
combat	NULL
them	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
suggestion	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
suburban	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
let	NULL
himself	NULL
be	NULL
disturbed	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
inattention	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
irritated	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
indifference	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bored	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
himself	NULL
affable	NULL
and	NULL
entertaining	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
let	NULL
himself	NULL
be	NULL
angry	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
complained	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
scolded	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
engagements	NULL
and	NULL
broke	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
her	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smiling	NULL
face	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
excused	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
pained	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
understood	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
passionate	NULL
grief	NULL
had	NULL
wearied	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
care	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
every	NULL
sentiment	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
degree	NULL
troublesome	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
heroic	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
mentioned	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
any	NULL
conscious	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
affected	NULL
her	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
became	NULL
more	NULL
confidential	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
grievances	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
always	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
grievance	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
manageress	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
fellow	NULL
waitresses	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
talkative	NULL
enough	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
said	NULL
anything	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
trivial	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

she	NULL
told	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
's	NULL

he	NULL
laughed	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
realise	NULL
how	NULL
her	NULL
words	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
sink	NULL
nor	NULL
what	NULL
an	NULL

it	NULL
needed	NULL

him	NULL

him	NULL
with	NULL
rapture	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

it	NULL
to	NULL
anyone	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
apology	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
give	NULL
me	NULL
greater	NULL
pleasure	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
smiled	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
one	NULL
evening	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
April	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Where	NULL
would	NULL
you	NULL

go	NULL
afterwards	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

n't	NULL

do	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Rather	NULL
not	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Three	NULL
months	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
evening	NULL
spent	NULL
in	NULL
conversation	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
bored	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
death	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
high	NULL
spirits	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
content	NULL
with	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL

wo	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL

ripping	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL

along	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
drove	NULL
along	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
'	NULL
bus	NULL
to	NULL
Soho	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
herself	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL

so	NULL
extravagant	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
by	NULL
cab	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
smiled	NULL
slightly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
encouraged	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
withdraw	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
really	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
old	NULL
customers	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
restaurant	NULL
in	NULL
Soho	NULL
by	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
patronne	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
waiter	NULL
was	NULL
obsequious	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
me	NULL
order	NULL
the	NULL
dinner	NULL

said	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
her	NULL
more	NULL
enchanting	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
menu	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
chose	NULL
her	NULL
favourite	NULL
dishes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
range	NULL
was	NULL
small	NULL

and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
eaten	NULL
many	NULL
times	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
restaurant	NULL
could	NULL
provide	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
gay	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
dwelt	NULL
on	NULL
every	NULL
perfection	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
pale	NULL
cheek	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
Mildred	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
exception	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
cigarette	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
smoked	NULL
very	NULL
seldom	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
hesitated	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
spoke	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Were	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
sank	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
trained	NULL
himself	NULL
well	NULL

said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL

nothing	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
considered	NULL
the	NULL

imagined	NULL

himself	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
agonies	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
despair	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
suffer	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL

the	NULL

passion	NULL

anger	NULL
that	NULL

seize	NULL
him	NULL

perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
too	NULL
completely	NULL
anticipated	NULL
the	NULL
emotion	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
experience	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
merely	NULL
exhausted	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
does	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
serious	NULL
illness	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
vitality	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
low	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
is	NULL
indifferent	NULL

the	NULL

left	NULL
alone	NULL

"	NULL

I	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
patronne	NULL
sitting	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
counter	NULL

his	NULL

remembered	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
tired	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
straight	NULL

called	NULL

He	NULL
nodded	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

forced	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
jumped	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
'	NULL
bus	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
smoked	NULL
a	NULL
pipe	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
keep	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
open	NULL

He	NULL
suffered	NULL
no	NULL
pain	NULL

He	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
sleep	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
touched	NULL
the	NULL
pillow	NULL
.	NULL

LXIV	NULL
But	NULL
about	NULL
three	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
Philip	NULL
awoke	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
sleep	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
repeated	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
thing	NULL
time	NULL
after	NULL
time	NULL
till	NULL
his	NULL
brain	NULL
reeled	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
inevitable	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
marry	NULL
:	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
hard	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
earn	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
living	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
someone	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
comfortable	NULL
home	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
blamed	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
accepted	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
acknowledged	NULL
that	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
madness	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
only	NULL
love	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
such	NULL
poverty	NULL
bearable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
love	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
fault	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
accepted	NULL
like	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
reason	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
deep	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
mortified	NULL
pride	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
passion	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
in	NULL
wounded	NULL
vanity	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
at	NULL
bottom	NULL
which	NULL
caused	NULL
now	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wretchedness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
despised	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
despised	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
plans	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
plans	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
interrupted	NULL
by	NULL
recollections	NULL
of	NULL
kisses	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
soft	NULL
pale	NULL
cheek	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
trailing	NULL
accent	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
taking	NULL
chemistry	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
examinations	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
failed	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
separated	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
companionship	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
happy	NULL
occurrence	NULL
:	NULL
Hayward	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
before	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
passing	NULL
through	NULL
London	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
unwilling	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
bothered	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
refused	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
back	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
thankful	NULL
when	NULL
eight	NULL
o'clock	NULL
struck	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
pale	NULL
and	NULL
weary	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bathed	NULL
,	NULL
dressed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
breakfast	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
joined	NULL
up	NULL
again	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
at	NULL
large	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
pain	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
easier	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
like	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
lectures	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
went	NULL
instead	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Army	NULL
and	NULL
Navy	NULL
Stores	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
Mildred	NULL
a	NULL
wedding-present	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
much	NULL
wavering	NULL
he	NULL
settled	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
dressing-bag	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
cost	NULL
twenty	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
afford	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
showy	NULL
and	NULL
vulgar	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
aware	NULL
exactly	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
it	NULL
cost	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
melancholy	NULL

the	NULL

had	NULL
for	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
with	NULL
apprehension	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
married	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
expecting	NULL
an	NULL
intolerable	NULL
anguish	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
relief	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
Hayward	NULL
on	NULL
Saturday	NULL
morning	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
up	NULL
early	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
fetch	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
rooms	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
distracted	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
time-table	NULL
and	NULL
discovered	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
train	NULL
Hayward	NULL
was	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
by	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
reunion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
friends	NULL
was	NULL
enthusiastic	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
luggage	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
set	NULL
off	NULL
gaily	NULL
.	NULL

Hayward	NULL
characteristically	NULL
proposed	NULL
that	NULL
first	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
National	NULL
Gallery	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
pictures	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
stated	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
needed	NULL
a	NULL
glimpse	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
tune	NULL
with	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
for	NULL
months	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL
and	NULL
books	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
the	NULL
Paris	NULL
days	NULL
Hayward	NULL
had	NULL
immersed	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
modern	NULL
French	NULL
versifiers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
plethora	NULL
of	NULL
poets	NULL
is	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
France	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
several	NULL
new	NULL
geniuses	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
Philip	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
walked	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
gallery	NULL
pointing	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
their	NULL
favourite	NULL
pictures	NULL
;	NULL
one	NULL
subject	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
another	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
talked	NULL
excitedly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
shining	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
was	NULL
warm	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
's	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
sit	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Park	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Hayward	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
'll	NULL
look	NULL
for	NULL
rooms	NULL
after	NULL
luncheon	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
spring	NULL
was	NULL
pleasant	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
one	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
good	NULL
merely	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
young	NULL
green	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
was	NULL
exquisite	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
,	NULL
pale	NULL
and	NULL
blue	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
dappled	NULL
with	NULL
little	NULL
white	NULL
clouds	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ornamental	NULL
water	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Horse	NULL
Guards	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
ordered	NULL
elegance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
charm	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
eighteenth-century	NULL
picture	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
reminded	NULL
you	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
Watteau	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
landscapes	NULL
are	NULL
so	NULL
idyllic	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
recall	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
woodland	NULL
glens	NULL
seen	NULL
in	NULL
dreams	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
prosaic	NULL
Jean-Baptiste	NULL
Pater	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
lightness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
realised	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
read	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
art	NULL
(	NULL
for	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
art	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
manner	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
nature	NULL
)	NULL
might	NULL
liberate	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
from	NULL
pain	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
Italian	NULL
restaurant	NULL
for	NULL
luncheon	NULL
and	NULL
ordered	NULL
themselves	NULL
a	NULL
fiaschetto	NULL
of	NULL
Chianti	NULL
.	NULL

Lingering	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
meal	NULL
they	NULL
talked	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
reminded	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
at	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
friends	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
pictures	NULL
,	NULL
morals	NULL
,	NULL
life	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
suddenly	NULL
Philip	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
clock	NULL
strike	NULL
three	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
married	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
stitch	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
hear	NULL
what	NULL
Hayward	NULL
was	NULL
saying	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
filled	NULL
his	NULL
glass	NULL
with	NULL
Chianti	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
unaccustomed	NULL
to	NULL
alcohol	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
events	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
care	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
quick	NULL
brain	NULL
had	NULL
lain	NULL
idle	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
months	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
intoxicated	NULL
now	NULL
with	NULL
conversation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
thankful	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
someone	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
interest	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
interested	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
let	NULL
's	NULL
waste	NULL
this	NULL
beautiful	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
looking	NULL
for	NULL
rooms	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
put	NULL
you	NULL
up	NULL
tonight	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
can	NULL
look	NULL
for	NULL
rooms	NULL
tomorrow	NULL
or	NULL
Monday	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
shall	NULL
we	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

answered	NULL
Hayward	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
's	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
penny	NULL
steamboat	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Greenwich	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
idea	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
Hayward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
jumped	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
cab	NULL
which	NULL
took	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
Westminster	NULL
Bridge	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
steamboat	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
starting	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
spoke	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
when	NULL
first	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
Clutton	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
discourse	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
that	NULL
beauty	NULL
is	NULL
put	NULL
into	NULL
things	NULL
by	NULL
painters	NULL
and	NULL
poets	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
create	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
themselves	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
choose	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
Campanile	NULL
of	NULL
Giotto	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
factory	NULL
chimney	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
beautiful	NULL
things	NULL
grow	NULL
rich	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
emotion	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
aroused	NULL
in	NULL
succeeding	NULL
generations	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
is	NULL
why	NULL
old	NULL
things	NULL
are	NULL
more	NULL
beautiful	NULL
than	NULL
modern	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Ode	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
Grecian	NULL
Urn	NULL
is	NULL
more	NULL
lovely	NULL
now	NULL
than	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL

written	NULL

because	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
years	NULL
lovers	NULL

read	NULL
it	NULL

the	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
left	NULL
Hayward	NULL
to	NULL
infer	NULL
what	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
passing	NULL
scene	NULL
had	NULL
suggested	NULL
these	NULL
words	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
delight	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
safely	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
inference	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
sudden	NULL
reaction	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
leading	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
deeply	NULL
affected	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
delicate	NULL
iridescence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
London	NULL
air	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
softness	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
pastel	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
buildings	NULL

They	NULL
went	NULL
further	NULL

the	NULL

a	NULL

the	NULL

broadened	NULL

it	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL

had	NULL
made	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
so	NULL
beautiful	NULL

his	NULL

filled	NULL

came	NULL
to	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
back	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL

with	NULL
disgust	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
submitted	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dishonour	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Mildred	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
angry	NULL
hatred	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
submitted	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
humiliation	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
imagination	NULL
presented	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
defects	NULL
of	NULL
person	NULL
and	NULL
manner	NULL
exaggerated	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
shuddered	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
connected	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
just	NULL
shows	NULL
how	NULL
damned	NULL
weak	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
adventure	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
blunder	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
committed	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
party	NULL
so	NULL
horrible	NULL

nothing	NULL

be	NULL
done	NULL

it	NULL

the	NULL

to	NULL

His	NULL
horror	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
degradation	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
helped	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
snake	NULL
casting	NULL
its	NULL
skin	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
covering	NULL
with	NULL
nausea	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
exulted	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
realised	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
delight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
absorbed	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
madness	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
called	NULL
love	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
enough	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL

he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL

be	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
if	NULL
love	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
told	NULL
Hayward	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
through	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Was	NULL
n't	NULL

Philip	NULL
seemed	NULL
really	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
born	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
breathed	NULL
the	NULL
circumambient	NULL
air	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
breathed	NULL
it	NULL
before	NULL

he	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
's	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL

facts	NULL

He	NULL
called	NULL
his	NULL
period	NULL

insanity	NULL
six	NULL

Hayward	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
been	NULL
settled	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
received	NULL
from	NULL
Blackstable	NULL

where	NULL
it	NULL

sent	NULL

a	NULL
card	NULL
for	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
Hayward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
catalogue	NULL
,	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
Lawson	NULL

a	NULL

it	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

he	NULL
sent	NULL

Philip	NULL

This	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
profile	NULL
of	NULL
Ruth	NULL
Chalice	NULL

was	NULL
tucked	NULL
away	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
corner	NULL

and	NULL
Lawson	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
lost	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
large	NULL
soft	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
loose	NULL

pale	NULL

,	NULL
amongst	NULL
the	NULL
fashionable	NULL
throng	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL

the	NULL

He	NULL
greeted	NULL
Philip	NULL
with	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
volubility	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL

come	NULL

live	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL

Ruth	NULL
Chalice	NULL

out	NULL

he	NULL

a	NULL

they	NULL
'd	NULL
better	NULL
dine	NULL
together	NULL

have	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL

talk	NULL

Philip	NULL
reminded	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
with	NULL
Hayward	NULL

and	NULL
was	NULL
entertained	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL

was	NULL
slightly	NULL
awed	NULL
by	NULL
Hayward	NULL
's	NULL
elegant	NULL
clothes	NULL

grand	NULL
manner	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shabby	NULL
little	NULL
studio	NULL
which	NULL
Lawson	NULL

Philip	NULL

At	NULL
dinner	NULL
Lawson	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
news	NULL
.	NULL

Flanagan	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
America	NULL
.	NULL

Clutton	NULL
had	NULL
disappeared	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
anything	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
contact	NULL
with	NULL
art	NULL
and	NULL
artists	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
right	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
step	NULL
easier	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
quarrelled	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
developed	NULL
a	NULL
talent	NULL
for	NULL
telling	NULL
them	NULL
home	NULL
truths	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
them	NULL
bear	NULL
with	NULL
fortitude	NULL
his	NULL
declaration	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
city	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
settling	NULL
in	NULL
Gerona	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
town	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
north	NULL
of	NULL
Spain	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
attracted	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
Barcelona	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
living	NULL
there	NULL
now	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wonder	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
'll	NULL
ever	NULL
do	NULL
any	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
human	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
struggle	NULL
to	NULL
express	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
obscure	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
become	NULL
morbid	NULL
and	NULL
querulous	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
vaguely	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
conduct	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
whole	NULL
that	NULL
perplexed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
self-expression	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
clear	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
continue	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
train	NULL
of	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Lawson	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
frank	NULL
recital	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
affair	NULL
with	NULL
Ruth	NULL
Chalice	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
student	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
England	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
behaving	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
scandalous	NULL
fashion	NULL
.	NULL

Lawson	NULL
really	NULL
thought	NULL
someone	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
step	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
save	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
ruin	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
gathered	NULL
that	NULL
Lawson	NULL
's	NULL
chief	NULL
grievance	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
rupture	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
portrait	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
painting	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Women	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
real	NULL
feeling	NULL
for	NULL
art	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
only	NULL
pretend	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
finished	NULL
philosophically	NULL
enough	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
However	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
four	NULL
portraits	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
sure	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL

ever	NULL

Philip	NULL
envied	NULL
the	NULL
easy	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
painter	NULL
managed	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
affairs	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
eighteen	NULL
months	NULL
pleasantly	NULL
enough	NULL

had	NULL
got	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
model	NULL
for	NULL
nothing	NULL

had	NULL
parted	NULL

her	NULL
at	NULL

with	NULL
no	NULL

And	NULL
what	NULL
about	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

's	NULL
done	NULL

He	NULL
'll	NULL

abstemious	NULL
Philip	NULL

kept	NULL
off	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL

him	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

he	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
himself	NULL

A	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
ago	NULL
he	NULL
started	NULL
on	NULL
whiskey	NULL
again	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL

luncheon-party	NULL
one	NULL
Sunday	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
brought	NULL
a	NULL
chaperon	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
fourth	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
instructed	NULL
to	NULL
confine	NULL
his	NULL
attentions	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
this	NULL
easy	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
an	NULL
agreeable	NULL
chatterbox	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
amusing	NULL
tongue	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
rooms	NULL
in	NULL
Vincent	NULL
Square	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
tea	NULL
at	NULL
five	NULL
o'clock	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
delighted	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
welcome	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Nesbit	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
twenty-five	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
small	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
,	NULL
ugly	NULL
face	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
very	NULL
bright	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
high	NULL
cheekbones	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
mouth	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
excessive	NULL
contrasts	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
colouring	NULL
reminded	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
portrait	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
modern	NULL
French	NULL
painters	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
skin	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
red	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
thick	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
black	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
effect	NULL
was	NULL
odd	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
unnatural	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
unpleasing	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
separated	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
and	NULL
earned	NULL
her	NULL
living	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
child	NULL
's	NULL
by	NULL
writing	NULL
penny	NULL
novelettes	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
publishers	NULL
who	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
specialty	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
work	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
ill-paid	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
received	NULL
fifteen	NULL
pounds	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
thirty	NULL
thousand	NULL
words	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
satisfied	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
After	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
only	NULL
costs	NULL
the	NULL
reader	NULL
twopence	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
thing	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
just	NULL
change	NULL
the	NULL
names	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
bored	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
washing	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rent	NULL
and	NULL
clothes	NULL
for	NULL
baby	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
on	NULL
at	NULL
various	NULL
theatres	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
wanted	NULL
supers	NULL
and	NULL
earned	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
when	NULL
in	NULL
work	NULL
from	NULL
sixteen	NULL
shillings	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
guinea	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
day	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
tired	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
slept	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
top	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
difficult	NULL
lot	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
keen	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
humour	NULL
enabled	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
amusement	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
every	NULL
vexatious	NULL
circumstance	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
things	NULL
went	NULL
wrong	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
money	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
her	NULL
trifling	NULL
possessions	NULL
found	NULL
their	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
pawnshop	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Vauxhall	NULL
Bridge	NULL
Road	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
ate	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
till	NULL
things	NULL
grew	NULL
brighter	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
never	NULL
lost	NULL
her	NULL
cheerfulness	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
shiftless	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
laugh	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
fantastic	NULL
narration	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
struggles	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
try	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
at	NULL
literary	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
sort	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
talent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
abominable	NULL
stuff	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
thousand	NULL
words	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
tolerably	NULL
paid	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
continuation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
she	NULL
led	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
relations	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
poor	NULL
as	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
As	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
enough	NULL
money	NULL
for	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
'	NULL
rent	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
pound	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
over	NULL
for	NULL
food	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
bother	NULL
.	NULL

Life	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
worth	NULL
living	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
worried	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
things	NULL
are	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
worst	NULL
I	NULL
find	NULL
something	NULL
always	NULL
happens	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Soon	NULL
Philip	NULL
grew	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
tea	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
visits	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
embarrass	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cake	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
pound	NULL
of	NULL
butter	NULL
or	NULL
some	NULL
tea	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
Christian	NULL
names	NULL
.	NULL

Feminine	NULL
sympathy	NULL
was	NULL
new	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
delighted	NULL
in	NULL
someone	NULL
who	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
willing	NULL
ear	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
troubles	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hours	NULL
went	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
hide	NULL
his	NULL
admiration	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
delightful	NULL
companion	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
comparing	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
Mildred	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
contrasted	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
obstinate	NULL
stupidity	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
refused	NULL
interest	NULL
to	NULL
everything	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
's	NULL
quick	NULL
appreciation	NULL
and	NULL
ready	NULL
intelligence	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
sank	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
tied	NULL
for	NULL
life	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
as	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
evening	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
Norah	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
much	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
self-esteem	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
such	NULL
charming	NULL
sympathy	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
well	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
funny	NULL
way	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
of	NULL
holding	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
Aberdeen	NULL
puppy	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
upright	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
sewing	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
himself	NULL
comfortable	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
how	NULL
heartily	NULL
thankful	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
sighed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Poor	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
rotten	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
murmured	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
showing	NULL
her	NULL
sympathy	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
shoulder	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
withdrew	NULL
it	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
blush	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Have	NULL
you	NULL
any	NULL
objection	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
with	NULL
twinkling	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
smiled	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
and	NULL
faced	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
steadily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
large	NULL
mouth	NULL
trembled	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
a	NULL
ripper	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL
so	NULL
grateful	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
for	NULL
being	NULL

I	NULL

you	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
idiotic	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
took	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
elbows	NULL
and	NULL
drew	NULL
her	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
resistance	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
bent	NULL
forward	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
red	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Because	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
comfortable	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
tender	NULL
look	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
passed	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
softly	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
awfully	NULL
silly	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL

this	NULL

We	NULL
were	NULL
such	NULL
good	NULL
friends	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
jolly	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
really	NULL
want	NULL

replied	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL

stroke	NULL
my	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
chuckle	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
stop	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
surprised	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
amused	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
them	NULL
soften	NULL
and	NULL
grow	NULL
liquid	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
expression	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
enchanted	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
suddenly	NULL
stirred	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tears	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Norah	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
not	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
,	NULL
incredulously	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
clever	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
ask	NULL
such	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

my	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
never	NULL

He	NULL
flung	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
laughing	NULL
,	NULL
blushing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
crying	NULL
,	NULL
surrendered	NULL
herself	NULL
willingly	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
embrace	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
he	NULL
released	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
sitting	NULL
back	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
heels	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
curiously	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL
blowed	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
so	NULL
surprised	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

pleased	NULL

"	NULL
Delighted	NULL

he	NULL
cried	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
proud	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
happy	NULL

so	NULL
grateful	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
covered	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
kisses	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
for	NULL
Philip	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
happiness	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
both	NULL
solid	NULL
and	NULL
durable	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
became	NULL
lovers	NULL
but	NULL
remained	NULL
friends	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
Norah	NULL
a	NULL
maternal	NULL
instinct	NULL
which	NULL
received	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
Philip	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
someone	NULL
to	NULL
pet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
scold	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
fuss	NULL
of	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
domestic	NULL
temperament	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
looking	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
health	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
linen	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
pitied	NULL
his	NULL
deformity	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
sensitive	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
pity	NULL
expressed	NULL
itself	NULL
instinctively	NULL
in	NULL
tenderness	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
strong	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
healthy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
quite	NULL
natural	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
high	NULL
spirits	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
merry	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
liked	NULL
Philip	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
laughed	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
amusing	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
that	NULL
caught	NULL
her	NULL
fancy	NULL

and	NULL
above	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
gaily	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Nonsense	NULL

You	NULL
like	NULL
me	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
love	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
extremely	NULL
fond	NULL

her	NULL

glad	NULL

with	NULL
her	NULL

amused	NULL

She	NULL
restored	NULL
his	NULL
belief	NULL

himself	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
feminine	NULL
gift	NULL
for	NULL
delicate	NULL
flattery	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
did	NULL
a	NULL
brave	NULL
thing	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
Paris	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
artist	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
enchanted	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
expressed	NULL
enthusiastic	NULL
admiration	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
quite	NULL
certain	NULL
whether	NULL
this	NULL
action	NULL
indicated	NULL
courage	NULL
or	NULL
infirmity	NULL

purpose	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
delightful	NULL
to	NULL
realise	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
considered	NULL
it	NULL
heroic	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
ventured	NULL
to	NULL
tackle	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
subject	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
instinctively	NULL
avoided	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL

she	NULL

blush	NULL
darkly	NULL

went	NULL
on	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
in	NULL
other	NULL
ways	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL

him	NULL

laughed	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL

out	NULL

him	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
to	NULL
realise	NULL
his	NULL
happiness	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
preserved	NULL
his	NULL
freedom	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
charming	NULL
friend	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sympathy	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
found	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL

The	NULL
sexual	NULL
relationship	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
strongest	NULL
link	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
friendship	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
completed	NULL
it	NULL

but	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
essential	NULL

And	NULL
because	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL

satisfied	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
more	NULL
equable	NULL
and	NULL
easier	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
in	NULL
complete	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
sometimes	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
obsessed	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
hideous	NULL
passion	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
loathing	NULL
for	NULL
Mildred	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
horror	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL

His	NULL
examinations	NULL
were	NULL
approaching	NULL

and	NULL
Norah	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
interested	NULL

them	NULL
as	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
flattered	NULL

touched	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
eagerness	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
promise	NULL

He	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL

her	NULL
she	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
tears	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
laughed	NULL

put	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL

looked	NULL

LXVII	NULL
Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
with	NULL
impatience	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
months	NULL
he	NULL
spent	NULL
at	NULL
Blackstable	NULL

wrote	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
frequently	NULL

a	NULL
bold	NULL
,	NULL
large	NULL
hand	NULL

in	NULL
which	NULL
with	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
walking	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
important	NULL
spectacle	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
London	NULL
theatres	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
odd	NULL
adventures	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
publishers	NULL
of	NULL
novelettes	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
read	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
,	NULL
bathed	NULL
,	NULL
played	NULL
tennis	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sailed	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
October	NULL
he	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Second	NULL
Conjoint	NULL
examination	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
eager	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
it	NULL

since	NULL
that	NULL
ended	NULL
the	NULL
drudgery	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
curriculum	NULL

after	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
student	NULL
became	NULL
an	NULL

was	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL

text-books	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
Norah	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Lawson	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
spending	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
at	NULL
Poole	NULL

and	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
sketches	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
harbour	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
beach	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
commissions	NULL

portraits	NULL

proposed	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
bad	NULL
light	NULL
drove	NULL
him	NULL
away	NULL

Hayward	NULL

in	NULL
London	NULL
too	NULL

intended	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
abroad	NULL

remained	NULL
week	NULL
after	NULL
week	NULL
from	NULL
sheer	NULL
inability	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL

Hayward	NULL
had	NULL
run	NULL
to	NULL
fat	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
since	NULL
Philip	NULL
first	NULL
met	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
prematurely	NULL
bald	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
sensitive	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
wore	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
long	NULL
to	NULL
conceal	NULL
the	NULL
unsightly	NULL
patch	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
crown	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
only	NULL
consolation	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
brow	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
very	NULL
noble	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
their	NULL
colour	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
listless	NULL
droop	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
losing	NULL
the	NULL
fulness	NULL
of	NULL
youth	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
weak	NULL
and	NULL
pale	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
still	NULL
talked	NULL
vaguely	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
less	NULL
conviction	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
drank	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
glasses	NULL
of	NULL
whiskey	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
elegiac	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
a	NULL
failure	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
murmured	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
unfit	NULL

the	NULL
brutality	NULL

All	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL

to	NULL

let	NULL
the	NULL
vulgar	NULL
throng	NULL
hustle	NULL
by	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
pursuit	NULL

good	NULL
things	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
gave	NULL
you	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
fail	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
delicate	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
exquisite	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
succeed	NULL

He	NULL
insinuated	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
aloofness	NULL
was	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
distaste	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
common	NULL

low	NULL

talked	NULL
beautifully	NULL

Philip	NULL

Hayward	NULL

Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
Hayward	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
by	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
weak	NULL
and	NULL
vain	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
vain	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
watch	NULL
constantly	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
hurt	NULL
his	NULL
feelings	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
mingled	NULL
idleness	NULL
and	NULL
idealism	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
separate	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
Lawson	NULL
's	NULL
studio	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
a	NULL
journalist	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
charmed	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
conversation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
later	NULL
the	NULL
editor	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
paper	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
suggest	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
do	NULL
some	NULL
criticism	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
forty-eight	NULL
hours	NULL
Hayward	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
agony	NULL
of	NULL
indecision	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
occupation	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
sort	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
to	NULL
refuse	NULL
outright	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
anything	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
panic	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
declined	NULL
the	NULL
offer	NULL
and	NULL
breathed	NULL
freely	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
interfered	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL

"	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
brutally	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
beautiful	NULL
things	NULL
about	NULL
Amiel	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
professor	NULL
of	NULL
Geneva	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
brilliancy	NULL
promised	NULL
achievement	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
fulfilled	NULL

till	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
death	NULL
the	NULL
reason	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
failure	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
excuse	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
manifest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
wonderful	NULL
journal	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
found	NULL
among	NULL
his	NULL
papers	NULL
.	NULL

Hayward	NULL
smiled	NULL
enigmatically	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Hayward	NULL
could	NULL
still	NULL
talk	NULL
delightfully	NULL
about	NULL
books	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
taste	NULL
was	NULL
exquisite	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
discrimination	NULL
elegant	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
constant	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
ideas	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
entertaining	NULL
companion	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
meant	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
really	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
they	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
effect	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
treated	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
pieces	NULL
of	NULL
china	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
auction-room	NULL
,	NULL
handling	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
pleasure	NULL

their	NULL

pricing	NULL
them	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
putting	NULL
them	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
their	NULL

thought	NULL

them	NULL
no	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Hayward	NULL
who	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
momentous	NULL
discovery	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
due	NULL

he	NULL
took	NULL
Philip	NULL

Lawson	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
tavern	NULL
situated	NULL
in	NULL
Beak	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
remarkable	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
itself	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL
history	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
memories	NULL

glories	NULL
which	NULL
excited	NULL

imagination	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL
snuff	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
above	NULL
all	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL
punch	NULL
.	NULL

Hayward	NULL
led	NULL
them	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL

long	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
dingily	NULL
magnificent	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
huge	NULL
pictures	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL

they	NULL
were	NULL
vast	NULL
allegories	NULL

the	NULL
school	NULL
of	NULL
Haydon	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
smoke	NULL
,	NULL
gas	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
London	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
richness	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
them	NULL
look	NULL

The	NULL

the	NULL

ordered	NULL

They	NULL
drank	NULL
it	NULL

Hayward	NULL
discovered	NULL
the	NULL
tavern	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
this	NULL
priceless	NULL
beverage	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
obtained	NULL
by	NULL
meeting	NULL
in	NULL

street	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
called	NULL
Macalister	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
stockbroker	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
philosopher	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tavern	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
Lawson	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Hayward	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
meeting	NULL
there	NULL
every	NULL
Tuesday	NULL
evening	NULL
:	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
manners	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
now	NULL
little	NULL
frequented	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
advantage	NULL
to	NULL
persons	NULL
who	NULL
took	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
conversation	NULL
.	NULL

Macalister	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
big-boned	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
too	NULL
short	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
width	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
,	NULL
fleshy	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
soft	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
student	NULL
of	NULL
Kant	NULL
and	NULL
judged	NULL
everything	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
standpoint	NULL
of	NULL
pure	NULL
reason	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
expounding	NULL
his	NULL
doctrines	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
listened	NULL
with	NULL
excited	NULL
interest	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
amused	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
metaphysics	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
sure	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
efficacy	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
affairs	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
neat	NULL
little	NULL
system	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
formed	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
meditations	NULL
at	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
of	NULL
conspicuous	NULL
use	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
infatuation	NULL
for	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
positive	NULL
that	NULL
reason	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
help	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
conduct	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
life	NULL
lived	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
very	NULL
vividly	NULL
the	NULL
violence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
emotion	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
possessed	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
inability	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
tied	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
with	NULL
ropes	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
react	NULL
against	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
read	NULL
many	NULL
wise	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
judge	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
experience	NULL
(	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
)	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
calculate	NULL
the	NULL
pros	NULL
and	NULL
cons	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
action	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
benefits	NULL
which	NULL
must	NULL
befall	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
harm	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
result	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
omission	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
whole	NULL
being	NULL
was	NULL
urged	NULL
on	NULL
irresistibly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
act	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
but	NULL
altogether	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
power	NULL
that	NULL
possessed	NULL
him	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
reason	NULL
:	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
reason	NULL
did	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
point	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
methods	NULL
of	NULL
obtaining	NULL
what	NULL
his	NULL
whole	NULL
soul	NULL
was	NULL
striving	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

Macalister	NULL
reminded	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Categorical	NULL
Imperative	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Act	NULL

remembered	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
chafed	NULL
against	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
degradation	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Thank	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
even	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
sure	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
sincerely	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
influence	NULL
of	NULL
passion	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
singular	NULL
vigour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
had	NULL
worked	NULL
with	NULL
unwonted	NULL
force	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
alive	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
excitement	NULL
in	NULL
sheer	NULL
being	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
eager	NULL
vehemence	NULL
of	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
life	NULL
now	NULL
a	NULL
trifle	NULL
dull	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
misery	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
endured	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
compensation	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
rushing	NULL
,	NULL
overwhelming	NULL
existence	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
unlucky	NULL
words	NULL
engaged	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
discussion	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
freedom	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Macalister	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
well-stored	NULL
memory	NULL
,	NULL
brought	NULL
out	NULL
argument	NULL
after	NULL
argument	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
delighted	NULL
in	NULL
dialectics	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
forced	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
contradict	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
pushed	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
corners	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
escape	NULL
by	NULL
damaging	NULL
concessions	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
tripped	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
logic	NULL
and	NULL
battered	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
authorities	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
Philip	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
say	NULL
anything	NULL

can	NULL
only	NULL

The	NULL
illusion	NULL

so	NULL
strong	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL

I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL

I	NULL

an	NULL

LXVIII	NULL
One	NULL
morning	NULL
Philip	NULL
on	NULL
getting	NULL
up	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
swim	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
going	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
suddenly	NULL
discovered	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ill	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
his	NULL
limbs	NULL
ached	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
shivered	NULL
with	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
landlady	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
breakfast	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
door	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
tea	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
toast	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
later	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
knock	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
house	NULL
for	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
done	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
nod	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
hear	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
seedy	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL

see	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL

with	NULL
you	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
blushing	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
'd	NULL
better	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
take	NULL
your	NULL
temperature	NULL

said	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
quite	NULL
unnecessary	NULL

"	NULL
answered	NULL
Philip	NULL
irritably	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
thermometer	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
.	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
chatted	NULL
brightly	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
,	NULL
look	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Nonsense	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
's	NULL
nothing	NULL
the	NULL

I	NULL
wish	NULL

about	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
it	NULL

n't	NULL
any	NULL

You	NULL

wo	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
charm	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
mingling	NULL
of	NULL
gravity	NULL

kindliness	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
infinitely	NULL
attractive	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
've	NULL

a	NULL

manner	NULL

"	NULL
Philip	NULL
murmured	NULL
,	NULL
closing	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
shook	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
pillow	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
deftly	NULL
smoothed	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
bedclothes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tucked	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
siphon	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fetched	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
drew	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
blind	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
,	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL

"	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
hours	NULL
before	NULL
anyone	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
head	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
split	NULL
,	NULL
anguish	NULL
rent	NULL
his	NULL
limbs	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
knock	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
,	NULL
healthy	NULL
,	NULL
strong	NULL

cheerful	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Here	NULL
's	NULL
Doctor	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

The	NULL
physician	NULL
stepped	NULL
forward	NULL

an	NULL
elderly	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

manner	NULL

whom	NULL
Philip	NULL

only	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
questions	NULL

a	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
diagnosis	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
,	NULL
smiling	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Influenza	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Quite	NULL
right	NULL

"	NULL

Doctor	NULL
Deacon	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
dingy	NULL
lodging-house	NULL

.	NULL

"	NULL
Would	NULL
n't	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
rather	NULL
stay	NULL
where	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
disturbed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
shy	NULL
of	NULL
new	NULL
surroundings	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
fancy	NULL
nurses	NULL
fussing	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
dreary	NULL
cleanliness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL

said	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

very	NULL

He	NULL
wrote	NULL
a	NULL
prescription	NULL

gave	NULL
instructions	NULL

and	NULL
left	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
you	NULL

said	NULL
Philip	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL

on	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
forehead	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
cool	NULL

dry	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
brought	NULL
the	NULL
medicine	NULL

gave	NULL
Philip	NULL
a	NULL
dose	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
upstairs	NULL

Later	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

Philip	NULL

awaking	NULL
from	NULL
an	NULL
uneasy	NULL
doze	NULL

heard	NULL
voices	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL

A	NULL

then	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
afterwards	NULL
someone	NULL
else	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
expressed	NULL
his	NULL
surprise	NULL
at	NULL
finding	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
there	NULL

Philip	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
explain	NULL

Presently	NULL

Philip	NULL
grew	NULL
worse	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
came	NULL
on	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
slightly	NULL
delirious	NULL

towards	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
awoke	NULL
from	NULL

saw	NULL

down	NULL

with	NULL
his	NULL

I	NULL
thought	NULL

brought	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
drew	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
breakfast	NULL

went	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
dressed	NULL

have	NULL
something	NULL

A	NULL

a	NULL

You	NULL

Philip	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL

for	NULL
five	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

Norah	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
nursed	NULL
him	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL

Though	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
age	NULL
as	NULL
Philip	NULL
he	NULL
adopted	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
humorous	NULL
,	NULL
motherly	NULL
attitude	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
thoughtful	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
gentle	NULL
and	NULL
encouraging	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
greatest	NULL
quality	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
vitality	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
health	NULL
to	NULL
everyone	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
unused	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
petting	NULL
which	NULL
most	NULL
people	NULL
enjoy	NULL
from	NULL
mothers	NULL

sisters	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
deeply	NULL
touched	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
feminine	NULL
tenderness	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
strong	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL

Philip	NULL
grew	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
idly	NULL
in	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
amused	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
gay	NULL
stories	NULL
of	NULL
amorous	NULL
adventure	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
flirtatious	NULL
creature	NULL

capable	NULL
of	NULL
carrying	NULL
on	NULL
three	NULL

four	NULL
affairs	NULL

his	NULL

forced	NULL
to	NULL
in	NULL

keep	NULL
out	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
gift	NULL
for	NULL
throwing	NULL
a	NULL
romantic	NULL
glamour	NULL
over	NULL
everything	NULL
that	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
crippled	NULL
with	NULL
debts	NULL
,	NULL
everything	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
value	NULL
was	NULL
pawned	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
managed	NULL
always	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
cheerful	NULL
,	NULL
extravagant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
generous	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
adventurer	NULL
by	NULL
nature	NULL

He	NULL
loved	NULL
people	NULL
of	NULL
doubtful	NULL
occupations	NULL

and	NULL
his	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
riff-raff	NULL
that	NULL

the	NULL
bars	NULL

London	NULL
was	NULL

treating	NULL
him	NULL

card-sharpers	NULL

his	NULL
impecuniosity	NULL

stood	NULL
him	NULL

lent	NULL
him	NULL
five-pound	NULL
notes	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
ploughed	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
examinations	NULL
time	NULL
after	NULL
time	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
bore	NULL
this	NULL
cheerfully	NULL

and	NULL
submitted	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
charming	NULL
grace	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
parental	NULL
expostulations	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL

a	NULL
doctor	NULL

Life	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
too	NULL
jolly	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
exuberance	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
youth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
qualified	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
tremendous	NULL
success	NULL
in	NULL
practice	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
cure	NULL
people	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sheer	NULL
charm	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
worshipped	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
worshipped	NULL
boys	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
tall	NULL
and	NULL
straight	NULL
and	NULL
high	NULL
of	NULL
spirits	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
fast	NULL
friends	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
enjoy	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
little	NULL
parlour	NULL
,	NULL
wasting	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
time	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
amusing	NULL
chatter	NULL
and	NULL
smoking	NULL
innumerable	NULL
cigarettes	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
sometimes	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tavern	NULL
off	NULL
Regent	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

Hayward	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
stupid	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Lawson	NULL
recognised	NULL
his	NULL
charm	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
eager	NULL
to	NULL
paint	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
picturesque	NULL
figure	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
white	NULL
skin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
curly	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

Often	NULL
they	NULL
discussed	NULL
things	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
quietly	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
good-natured	NULL
smile	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
handsome	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
quite	NULL
rightly	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
presence	NULL
was	NULL
sufficient	NULL
contribution	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
entertainment	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
Macalister	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
eager	NULL
for	NULL
tips	NULL

Macalister	NULL

with	NULL
his	NULL
grave	NULL

told	NULL

made	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
certain	NULL

made	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL

water	NULL

for	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
way	NULL

another	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
spending	NULL
more	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL

it	NULL
would	NULL

very	NULL
well	NULL

Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
thinking	NULL
how	NULL
delightful	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
fifty	NULL
pounds	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL

give	NULL
Norah	NULL
the	NULL
furs	NULL
she	NULL
so	NULL
badly	NULL
needed	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
shops	NULL
in	NULL
Regent	NULL

picked	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
articles	NULL

deserved	NULL
everything	NULL

happy	NULL

LXIX	NULL
One	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
rooms	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
to	NULL
wash	NULL
and	NULL
tidy	NULL
himself	NULL
before	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
tea	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
with	NULL
Norah	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
let	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
latch-key	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
landlady	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL

"	NULL

exclaimed	NULL
Philip	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
only	NULL
be	NULL
Norah	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL

had	NULL

He	NULL
pushed	NULL
past	NULL
the	NULL
explaining	NULL
landlady	NULL
and	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
turned	NULL
sick	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Mildred	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
hurriedly	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
move	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
nor	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
surprised	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
saying	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
the	NULL
hell	NULL
d'you	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
kept	NULL
them	NULL
hanging	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
body	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
housemaid	NULL
applying	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
situation	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dreadful	NULL
humility	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
bearing	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
feelings	NULL
came	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
impulse	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
round	NULL
and	NULL
escape	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
moaned	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
standing	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
think	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
steadying	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
knees	NULL
were	NULL
shaking	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
groaned	NULL
in	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
's	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
's	NULL

Emil	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
bounded	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
passionately	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
humble	NULL
and	NULL
unresisting	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
and	NULL
cover	NULL
her	NULL
tear-stained	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
kisses	NULL
.	NULL

Oh	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
long	NULL
the	NULL
separation	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
!	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
endured	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
'd	NULL
better	NULL

down	NULL

Let	NULL
me	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
drew	NULL
the	NULL
chair	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
mixed	NULL
her	NULL
whiskey	NULL
and	NULL
soda	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
sobbing	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
drank	NULL
it	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
,	NULL
mournful	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
large	NULL
black	NULL
lines	NULL
under	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
thinner	NULL
and	NULL
whiter	NULL
than	NULL
when	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
married	NULL
you	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
asked	NULL
me	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
the	NULL
remark	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
swell	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
keep	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
forced	NULL
upon	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
shoulder	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
awfully	NULL
sorry	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
leaned	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
bosom	NULL
and	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
hysterical	NULL
crying	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
hat	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
dreamt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
crying	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
ease	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

she	NULL
cried	NULL
out	NULL

him	NULL

He	NULL
sank	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL

put	NULL

him	NULL
the	NULL

sometimes	NULL
she	NULL
sobbed	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL

"	NULL
Last	NULL
Monday	NULL
week	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
Birmingham	NULL

he	NULL
promised	NULL

be	NULL
back	NULL

Thursday	NULL

he	NULL
never	NULL
came	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
come	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Friday	NULL

so	NULL
I	NULL
wrote	NULL

ask	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
answered	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
wrote	NULL

said	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
hear	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
return	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
go	NULL
up	NULL

this	NULL

I	NULL
got	NULL

it	NULL

cried	NULL
Philip	NULL

"	NULL
A	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sick	NULL

he	NULL

said	NULL
it	NULL

he	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
it	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
frightened	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
I	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
baby	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL

I	NULL
kept	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
my	NULL
fault	NULL

I	NULL
ought	NULL

known	NULL
better	NULL

If	NULL
you	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
precious	NULL
quick	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL

He	NULL
left	NULL
me	NULL
without	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL

I	NULL

the	NULL

he	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL

He	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
mixing	NULL
the	NULL
trivial	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
important	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
puzzled	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
whole	NULL

was	NULL
incomprehensible	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL

two	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
deeply	NULL
moved	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
calmer	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
wrote	NULL
a	NULL
note	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
money	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
fortunately	NULL
changed	NULL
a	NULL
cheque	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL

was	NULL
able	NULL

give	NULL
her	NULL
five	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL

he	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
surrender	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
action	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
before	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
agony	NULL

suffered	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL

been	NULL
there	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
hours	NULL

was	NULL
extraordinarily	NULL
happy	NULL

he	NULL
murmured	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL

his	NULL
heart	NULL
glowing	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
greater	NULL
love	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Norah	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
till	NULL
about	NULL
eight	NULL
o'clock	NULL
a	NULL
telegram	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
before	NULL
opening	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Is	NULL
anything	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
?	NULL

Norah	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL

what	NULL
to	NULL
answer	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
fetch	NULL
her	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL

in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
walking	NULL
on	NULL

was	NULL
over	NULL

stroll	NULL
home	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
sometimes	NULL
did	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
whole	NULL
soul	NULL
revolted	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
writing	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bring	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
address	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
dearest	NULL
Norah	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
telegraph	NULL
.	NULL

Sorry	NULL

Could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
visualised	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
slightly	NULL
repelled	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
ugly	NULL
little	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
high	NULL
cheekbones	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
crude	NULL
colour	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
coarseness	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
skin	NULL
which	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
goose-flesh	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
telegram	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
followed	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
action	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
events	NULL
it	NULL
postponed	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
wired	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Regret	NULL
,	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

Will	NULL
write	NULL

Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
suggested	NULL
coming	NULL
at	NULL
four	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
was	NULL
inconvenient	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
first	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
impatiently	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
watched	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
and	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
front-door	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

you	NULL

cried	NULL
Philip	NULL

sat	NULL
down	NULL
wearily	NULL

"	NULL

any	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
crumpled	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
more	NULL

Philip	NULL
asked	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
voice	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL

with	NULL
his	NULL
pasty	NULL

Philip	NULL
sighed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
arm	NULL
round	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
bent	NULL
down	NULL

kissed	NULL
him	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL

Her	NULL
words	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
slightly	NULL
sick	NULL

It	NULL

They	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
talking	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
familiar	NULL
companionship	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
grew	NULL
late	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
dine	NULL
together	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
music-hall	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
some	NULL
persuasion	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
acting	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
situation	NULL

and	NULL
felt	NULL
instinctively	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL

accord	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL

condition	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL

entertainment	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
Philip	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
simply	NULL
to	NULL
please	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
act	NULL
of	NULL
self-sacrifice	NULL
she	NULL
accepted	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
thoughtfulness	NULL
which	NULL
delighted	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
restaurant	NULL
in	NULL
Soho	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
been	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
infinitely	NULL
grateful	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
her	NULL
suggestion	NULL
showed	NULL
that	NULL
happy	NULL
memories	NULL
were	NULL
attached	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
grew	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
cheerful	NULL
as	NULL
dinner	NULL
proceeded	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Burgundy	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
house	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
warmed	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
forgot	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
preserve	NULL
a	NULL
dolorous	NULL
countenance	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
safe	NULL

speak	NULL

her	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

"	NULL

it	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL

pride	NULL

"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
awkward	NULL
for	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
needed	NULL
rigid	NULL
economy	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
money	NULL
last	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
qualified	NULL

he	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
something	NULL
over	NULL

keep	NULL
him	NULL

Mildred	NULL

him	NULL
various	NULL

Emil	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL

accused	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL

By	NULL
degrees	NULL
Philip	NULL
learned	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
separation	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
appeared	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
fellow	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
had	NULL
discovered	NULL
the	NULL
adventure	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
engaged	NULL
in	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
periodical	NULL
visits	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
firm	NULL
that	NULL
employed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
threatened	NULL
to	NULL
divorce	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
announced	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
dismiss	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
passionately	NULL
devoted	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
children	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
separated	NULL
from	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
choose	NULL
between	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
mistress	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
always	NULL
anxious	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
child	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
entanglement	NULL
more	NULL
complicated	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Mildred	NULL
,	NULL
unable	NULL
longer	NULL
to	NULL
conceal	NULL
its	NULL
approach	NULL
,	NULL
informed	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
seized	NULL
with	NULL
panic	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
picked	NULL
a	NULL
quarrel	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
without	NULL
more	NULL
ado	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
When	NULL
d'you	NULL
expect	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
confined	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
At	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
March	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Three	NULL
months	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
discuss	NULL
plans	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
declared	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
remain	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL
at	NULL
Highbury	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
more	NULL
convenient	NULL
too	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
nearer	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
for	NULL
something	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
suggested	NULL
the	NULL
Vauxhall	NULL
Bridge	NULL
Road	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
likely	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
near	NULL
for	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
mean	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
only	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
there	NULL
about	NULL
two	NULL
months	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
respectable	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
superior	NULL
class	NULL
of	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
take	NULL
you	NULL
for	NULL
four	NULL
guineas	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
extras	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
's	NULL
extra	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
friend	NULL
of	NULL
mine	NULL
went	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
who	NULL
keeps	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
thorough	NULL
lady	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
an	NULL
officer	NULL
in	NULL
India	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
for	NULL
my	NULL
baby	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
better	NULL
for	NULL
my	NULL
health	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
her	NULL
talking	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
her	NULL
delicate	NULL
little	NULL
features	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
pale	NULL
face	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
maidenly	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
passions	NULL
that	NULL
burnt	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
unexpected	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
strangely	NULL
troubled	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
pulse	NULL
beat	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

LXX	NULL
Philip	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
Norah	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
;	NULL
nor	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
receive	NULL
one	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
silence	NULL
irritated	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
alarmed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
previous	NULL
June	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
seem	NULL
odd	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
let	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
go	NULL
by	NULL
without	NULL
visiting	NULL
her	NULL
or	NULL
offering	NULL
a	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
absence	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
unlucky	NULL
chance	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
hurt	NULL
or	NULL
unhappy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
reproach	NULL
her	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
allowed	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
such	NULL
intimate	NULL
terms	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
continuing	NULL
them	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
disgust	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
two	NULL
rooms	NULL
for	NULL
Mildred	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
floor	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Vauxhall	NULL
Bridge	NULL
Road	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
noisy	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
the	NULL
rattle	NULL
of	NULL
traffic	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
windows	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
dead	NULL
and	NULL
alive	NULL
street	NULL
where	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
soul	NULL
pass	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Give	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
forced	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Vincent	NULL
Square	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
sick	NULL
with	NULL
apprehension	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
rang	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
uneasy	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
treating	NULL
Norah	NULL
badly	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
dreaded	NULL
reproaches	NULL

he	NULL
knew	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
temper	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
scenes	NULL
:	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
way	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
frankly	NULL
that	NULL
Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
violent	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
sorry	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
Norah	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
anguish	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
flattered	NULL
him	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
immensely	NULL
grateful	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
horrible	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
deserved	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
inflict	NULL
pain	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
greet	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
all	NULL
possible	NULL
forms	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
behaviour	NULL
flashed	NULL
across	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knocked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wondered	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
conceal	NULL
his	NULL
nervousness	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
writing	NULL
away	NULL
industriously	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
sprang	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
entered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
recognised	NULL
your	NULL
step	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
cried	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Where	NULL
have	NULL
you	NULL
been	NULL
hiding	NULL
yourself	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
naughty	NULL
boy	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
came	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
joyfully	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
round	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
delighted	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
himself	NULL
countenance	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dying	NULL
for	NULL
tea	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
bustled	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
kettle	NULL
boil	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
been	NULL
awfully	NULL
busy	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
lamely	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
chatter	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
bright	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
telling	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
commission	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
provide	NULL
a	NULL
novelette	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
firm	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
hitherto	NULL
employed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
fifteen	NULL
guineas	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
money	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
clouds	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
what	NULL
we	NULL
'll	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
'll	NULL
stand	NULL
ourselves	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
jaunt	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
's	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
spend	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
at	NULL
Oxford	NULL
,	NULL
shall	NULL
we	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
'd	NULL
love	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
colleges	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
whether	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
any	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
reproach	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
frank	NULL
and	NULL
merry	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
overjoyed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
sank	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
brutal	NULL
truth	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
some	NULL
toast	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cut	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
little	NULL
pieces	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
it	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
the	NULL
brute	NULL
fed	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
nodded	NULL
,	NULL
smiling	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
lit	NULL
a	NULL
cigarette	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
light	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
leaned	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
of	NULL
delicious	NULL
happiness	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Say	NULL
something	NULL
nice	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
murmured	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
shall	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
might	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL
of	NULL
imagination	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
rather	NULL
liked	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
know	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
peace	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
events	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
easier	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
crying	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
kiss	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Mildred	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
thin	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
recollection	NULL
of	NULL
Mildred	NULL
remained	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
incorporated	NULL
form	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
more	NULL
substantial	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
shadow	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
continually	NULL
distracted	NULL
his	NULL
attention	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
very	NULL
quiet	NULL
today	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Norah	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
loquacity	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
standing	NULL
joke	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
never	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
talking	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
not	NULL
listening	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
bad	NULL
manners	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
reddened	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
wondering	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
inkling	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
secret	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
uneasily	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
weight	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
irked	NULL
him	NULL
this	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
touch	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
foot	NULL
's	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
so	NULL
sorry	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
cried	NULL
,	NULL
jumping	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
bant	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
break	NULL
myself	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
sitting	NULL
on	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
's	NULL
knees	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
through	NULL
an	NULL
elaborate	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
stamping	NULL
his	NULL
foot	NULL
and	NULL
walking	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
resume	NULL
her	NULL
position	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
she	NULL
talked	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
ten	NULL
of	NULL
Mildred	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
amused	NULL
him	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
jollier	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
cleverer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
nicer	NULL
nature	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
brave	NULL
,	NULL
honest	NULL
little	NULL
woman	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
bitterly	NULL
,	NULL
deserved	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
epithets	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
sense	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
stick	NULL
to	NULL
Norah	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
much	NULL
happier	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
ever	NULL
be	NULL
with	NULL
Mildred	NULL
:	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
grateful	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
help	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
important	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
loved	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
yearned	NULL
for	NULL
Mildred	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
whole	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
sooner	NULL
have	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
whole	NULL
afternoon	NULL
with	NULL
Norah	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
prized	NULL
one	NULL
kiss	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
cold	NULL
lips	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
all	NULL
Norah	NULL
could	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
help	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
just	NULL
got	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
bones	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
heartless	NULL
,	NULL
vicious	NULL
and	NULL
vulgar	NULL
,	NULL
stupid	NULL
and	NULL
grasping	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
rather	NULL
have	NULL
misery	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
than	NULL
happiness	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
Norah	NULL
said	NULL
casually	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
tomorrow	NULL
,	NULL
sha	NULL
n't	NULL
I	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
Mildred	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
moving	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
courage	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
send	NULL
a	NULL
wire	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
satisfied	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
luncheon	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
Highbury	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
trunk	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
clothes	NULL
and	NULL
another	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
odds	NULL
and	NULL
ends	NULL
,	NULL
cushions	NULL
,	NULL
lampshades	NULL
,	NULL
photograph	NULL
frames	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
apartments	NULL
a	NULL
home-like	NULL
air	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
large	NULL
cardboard	NULL
boxes	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
roof	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
four-wheeler	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
they	NULL
drove	NULL
through	NULL
Victoria	NULL
Street	NULL
Philip	NULL
sat	NULL
well	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cab	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
Norah	NULL
should	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
passing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL
to	NULL
telegraph	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
post	NULL
office	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Vauxhall	NULL
Bridge	NULL
Road	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
wonder	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
excuse	NULL
for	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
neighbouring	NULL
square	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
lived	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
go	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
necessity	NULL
irritated	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
Norah	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
forced	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
vulgar	NULL
and	NULL
degrading	NULL
shifts	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
happy	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
with	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
amused	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
unpacking	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
experienced	NULL
a	NULL
charming	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
possession	NULL
in	NULL
installing	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
lodgings	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
paying	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
exert	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pleasure	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
things	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
what	NULL
somebody	NULL
else	NULL
seemed	NULL
desirous	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
unpacked	NULL
her	NULL
clothes	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
them	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
proposing	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
her	NULL
slippers	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
boots	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
delighted	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
perform	NULL
menial	NULL
offices	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
do	NULL
spoil	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
running	NULL
her	NULL
fingers	NULL
affectionately	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
unbuttoning	NULL
her	NULL
boots	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
nipping	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
you	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
arranged	NULL
the	NULL
cushions	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
photograph	NULL
frames	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
several	NULL
jars	NULL
of	NULL
green	NULL
earthenware	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
get	NULL
you	NULL
some	NULL
flowers	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
proudly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
As	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
get	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
tea-gown	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Undo	NULL
me	NULL
behind	NULL
,	NULL
will	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
as	NULL
unconcernedly	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
sex	NULL
meant	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
gratitude	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
intimacy	NULL
her	NULL
request	NULL
showed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
undid	NULL
the	NULL
hooks	NULL
and	NULL
eyes	NULL
with	NULL
clumsy	NULL
fingers	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
first	NULL
day	NULL
I	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
thought	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
be	NULL
doing	NULL
this	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
laugh	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
forced	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Somebody	NULL
must	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bed-room	NULL
and	NULL
slipped	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
pale	NULL
blue	NULL
tea-gown	NULL
decorated	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
cheap	NULL
lace	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Philip	NULL
settled	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
sofa	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
tea	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
regretfully	NULL

him	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
appointment	NULL
was	NULL

she	NULL
showed	NULL
no	NULL
curiosity	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
ordered	NULL
dinner	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL

and	NULL
proposed	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
quietly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
hurry	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
back	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
tram	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
Vauxhall	NULL
Bridge	NULL

.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
break	NULL
the	NULL

to	NULL
Norah	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
that	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

got	NULL

I	NULL

fell	NULL

what	NULL

It	NULL
exasperated	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
force	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
lies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
reddened	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL

demonstration	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
bound	NULL

He	NULL
fancied	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL

she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
this	NULL
irritated	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
blankly	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Sunday	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
looking	NULL

the	NULL

with	NULL
Mildred	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
common	NULL
decency	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
leave	NULL
her	NULL

knew	NULL

would	NULL
have	NULL

the	NULL

asked	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL

looked	NULL
at	NULL

twinkling	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL

out	NULL

posted	NULL

He	NULL
passed	NULL
an	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
morning	NULL

imagined	NULL

what	NULL
Norah	NULL

He	NULL
tortured	NULL
himself	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

time	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
relieved	NULL

Imagined	NULL
grief	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL

he	NULL

free	NULL
now	NULL

all	NULL

His	NULL

when	NULL
his	NULL

himself	NULL

he	NULL

behind	NULL
him	NULL

nothing	NULL

opened	NULL

she	NULL
preceded	NULL
him	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
nervous	NULL

to	NULL
give	NULL

offered	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
cigarette	NULL

lit	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
steadily	NULL
for	NULL

in	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

She	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

said	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
Philip	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
sighed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

inexplicable	NULL

What	NULL
does	NULL
it	NULL

Philip	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
determination	NULL

The	NULL
colour	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
tell	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

set	NULL
her	NULL
hat	NULL
straight	NULL

said	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
stopped	NULL
a	NULL
passing	NULL
hansom	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
followed	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
startled	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
white	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
heaviness	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
movements	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
suddenly	NULL
grown	NULL
older	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
so	NULL
ill	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL

let	NULL
her	NULL
go	NULL
alone	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
cab	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
drove	NULL
along	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
bridge	NULL
,	NULL
through	NULL
shabby	NULL
streets	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
children	NULL

with	NULL
shrill	NULL
cries	NULL

played	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
door	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
immediately	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
summon	NULL
enough	NULL
strength	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
legs	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
hope	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL
forgive	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
bright	NULL
again	NULL
with	NULL
tears	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
forced	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

Lightly	NULL
and	NULL
quickly	NULL
she	NULL
stroked	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
bore	NULL
no	NULL

the	NULL
gesture	NULL
was	NULL

then	NULL
she	NULL
jumped	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cab	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
herself	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
paid	NULL
the	NULL
hansom	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
to	NULL
Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
lodgings	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
heaviness	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
reproach	NULL
himself	NULL

But	NULL
why	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
else	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

Passing	NULL
a	NULL
fruiterer	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
grapes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
grateful	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
show	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
recollecting	NULL
every	NULL
whim	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

LXXII	NULL
For	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
books	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
tea	NULL
worked	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Mildred	NULL
lay	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
reading	NULL
novels	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
look	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
watch	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
happy	NULL
smile	NULL
crossed	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
feel	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
waste	NULL
your	NULL
time	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
silly	NULL

Go	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
your	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Tyrant	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
gaily	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
aside	NULL
his	NULL
book	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
landlady	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
cloth	NULL
for	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
high	NULL
spirits	NULL
he	NULL
exchanged	NULL
chaff	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
cockney	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
middle	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
amusing	NULL
humour	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
tongue	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
great	NULL
friends	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
an	NULL
elaborate	NULL
but	NULL
mendacious	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
pass	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
good-hearted	NULL
little	NULL
woman	NULL
was	NULL
touched	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
no	NULL
trouble	NULL
too	NULL
great	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
Mildred	NULL
comfortable	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
propriety	NULL
had	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
should	NULL
pass	NULL
himself	NULL
off	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
dined	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
delighted	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ordered	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
tempted	NULL
Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
capricious	NULL
appetite	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
enchanted	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
sitting	NULL
opposite	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
from	NULL
sheer	NULL
joy	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
pressed	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
dinner	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
arm-chair	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
settled	NULL
himself	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
leaning	NULL
against	NULL
her	NULL
knees	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
smoked	NULL
.	NULL

Often	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
talk	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
Philip	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
doze	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
move	NULL
then	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
he	NULL
woke	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
very	NULL
quietly	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
lazily	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
and	NULL
enjoying	NULL
his	NULL
happiness	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Had	NULL
a	NULL
nice	NULL
little	NULL
nap	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
smiled	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
woke	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
sleeping	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
only	NULL
just	NULL
closed	NULL
my	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
acknowledge	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
asleep	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
phlegmatic	NULL
temperament	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
condition	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seriously	NULL
inconvenience	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
trouble	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
health	NULL
and	NULL
accepted	NULL
the	NULL
advice	NULL
of	NULL
anyone	NULL
who	NULL
chose	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
'	NULL
constitutional	NULL
'	NULL
every	NULL
morning	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
fine	NULL
and	NULL
remained	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
definite	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
too	NULL
cold	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
St.	NULL
James	NULL
'	NULL
Park	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
she	NULL
spent	NULL
quite	NULL
happily	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
sofa	NULL
,	NULL
reading	NULL
one	NULL
novel	NULL
after	NULL
another	NULL
or	NULL
chatting	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
landlady	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
inexhaustible	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
gossip	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
with	NULL
abundant	NULL
detail	NULL
the	NULL
history	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
landlady	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
house	NULL
on	NULL
either	NULL

.	NULL

Now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
seized	NULL
with	NULL
panic	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
fears	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
confinement	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
terror	NULL

she	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
callous	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
reason	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
she	NULL
pretended	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

You	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
still-born	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
hint	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
shocked	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
reasoning	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL

Mildred	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
horrified	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

smiling	NULL

Mildred	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
confined	NULL
early	NULL
in	NULL
March	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
enough	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
seaside	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
:	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
Philip	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
without	NULL
interruption	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
examination	NULL
;	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
Easter	NULL
holidays	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
arranged	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
talked	NULL
endlessly	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

Paris	NULL
was	NULL
delightful	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
hotel	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Latin	NULL
Quarter	NULL

and	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
eat	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
charming	NULL
little	NULL
restaurants	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
music	NULL
halls	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
amuse	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
about	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL

she	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL

Lawson	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL

a	NULL

the	NULL
Bal	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
'll	NULL
cost	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL

money	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

damn	NULL
the	NULL
expense	NULL

how	NULL
I	NULL

n't	NULL
you	NULL

never	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
with	NULL
smiling	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
tenderness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
grateful	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
gentler	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
the	NULL
superciliousness	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
irritated	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
pains	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
up	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
any	NULL
pretences	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
troubled	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
elaboration	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
just	NULL
tied	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
knot	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
left	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
vast	NULL
fringe	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
generally	NULL
wore	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
careless	NULL
style	NULL
suited	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
thin	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
seem	NULL
very	NULL
large	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
heavy	NULL
lines	NULL
under	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
pallor	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
made	NULL
their	NULL
colour	NULL
more	NULL
profound	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
wistful	NULL
look	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
infinitely	NULL
pathetic	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Madonna	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
continue	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
same	NULL
way	NULL
always	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
happier	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
ten	NULL
o'clock	NULL
every	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
early	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
hours	NULL
'	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
lost	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
generally	NULL
brushed	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
ritual	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kisses	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
bade	NULL
her	NULL
good-night	NULL
;	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
the	NULL
palms	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
(	NULL
how	NULL
thin	NULL
the	NULL
fingers	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
nails	NULL
were	NULL
beautiful	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
spent	NULL
much	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
manicuring	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
)	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
closed	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
first	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
one	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
heart	NULL
overflowing	NULL
with	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
longed	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL
to	NULL
gratify	NULL
the	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
self-sacrifice	NULL
which	NULL
consumed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
came	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
nursing-home	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
confined	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
visit	NULL
her	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoons	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
changed	NULL
her	NULL
story	NULL
and	NULL
represented	NULL
herself	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
wife	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
soldier	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
India	NULL
to	NULL
join	NULL
his	NULL
regiment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
introduced	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
mistress	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
establishment	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
brother-in-law	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
rather	NULL
careful	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
as	NULL
there	NULL
's	NULL
another	NULL
lady	NULL
here	NULL
whose	NULL
husband	NULL

Civil	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL

you	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL

yours	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
boat	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
boat	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
innocently	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
Flying	NULL
Dutchman	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
safely	NULL
delivered	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
daughter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
weak	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
relieved	NULL
that	NULL
everything	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
showed	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
herself	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
curiously	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL

funny-looking	NULL

it	NULL

I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL

"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
red	NULL
and	NULL
wrinkled	NULL
and	NULL
odd	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
smiled	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
him	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
nurse	NULL
who	NULL
owned	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
side	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
disbelieving	NULL
Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
complicated	NULL
story	NULL

she	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
father	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
her	NULL

"	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL

up	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL

I	NULL

Madeleine	NULL

Cecilia	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
nurse	NULL
left	NULL
them	NULL
alone	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
bent	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
Mildred	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
mouth	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
so	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
thin	NULL
arms	NULL
round	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

Now	NULL
I	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL

I	NULL

They	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
nurse	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
hurriedly	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
nurse	NULL
entered	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
smile	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

LXXIII	NULL
Three	NULL
weeks	NULL
later	NULL
Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
Mildred	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
baby	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
Brighton	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
recovery	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
boarding-house	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
weekends	NULL
with	NULL
Emil	NULL
Miller	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Germany	NULL
on	NULL
business	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
baby	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
got	NULL
pleasure	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stories	NULL
she	NULL
invented	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
showed	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
fertility	NULL
of	NULL
invention	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
working	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
details	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
proposed	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
in	NULL
Brighton	NULL
some	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
charge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
startled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
callousness	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
getting	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
soon	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
argued	NULL
with	NULL
common	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
child	NULL
had	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
be	NULL
put	NULL
somewhere	NULL
before	NULL
it	NULL
grew	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
the	NULL
maternal	NULL
instinct	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
itself	NULL
felt	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
counted	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
persuade	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
occurred	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
unkind	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
baby	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
amused	NULL
her	NULL
sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL

laughed	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL

Philip	NULL

she	NULL
laughed	NULL

To	NULL
him	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
very	NULL
touching	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
's	NULL
helplessness	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
small	NULL

ugly	NULL

querulous	NULL

Its	NULL
birth	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
with	NULL
shame	NULL

anguish	NULL

Nobody	NULL
wanted	NULL
it	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
dependent	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL

a	NULL
stranger	NULL

for	NULL
food	NULL

shelter	NULL

and	NULL
clothes	NULL

cover	NULL
its	NULL
nakedness	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
started	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
kissed	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
laugh	NULL

him	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL

it	NULL
industriously	NULL

now	NULL
with	NULL
only	NULL
ten	NULL
days	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
final	NULL
effort	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
anxious	NULL

first	NULL

himself	NULL
time	NULL

speed	NULL

then	NULL
because	NULL
this	NULL
examination	NULL
marked	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL

the	NULL
drudgery	NULL

after	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
student	NULL

to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
medicine	NULL

midwifery	NULL

surgery	NULL

the	NULL
interest	NULL

which	NULL

more	NULL
vivid	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
anatomy	NULL
and	NULL
physiology	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
hitherto	NULL
concerned	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
with	NULL
interest	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
curriculum	NULL
.	NULL

Nor	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
confess	NULL
to	NULL
Mildred	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
failed	NULL
:	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
examination	NULL

difficult	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
majority	NULL
of	NULL
candidates	NULL
were	NULL
ploughed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
attempt	NULL

he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
think	NULL
less	NULL
well	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
succeed	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
peculiarly	NULL
humiliating	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
showing	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
sent	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
postcard	NULL
to	NULL
announce	NULL
her	NULL
safe	NULL
arrival	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
snatched	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
shyness	NULL
in	NULL
expressing	NULL
himself	NULL
by	NULL
word	NULL
of	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
pen	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
ridiculous	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

Profiting	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
discovery	NULL
he	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
his	NULL
whole	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
before	NULL
how	NULL
his	NULL
adoration	NULL
filled	NULL
every	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
actions	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
touched	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
happiness	NULL
that	NULL
lay	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
gratitude	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
owed	NULL
her	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
(	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
before	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
words	NULL
)	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
extravagant	NULL
delight	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
gray	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
big	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
body	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
breathe	NULL
(	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
pressed	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
lungs	NULL
)	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
throbbed	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
delight	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
presence	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
pain	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
shook	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
strangely	NULL
weak	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
having	NULL
eaten	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
tremulous	NULL
from	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
food	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
eagerly	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
answers	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
expect	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
often	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
letter-writing	NULL
came	NULL
difficultly	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
content	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
clumsy	NULL
little	NULL
note	NULL
that	NULL
arrived	NULL
in	NULL
reply	NULL
to	NULL
four	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boarding-house	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
,	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
walk	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
lady-friend	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
boarding-house	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
fancy	NULL
to	NULL
baby	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
theatre	NULL
on	NULL
Saturday	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Brighton	NULL
was	NULL
filling	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
touched	NULL
Philip	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
matter-of-fact	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
crabbed	NULL
style	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
formality	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
laugh	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
and	NULL
kiss	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
examination	NULL
with	NULL
happy	NULL
confidence	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
either	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
papers	NULL
that	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
trouble	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
examination	NULL
was	NULL
viva	NULL
voce	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
nervous	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
answer	NULL
the	NULL
questions	NULL
adequately	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sent	NULL
a	NULL
triumphant	NULL
telegram	NULL
to	NULL
Mildred	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
was	NULL
announced	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
rooms	NULL
Philip	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
another	NULL
week	NULL
in	NULL
Brighton	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
for	NULL
seven	NULL
shillings	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
inquiries	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
herself	NULL
benefiting	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sea-air	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
more	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
her	NULL
no	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
hated	NULL
asking	NULL
Philip	NULL
for	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
would	NULL
he	NULL
send	NULL
some	NULL
by	NULL
return	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
go	NULL
about	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
lady-friend	NULL
always	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
lady-friend	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
dressy	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
bitter	NULL
disappointment	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
took	NULL
away	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
pleasure	NULL
at	NULL
getting	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
examination	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
me	NULL
one	NULL
quarter	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
love	NULL
her	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
away	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
longer	NULL
than	NULL
necessary	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
quickly	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
pure	NULL
selfishness	NULL
;	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
her	NULL
health	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
important	NULL
than	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
now	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
spend	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
Brighton	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
together	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
leaped	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
amusing	NULL
to	NULL
appear	NULL
before	NULL
Mildred	NULL
suddenly	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
information	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
boarding-house	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
out	NULL
trains	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
paused	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
pleased	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
friends	NULL
in	NULL
Brighton	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
quiet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
boisterous	NULL
joviality	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
amused	NULL
herself	NULL
more	NULL
with	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
than	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
torture	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
to	NULL
risk	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
write	NULL
and	NULL
suggest	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
risk	NULL
the	NULL
anguish	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
suffer	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
proposed	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
excuses	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
sent	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
five-pound	NULL
note	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
letter	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL
and	NULL
cared	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
week-end	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
down	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL
means	NULL
to	NULL
alter	NULL
any	NULL
plans	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
awaited	NULL
her	NULL
answer	NULL
with	NULL
impatience	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
it	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
known	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
arranged	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
music-hall	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Saturday	NULL
night	NULL
;	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
boarding-house	NULL
talk	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
stayed	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
on	NULL
Sunday	NULL
morning	NULL
and	NULL
spend	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
?	NULL

They	NULL
could	NULL
lunch	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Metropole	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL

He	NULL
blessed	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
fine	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
approached	NULL
Brighton	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
poured	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL

Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
platform	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
jolly	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL

he	NULL
cried	NULL

he	NULL
seized	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
expected	NULL

It	NULL

up	NULL
after	NULL
seeing	NULL
nobody	NULL

these	NULL
months	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
dull	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
very	NULL
smart	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
new	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
black	NULL
straw	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
many	NULL

on	NULL
it	NULL

and	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
neck	NULL
floated	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
boa	NULL
of	NULL
imitation	NULL
swansdown	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
very	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
stooped	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
(	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
done	NULL
that	NULL

but	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

though	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL

any	NULL

her	NULL

the	NULL

They	NULL
walked	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
remembering	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
walked	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
months	NULL

grew	NULL
suddenly	NULL
conscious	NULL

his	NULL

walked	NULL
stiffly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
attempt	NULL

conceal	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL

asked	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
talked	NULL

her	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL

Griffiths	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
how	NULL

her	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL

Philip	NULL

Philip	NULL

He	NULL
described	NULL

He	NULL
dwelt	NULL
amorously	NULL
on	NULL
every	NULL

"	NULL
Life	NULL

Philip	NULL
smiled	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
delight	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
so	NULL
madly	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
knew	NULL

remarked	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
must	NULL

Philip	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
what	NULL

"	NULL

Since	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
early	NULL
for	NULL
luncheon	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shelters	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
parade	NULL
,	NULL
sunning	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
watched	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
pass	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
Brighton	NULL
shop-boys	NULL
who	NULL
walked	NULL
in	NULL
twos	NULL
and	NULL
threes	NULL
,	NULL
swinging	NULL
their	NULL
canes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
Brighton	NULL
shop-girls	NULL
who	NULL
tripped	NULL
along	NULL
in	NULL
giggling	NULL
bunches	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
could	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
from	NULL
London	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
keen	NULL
air	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
fillip	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
weariness	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
many	NULL
Jews	NULL
,	NULL
stout	NULL
ladies	NULL
in	NULL
tight	NULL
satin	NULL
dresses	NULL
and	NULL
diamonds	NULL
,	NULL
little	NULL
corpulent	NULL
men	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
gesticulative	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
middle-aged	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
spending	NULL
a	NULL
week-end	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
hotels	NULL
,	NULL
carefully	NULL
dressed	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
industriously	NULL
after	NULL
too	NULL
substantial	NULL
a	NULL
breakfast	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
themselves	NULL
an	NULL
appetite	NULL
for	NULL
too	NULL
substantial	NULL
a	NULL
luncheon	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
exchanged	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
day	NULL
with	NULL
friends	NULL
and	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Brighton	NULL
or	NULL
London-by-the-Sea	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
a	NULL
well-known	NULL
actor	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
elaborately	NULL
unconscious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
attention	NULL
he	NULL
excited	NULL
:	NULL
sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
wore	NULL
patent	NULL
leather	NULL
boots	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
coat	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
astrakhan	NULL
collar	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
carried	NULL
a	NULL
silver-knobbed	NULL
stick	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
shooting	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
strolled	NULL
in	NULL
knickerbockers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ulster	NULL
of	NULL
Harris	NULL
tweed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
tweed	NULL
hat	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
shone	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
sea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
sea	NULL
was	NULL
trim	NULL
and	NULL
neat	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
luncheon	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Hove	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
charge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
back	NULL
street	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
clean	NULL
and	NULL
tidy	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Harding	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
elderly	NULL
,	NULL
stout	NULL
person	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
gray	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
red	NULL
,	NULL
fleshy	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
motherly	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
cap	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
kind	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Wo	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
find	NULL
it	NULL
an	NULL
awful	NULL
nuisance	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL

baby	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
explained	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
curate	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
getting	NULL
permanent	NULL
work	NULL
since	NULL
vicars	NULL
wanted	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
to	NULL
assist	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
earned	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
by	NULL
doing	NULL
locums	NULL
when	NULL
someone	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
holiday	NULL
or	NULL
fell	NULL
ill	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
charitable	NULL
institution	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
pension	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
lonely	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
shillings	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
paid	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
help	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
things	NULL
going	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
promised	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
well	NULL
fed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Quite	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
she	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
Mildred	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
tea	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Metropole	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
liked	NULL
the	NULL
crowd	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
band	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
talking	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
watched	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
with	NULL
keen	NULL
eyes	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
dresses	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
who	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
sharpness	NULL
for	NULL
reckoning	NULL
up	NULL
what	NULL
things	NULL
cost	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
leaned	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
whispered	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
meditations	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
D'you	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
aigrette	NULL
there	NULL
?	NULL

That	NULL

guineas	NULL

Or	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Look	NULL

Philip	NULL

that	NULL

She	NULL
laughed	NULL
triumphantly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
know	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
smiled	NULL
happily	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
pleasure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
ingenuousness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
conversation	NULL
amused	NULL
and	NULL
touched	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
band	NULL
played	NULL
sentimental	NULL
music	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
dinner	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
arm	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
what	NULL
arrangements	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
journey	NULL
to	NULL
France	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
Saturday	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
engaged	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
hotel	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
forward	NULL
eagerly	NULL
to	NULL
taking	NULL
the	NULL
tickets	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL
going	NULL
second-class	NULL

will	NULL
you	NULL

We	NULL
must	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
extravagant	NULL

it	NULL

there	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
times	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Quarter	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
wander	NULL
through	NULL
its	NULL
pleasant	NULL
old	NULL
streets	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
sit	NULL
idly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
charming	NULL
gardens	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Luxembourg	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
was	NULL
fine	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
enough	NULL
of	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Fontainebleau	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
trees	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
just	NULL
bursting	NULL
into	NULL
leaf	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
green	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
forest	NULL
in	NULL
spring	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
beautiful	NULL
than	NULL
anything	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
song	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
happy	NULL
pain	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL

Mildred	NULL
listened	NULL
quietly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
deep	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
broke	NULL
off	NULL

They	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL

they	NULL
had	NULL
dawdled	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
barely	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL

good-night	NULL

He	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
quickly	NULL

ran	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL

Saturday	NULL
Mildred	NULL
returned	NULL

that	NULL
evening	NULL
Philip	NULL
kept	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
seats	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL

they	NULL
drank	NULL
champagne	NULL
at	NULL
dinner	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL

in	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
everything	NULL
ingenuously	NULL

She	NULL
cuddled	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
drove	NULL
from	NULL

theatre	NULL

gently	NULL
pressed	NULL
his	NULL

Philip	NULL

arranged	NULL

the	NULL
gallery	NULL
at	NULL
Romano	NULL

Sunday	NULL

because	NULL
the	NULL

looked	NULL

though	NULL
it	NULL

a	NULL
good	NULL

more	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL

.	NULL

Philip	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
arrived	NULL
first	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
Griffiths	NULL

"	NULL

But	NULL
presently	NULL
he	NULL
appeared	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
handsome	NULL
creature	NULL
,	NULL
tall	NULL
and	NULL
thin	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
was	NULL
placed	NULL
well	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
conquering	NULL
air	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
attractive	NULL

and	NULL
his	NULL
curly	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
bold	NULL
,	NULL
friendly	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL

his	NULL
red	NULL

were	NULL
charming	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
Mildred	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
appreciation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
satisfaction	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
greeted	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
Mildred	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL

answered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Nor	NULL
so	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Has	NULL
he	NULL
been	NULL
blackening	NULL
my	NULL
character	NULL

"	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
laughed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
Mildred	NULL
noticed	NULL
how	NULL
white	NULL
and	NULL
regular	NULL
his	NULL
teeth	NULL
were	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
pleasant	NULL
his	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL

said	NULL
Philip	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
talked	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
about	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL

"	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
possible	NULL
humour	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
passed	NULL
his	NULL
final	NULL
examination	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
qualified	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
been	NULL
appointed	NULL
house-surgeon	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
hospital	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
North	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
taking	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
duties	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
May	NULL
and	NULL
meanwhile	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
home	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
holiday	NULL
;	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
week	NULL
in	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
into	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
the	NULL
gay	NULL
nonsense	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
admired	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
copy	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
much	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
vivacity	NULL
gave	NULL
it	NULL
point	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
flowed	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
which	NULL
affected	NULL
everyone	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
sensible	NULL
as	NULL
bodily	NULL
warmth	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
lively	NULL
than	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
known	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
delighted	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
little	NULL
party	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
success	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
amusing	NULL
herself	NULL
enormously	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
laughed	NULL
louder	NULL
and	NULL
louder	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
quite	NULL
forgot	NULL
the	NULL
genteel	NULL
reserve	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
second	NULL
nature	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
difficult	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL

Philip	NULL
never	NULL
calls	NULL
you	NULL
anything	NULL

Mildred	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
daresay	NULL
she	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
scratch	NULL
your	NULL
eyes	NULL
out	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
call	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
too	NULL

"	NULL
laughed	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
call	NULL
me	NULL
Harry	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
sat	NULL
silent	NULL
while	NULL
they	NULL
chattered	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
how	NULL
good	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
people	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
teased	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
kindly	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
so	NULL
serious	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
he	NULL
's	NULL
quite	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL

smiled	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
old	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
answered	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
taking	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
hand	NULL
he	NULL
shook	NULL
it	NULL
gaily	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
an	NULL
added	NULL
charm	NULL
in	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
sober	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
wine	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
drunk	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
.	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
became	NULL
more	NULL
talkative	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
boisterous	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
amused	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
beg	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
quiet	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
gift	NULL
for	NULL
story-telling	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
adventures	NULL
lost	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
romance	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
laughter	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
narration	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
played	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
gallant	NULL
,	NULL
humorous	NULL
part	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
shining	NULL
with	NULL
excitement	NULL
,	NULL
urged	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
anecdote	NULL
after	NULL
anecdote	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
lights	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
astonished	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
word	NULL

the	NULL
evening	NULL

I	NULL
thought	NULL

n't	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
half	NULL
past	NULL
nine	NULL

They	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
good-bye	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
added	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL

he	NULL
smiled	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Pimlico	NULL
Mildred	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
good	NULL
looks	NULL

his	NULL
well-cut	NULL
clothes	NULL

his	NULL
voice	NULL

said	NULL
Philip	NULL

"	NULL
D'you	NULL

rather	NULL
sniffy	NULL
about	NULL

think	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
absurd	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
laughed	NULL
,	NULL
touched	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
appreciation	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
moisture	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL

She	NULL
opened	NULL
her	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
turned	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Tell	NULL
Harry	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
madly	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
right	NULL

laughed	NULL

Good-night	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
having	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sank	NULL
lazily	NULL
into	NULL
an	NULL
arm-chair	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
strangely	NULL
sensual	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
slow	NULL
movements	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
large	NULL
limbs	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
remained	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
chattered	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
enjoying	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
admired	NULL
them	NULL
both	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
natural	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
admire	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
if	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
absorbed	NULL
Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
attention	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
attitude	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
loving	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
confident	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL

looks	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
amusement	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
flirts	NULL
harmlessly	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
stranger	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
half	NULL
past	NULL
seven	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
watch	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

slightly	NULL
irritated	NULL

All	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
promptly	NULL

I	NULL

The	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
Philip	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
Mildred	NULL
angrily	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
on	NULL
earth	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
looked	NULL
so	NULL
funny	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
nothing	NULL
when	NULL

said	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

what	NULL

And	NULL
why	NULL
the	NULL
hell	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL

he	NULL

Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
pale	NULL
lips	NULL
tightened	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL

little	NULL
amusement	NULL
sometimes	NULL

I	NULL

tired	NULL

with	NULL

"	NULL

They	NULL
heard	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
coming	NULL
heavily	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
bed-room	NULL
to	NULL
wash	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
dined	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
Italian	NULL
restaurant	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
cross	NULL
and	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
quickly	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
showing	NULL
to	NULL
disadvantage	NULL
in	NULL
comparison	NULL
with	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
forced	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
his	NULL
annoyance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
drank	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
wine	NULL
to	NULL
destroy	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
gnawing	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
set	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
remorseful	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
herself	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
kindly	NULL
and	NULL
affectionate	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
Philip	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
to	NULL
surrender	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
jealousy	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
dinner	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
hansom	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
music-hall	NULL
Mildred	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
accord	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
anger	NULL
vanished	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
how	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
was	NULL
holding	NULL
her	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pain	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
violently	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
physical	NULL
pain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
panic-stricken	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
whether	NULL
Mildred	NULL
and	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
anything	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
performance	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mist	NULL
of	NULL
suspicion	NULL
,	NULL
anger	NULL
,	NULL
dismay	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wretchedness	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
forced	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
conceal	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
anything	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
talking	NULL
and	NULL
laughing	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
torture	NULL
himself	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
drink	NULL
something	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
and	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
alone	NULL
together	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
them	NULL
by	NULL
themselves	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
come	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
thirst	NULL
on	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
nonsense	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
stay	NULL
and	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
Mildred	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
throwing	NULL
them	NULL
together	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
he	NULL
suffered	NULL
more	NULL
intolerable	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bar	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
up	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
balcony	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
watch	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
stage	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
smiling	NULL
into	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
happy	NULL
fluency	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
hang	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
head	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
ache	NULL
frightfully	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
there	NULL
motionless	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
enjoying	NULL
themselves	NULL
without	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
suffering	NULL
,	NULL
suffering	NULL
.	NULL

Time	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
shyness	NULL
about	NULL
rejoining	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
reflected	NULL
bitterly	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
paid	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
dinner	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
seats	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
music-hall	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
making	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
!	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
hot	NULL
with	NULL
shame	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
happy	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
without	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
instinct	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
themselves	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
coat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
necessitate	NULL
endless	NULL
explanations	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
annoyance	NULL
in	NULL
Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
sank	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
've	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
devil	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
of	NULL
welcome	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
met	NULL
some	NULL
men	NULL

I	NULL

said	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL

about	NULL
Mildred	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
laugh	NULL
of	NULL
happy	NULL
complacency	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
vulgar	NULL
sound	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ring	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
horrified	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL
on	NULL

said	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
we	NULL
'll	NULL
both	NULL

Philip	NULL
suspected	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
arrangement	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
left	NULL
alone	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
cab	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
nor	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
offer	NULL
it	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
holding	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
'	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
chief	NULL
thought	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
so	NULL
horribly	NULL
vulgar	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
they	NULL
drove	NULL
along	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
what	NULL
plans	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
without	NULL
his	NULL
knowledge	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
cursed	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
having	NULL
left	NULL
them	NULL
alone	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
actually	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
enable	NULL
them	NULL

arrange	NULL
things	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL

said	NULL
Philip	NULL

when	NULL
they	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
lodging	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
too	NULL
tired	NULL

home	NULL

"	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
back	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
talked	NULL
gaily	NULL
and	NULL
seemed	NULL
indifferent	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
answered	NULL
in	NULL
monosyllables	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
notice	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
silence	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
grew	NULL
too	NULL
significant	NULL
to	NULL
struggle	NULL
against	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
nervous	NULL
,	NULL
ceased	NULL
talking	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
shy	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
bring	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL

and	NULL
yet	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
was	NULL
passing	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
lost	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
forced	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL

asked	NULL
suddenly	NULL

laughed	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
slip	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
through	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
arm	NULL

but	NULL
Philip	NULL
drew	NULL
himself	NULL
away	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL

was	NULL
lying	NULL

could	NULL
not	NULL
bring	NULL
himself	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
holding	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL

He	NULL
suddenly	NULL
felt	NULL
very	NULL
weak	NULL
and	NULL
broken	NULL

"	NULL

His	NULL
voice	NULL
broke	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
prevent	NULL
the	NULL
sob	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL

him	NULL

was	NULL
horribly	NULL

Philip	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL

The	NULL
cab	NULL
stopped	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
door	NULL

LXXV	NULL
Next	NULL
day	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
temper	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
anxious	NULL

bore	NULL
Mildred	NULL
with	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
society	NULL

so	NULL
had	NULL
arranged	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
till	NULL
dinner-time	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
fetched	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
chaffed	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL

unwonted	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
wearing	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
dress	NULL

had	NULL
given	NULL

remarked	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL

would	NULL

entirely	NULL

himself	NULL

His	NULL
eyes	NULL

presently	NULL
while	NULL
they	NULL

dining	NULL
Philip	NULL
half	NULL

I	NULL
asked	NULL

She	NULL
hesitated	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
gleam	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL

"	NULL
Would	NULL

this	NULL
morning	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
handed	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
envelope	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
recognised	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
'	NULL
bold	NULL
,	NULL
legible	NULL
writing	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
eight	NULL
pages	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
written	NULL
,	NULL
frank	NULL
and	NULL
charming	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
making	NULL
love	NULL
to	NULL
women	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
Mildred	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
passionately	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
fond	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
his	NULL
fault	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
carried	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
paid	NULL
her	NULL
delightful	NULL
compliments	NULL
.	NULL

Finally	NULL
he	NULL
thanked	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
consenting	NULL
to	NULL
lunch	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
impatient	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
was	NULL
dated	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
;	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
written	NULL
it	NULL
after	NULL
leaving	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
post	NULL
it	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sickening	NULL
palpitation	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
gave	NULL
no	NULL
outward	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
surprise	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
handed	NULL
it	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Mildred	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
calmly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

you	NULL

"	NULL
Rather	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
emphatically	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
were	NULL
trembling	NULL

so	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
them	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL

looked	NULL

it	NULL
again	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL

she	NULL
tried	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL

Philip	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL

come	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
slept	NULL
badly	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
club	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Medical	NULL
School	NULL
,	NULL
reading	NULL
one	NULL
newspaper	NULL
after	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
vacation	NULL
and	NULL
few	NULL
students	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
played	NULL
a	NULL
game	NULL
of	NULL
chess	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
wore	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
tedious	NULL
hours	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
luncheon	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
so	NULL
tired	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
was	NULL
aching	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
lodgings	NULL
and	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
a	NULL
novel	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
Griffiths	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
returned	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
look	NULL
into	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL

see	NULL
if	NULL

asleep	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
Philip	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
early	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
tap	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
sprang	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
and	NULL
opened	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
threshold	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
move	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
hesitated	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

gave	NULL
him	NULL

reminded	NULL
Philip	NULL
of	NULL

timid	NULL

puppy	NULL

Philip	NULL

Her	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL

a	NULL

abandonment	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
horribly	NULL
painful	NULL

and	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
torn	NULL

Without	NULL

what	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL

he	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

put	NULL

did	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL

surrendered	NULL

comforting	NULL

He	NULL
whispered	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
solace	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
scarcely	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
saying	NULL

he	NULL
bent	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
repeatedly	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL
awfully	NULL
unhappy	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
at	NULL

Her	NULL
hat	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
off	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
placed	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
more	NULL
comfortably	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

said	NULL

Fancy	NULL

Presently	NULL
the	NULL
violence	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
sobbing	NULL
diminished	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
chair	NULL

with	NULL
her	NULL

her	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL

paused	NULL

shut	NULL

A	NULL

Philip	NULL

he	NULL
spoke	NULL
it	NULL

without	NULL

it	NULL
out	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
up	NULL

looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL

that	NULL

sick	NULL

yet	NULL
the	NULL

it	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL

almost	NULL
expected	NULL

knew	NULL
that	NULL

was	NULL
horribly	NULL
jealous	NULL

the	NULL
sudden	NULL
passion	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
seized	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL

seemed	NULL

something	NULL

himself	NULL
helpless	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
natural	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
love	NULL
one	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
advantages	NULL
that	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
had	NULL
over	NULL
himself	NULL

confessed	NULL

in	NULL
Mildred	NULL

would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL

Friday	NULL

when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL

realised	NULL

gone	NULL
out	NULL

entirely	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL

were	NULL
engrossed	NULL
in	NULL
Griffiths	NULL

suddenly	NULL
hated	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
now	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
loved	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
was	NULL
stupid	NULL
,	NULL
oh	NULL
so	NULL
stupid	NULL
!	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
along	NULL

but	NULL
had	NULL
shut	NULL
his	NULL

it	NULL

empty-headed	NULL

that	NULL
charm	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
concealed	NULL
an	NULL

how	NULL

the	NULL

led	NULL

wandering	NULL
from	NULL

never	NULL
read	NULL
a	NULL

was	NULL
blind	NULL
to	NULL
everything	NULL

was	NULL
not	NULL
frivolous	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
a	NULL
thought	NULL

was	NULL
fine	NULL

the	NULL
word	NULL
most	NULL
common	NULL
on	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL

pleased	NULL
Mildred	NULL

suited	NULL
one	NULL

Philip	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
Mildred	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
mattered	NULL
to	NULL
neither	NULL

them	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL

wanted	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
of	NULL
Griffiths	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
no	NULL
opportunity	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
refer	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
two	NULL
evenings	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
off	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
casual	NULL

trying	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
suddenly	NULL
grown	NULL
indifferent	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
exercised	NULL

saying	NULL
little	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
would	NULL
wound	NULL
her	NULL

which	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
indefinite	NULL

so	NULL
delicately	NULL
cruel	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
exception	NULL

At	NULL

She	NULL

out	NULL
her	NULL

he	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL
good-bye	NULL

and	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
ironical	NULL
air	NULL
intimidated	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Often	NULL
his	NULL
shyness	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
seem	NULL
so	NULL
frigid	NULL
that	NULL
unintentionally	NULL
he	NULL
frightened	NULL
people	NULL

and	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
discovered	NULL
this	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
when	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
at	NULL

he	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
icy	NULL
deliberation	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
peculiarly	NULL
offensive	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
flushed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
she	NULL
hated	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
self-control	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
prevented	NULL
herself	NULL
from	NULL
flying	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL

gave	NULL
a	NULL

thud	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
ribs	NULL

he	NULL

the	NULL

The	NULL

That	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL

With	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
Mildred	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL

she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
thrown	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
society	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
alone	NULL
together	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
soon	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL

this	NULL
infatuation	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
safe	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
fiendish	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
break	NULL
down	NULL
their	NULL
scruples	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL

how	NULL

him	NULL

if	NULL
he	NULL
tempted	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL

they	NULL

he	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
fierce	NULL
joy	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
dishonour	NULL

Though	NULL
every	NULL

tortured	NULL
him	NULL

he	NULL
found	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
torture	NULL
a	NULL

That	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
passionate	NULL
note	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
which	NULL
struck	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
biting	NULL
his	NULL
nails	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
nervousness	NULL

"	NULL
Where	NULL

said	NULL
Philip	NULL

She	NULL
paused	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL

looking	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
forced	NULL
himself	NULL

look	NULL

her	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
friendly	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hated	NULL

loved	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
desk	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
out	NULL
what	NULL
money	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL

The	NULL
dress	NULL
was	NULL

LXXVII	NULL
After	NULL
lunching	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
basement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Medical	NULL
School	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
rooms	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Saturday	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
landlady	NULL
was	NULL
cleaning	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
in	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL

"	NULL

went	NULL

out	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL

back	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

sir	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
's	NULL
taken	NULL
his	NULL
luggage	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL
this	NULL
could	NULL
mean	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Burton	NULL
's	NULL
Journey	NULL
to	NULL
Meccah	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Westminster	NULL
Public	NULL
Library	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
page	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
no	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
elsewhere	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
listening	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
ring	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
away	NULL
already	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
Mildred	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
Cumberland	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
coming	NULL
presently	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
set	NULL
his	NULL
teeth	NULL
and	NULL
read	NULL
on	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
desperately	NULL
to	NULL
concentrate	NULL
his	NULL
attention	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
sentences	NULL
etched	NULL
themselves	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
brain	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
effort	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
distorted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
agony	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
enduring	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
horrible	NULL
proposition	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
them	NULL
money	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
he	NULL
lacked	NULL
the	NULL
strength	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
on	NULL
Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
account	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
morbid	NULL
obstinacy	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
which	NULL
forced	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
determined	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
pages	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
impression	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
started	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
reading	NULL
one	NULL
sentence	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
it	NULL
weaved	NULL
itself	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
,	NULL
horribly	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
some	NULL
formula	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
nightmare	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
thing	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
keep	NULL
away	NULL
till	NULL
midnight	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
then	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
them	NULL
calling	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
every	NULL
hour	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
disappointment	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
repeated	NULL
that	NULL
sentence	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
mechanically	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
them	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
know	NULL
then	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
infamy	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
for	NULL
men	NULL
to	NULL
descend	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
read	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
simply	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
leaned	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
closing	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
numb	NULL
with	NULL
misery	NULL
,	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
landlady	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

Miller	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Show	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
pulled	NULL
himself	NULL
together	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
her	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
feeling	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
impulse	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
and	NULL
seize	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
beg	NULL
her	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
moving	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
acted	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
ashamed	NULL

"	NULL

or	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Look	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
here	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
fiver	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'd	NULL
like	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
thanked	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
When	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
coming	NULL
back	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
Monday	NULL
.	NULL

Harry	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
home	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
was	NULL
humiliating	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
broken	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
jealousy	NULL
and	NULL
desire	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
sha	NULL
n't	NULL
I	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
the	NULL
note	NULL
of	NULL
appeal	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Of	NULL
course	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
let	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Through	NULL
the	NULL
curtains	NULL
he	NULL
watched	NULL
her	NULL
jump	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
four-wheeler	NULL
that	NULL
stood	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
rolled	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
threw	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
hid	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
tears	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
clenched	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
screwed	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
body	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
great	NULL
painful	NULL
sobs	NULL
were	NULL
forced	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
exhausted	NULL
and	NULL
ashamed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
washed	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
mixed	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
whiskey	NULL
and	NULL
soda	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
caught	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tickets	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
chimney-piece	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
seizing	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
impulse	NULL
of	NULL
rage	NULL
he	NULL
flung	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
back	NULL
on	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
relieved	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
destroy	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
search	NULL
of	NULL
someone	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
club	NULL
was	NULL
empty	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
mad	NULL
unless	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
someone	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Lawson	NULL
was	NULL
abroad	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
Hayward	NULL
's	NULL
rooms	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
who	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Brighton	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
week-end	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
gallery	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
closing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
distracted	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
Oxford	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
opposite	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
,	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
horror	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
wretched	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
Burton	NULL
's	NULL
book	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
himself	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
suggestion	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
offered	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
forced	NULL
it	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
happen	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
introduced	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
to	NULL
Mildred	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
vehement	NULL
passion	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
arouse	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
's	NULL
desire	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
reached	NULL
Oxford	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lodging-houses	NULL
in	NULL
John	NULL
Street	NULL
;	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
Oxford	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
had	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
exactly	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
dine	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Clarendon	NULL
:	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
dining	NULL
there	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
spree	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
got	NULL
himself	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
restaurant	NULL
near	NULL
Charing	NULL
Cross	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
play	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
afterwards	NULL
he	NULL
fought	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
pit	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
theatre	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Oscar	NULL
Wilde	NULL
's	NULL
pieces	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
performed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
Mildred	NULL
and	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
play	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
kill	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
somehow	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
stupid	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
content	NULL
themselves	NULL
with	NULL
conversation	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
fierce	NULL
delight	NULL
in	NULL
reminding	NULL
himself	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vulgarity	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
minds	NULL
which	NULL
suited	NULL
them	NULL
so	NULL
exactly	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
watched	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
abstracted	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
himself	NULL
gaiety	NULL
by	NULL
drinking	NULL
whiskey	NULL
in	NULL
each	NULL
interval	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
unused	NULL
to	NULL
alcohol	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
affected	NULL
him	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
drunkenness	NULL
was	NULL
savage	NULL
and	NULL
morose	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
another	NULL
drink	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
dreaded	NULL
the	NULL
pictures	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
vivid	NULL
imagination	NULL
would	NULL
place	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
drunk	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
seized	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
horrible	NULL
,	NULL
sordid	NULL
things	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
roll	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
gutters	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
whole	NULL
being	NULL
yearned	NULL
for	NULL
beastliness	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
grovel	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
up	NULL
Piccadilly	NULL
,	NULL
dragging	NULL
his	NULL
club-foot	NULL
,	NULL
sombrely	NULL
drunk	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
rage	NULL
and	NULL
misery	NULL
clawing	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
stopped	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
painted	NULL
harlot	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
pushed	NULL
her	NULL
violently	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
brutal	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
steps	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
stopped	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
sorry	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
so	NULL
roughly	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Go	NULL
to	NULL
hell	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
laughed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
merely	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
'd	NULL
do	NULL
me	NULL
the	NULL
honour	NULL
of	NULL
supping	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
tonight	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
amazement	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hesitated	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
drunk	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
amused	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
use	NULL
a	NULL
phrase	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
on	NULL
Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
restaurants	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
with	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
noticed	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
along	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
limb	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
club-foot	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Have	NULL
you	NULL
any	NULL
objection	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
are	NULL
a	NULL
cure	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
laughed	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
home	NULL
his	NULL
bones	NULL
were	NULL
aching	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
hammering	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
nearly	NULL
scream	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
another	NULL
whiskey	NULL
and	NULL
soda	NULL
to	NULL
steady	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
sank	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
dreamless	NULL
sleep	NULL
till	NULL
mid-day	NULL
.	NULL

LXXVIII	NULL
At	NULL
last	NULL
Monday	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
his	NULL
long	NULL
torture	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

Looking	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
trains	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
latest	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
could	NULL
reach	NULL
home	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
left	NULL
Oxford	NULL
soon	NULL
after	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
supposed	NULL
that	NULL
Mildred	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
started	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
later	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
desire	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
meet	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
Mildred	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
left	NULL
alone	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
drop	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
line	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
call	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
lodgings	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
:	NULL
his	NULL
spirit	NULL
was	NULL
cowed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
bitter	NULL
hatred	NULL
for	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
Mildred	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
heart-rending	NULL
desire	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
Hayward	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
on	NULL
Saturday	NULL
afternoon	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
distraught	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
search	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
comfort	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
prevented	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
telling	NULL
him	NULL
everything	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Hayward	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
astonished	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
weakness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
despise	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
be	NULL
shocked	NULL
or	NULL
disgusted	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
envisage	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
Mildred	NULL
his	NULL
mistress	NULL
after	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
another	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
care	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
shocking	NULL
or	NULL
disgusting	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
compromise	NULL
,	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
more	NULL
degrading	NULL
humiliations	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
gratify	NULL
his	NULL
desire	NULL
.	NULL

Towards	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
his	NULL
steps	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
will	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
lived	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
dark	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
venture	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
confident	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
promise	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
about	NULL
mid-day	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
arrived	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
home	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
best	NULL
man	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
wedding	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
over	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
every	NULL
possible	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
a	NULL
note	NULL
,	NULL
asking	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
dine	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
as	NULL
calmly	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
events	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
fortnight	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
mentioned	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
and	NULL
time	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hoping	NULL
against	NULL
hope	NULL
kept	NULL
the	NULL
appointment	NULL
:	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
Wednesday	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ashamed	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
sent	NULL
a	NULL
messenger-boy	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
and	NULL
instructions	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
back	NULL
a	NULL
reply	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
with	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
letter	NULL
unopened	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
answer	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
returned	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
beside	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
last	NULL
deception	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
bear	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
repeated	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
again	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
loathed	NULL
Mildred	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
ascribing	NULL
to	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
this	NULL
new	NULL
disappointment	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
delight	NULL
of	NULL
murder	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
about	NULL
considering	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
joy	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
stick	NULL
a	NULL
knife	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
throat	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
carotid	NULL
artery	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
leave	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
dog	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
senses	NULL
with	NULL
grief	NULL
and	NULL
rage	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
whiskey	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
drank	NULL
to	NULL
stupefy	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
drunk	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Tuesday	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Wednesday	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
Thursday	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
very	NULL
late	NULL
and	NULL
dragged	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
blear-eyed	NULL
and	NULL
sallow	NULL
,	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
any	NULL
letters	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
curious	NULL
feeling	NULL
shot	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
recognised	NULL
the	NULL
handwriting	NULL
of	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
.	NULL

Dear	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
:	NULL
I	NULL
hardly	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
I	NULL
feel	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
write	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
hope	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
not	NULL
awfully	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
I	NULL
ought	NULL
n't	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
Milly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
simply	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
help	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
simply	NULL
carried	NULL
me	NULL
off	NULL
my	NULL
feet	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
offered	NULL
us	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
I	NULL
simply	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
resist	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
awfully	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
myself	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
been	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wish	NULL
you	NULL
'd	NULL
write	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
not	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
awfully	NULL
hurt	NULL
at	NULL
your	NULL
telling	NULL
Milly	NULL
you	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

Do	NULL
write	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
line	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
chap	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
you	NULL
forgive	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
'll	NULL
ease	NULL
my	NULL
conscience	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL
or	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
offered	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
I	NULL
ought	NULL
n't	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
came	NULL
home	NULL
on	NULL
Monday	NULL
and	NULL
Milly	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
days	NULL
at	NULL
Oxford	NULL
by	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
's	NULL
going	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
on	NULL
Wednesday	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
you	NULL
receive	NULL
this	NULL
letter	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
hope	NULL
everything	NULL
will	NULL
go	NULL
off	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

Do	NULL
write	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
you	NULL
forgive	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

Please	NULL
write	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

Yours	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
Harry	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
tore	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
furiously	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
answer	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
despised	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
apologies	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
patience	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
prickings	NULL
of	NULL
conscience	NULL
:	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
a	NULL
dastardly	NULL
thing	NULL
if	NULL
one	NULL
chose	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
contemptible	NULL
to	NULL
regret	NULL
it	NULL
afterwards	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
cowardly	NULL
and	NULL
hypocritical	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
disgusted	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
sentimentality	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
easy	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
a	NULL
beastly	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
muttered	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
say	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
sorry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
hoped	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
chance	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
turn	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
events	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
dressed	NULL
hurriedly	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
waiting	NULL
to	NULL
shave	NULL
,	NULL
drank	NULL
a	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
cab	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
rooms	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
cab	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
crawl	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
painfully	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
he	NULL
uttered	NULL
a	NULL
prayer	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
God	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
receive	NULL
him	NULL
kindly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
only	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
forget	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
beating	NULL
heart	NULL
he	NULL
rang	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
forgot	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
suffering	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
passionate	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
enfold	NULL
her	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Miller	NULL
in	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
joyously	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
's	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
blankly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
came	NULL
about	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
ago	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
away	NULL
her	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Did	NULL
you	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
my	NULL
letter	NULL
?	NULL

Did	NULL
she	NULL
say	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
understood	NULL
that	NULL
Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
deceived	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
coming	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
daresay	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
hear	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
sent	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
another	NULL
address	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
hopeless	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
rooms	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
pity	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
kindness	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
charity	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
the	NULL
inevitable	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pain	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
suffering	NULL
was	NULL
horrible	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
sooner	NULL
be	NULL
dead	NULL
than	NULL
endure	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
finish	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
thing	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
throw	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
or	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
railway	NULL
line	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
sooner	NULL
set	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
into	NULL
words	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
rebelled	NULL
against	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
reason	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
get	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
unhappiness	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
might	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
forget	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
grotesque	NULL
to	NULL
kill	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
vulgar	NULL
slut	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
madness	NULL
to	NULL
fling	NULL
it	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
FELT	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
overcome	NULL
his	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
KNEW	NULL
that	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
stay	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
everything	NULL
reminded	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
unhappiness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
telegraphed	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
hurrying	NULL
to	NULL
pack	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
train	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
sordid	NULL
rooms	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
endured	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
suffering	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
breathe	NULL
clean	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
disgusted	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
mad	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
grown	NULL
up	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
given	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
spare	NULL
room	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
corner-room	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
window	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
tree	NULL
which	NULL
blocked	NULL
the	NULL
view	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
you	NULL
saw	NULL
,	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
field	NULL
,	NULL
broad	NULL
meadows	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
wall-paper	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
earliest	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL
were	NULL
quaint	NULL
water	NULL
colours	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
Victorian	NULL
period	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
's	NULL
youth	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
faded	NULL
charm	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dressing-table	NULL
was	NULL
surrounded	NULL
by	NULL
stiff	NULL
muslin	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
tall-boy	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
your	NULL
clothes	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
of	NULL
pleasure	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
things	NULL
meant	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
life	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
furniture	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
moved	NULL
from	NULL
one	NULL
place	NULL
to	NULL
another	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
ate	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
walk	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
fatter	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
narrow	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
living	NULL
without	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
and	NULL
missed	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
bickered	NULL
still	NULL
with	NULL
Josiah	NULL
Graves	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
churchwarden	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
thinner	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
whiter	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
austere	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
autocratic	NULL
still	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
disapproved	NULL
of	NULL
candles	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
altar	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
shops	NULL
had	NULL
still	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
quaintness	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
things	NULL
useful	NULL
to	NULL
seamen	NULL
were	NULL
sold	NULL
,	NULL
sea-boots	NULL
and	NULL
tarpaulins	NULL
and	NULL
tackle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
childhood	NULL
the	NULL
thrill	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
adventurous	NULL
magic	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
unknown	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
beating	NULL
at	NULL
each	NULL
double	NULL
knock	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
postman	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
Mildred	NULL
sent	NULL
on	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
landlady	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
none	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
more	NULL
calmly	NULL
he	NULL
understood	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
force	NULL
Mildred	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
attempting	NULL
the	NULL
impossible	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
passed	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
slave	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
convenient	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
sexual	NULL
instinct	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
why	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
occasion	NULL
so	NULL
vehement	NULL
an	NULL
attraction	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
person	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
irresistible	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
battle	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
friendship	NULL
,	NULL
gratitude	NULL
,	NULL
interest	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
power	NULL
beside	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
attracted	NULL
Mildred	NULL
sexually	NULL
,	NULL
nothing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
effect	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
idea	NULL
revolted	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
human	NULL
nature	NULL
beastly	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
suddenly	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
hearts	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
dark	NULL
places	NULL
.	NULL

Because	NULL
Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
indifferent	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
her	NULL
sexless	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
anaemic	NULL
appearance	NULL
and	NULL
thin	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
narrow	NULL
hips	NULL
and	NULL
flat	NULL
chest	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
languor	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
carried	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
supposition	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
sudden	NULL
passions	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
risk	NULL
everything	NULL
to	NULL
gratify	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
understood	NULL
her	NULL
adventure	NULL
with	NULL
Emil	NULL
Miller	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
unlike	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
thing	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
then	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
carried	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
ungovernable	NULL
desire	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
out	NULL
what	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
men	NULL
had	NULL
which	NULL
so	NULL
strangely	NULL
attracted	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
both	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
vulgar	NULL
facetiousness	NULL
which	NULL
tickled	NULL
her	NULL
simple	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
humour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
coarseness	NULL
of	NULL
nature	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
what	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
perhaps	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
blatant	NULL
sexuality	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
their	NULL
most	NULL
marked	NULL
characteristic	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
genteel	NULL
refinement	NULL
which	NULL
shuddered	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
bodily	NULL
functions	NULL
as	NULL
indecent	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
euphemisms	NULL
for	NULL
common	NULL
objects	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
always	NULL
chose	NULL
an	NULL
elaborate	NULL
word	NULL
as	NULL
more	NULL
becoming	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
simple	NULL
one	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
brutality	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
men	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
whip	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
thin	NULL
white	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
shuddered	NULL
with	NULL
voluptuous	NULL
pain	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
thing	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
lodgings	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
landlady	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
notice	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
things	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
unfurnished	NULL
rooms	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
pleasant	NULL
and	NULL
cheaper	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
urgent	NULL
consideration	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
year	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
nearly	NULL
seven	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
now	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
rigid	NULL
economy	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
with	NULL
panic	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
money	NULL
on	NULL
Mildred	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
again	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
act	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
amused	NULL
him	NULL
sometimes	NULL
to	NULL
consider	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
face	NULL
which	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
express	NULL
his	NULL
feelings	NULL
very	NULL
vividly	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
slow	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
moving	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
strong-minded	NULL
,	NULL
deliberate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cool	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
thought	NULL
him	NULL
reasonable	NULL
and	NULL
praised	NULL
his	NULL
common	NULL
sense	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
placid	NULL
expression	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
mask	NULL
,	NULL
assumed	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
acted	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
protective	NULL
colouring	NULL
of	NULL
butterflies	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
himself	NULL
was	NULL
astonished	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
weakness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
will	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
swayed	NULL
by	NULL
every	NULL
light	NULL
emotion	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
leaf	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
passion	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
powerless	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
self-control	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
merely	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
possess	NULL
it	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
indifferent	NULL
to	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
moved	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
considered	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
irony	NULL
the	NULL
philosophy	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
developed	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
of	NULL
much	NULL
use	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
conjuncture	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL
thought	NULL
really	NULL
helped	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
critical	NULL
affairs	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
rather	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
swayed	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
power	NULL
alien	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
within	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
urged	NULL
him	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
great	NULL
wind	NULL
of	NULL
Hell	NULL
which	NULL
drove	NULL
Paolo	NULL
and	NULL
Francesca	NULL
ceaselessly	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
act	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
powerless	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
grasp	NULL
of	NULL
instincts	NULL
,	NULL
emotions	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
what	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
acted	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
machine	NULL
driven	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
forces	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
environment	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
personality	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
reason	NULL
was	NULL
someone	NULL
looking	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
observing	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
but	NULL
powerless	NULL
to	NULL
interfere	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
those	NULL
gods	NULL
of	NULL
Epicurus	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
doings	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
empyrean	NULL
heights	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
might	NULL
to	NULL
alter	NULL
one	NULL
smallest	NULL
particle	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
occurred	NULL
.	NULL

LXXIX	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
days	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
session	NULL
began	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
himself	NULL
rooms	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hunted	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
that	NULL
led	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Westminster	NULL
Bridge	NULL
Road	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
their	NULL
dinginess	NULL
was	NULL
distasteful	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
Kennington	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
and	NULL
old-world	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
reminded	NULL
one	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
London	NULL
which	NULL
Thackeray	NULL
knew	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Kennington	NULL
Road	NULL
,	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
barouche	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Newcomes	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
passed	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
drove	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
West	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
plane-trees	NULL
were	NULL
bursting	NULL
into	NULL
leaf	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
houses	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
fixed	NULL
upon	NULL
were	NULL
two-storied	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
notice	NULL
to	NULL
state	NULL
that	NULL
lodgings	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knocked	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
announced	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
lodgings	NULL
were	NULL
unfurnished	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
shown	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
austere	NULL
,	NULL
silent	NULL
woman	NULL
four	NULL
very	NULL
small	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
kitchen	NULL
range	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
sink	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rent	NULL
was	NULL
nine	NULL
shillings	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
rent	NULL
was	NULL
low	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
settle	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
the	NULL
landlady	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
keep	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
clean	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
cook	NULL
his	NULL
breakfast	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
replied	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
enough	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
without	NULL
that	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
pleased	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
otherwise	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
intimated	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
his	NULL
rent	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
inquired	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
grocer	NULL
's	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
a	NULL
post	NULL
office	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
hear	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
'	NULL
do	NULL
'	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
furniture	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gathered	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
along	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
arm-chair	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
drawings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
Persian	NULL
rug	NULL
which	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
uncle	NULL
had	NULL
offered	NULL
a	NULL
fold-up	NULL
bed	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
let	NULL
his	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
August	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
use	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
spending	NULL
another	NULL
ten	NULL
pounds	NULL
Philip	NULL
bought	NULL
himself	NULL
whatever	NULL
else	NULL
was	NULL
essential	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spent	NULL
ten	NULL
shillings	NULL
on	NULL
putting	NULL
a	NULL
corn-coloured	NULL
paper	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
his	NULL
parlour	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
hung	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL
a	NULL
sketch	NULL
which	NULL
Lawson	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Quai	NULL
des	NULL
Grands	NULL
Augustins	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
photograph	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Odalisque	NULL
by	NULL
Ingres	NULL
and	NULL
Manet	NULL
's	NULL
Olympia	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
objects	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
contemplation	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
shaved	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
remind	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
too	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
been	NULL
engaged	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
practice	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
charcoal	NULL
drawing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
Spaniard	NULL
Miguel	NULL
Ajuria	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
thing	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
nude	NULL
standing	NULL
with	NULL
clenched	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
gripping	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
force	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
that	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
determination	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
impressive	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
Philip	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
interval	NULL
saw	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
the	NULL
defects	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
its	NULL
associations	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
tolerance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
Miguel	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
is	NULL
nothing	NULL
so	NULL
terrible	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
pursuit	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL
by	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
talent	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
worn	NULL
out	NULL
by	NULL
exposure	NULL
,	NULL
starvation	NULL
,	NULL
disease	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
hospital	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
access	NULL
of	NULL
despair	NULL
had	NULL
sought	NULL
death	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
turbid	NULL
Seine	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
perhaps	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
Southern	NULL
instability	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
struggle	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
accord	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
clerk	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
office	NULL
in	NULL
Madrid	NULL
,	NULL
turned	NULL
his	NULL
fervent	NULL
rhetoric	NULL
to	NULL
politics	NULL
and	NULL
bull-fighting	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
asked	NULL
Lawson	NULL
and	NULL
Hayward	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
new	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
bottle	NULL
of	NULL
whiskey	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pate	NULL
de	NULL
foie	NULL
gras	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
delighted	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
praised	NULL
his	NULL
taste	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
invited	NULL
the	NULL
Scotch	NULL
stockbroker	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
three	NULL
chairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
could	NULL
entertain	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
definite	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
guests	NULL
.	NULL

Lawson	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
through	NULL
him	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
very	NULL
friendly	NULL
with	NULL
Norah	NULL
Nesbit	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
remarked	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
run	NULL
across	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
was	NULL
asking	NULL
how	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
flushed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
mention	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
name	NULL
(	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
himself	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
awkward	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
reddening	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Lawson	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
quizzically	NULL
.	NULL

Lawson	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
now	NULL
spent	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
surrendered	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
environment	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
wear	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
short	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
dress	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
neat	NULL
serge	NULL
suit	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
bowler	NULL
hat	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
gather	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
is	NULL
over	NULL
between	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
months	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
rather	NULL
nice	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
smart	NULL
hat	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
white	NULL
ostrich	NULL
feathers	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
doing	NULL
pretty	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
changed	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
an	NULL
interval	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
talking	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
suddenly	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Did	NULL
you	NULL
gather	NULL
that	NULL
Norah	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
talked	NULL
very	NULL
nicely	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
eat	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Norah	NULL
often	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Mildred	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
thought	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
himself	NULL
bitterly	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
treated	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
impulse	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
depend	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
pity	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ashamed	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
good	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
always	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
treated	NULL
her	NULL
abominably	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
only	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
to	NULL
stick	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Lawson	NULL
and	NULL
Hayward	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
smoking	NULL
a	NULL
last	NULL
pipe	NULL
before	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
pleasant	NULL
hours	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cosy	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
in	NULL
Vincent	NULL
Square	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
visits	NULL
to	NULL
galleries	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
charming	NULL
evenings	NULL
of	NULL
intimate	NULL
conversation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
recollected	NULL
her	NULL
solicitude	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
welfare	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
concerned	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
love	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
kind	NULL
and	NULL
lasting	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
sensuality	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
maternal	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
known	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
precious	NULL
thing	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
thank	NULL
the	NULL
gods	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
mercy	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
suffered	NULL
horribly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
greatness	NULL
of	NULL
heart	NULL
to	NULL
forgive	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
incapable	NULL
of	NULL
malice	NULL
.	NULL

Should	NULL
he	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL

No	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
break	NULL
in	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
suddenly	NULL
and	NULL
cast	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
came	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
feel	NULL
too	NULL
shy	NULL
to	NULL
perform	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
dramatic	NULL
gesture	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
rely	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
cured	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hateful	NULL
disease	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
her	NULL
worth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
trust	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
imagination	NULL
leaped	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
pictured	NULL
himself	NULL
rowing	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
on	NULL
Sundays	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
Greenwich	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
forgotten	NULL
that	NULL
delightful	NULL
excursion	NULL
with	NULL
Hayward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Port	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
remained	NULL
a	NULL
permanent	NULL
treasure	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
recollection	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
warm	NULL
summer	NULL
afternoons	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
sit	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Park	NULL
together	NULL
and	NULL
talk	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
laughed	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
her	NULL
gay	NULL
chatter	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
brook	NULL
bubbling	NULL
over	NULL
little	NULL
stones	NULL
,	NULL
amusing	NULL
,	NULL
flippant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
character	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
agony	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
would	NULL
pass	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
dream	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
tea-time	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
pretty	NULL
certain	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
Norah	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knocked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
door	NULL
his	NULL
courage	NULL
suddenly	NULL
failed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
forgive	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
abominable	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
force	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
presence	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
door	NULL
was	NULL
opened	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
maid	NULL
new	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
calling	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
inquired	NULL
if	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Nesbit	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Will	NULL
you	NULL
ask	NULL
her	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
wait	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
maid	NULL
ran	NULL
upstairs	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
clattered	NULL
down	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Will	NULL
you	NULL
step	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
please	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL
.	NULL

Second	NULL
floor	NULL
front	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
fluttering	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knocked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
well-known	NULL
,	NULL
cheerful	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
peace	NULL
and	NULL
happiness	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
entered	NULL
Norah	NULL
stepped	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
greet	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
parted	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
man	NULL
stood	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
--	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Kingsford	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
bitterly	NULL
disappointed	NULL
at	NULL
not	NULL
finding	NULL
her	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
stock	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stranger	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
mention	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
occupy	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
forty	NULL
,	NULL
clean-shaven	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
long	NULL
fair	NULL
hair	NULL
very	NULL
neatly	NULL
plastered	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
reddish	NULL
skin	NULL
and	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
tired	NULL
eyes	NULL
which	NULL
fair	NULL
men	NULL
get	NULL
when	NULL
their	NULL
youth	NULL
is	NULL
passed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
nose	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
mouth	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
bones	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
were	NULL
prominent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
heavily	NULL
made	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
average	NULL
height	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
broad-shouldered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
wondering	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Norah	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
sprightly	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
met	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Lawson	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
day	NULL
--	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
informed	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
high	NULL
time	NULL
you	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
me	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
no	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
embarrassment	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
countenance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
admired	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
carried	NULL
off	NULL
an	NULL
encounter	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
himself	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
intense	NULL
awkwardness	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
tea	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
sugar	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
stopped	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
stupid	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
cried	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
forgot	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL
remember	NULL
quite	NULL
well	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
took	NULL
sugar	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
tea	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
accepted	NULL
the	NULL
incident	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
sign	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
nonchalance	NULL
was	NULL
affected	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
conversation	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
interrupted	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

Kingsford	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
particular	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
fluently	NULL
and	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
humour	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
slightly	NULL
dogmatic	NULL
manner	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
journalist	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
something	NULL
amusing	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
on	NULL
every	NULL
topic	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
touched	NULL
upon	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
exasperated	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
himself	NULL
edged	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
the	NULL
visitor	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
admired	NULL
Norah	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
days	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
flirt	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
to	NULL
matters	NULL
which	NULL
only	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
Norah	NULL
knew	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
each	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
journalist	NULL
broke	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
drawing	NULL
it	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
subject	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
grew	NULL
faintly	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
Norah	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
see	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
made	NULL
ridiculous	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
inflicting	NULL
this	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
punishment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
regained	NULL
his	NULL
good	NULL
humour	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
clock	NULL
struck	NULL
six	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Kingsford	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Norah	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
accompanied	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
landing	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
shut	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
outside	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
minutes	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
talking	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Who	NULL
is	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Kingsford	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
cheerfully	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
returned	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
editor	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Harmsworth	NULL
's	NULL
Magazines	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
's	NULL
been	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
work	NULL
lately	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
going	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
glad	NULL
you	NULL
stayed	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
talk	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
curled	NULL
herself	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
arm-chair	NULL
,	NULL
feet	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
her	NULL
small	NULL
size	NULL
made	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lit	NULL
a	NULL
cigarette	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
smiled	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
assume	NULL
the	NULL
attitude	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
amused	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
look	NULL
just	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
cat	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
flash	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
fine	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
really	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
break	NULL
myself	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
absurd	NULL
to	NULL
behave	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
my	NULL
age	NULL

but	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
comfortable	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
legs	NULL
under	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
awfully	NULL
jolly	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
room	NULL
again	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
happily	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
missed	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
on	NULL
earth	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
come	NULL
before	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
gaily	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
reddening	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
kindness	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
lips	NULL
outlined	NULL
a	NULL
charming	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
need	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
hesitated	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
D'you	NULL
remember	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
time	NULL
we	NULL
met	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
treated	NULL
you	NULL
awfully	NULL
badly	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
steadily	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
losing	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
on	NULL
an	NULL
errand	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
now	NULL
realising	NULL
the	NULL
outrageousness	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
blurt	NULL
out	NULL
bluntly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Can	NULL
you	NULL
ever	NULL
forgive	NULL
me	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
impetuously	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
unhappiness	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
great	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
almost	NULL
killed	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
birth	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
meeting	NULL
with	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
folly	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
trust	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
immense	NULL
deception	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
how	NULL
often	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
kindness	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
bitterly	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
regretted	NULL
throwing	NULL
it	NULL
away	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
been	NULL
happy	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL

he	NULL
knew	NULL
now	NULL
how	NULL
great	NULL

her	NULL
worth	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
voice	NULL
was	NULL
hoarse	NULL
with	NULL
emotion	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
fixed	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
distorted	NULL
with	NULL
pain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
relief	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
finished	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
flung	NULL
himself	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
exhausted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
concealed	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
self-abasement	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
striven	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
himself	NULL
more	NULL
despicable	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
really	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
raised	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
lost	NULL
in	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Have	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
got	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
started	NULL
and	NULL
reddened	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
afraid	NULL
you	NULL
've	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
sorry	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
seemed	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
stopped	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
length	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
force	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
engaged	NULL

Mr.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL

he	NULL
cried	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

I	NULL
met	NULL
him	NULL
soon	NULL
after	NULL
you	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
search	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
expression	NULL
that	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
wound	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
your	NULL
friend	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
wretched	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
extremely	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
someone	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
me	NULL
suffer	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
he	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL

it	NULL

you	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
without	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
suddenly	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
working	NULL
,	NULL
working	NULL
,	NULL
working	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
tired	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
so	NULL
ill	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
my	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
offered	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
me	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
my	NULL
divorce	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
marry	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
job	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
unless	NULL
I	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
care	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
awfully	NULL
touched	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
very	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Have	NULL
you	NULL
got	NULL
your	NULL
divorce	NULL

"	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
decree	NULL

It	NULL
'll	NULL

in	NULL
July	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL

are	NULL
going	NULL

be	NULL
married	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

For	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
anything	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
made	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
of	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
muttered	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
humiliating	NULL
confession	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
curiously	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
were	NULL
never	NULL
really	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
pleasant	NULL
being	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
recover	NULL
himself	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
getting	NULL
up	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
holding	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
hope	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
wistfully	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
held	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
'll	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
me	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
shaking	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
me	NULL
too	NULL
envious	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
slowly	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
disappointed	NULL
,	NULL
irritated	NULL
even	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
vanity	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
affected	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
presently	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
gods	NULL
had	NULL
played	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
practical	NULL
joke	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
himself	NULL
mirthlessly	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
comfortable	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
gift	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
amused	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
own	NULL
absurdity	NULL
.	NULL

LXXX	NULL
For	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
Philip	NULL
worked	NULL
on	NULL
subjects	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
new	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
unwieldy	NULL
crowd	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
Medical	NULL
School	NULL
nearly	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
had	NULL
thinned	NULL
out	NULL
:	NULL
some	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
,	NULL
finding	NULL
the	NULL
examinations	NULL
more	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
than	NULL
they	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
taken	NULL
away	NULL
by	NULL
parents	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
foreseen	NULL
the	NULL
expense	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
had	NULL
drifted	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
other	NULL
callings	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
youth	NULL
whom	NULL
Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
had	NULL
devised	NULL
an	NULL
ingenious	NULL
plan	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
money	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
things	NULL
at	NULL
sales	NULL
and	NULL
pawned	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
presently	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
more	NULL
profitable	NULL
to	NULL
pawn	NULL
goods	NULL
bought	NULL
on	NULL
credit	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
caused	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
excitement	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
when	NULL
someone	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
in	NULL
police-court	NULL
proceedings	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
remand	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
assurances	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
harassed	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
the	NULL
White	NULL
Man	NULL
's	NULL
Burden	NULL
overseas	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
imagination	NULL
of	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
lad	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
before	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
town	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
fell	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
glamour	NULL
of	NULL
music-halls	NULL
and	NULL
bar	NULL
parlours	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
spent	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
among	NULL
racing-men	NULL
,	NULL
tipsters	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
trainers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
was	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
book-maker	NULL
's	NULL
clerk	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
once	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
bar	NULL
near	NULL
Piccadilly	NULL
Circus	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
tight-waisted	NULL
coat	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
brown	NULL
hat	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
broad	NULL
,	NULL
flat	NULL
brim	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
third	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
gift	NULL
for	NULL
singing	NULL
and	NULL
mimicry	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
achieved	NULL
success	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
smoking	NULL
concerts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Medical	NULL
School	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
imitation	NULL
of	NULL
notorious	NULL
comedians	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
abandoned	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
chorus	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
musical	NULL
comedy	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
interested	NULL
Philip	NULL
because	NULL
his	NULL
uncouth	NULL
manner	NULL
and	NULL
interjectional	NULL
speech	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
suggest	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
deep	NULL
emotion	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
stifle	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
houses	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
grew	NULL
haggard	NULL
in	NULL
shut-in	NULL
spaces	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
he	NULL
possessed	NULL
struggled	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
sparrow	NULL
held	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
little	NULL
frightened	NULL
gasps	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
palpitation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
yearned	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
broad	NULL
skies	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
desolate	NULL
places	NULL
among	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
childhood	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
spent	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
off	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
to	NULL
anybody	NULL
,	NULL
between	NULL
one	NULL
lecture	NULL
and	NULL
another	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
thing	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
heard	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thrown	NULL
up	NULL
medicine	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
working	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
farm	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
attended	NULL
now	NULL
lectures	NULL
on	NULL
medicine	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
surgery	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
certain	NULL
mornings	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
he	NULL
practised	NULL
bandaging	NULL
on	NULL
out-patients	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
earn	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
taught	NULL
auscultation	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
the	NULL
stethoscope	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
learned	NULL
dispensing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
taking	NULL
the	NULL
examination	NULL
in	NULL
Materia	NULL
Medica	NULL
in	NULL
July	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
amused	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
with	NULL
various	NULL
drugs	NULL
,	NULL
concocting	NULL
mixtures	NULL
,	NULL
rolling	NULL
pills	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
making	NULL
ointments	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seized	NULL
avidly	NULL
upon	NULL
anything	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
extract	NULL
a	NULL
suggestion	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
interest	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
once	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
of	NULL
cutting	NULL
him	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
avoided	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
self-consciousness	NULL
with	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
'	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
were	NULL
now	NULL
friends	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
realised	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
quarrel	NULL
with	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
and	NULL
surmised	NULL
they	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL

a	NULL
languid	NULL

a	NULL
youth	NULL
called	NULL
Ramsden	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Griffiths	NULL

Philip	NULL
that	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL

hurt	NULL
because	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
answered	NULL
his	NULL

He	NULL

one	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
guessed	NULL
how	NULL
violently	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
beating	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
waited	NULL
impatiently	NULL
for	NULL
Ramsden	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
you	NULL

Quite	NULL

Little	NULL
by	NULL
little	NULL
he	NULL
discovered	NULL
the	NULL
history	NULL
of	NULL
Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
relations	NULL
with	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
listened	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
feigning	NULL
an	NULL
equanimity	NULL
which	NULL
quite	NULL
deceived	NULL
the	NULL
dull-witted	NULL
boy	NULL
who	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
week-end	NULL
she	NULL
spent	NULL
with	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
at	NULL
Oxford	NULL
inflamed	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
extinguished	NULL
her	NULL
sudden	NULL
passion	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
unexpected	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
she	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
in	NULL
Oxford	NULL
by	NULL
herself	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
happy	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
could	NULL
induce	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
revolted	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Griffiths	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
aback	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
aroused	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
his	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
somewhat	NULL
tedious	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
an	NULL
amusing	NULL
episode	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
tiresome	NULL
affair	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
promise	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
an	NULL
honest	NULL
,	NULL
decent	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
natural	NULL
politeness	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
himself	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
everybody	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
home	NULL
he	NULL
wrote	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
charming	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
answered	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
reams	NULL
of	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
clumsy	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
gift	NULL
of	NULL
expression	NULL
,	NULL
ill-written	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
vulgar	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
bored	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
followed	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
by	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
third	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
her	NULL
love	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
flattering	NULL
but	NULL
alarming	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
bombarded	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
telegrams	NULL
,	NULL
asking	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
ill	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
received	NULL
her	NULL
letters	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
his	NULL
silence	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
anxious	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
sought	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
his	NULL
reply	NULL
as	NULL
casual	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
without	NULL
being	NULL
offensive	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
begged	NULL
her	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
wire	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
telegrams	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
person	NULL
for	NULL
whom	NULL
a	NULL
telegram	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
an	NULL
event	NULL
to	NULL
excite	NULL
tremor	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
answered	NULL
by	NULL
return	NULL
of	NULL
post	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
announced	NULL
her	NULL
intention	NULL
to	NULL
pawn	NULL
things	NULL
(	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
dressing-case	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
wedding-present	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
raise	NULL
eight	NULL
pounds	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
)	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
stay	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
market	NULL
town	NULL
four	NULL
miles	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
practised	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
frightened	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
telegraph	NULL
wires	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
do	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
been	NULL
asking	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
appointment	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
seeing	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
told	NULL
Mildred	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
there	NULL
on	NULL
any	NULL
pretext	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
an	NULL
absence	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
bored	NULL
him	NULL
quite	NULL
decidedly	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
troubled	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
break	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
who	NULL
dreaded	NULL
quarrels	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
pain	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
determined	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
Mildred	NULL
bother	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
pleasant	NULL
,	NULL
cheerful	NULL
,	NULL
amusing	NULL
,	NULL
affectionate	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
invented	NULL
convincing	NULL
excuses	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
interval	NULL
since	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
everything	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
forced	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
appointments	NULL
he	NULL
sent	NULL
telegrams	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
moment	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
himself	NULL
off	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
landlady	NULL
(	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
appointment	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
spending	NULL
in	NULL
rooms	NULL
)	NULL
had	NULL
orders	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
when	NULL
Mildred	NULL
called	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
waylay	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
waiting	NULL
about	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
charming	NULL
,	NULL
friendly	NULL
words	NULL
and	NULL
bolt	NULL
off	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
excuse	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
business	NULL
engagement	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
grew	NULL
very	NULL
skilful	NULL
in	NULL
slipping	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
unseen	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
lodgings	NULL
at	NULL
midnight	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
standing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
area	NULL
railings	NULL
and	NULL
suspecting	NULL
who	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
beg	NULL
a	NULL
shake-down	NULL
in	NULL
Ramsden	NULL
's	NULL
rooms	NULL
;	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
the	NULL
landlady	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
sat	NULL
crying	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
doorsteps	NULL
for	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
send	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
policeman	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Ramsden	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
jolly	NULL
well	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Harry	NULL
says	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
'd	NULL
suspected	NULL
for	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
blooming	NULL
nuisance	NULL
of	NULL
herself	NULL
he	NULL
'd	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
himself	NULL
damned	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
sitting	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
doorstep	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
hours	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
dully	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
landlady	NULL
who	NULL
sent	NULL
her	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wonder	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
's	NULL
doing	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
's	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
job	NULL
somewhere	NULL
,	NULL
thank	NULL
God	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
keeps	NULL
her	NULL
busy	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
last	NULL
thing	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
session	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
,	NULL
urbanity	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
way	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
exasperation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
constant	NULL
persecution	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
Mildred	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sick	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
pestered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
take	NULL
herself	NULL
off	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
bother	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Ramsden	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
too	NULL
thick	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
then	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
n't	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
ten	NULL
days	NULL

You	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
Harry	NULL
's	NULL
wonderful	NULL
at	NULL
dropping	NULL
people	NULL

This	NULL
is	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
toughest	NULL
nut	NULL
he	NULL
's	NULL
ever	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
crack	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
's	NULL
cracked	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
Philip	NULL
heard	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
vanished	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
vast	NULL
anonymous	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
population	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

LXXXI	NULL
At	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
session	NULL
Philip	NULL
became	NULL
an	NULL
out-patients	NULL
'	NULL
clerk	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
three	NULL
assistant-physicians	NULL
who	NULL
took	NULL
out-patients	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
each	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
down	NULL
for	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
popular	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
students	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
some	NULL
competition	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
clerk	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
thin	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
thirty-five	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
small	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
red	NULL
hair	NULL
cut	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
prominent	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
:	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
bright	NULL
scarlet	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
well	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
joke	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
treated	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
lightly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
successful	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
consulting	NULL
practice	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
knighthood	NULL
in	NULL
prospect	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
commerce	NULL
with	NULL
students	NULL
and	NULL
poor	NULL
people	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
patronising	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
dealing	NULL
always	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sick	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
healthy	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
jovial	NULL
condescension	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
some	NULL
consultants	NULL
achieve	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
professional	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
patient	NULL
feel	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
confronted	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
jolly	NULL
schoolmaster	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
illness	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
absurd	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
naughtiness	NULL
which	NULL
amused	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
irritated	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
student	NULL
was	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
attend	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
out-patients	NULL
'	NULL
room	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
see	NULL
cases	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pick	NULL
up	NULL
what	NULL
information	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
clerked	NULL
his	NULL
duties	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
definite	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
out-patients	NULL
'	NULL
department	NULL
at	NULL
St.	NULL
Luke	NULL
's	NULL
consisted	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
leading	NULL
into	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
,	NULL
dark	NULL
waiting-room	NULL
with	NULL
massive	NULL
pillars	NULL
of	NULL
masonry	NULL
and	NULL
long	NULL
benches	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
the	NULL
patients	NULL
waited	NULL
after	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
given	NULL
their	NULL
'	NULL
letters	NULL
'	NULL
at	NULL
mid-day	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
rows	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
bottles	NULL
and	NULL
gallipots	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
tattered	NULL
and	NULL
dirty	NULL
,	NULL
others	NULL
decent	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dimness	NULL
,	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
women	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
ages	NULL
,	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
one	NULL
an	NULL
impression	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
weird	NULL
and	NULL
horrible	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
suggested	NULL
the	NULL
grim	NULL
drawings	NULL
of	NULL
Daumier	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL
were	NULL
painted	NULL
alike	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
salmon-colour	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
high	NULL
dado	NULL
of	NULL
maroon	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
an	NULL
odour	NULL
of	NULL
disinfectants	NULL
,	NULL
mingling	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
wore	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
crude	NULL
stench	NULL
of	NULL
humanity	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
largest	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
table	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
office	NULL
chair	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
physician	NULL
;	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
smaller	NULL
tables	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
lower	NULL
:	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
sat	NULL
the	NULL
house-physician	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
the	NULL
clerk	NULL
who	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
book	NULL
'	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
volume	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
written	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
sex	NULL
,	NULL
profession	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
patient	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
diagnosis	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
disease	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
half	NULL
past	NULL
one	NULL
the	NULL
house-physician	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
rang	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL

the	NULL
porter	NULL
to	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
always	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
many	NULL

these	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL

through	NULL

many	NULL

before	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
came	NULL
at	NULL
two	NULL

The	NULL
H.P.	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
Philip	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
contact	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dapper	NULL
little	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
excessively	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
importance	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
treated	NULL
the	NULL
clerks	NULL
with	NULL
condescension	NULL
and	NULL
patently	NULL
resented	NULL
the	NULL
familiarity	NULL
of	NULL
older	NULL
students	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
contemporaries	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
use	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
respect	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
present	NULL
position	NULL
demanded	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
set	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
cases	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
clerk	NULL
helped	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
patients	NULL
streamed	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
men	NULL
came	NULL
first	NULL
.	NULL

Chronic	NULL
bronchitis	NULL

"	NULL
a	NULL
nasty	NULL

"	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
chiefly	NULL
suffered	NULL
from	NULL
;	NULL
one	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
H.P.	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
clerk	NULL
,	NULL
handing	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
letters	NULL
:	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
well	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
Rep	NULL
14	NULL
were	NULL
written	NULL
on	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dispensary	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
bottles	NULL
or	NULL
gallipots	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
medicine	NULL
given	NULL
them	NULL
for	NULL
fourteen	NULL
days	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
old	NULL
stagers	NULL
held	NULL
back	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
physician	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
seldom	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
condition	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
demand	NULL
his	NULL
attention	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
kept	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
quick	NULL
movements	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
breezy	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
reminded	NULL
one	NULL
slightly	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
clown	NULL
leaping	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
arena	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
circus	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
cry	NULL
:	NULL
Here	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
air	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
indicate	NULL
:	NULL
What	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
nonsense	NULL
about	NULL
being	NULL
ill	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
soon	NULL
put	NULL
that	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
seat	NULL
,	NULL
asked	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
any	NULL
old	NULL
patients	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
rapidly	NULL
passed	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
review	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
shrewd	NULL
eyes	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
discussed	NULL
their	NULL
symptoms	NULL
,	NULL
cracked	NULL
a	NULL
joke	NULL
(	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
clerks	NULL
laughed	NULL
heartily	NULL
)	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
H.P.	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
laughed	NULL
heartily	NULL
too	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
impudent	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
clerks	NULL
to	NULL
laugh	NULL
,	NULL
remarked	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
hot	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rang	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
porter	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
patients	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
sat	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
old	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
middle-aged	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
mostly	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
labouring	NULL
class	NULL
,	NULL
dock	NULL
labourers	NULL
,	NULL
draymen	NULL
,	NULL
factory	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
barmen	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
some	NULL
,	NULL
neatly	NULL
dressed	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
station	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
obviously	NULL
superior	NULL
,	NULL
shop-assistants	NULL
,	NULL
clerks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
like	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
these	NULL
with	NULL
suspicion	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
they	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
shabby	NULL
clothes	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
pretend	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
poor	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
keen	NULL
eye	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
regarded	NULL
as	NULL
fraud	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
well	NULL
pay	NULL
for	NULL
medical	NULL
attendance	NULL
.	NULL

Women	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
offenders	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
managed	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
more	NULL
clumsily	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
wear	NULL
a	NULL
cloak	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
skirt	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
almost	NULL
in	NULL
rags	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
neglect	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
rings	NULL
off	NULL
their	NULL
fingers	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
afford	NULL
to	NULL
wear	NULL
jewellery	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
afford	NULL
a	NULL
doctor	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
hospital	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
charitable	NULL
institution	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
handed	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
my	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
care	NULL
a	NULL

about	NULL
your	NULL

out	NULL

You	NULL
've	NULL

no	NULL

and	NULL
steal	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL

by	NULL
the	NULL
really	NULL
poor	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
patient	NULL
retired	NULL
sulkily	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
angry	NULL
scowl	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
'll	NULL
probably	NULL
write	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
papers	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
gross	NULL
mismanagement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
London	NULL
hospitals	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
paper	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
patient	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
shrewd	NULL
glances	NULL
.	NULL

Most	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
institution	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
state	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
paid	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rates	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
attendance	NULL
they	NULL
received	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
claim	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
imagined	NULL
the	NULL
physician	NULL
who	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
was	NULL
heavily	NULL
paid	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
gave	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
clerks	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
to	NULL
examine	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
clerk	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
patient	NULL
into	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
inner	NULL
rooms	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
smaller	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
each	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
couch	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
black	NULL
horse-hair	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
his	NULL
patient	NULL
a	NULL
variety	NULL
of	NULL
questions	NULL
,	NULL
examined	NULL
his	NULL
lungs	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
liver	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
notes	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
formed	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
mind	NULL
some	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
diagnosis	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
followed	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
crowd	NULL
of	NULL
students	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
clerk	NULL
read	NULL
out	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
physician	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
questions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
examined	NULL
the	NULL
patient	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
anything	NULL
interesting	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
students	NULL
applied	NULL
their	NULL
stethoscope	NULL
:	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
chest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
perhaps	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
others	NULL
waited	NULL
impatiently	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
patient	NULL
stood	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
altogether	NULL
displeased	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
himself	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
attention	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
listened	NULL
confusedly	NULL
while	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
discoursed	NULL
glibly	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
students	NULL
listened	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
recognise	NULL
the	NULL
murmur	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
crepitation	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
physician	NULL
described	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
told	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
clothes	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
cases	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
examined	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
again	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
desk	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
any	NULL
student	NULL
who	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
standing	NULL
near	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
prescribe	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
patient	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
seen	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
student	NULL
mentioned	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
drugs	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Would	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
original	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
events	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
we	NULL
'll	NULL
be	NULL
rash	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

This	NULL
always	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
students	NULL
laugh	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
twinkle	NULL
of	NULL
amusement	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
bright	NULL
humour	NULL
the	NULL
physician	NULL
prescribed	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
drug	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
student	NULL
had	NULL
suggested	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
cases	NULL
of	NULL
exactly	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
sort	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
student	NULL
proposed	NULL
the	NULL
treatment	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
physician	NULL
had	NULL
ordered	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
exercised	NULL
considerable	NULL
ingenuity	NULL
in	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dispensary	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
worked	NULL
off	NULL
their	NULL
legs	NULL
and	NULL
preferred	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
medicines	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
ready	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
hospital	NULL
mixtures	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
found	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
experience	NULL
of	NULL
years	NULL
to	NULL
answer	NULL
their	NULL
purpose	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
amused	NULL
himself	NULL
by	NULL
writing	NULL
an	NULL
elaborate	NULL
prescription	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
'll	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
dispenser	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
we	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
prescribing	NULL
mist	NULL
:	NULL
alb	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
'll	NULL
lose	NULL
his	NULL
cunning	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
students	NULL
laughed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
circular	NULL
glance	NULL
of	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
joke	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
touched	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
porter	NULL
poked	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Old	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
please	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
leaned	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
chatting	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
H.P.	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
porter	NULL
herded	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
patients	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
strings	NULL
of	NULL
anaemic	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
large	NULL
fringes	NULL
and	NULL
pallid	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
digest	NULL
their	NULL
bad	NULL

insufficient	NULL
food	NULL

old	NULL
ladies	NULL

this	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
house-physician	NULL
got	NULL
through	NULL
them	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

Time	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
growing	NULL
more	NULL
sickly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
physician	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
watch	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
there	NULL
many	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
H.P.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL

They	NULL
entered	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
common	NULL
ailments	NULL
were	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
excessive	NULL
use	NULL

alcohol	NULL

but	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL

By	NULL
about	NULL
six	NULL
o'clock	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
finished	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
exhausted	NULL
by	NULL
standing	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
bad	NULL
air	NULL

and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
attention	NULL

given	NULL

strolled	NULL
over	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
fellow-clerks	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Medical	NULL
School	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
tea	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL

absorbing	NULL
interest	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
humanity	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rough	NULL

the	NULL
materials	NULL
the	NULL
artist	NULL
worked	NULL
on	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL

when	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
artist	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
patients	NULL
were	NULL

the	NULL

gave	NULL
a	NULL
thrill	NULL

an	NULL

could	NULL
guess	NULL
their	NULL
trades	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
learnt	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
your	NULL
questions	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
understood	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
discovered	NULL
on	NULL
what	NULL
subjects	NULL
nearly	NULL
all	NULL
lied	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
what	NULL
inquiries	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
extort	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
different	NULL
way	NULL
people	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
diagnosis	NULL
of	NULL
dangerous	NULL
illness	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
accepted	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
laugh	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
joke	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
another	NULL
with	NULL
dumb	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
shy	NULL
with	NULL
these	NULL
people	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
with	NULL
others	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
not	NULL
exactly	NULL
sympathy	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
sympathy	NULL
suggests	NULL
condescension	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
ease	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
given	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
patient	NULL
delivered	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
confidence	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
perhaps	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
cut	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
doctor	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
lark	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
hit	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
fit	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
alone	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
clerks	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
dramatic	NULL
interest	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
afternoons	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
women	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
cases	NULL
,	NULL
good	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
complicated	NULL
,	NULL
tiresome	NULL
if	NULL
obvious	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
heard	NULL
murmurs	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
astonished	NULL
at	NULL
abnormal	NULL
livers	NULL
;	NULL
an	NULL
unexpected	NULL
sound	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lungs	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
an	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
just	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shape	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
length	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
noses	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
room	NULL
human	NULL
nature	NULL
taken	NULL
by	NULL
surprise	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
often	NULL
the	NULL
mask	NULL
of	NULL
custom	NULL
was	NULL
torn	NULL
off	NULL
rudely	NULL
,	NULL
showing	NULL
you	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
all	NULL
raw	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
you	NULL
saw	NULL
an	NULL
untaught	NULL
stoicism	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
profoundly	NULL
moving	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
rough	NULL
and	NULL
illiterate	NULL
,	NULL
told	NULL
his	NULL
case	NULL
was	NULL
hopeless	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
self-controlled	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
splendid	NULL
instinct	NULL
which	NULL
forced	NULL
the	NULL
fellow	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
a	NULL
stiff	NULL
upper-lip	NULL
before	NULL
strangers	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
brave	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
by	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
face	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
would	NULL
he	NULL
then	NULL
surrender	NULL
to	NULL
despair	NULL
?	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
tragedy	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
brought	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
examined	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
of	NULL
eighteen	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
delicate	NULL
features	NULL
and	NULL
large	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
fair	NULL
hair	NULL
that	NULL
sparkled	NULL
with	NULL
gold	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
ray	NULL
of	NULL
autumn	NULL
sunshine	NULL
touched	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
skin	NULL
of	NULL
amazing	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
students	NULL
'	NULL
eyes	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
little	NULL
smiles	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
often	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
girl	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
dingy	NULL
rooms	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
elder	NULL
woman	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
history	NULL
,	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
of	NULL
phthisis	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
brother	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
ones	NULL
left	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
coughing	NULL
lately	NULL
and	NULL
losing	NULL
weight	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
blouse	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
skin	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
neck	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
milk	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
examined	NULL
her	NULL
quietly	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
rapid	NULL
method	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
clerks	NULL
to	NULL
apply	NULL
their	NULL
stethoscopes	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
he	NULL
indicated	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
finger	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
dress	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sister	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
apart	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
hear	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
voice	NULL
trembled	NULL
with	NULL
fear	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
has	NULL
n't	NULL
got	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
doctor	NULL
,	NULL
has	NULL
she	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
afraid	NULL
there	NULL
's	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
goes	NULL
I	NULL
sha	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
anybody	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
gravely	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
too	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
type	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
old	NULL
bones	NULL
either	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
understood	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
meant	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
colour	NULL
fled	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
lovely	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
tears	NULL
fell	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
two	NULL
stood	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
crying	NULL
silently	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
older	NULL
,	NULL
forgetting	NULL
the	NULL
indifferent	NULL
crowd	NULL
that	NULL
watched	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rocked	NULL
her	NULL
gently	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
fro	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
baby	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
gone	NULL
a	NULL
student	NULL
asked	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
How	NULL
long	NULL
d'you	NULL
think	NULL
she	NULL
'll	NULL
last	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
shrugged	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Her	NULL
brother	NULL
and	NULL
sister	NULL
died	NULL
within	NULL

She	NULL
'll	NULL

Once	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
strong	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
manhood	NULL
came	NULL
because	NULL
a	NULL
persistent	NULL
aching	NULL
troubled	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
club-doctor	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
him	NULL
any	NULL
good	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
verdict	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
too	NULL
was	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
inevitable	NULL
death	NULL
that	NULL
horrified	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
was	NULL
tolerable	NULL
because	NULL
science	NULL
was	NULL
helpless	NULL
before	NULL
it	NULL

but	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
inevitable	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
wheel	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
machine	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
complex	NULL
civilisation	NULL

and	NULL
had	NULL
as	NULL
little	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
changing	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
automaton	NULL
.	NULL

Complete	NULL
rest	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
only	NULL
chance	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
physician	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
ask	NULL
impossibilities	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
shrugged	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL

The	NULL
dilemma	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
presented	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL

The	NULL
man	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
letter	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
useless	NULL
prescription	NULL
written	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
doctor	NULL
might	NULL
say	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
so	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL

He	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

said	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
comedy	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
flash	NULL
of	NULL
cockney	NULL
humour	NULL

now	NULL

then	NULL
some	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL

a	NULL

Once	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
came	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
member	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ballet	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
famous	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
fifty	NULL

but	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
age	NULL

twenty-eight	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
outrageously	NULL

ogled	NULL
the	NULL

impudently	NULL
with	NULL
large	NULL
black	NULL
eyes	NULL

her	NULL
smiles	NULL
were	NULL
grossly	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
abundant	NULL

treated	NULL
Dr.	NULL

vastly	NULL
amused	NULL

She	NULL

looking	NULL

him	NULL

he	NULL

It	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
prescription	NULL

him	NULL

on	NULL

LXXXII	NULL
Towards	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
bringing	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
close	NULL
his	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
as	NULL
clerk	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
out-patients	NULL
'	NULL
department	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
received	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
Lawson	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
.	NULL

Dear	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
living	NULL
at	NULL
43	NULL
Hyde	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
Soho	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
daresay	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Be	NULL
a	NULL
brick	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
luck	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
will	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
doing	NULL
.	NULL

Things	NULL
are	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
here	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
seems	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
changed	NULL
since	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

Clutton	NULL
is	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
become	NULL
quite	NULL
impossible	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
has	NULL
quarrelled	NULL
with	NULL
everybody	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
n't	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
cent	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
lives	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
studio	NULL
right	NULL
away	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
Jardin	NULL
des	NULL
Plantes	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
let	NULL
anybody	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL
show	NULL
anywhere	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
one	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
doing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
genius	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
he	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
ran	NULL
against	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
showing	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
Quarter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
has	NULL
chucked	NULL
art	NULL
and	NULL
is	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
popper	NULL
's	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seems	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
rolling	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Flanagan	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
pretty	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
a	NULL
portrait	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
much	NULL
would	NULL
you	NULL
ask	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
me	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
frighten	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
ass	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
L150	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
're	NULL
quite	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
L300	NULL
.	NULL

Yours	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
Frederick	NULL
Lawson	NULL

Philip	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
and	NULL
received	NULL
in	NULL
reply	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
written	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
half-sheet	NULL
of	NULL
common	NULL
note-paper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
flimsy	NULL
envelope	NULL
was	NULL
dirtier	NULL

was	NULL
justified	NULL
by	NULL
its	NULL
passage	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
post	NULL
.	NULL

Dear	NULL
Carey	NULL
,	NULL
Of	NULL
course	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
you	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
part	NULL
in	NULL
rescuing	NULL
you	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Slough	NULL
of	NULL
Despond	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
myself	NULL
am	NULL
hopelessly	NULL

I	NULL
shall	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL

I	NULL

the	NULL
philistines	NULL

It	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
ask	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
my	NULL
lodging	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
received	NULL
this	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
restaurant	NULL
,	NULL
consisting	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
small	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
poorest	NULL
class	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
its	NULL
only	NULL
customer	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
well	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
draughts	NULL
,	NULL
wearing	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
shabby	NULL
great-coat	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
without	NULL

with	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
bowler	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
eat	NULL

because	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
had	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL
of	NULL
absinthe	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
since	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
shocked	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
appearance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
rather	NULL
corpulent	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
dried-up	NULL
,	NULL
yellow	NULL
look	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
skin	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL
was	NULL
loose	NULL
and	NULL
winkled	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
clothes	NULL
hung	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
bought	NULL
for	NULL
someone	NULL
else	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
collar	NULL
,	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
sizes	NULL
too	NULL
large	NULL
,	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
slatternliness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
appearance	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
hands	NULL
trembled	NULL
continually	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
handwriting	NULL
which	NULL
scrawled	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
page	NULL
with	NULL
shapeless	NULL
,	NULL
haphazard	NULL
letters	NULL
.	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
very	NULL
ill	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
eat	NULL
little	NULL
these	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
very	NULL
sick	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL
just	NULL

some	NULL
soup	NULL
for	NULL

dinner	NULL

a	NULL
bit	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
glance	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
absinthe	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
quizzical	NULL
look	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
reproved	NULL
the	NULL
admonitions	NULL
of	NULL
common	NULL
sense	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
have	NULL
diagnosed	NULL
my	NULL
case	NULL

you	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL

wrong	NULL

me	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
've	NULL
evidently	NULL
got	NULL
cirrhosis	NULL
of	NULL

liver	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Evidently	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
formerly	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
incredibly	NULL
narrow	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
point	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
was	NULL
distressingly	NULL
obvious	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
agreed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
obvious	NULL
what	NULL
more	NULL
is	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL

Philip	NULL
changed	NULL
the	NULL
topic	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
When	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
going	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL

going	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
very	NULL
naturalness	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
this	NULL
startled	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
seemed	NULL
futile	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dying	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL
going	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
lamely	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
is	NULL

I	NULL
seem	NULL

I	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL

he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

wondered	NULL

LXXXIII	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
was	NULL
publishing	NULL
his	NULL
poems	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
friends	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
urging	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
laziness	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
necessary	NULL
steps	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
answered	NULL
their	NULL
exhortations	NULL
by	NULL
telling	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
love	NULL
of	NULL
poetry	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
brought	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
cost	NULL
you	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
thought	NULL
and	NULL
labour	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
given	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
contemptuous	NULL
lines	NULL
among	NULL
a	NULL
batch	NULL
of	NULL
similar	NULL
volumes	NULL
,	NULL
twenty	NULL
or	NULL
thirty	NULL
copies	NULL
were	NULL
sold	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
edition	NULL
was	NULL
pulped	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
since	NULL
worn	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
fame	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
illusion	NULL
like	NULL
all	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
letters	NULL
,	NULL
named	NULL
Leonard	NULL
Upjohn	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
with	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cafes	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Quarter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
considerable	NULL
reputation	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
critic	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
accredited	NULL
exponent	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
country	NULL
of	NULL
modern	NULL
French	NULL
literature	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
in	NULL
France	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
Mercure	NULL
de	NULL
France	NULL
the	NULL
liveliest	NULL
review	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
simple	NULL
process	NULL
of	NULL
expressing	NULL
in	NULL
English	NULL
their	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
acquired	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
a	NULL
reputation	NULL
for	NULL
originality	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
articles	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
formed	NULL
a	NULL
style	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
close	NULL
imitation	NULL
of	NULL
Sir	NULL
Thomas	NULL
Browne	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
elaborate	NULL
sentences	NULL
,	NULL
carefully	NULL
balanced	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
obsolete	NULL
,	NULL
resplendent	NULL
words	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
his	NULL
writing	NULL
an	NULL
appearance	NULL
of	NULL
individuality	NULL
.	NULL

Leonard	NULL
Upjohn	NULL
had	NULL
induced	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
poems	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
volume	NULL
of	NULL
reasonable	NULL
size	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
his	NULL
influence	NULL
with	NULL
publishers	NULL
.	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
his	NULL
illness	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
more	NULL
difficult	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
steadily	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
barely	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
liquor	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Upjohn	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
publisher	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
admiring	NULL
the	NULL
poems	NULL
,	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
worth	NULL
while	NULL
to	NULL
publish	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
interested	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wrote	NULL
impressing	NULL
upon	NULL
Upjohn	NULL
his	NULL
great	NULL
need	NULL
and	NULL
urging	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
more	NULL
strenuous	NULL
efforts	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
published	NULL
book	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
produced	NULL
great	NULL
poetry	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
burst	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
star	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
fine	NULL
in	NULL
keeping	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
these	NULL
treasures	NULL
of	NULL
beauty	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
giving	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
disdainfully	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
parting	NULL
company	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
use	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
decision	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
England	NULL
was	NULL
caused	NULL
directly	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
announcement	NULL
from	NULL
Leonard	NULL
Upjohn	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
publisher	NULL
had	NULL
consented	NULL
to	NULL
print	NULL
the	NULL
poems	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
a	NULL
miracle	NULL
of	NULL
persuasion	NULL
Upjohn	NULL
had	NULL
persuaded	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
ten	NULL
pounds	NULL
in	NULL
advance	NULL
of	NULL
royalties	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
In	NULL
advance	NULL
of	NULL
royalties	NULL
,	NULL
mind	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Milton	NULL
only	NULL
got	NULL
ten	NULL
pounds	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Upjohn	NULL
had	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
a	NULL
signed	NULL
article	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
ask	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
who	NULL
reviewed	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
their	NULL
best	NULL
.	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
pretended	NULL
to	NULL
treat	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL
detachment	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
delighted	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stir	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
dine	NULL
by	NULL
arrangement	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
wretched	NULL
eating-house	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
taking	NULL
his	NULL
meals	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
appear	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
learned	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
there	NULL
for	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
himself	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
round	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
address	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
had	NULL
first	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
finding	NULL
Hyde	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
street	NULL
of	NULL
dingy	NULL
houses	NULL
huddled	NULL
together	NULL
;	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
broken	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
clumsily	NULL
repaired	NULL
with	NULL
strips	NULL
of	NULL
French	NULL
newspaper	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
doors	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
painted	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
shabby	NULL
little	NULL
shops	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
laundries	NULL
,	NULL
cobblers	NULL
,	NULL
stationers	NULL
.	NULL

Ragged	NULL
children	NULL
played	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
barrel-organ	NULL
was	NULL
grinding	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
vulgar	NULL
tune	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
knocked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
(	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
shop	NULL
of	NULL
cheap	NULL
sweetstuffs	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
opened	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
elderly	NULL
Frenchwoman	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dirty	NULL
apron	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
if	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ah	NULL
,	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
an	NULL
Englishman	NULL

back	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
's	NULL

If	NULL
you	NULL
want	NULL
him	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
go	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
staircase	NULL
was	NULL
lit	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
jet	NULL
of	NULL
gas	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
revolting	NULL
odour	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
passing	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
suspiciously	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
remark	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
three	NULL
doors	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
landing	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
knocked	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
knocked	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
reply	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
the	NULL
handle	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
was	NULL
locked	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knocked	NULL
at	NULL
another	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
got	NULL
no	NULL
answer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
opened	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
dark	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Who	NULL
's	NULL

He	NULL
recognised	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL

Carey	NULL
.	NULL

Can	NULL
I	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
received	NULL
no	NULL
answer	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
window	NULL
was	NULL
closed	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
stink	NULL
was	NULL
overpowering	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
arc-lamp	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
room	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
beds	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL

;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
washing-stand	NULL

one	NULL
chair	NULL

but	NULL
they	NULL
left	NULL
little	NULL
space	NULL
for	NULL
anyone	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
nearest	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
movement	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
chuckle	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
light	NULL
the	NULL
candle	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
struck	NULL
a	NULL
match	NULL
and	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
candlestick	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
beside	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL

He	NULL
lit	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
washing-stand	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
immobile	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
very	NULL
odd	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
nightshirt	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
baldness	NULL
was	NULL
disconcerting	NULL

His	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
earthy	NULL

death-like	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL

It	NULL

involve	NULL
him	NULL

he	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL

this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
revolted	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
economy	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

I	NULL

n't	NULL

They	NULL
settled	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
should	NULL
fetch	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL

Philip	NULL
snatched	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
busy	NULL
morning	NULL
to	NULL
arrange	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
dressed	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
great-coat	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL

shabby	NULL
portmanteau	NULL

his	NULL
clothes	NULL

books	NULL

already	NULL
packed	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
waiting-room	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
station	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
went	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
Kennington	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
four-wheeler	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
were	NULL
carefully	NULL
closed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
installed	NULL
his	NULL
guest	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
early	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
and	NULL
bought	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
second-hand	NULL
bedstead	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
cheap	NULL
chest	NULL
of	NULL
drawers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
looking-glass	NULL
.	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
to	NULL
correct	NULL
his	NULL
proofs	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
irritability	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
symptom	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
disease	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
easy	NULL
guest	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
lecture	NULL
at	NULL
nine	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
Philip	NULL
persuaded	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
share	NULL
the	NULL
scrappy	NULL
meal	NULL
he	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
restless	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
preferred	NULL
generally	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
himself	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cheapest	NULL
restaurants	NULL
in	NULL
Soho	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
stoutly	NULL
refused	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
a	NULL
doctor	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
stop	NULL
drinking	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
resolved	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
always	NULL
felt	NULL
horribly	NULL
ill	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
absinthe	NULL
at	NULL
mid-day	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
midnight	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
brilliancy	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
astonished	NULL
Philip	NULL
when	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
proofs	NULL
were	NULL
corrected	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
volume	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
publications	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
spring	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
recovered	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
avalanche	NULL
of	NULL
Christmas	NULL
books	NULL
.	NULL

LXXXIV	NULL
At	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
year	NULL
Philip	NULL
became	NULL
dresser	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
surgical	NULL
out-patients	NULL
'	NULL
department	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
character	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
been	NULL
engaged	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
directness	NULL
which	NULL
surgery	NULL
has	NULL
than	NULL
medicine	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
larger	NULL
proportion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
patients	NULL
suffered	NULL
from	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
diseases	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
supine	NULL
public	NULL
allows	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
prudishness	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
spread	NULL
broadcast	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
assistant-surgeon	NULL
for	NULL
whom	NULL
Philip	NULL
dressed	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
Jacobs	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
fat	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
exuberant	NULL
joviality	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
bald	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
loud	NULL
voice	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
cockney	NULL
accent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
generally	NULL
described	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
students	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
'	NULL
awful	NULL
bounder	NULL
'	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
cleverness	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
surgeon	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
teacher	NULL
,	NULL
caused	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
overlook	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
also	NULL
a	NULL
considerable	NULL
facetiousness	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
exercised	NULL
impartially	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
patients	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
students	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
making	NULL
his	NULL
dressers	NULL
look	NULL
foolish	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
ignorant	NULL
,	NULL
nervous	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
their	NULL
equal	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
difficult	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
his	NULL
afternoons	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
home	NULL
truths	NULL
he	NULL
permitted	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
students	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
club-foot	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
parents	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
anything	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Jacobs	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
'd	NULL
better	NULL
take	NULL
this	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
subject	NULL
you	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
something	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
flushed	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
surgeon	NULL
spoke	NULL
obviously	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
humorous	NULL
intention	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
brow-beaten	NULL
dressers	NULL
laughed	NULL
obsequiously	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
a	NULL
subject	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
studied	NULL
with	NULL
anxious	NULL
attention	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
everything	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
which	NULL
treated	NULL
of	NULL
talipes	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
various	NULL
forms	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
take	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
boot	NULL
and	NULL
stocking	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
fourteen	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
snub	NULL
nose	NULL
,	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
freckled	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
father	NULL
explained	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
wanted	NULL
something	NULL
done	NULL
if	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
hindrance	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
kid	NULL
in	NULL
earning	NULL
his	NULL
living	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
curiously	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
jolly	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
shy	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
talkative	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
cheekiness	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
reproved	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
foot	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
only	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
looks	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
find	NULL
it	NULL
no	NULL
trouble	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Be	NULL
quiet	NULL
,	NULL
Ernie	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
's	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
gas	NULL
about	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
examined	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
slowly	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
shapelessness	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
why	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
felt	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
humiliation	NULL
which	NULL
always	NULL
oppressed	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
his	NULL
deformity	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
philosophic	NULL
indifference	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Jacobs	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
couch	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
surgeon	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
semi-circle	NULL
,	NULL
crowding	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
students	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
accustomed	NULL
brilliancy	NULL
Jacobs	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
graphic	NULL
little	NULL
discourse	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
club-foot	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
varieties	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
forms	NULL
which	NULL
followed	NULL
upon	NULL
different	NULL
anatomical	NULL
conditions	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
you	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
talipes	NULL
equinus	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
suddenly	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fellow-students	NULL
rest	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
cursed	NULL
himself	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
blushing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
sweat	NULL
start	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
palms	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
surgeon	NULL
spoke	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
fluency	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
long	NULL
practice	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
admirable	NULL
perspicacity	NULL
which	NULL
distinguished	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
tremendously	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
profession	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
listen	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
wishing	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
fellow	NULL
would	NULL
get	NULL
done	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
he	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
Jacobs	NULL
was	NULL
addressing	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL
taking	NULL
off	NULL
your	NULL
sock	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
Carey	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
shudder	NULL
pass	NULL
through	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
impulse	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
surgeon	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
hell	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
courage	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
scene	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
feared	NULL
his	NULL
brutal	NULL
ridicule	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
forced	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
appear	NULL
indifferent	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
unlaced	NULL
his	NULL
boot	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
fingers	NULL
were	NULL
trembling	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
never	NULL
untie	NULL
the	NULL
knot	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
how	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
forced	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
his	NULL
foot	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
misery	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
eaten	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
keeps	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
nice	NULL
and	NULL
clean	NULL
,	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL
he	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Jacobs	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
rasping	NULL
,	NULL
cockney	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
attendant	NULL
students	NULL
giggled	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
whom	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
examining	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
foot	NULL
with	NULL
eager	NULL
curiosity	NULL
.	NULL

Jacobs	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
've	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
operation	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
fluent	NULL
explanations	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
students	NULL
leaned	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
examined	NULL
it	NULL
minutely	NULL
when	NULL
Jacobs	NULL

Philip	NULL

with	NULL

smile	NULL

ironically	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
killed	NULL
them	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
how	NULL

it	NULL

wished	NULL

comfort	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
horrible	NULL
tortures	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
theirs	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Jacobs	NULL
turned	NULL
his	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
treatment	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
partly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
's	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
partly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
students	NULL

Philip	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
sock	NULL

laced	NULL
his	NULL
boot	NULL

At	NULL

the	NULL
surgeon	NULL
finished	NULL

he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL

turned	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
whether	NULL
anything	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
distaste	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
reference	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
had	NULL
prevented	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
consulting	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
surgeons	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
reading	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
whatever	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
done	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
treatment	NULL
of	NULL
talipes	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
day	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
small	NULL
chance	NULL
now	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
great	NULL
benefit	NULL

Still	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
worth	NULL
while	NULL
if	NULL
an	NULL
operation	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
wear	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
ordinary	NULL
boot	NULL

to	NULL
limp	NULL
less	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
how	NULL
passionately	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
prayed	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
miracle	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
had	NULL
assured	NULL
him	NULL

possible	NULL

omnipotence	NULL

He	NULL
smiled	NULL
ruefully	NULL

the	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL

growing	NULL

was	NULL
no	NULL

refused	NULL

would	NULL
take	NULL

Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL

Leonard	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
was	NULL
often	NULL

only	NULL
keep	NULL

temper	NULL

Upjohn	NULL
came	NULL
sometimes	NULL
before	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL

LXXXV	NULL
About	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
after	NULL
this	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
going	NULL
home	NULL
one	NULL
evening	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
,	NULL
knocked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
no	NULL
answer	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
huddled	NULL
up	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
was	NULL
asleep	NULL
or	NULL
merely	NULL
lay	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
uncontrollable	NULL
fits	NULL
of	NULL
irritability	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
was	NULL
open	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
touched	NULL
his	NULL
shoulder	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
cry	NULL
of	NULL
dismay	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
slipped	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
under	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
's	NULL
shirt	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
;	NULL
helplessly	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
being	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
a	NULL
looking-glass	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
startled	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
alone	NULL
with	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
coat	NULL
still	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
ran	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
hailed	NULL
a	NULL
cab	NULL
and	NULL
drove	NULL
to	NULL
Harley	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
you	NULL
mind	NULL
coming	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
's	NULL
dead	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL

it	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
awfully	NULL
grateful	NULL

a	NULL

the	NULL

take	NULL

an	NULL
hour	NULL

Tyrell	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
cab	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
questions	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
seemed	NULL
no	NULL
worse	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
left	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
gave	NULL
me	NULL
an	NULL
awful	NULL
shock	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
just	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
dying	NULL
all	NULL
alone	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

D'you	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
remembered	NULL
what	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
last	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
seized	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
terror	NULL
of	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
imagined	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
plight	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
inevitable	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
an	NULL
encouraging	NULL
word	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
fear	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
rather	NULL
upset	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
bright	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
unsympathetic	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
He	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
dead	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
hours	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
died	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
do	NULL
sometimes	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
body	NULL
looked	NULL
shrunk	NULL
and	NULL
ignoble	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
anything	NULL
human	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
dispassionately	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
mechanical	NULL
gesture	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
watch	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
getting	NULL
along	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
send	NULL

I	NULL

you	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
funeral	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
see	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Tyrell	NULL
gave	NULL
Philip	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
sovereigns	NULL
towards	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
circumstances	NULL
;	NULL
perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
well	NULL
afford	NULL
the	NULL
expense	NULL
;	NULL
Philip	NULL
might	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
impertinent	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
any	NULL
suggestion	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
know	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
's	NULL
anything	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
parting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
doorstep	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
telegraph	NULL
office	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
a	NULL
message	NULL
to	NULL
Leonard	NULL
Upjohn	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
undertaker	NULL
whose	NULL
shop	NULL
he	NULL
passed	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
attention	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
drawn	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
often	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
words	NULL
in	NULL
silver	NULL
lettering	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
cloth	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
model	NULL
coffins	NULL
,	NULL
adorned	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
:	NULL
Economy	NULL
,	NULL
Celerity	NULL
,	NULL
Propriety	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
diverted	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
undertaker	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
fat	NULL
Jew	NULL
with	NULL
curly	NULL
black	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
greasy	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
black	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
diamond	NULL
ring	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
podgy	NULL
finger	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
received	NULL
Philip	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
manner	NULL
formed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
mingling	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
natural	NULL
blatancy	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
subdued	NULL
air	NULL
proper	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
calling	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
quickly	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
helpless	NULL
and	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
round	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
to	NULL
perform	NULL
the	NULL
needful	NULL
offices	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
suggestions	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
funeral	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
magnificent	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
undertaker	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
his	NULL
objections	NULL
mean	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
horrible	NULL
to	NULL
haggle	NULL
on	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finally	NULL
Philip	NULL
consented	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
expensiveness	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
ill	NULL
afford	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
quite	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
undertaker	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
any	NULL
show	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL

but	NULL
you	NULL
want	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
his	NULL
supper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
ate	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
came	NULL
along	NULL
to	NULL
lay	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
corpse	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
a	NULL
telegram	NULL
arrived	NULL
from	NULL
Leonard	NULL
Upjohn	NULL
.	NULL

Shocked	NULL
and	NULL
grieved	NULL
beyond	NULL
measure	NULL
.	NULL

Regret	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
tonight	NULL
.	NULL

Dining	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
you	NULL
early	NULL
tomorrow	NULL
.	NULL

Deepest	NULL
sympathy	NULL
.	NULL

Upjohn	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
knocked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
done	NULL

you	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
'	NULL
im	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
followed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
closed	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
folded	NULL
piously	NULL
across	NULL
his	NULL
chest	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
ought	NULL
by	NULL
rights	NULL
to	NULL
'	NULL
ave	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
flowers	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
get	NULL
some	NULL
tomorrow	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
of	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
performed	NULL
her	NULL
job	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
rolled	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
sleeves	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
apron	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
bonnet	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
he	NULL
owed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
give	NULL
me	NULL
two	NULL
and	NULL
sixpence	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
give	NULL
me	NULL
five	NULL
shillings	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
ashamed	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
larger	NULL
sum	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thanked	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
just	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
effusiveness	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
seemly	NULL
in	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
grief	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
,	NULL
cleared	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
remains	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
supper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
Walsham	NULL
's	NULL
Surgery	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
difficult	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
singularly	NULL
nervous	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sound	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
he	NULL
jumped	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
violently	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
adjoining	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
frightened	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
silence	NULL
seemed	NULL
alive	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
some	NULL
mysterious	NULL
movement	NULL
were	NULL
taking	NULL
place	NULL
within	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
death	NULL
weighed	NULL
upon	NULL
these	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
unearthly	NULL
and	NULL
terrifying	NULL
:	NULL
Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
horror	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
friend	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
force	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
presently	NULL
pushed	NULL
away	NULL
his	NULL
book	NULL
in	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
troubled	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
absolute	NULL
futility	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
ended	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
matter	NULL
if	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
was	NULL
alive	NULL
or	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
lived	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
young	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
needed	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL
of	NULL
imagination	NULL
to	NULL
picture	NULL
him	NULL
slender	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
springing	NULL
step	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
hair	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
buoyant	NULL
and	NULL
hopeful	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
rule	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
instincts	NULL
with	NULL
due	NULL
regard	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
policeman	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
acted	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
there	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
this	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
lamentable	NULL
failure	NULL
of	NULL
existence	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
instincts	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
trusted	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
puzzled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
what	NULL
rule	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
useless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
why	NULL
people	NULL
acted	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
way	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
acted	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
emotions	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
their	NULL
emotions	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
good	NULL
or	NULL
bad	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
whether	NULL
they	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
triumph	NULL
or	NULL
disaster	NULL
.	NULL

Life	NULL
seemed	NULL
an	NULL
inextricable	NULL
confusion	NULL
.	NULL

Men	NULL
hurried	NULL
hither	NULL
and	NULL
thither	NULL
,	NULL
urged	NULL
by	NULL
forces	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
purpose	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
escaped	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
hurry	NULL
just	NULL
for	NULL
hurrying	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
morning	NULL
Leonard	NULL
Upjohn	NULL
appeared	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
wreath	NULL
of	NULL
laurel	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
pleased	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
crowning	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
poet	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
attempted	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
disapproving	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
fix	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bald	NULL
head	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
wreath	NULL
fitted	NULL
grotesquely	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
brim	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hat	NULL
worn	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
comedian	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
music-hall	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
instead	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Upjohn	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
've	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
stomach	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
remarked	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Upjohn	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
thin	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Only	NULL

Philip	NULL

Philip	NULL
flushed	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL

Philip	NULL

dog-tired	NULL

Philip	NULL

there	NULL

Philip	NULL
kept	NULL
his	NULL
eye	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
monthlies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
later	NULL
it	NULL
appeared	NULL

The	NULL
article	NULL
made	NULL
something	NULL

a	NULL
stir	NULL

extracts	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
printed	NULL
in	NULL
many	NULL

papers	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

Leonard	NULL
Upjohn	NULL

on	NULL
a	NULL
tremulous	NULL
dignity	NULL

a	NULL
more	NULL

the	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL

was	NULL
wholly	NULL
charming	NULL

suggested	NULL

greater	NULL
generosity	NULL

him	NULL

to	NULL
some	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
lack	NULL

sympathy	NULL
,	NULL
well-meaning	NULL

so	NULL
tactless	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
poet	NULL
instead	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
Kennington	NULL
!	NULL

Leonard	NULL
Upjohn	NULL
described	NULL
Kennington	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL

humour	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
strict	NULL
adherence	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
vocabulary	NULL
of	NULL
Sir	NULL
Thomas	NULL
Browne	NULL
necessitated	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
delicate	NULL
sarcasm	NULL
he	NULL
narrated	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
weeks	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
patience	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
bore	NULL
the	NULL
well-meaning	NULL
clumsiness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
student	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
appointed	NULL
himself	NULL
his	NULL
nurse	NULL

middle-class	NULL
surroundings	NULL

Beauty	NULL
from	NULL
ashes	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
quoted	NULL
from	NULL
Isaiah	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
triumph	NULL
of	NULL
irony	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
outcast	NULL
poet	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
trappings	NULL
of	NULL
vulgar	NULL
respectability	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
reminded	NULL
Leonard	NULL
Upjohn	NULL
of	NULL
Christ	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
Pharisees	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
analogy	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
opportunity	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
exquisite	NULL
passage	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
how	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
good	NULL
taste	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
suffer	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL

to	NULL
hint	NULL
subtly	NULL
who	NULL
the	NULL
friend	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
gracious	NULL

had	NULL
laid	NULL
a	NULL
laurel	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL

heart	NULL

the	NULL
beautiful	NULL

,	NULL
an	NULL

the	NULL
article	NULL
ended	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
description	NULL
of	NULL

him	NULL
who	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
buried	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
prince	NULL
or	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
crowning	NULL

the	NULL
final	NULL
victory	NULL
of	NULL
Philistia	NULL
over	NULL
art	NULL
,	NULL

immaterial	NULL
things	NULL

Leonard	NULL
Upjohn	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
written	NULL
anything	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
miracle	NULL
of	NULL
charm	NULL

grace	NULL

pity	NULL

printed	NULL
all	NULL

course	NULL

the	NULL
article	NULL

that	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
volume	NULL
appeared	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
point	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
advanced	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
position	NULL
a	NULL

deal	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
thenceforth	NULL
a	NULL
critic	NULL

be	NULL
reckoned	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
before	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
aloof	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
warm	NULL
humanity	NULL

attractive	NULL

LXXXVI	NULL
In	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
finished	NULL
his	NULL
dressing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
out-patients	NULL
'	NULL
department	NULL
,	NULL
became	NULL
an	NULL
in-patients	NULL
'	NULL
clerk	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
appointment	NULL
lasted	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
clerk	NULL
spent	NULL
every	NULL
morning	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wards	NULL
,	NULL
first	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
house-physician	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wrote	NULL
up	NULL
cases	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
tests	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
day	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
nurses	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
two	NULL
afternoons	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
the	NULL
physician	NULL
in	NULL
charge	NULL
went	NULL
round	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
knot	NULL
of	NULL
students	NULL
,	NULL
examined	NULL
the	NULL
cases	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dispensed	NULL
information	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
work	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
excitement	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
constant	NULL
change	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
intimate	NULL
contact	NULL
with	NULL
reality	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
out-patients	NULL
'	NULL
department	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
picked	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
knowledge	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
patients	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
flattered	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
pleasure	NULL
they	NULL
showed	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
attendance	NULL
on	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
deep	NULL
sympathy	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
sufferings	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
no	NULL
airs	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
popular	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
than	NULL
others	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
clerks	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
pleasant	NULL
,	NULL
encouraging	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
friendly	NULL
.	NULL

Like	NULL
everyone	NULL
connected	NULL
with	NULL
hospitals	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
male	NULL
patients	NULL
were	NULL
more	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
than	NULL
female	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
women	NULL
were	NULL
often	NULL
querulous	NULL
and	NULL
ill-tempered	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
complained	NULL
bitterly	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hard-worked	NULL
nurses	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
show	NULL
them	NULL
the	NULL
attention	NULL
they	NULL
thought	NULL
their	NULL
right	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
troublesome	NULL
,	NULL
ungrateful	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rude	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
fortunate	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
morning	NULL
the	NULL
house-physician	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
seating	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bedside	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
proceeded	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
down	NULL
particulars	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL
'	NULL

He	NULL
noticed	NULL
on	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
patient	NULL
was	NULL
described	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
journalist	NULL
:	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
Thorpe	NULL
Athelny	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
unusual	NULL
one	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
hospital	NULL
patient	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
age	NULL
was	NULL
forty-eight	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
suffering	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
sharp	NULL
attack	NULL
of	NULL
jaundice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
taken	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
ward	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
obscure	NULL
symptoms	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
watch	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
answered	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
questions	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
,	NULL
educated	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
short	NULL
or	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
small	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
small	NULL
hands	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
average	NULL
height	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
people	NULL
's	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Athelny	NULL
's	NULL
astonished	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
small	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
tapering	NULL
fingers	NULL
and	NULL
beautiful	NULL
,	NULL
rosy	NULL
finger-nails	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
smooth	NULL
and	NULL
except	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
jaundice	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
surprising	NULL
whiteness	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
patient	NULL
kept	NULL
them	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
bed-clothes	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
slightly	NULL
spread	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
and	NULL
third	NULL
fingers	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
contemplate	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
twinkle	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
Philip	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

Notwithstanding	NULL
the	NULL
yellowness	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
distinguished	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
nose	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
imposing	NULL
boldness	NULL
,	NULL
hooked	NULL
,	NULL
aggressive	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
clumsy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
beard	NULL
,	NULL
pointed	NULL
and	NULL
gray	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
bald	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
had	NULL
evidently	NULL
been	NULL
quite	NULL
fine	NULL
,	NULL
curling	NULL
prettily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
still	NULL
wore	NULL
it	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
a	NULL
journalist	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
papers	NULL
d'you	NULL
write	NULL
for	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
write	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
papers	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
open	NULL
a	NULL
paper	NULL
without	NULL
seeing	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
writing	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
reaching	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
he	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
an	NULL
advertisement	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
large	NULL
letters	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
firm	NULL
well-known	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
Lynn	NULL
and	NULL
Sedley	NULL
,	NULL
Regent	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
London	NULL

and	NULL
below	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
type	NULL
smaller	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
magnitude	NULL

was	NULL
the	NULL
dogmatic	NULL
statement	NULL
:	NULL
Procrastination	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
Thief	NULL
of	NULL

Then	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
,	NULL
startling	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
reasonableness	NULL

Philip	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
Clutton	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
some	NULL
months	NULL
in	NULL
Toledo	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
journalist	NULL
's	NULL
answer	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
interest	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
improper	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
this	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
preserve	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
patient	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
staff	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
his	NULL
examination	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
other	NULL
beds	NULL

Thorpe	NULL
Athelny	NULL
's	NULL
illness	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
grave	NULL

,	NULL
though	NULL
remaining	NULL
very	NULL
yellow	NULL

he	NULL
soon	NULL
felt	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
stayed	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
only	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
physician	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL

under	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL

on	NULL
entering	NULL
the	NULL

Philip	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
Athelny	NULL

Philip	NULL

who	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
pass	NULL
a	NULL

at	NULL
it	NULL

Philip	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL

saw	NULL
that	NULL

a	NULL

Philip	NULL
picked	NULL
it	NULL

gave	NULL
it	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL

had	NULL
been	NULL
slightly	NULL
patronising	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
flushed	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL

good	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
brilliant	NULL
things	NULL

he	NULL
talked	NULL
inspiringly	NULL

fired	NULL

imagination	NULL

Philip	NULL

living	NULL

found	NULL
his	NULL
fancy	NULL
teeming	NULL

Athelny	NULL
had	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
manners	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
books	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
older	NULL
man	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
readiness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
conversation	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
superiority	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL

the	NULL
hospital	NULL

the	NULL

Ten	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL
Thorpe	NULL
Athelny	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
gave	NULL
Philip	NULL
his	NULL
address	NULL

and	NULL
Philip	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
dine	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
o'clock	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
Sunday	NULL
.	NULL

Athelny	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL

lived	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
built	NULL
by	NULL
Inigo	NULL
Jones	NULL

had	NULL
raved	NULL

raved	NULL
over	NULL
everything	NULL

over	NULL
the	NULL
balustrade	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
oak	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
open	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
for	NULL
Philip	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
admire	NULL
the	NULL
elegant	NULL
carving	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lintel	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
shabby	NULL
house	NULL

badly	NULL
needing	NULL
a	NULL
coat	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
dignity	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
period	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
street	NULL
between	NULL
Chancery	NULL
Lane	NULL
and	NULL
Holborn	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
been	NULL
fashionable	NULL
but	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
little	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
slum	NULL
:	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
plan	NULL
to	NULL
pull	NULL
it	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
handsome	NULL
offices	NULL
;	NULL
meanwhile	NULL
the	NULL
rents	NULL
were	NULL
small	NULL

Athelny	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
upper	NULL
floors	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
price	NULL
which	NULL
suited	NULL
his	NULL
income	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
before	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
small	NULL
size	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
five	NULL
feet	NULL
and	NULL
five	NULL
inches	NULL
high	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
dressed	NULL
fantastically	NULL
in	NULL
blue	NULL
linen	NULL
trousers	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
worn	NULL
by	NULL
working	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
France	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
old	NULL
brown	NULL

he	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
bright	NULL
red	NULL
sash	NULL
round	NULL
his	NULL
waist	NULL

a	NULL
low	NULL
collar	NULL

comic	NULL
Frenchman	NULL

pages	NULL

He	NULL
greeted	NULL
Philip	NULL
with	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
talking	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
lovingly	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
balusters	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Look	NULL

a	NULL
blousy	NULL
woman	NULL

their	NULL
Sunday	NULL
dinner	NULL

Athelny	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
Winchester	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
sensitive	NULL
to	NULL
differences	NULL
of	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
host	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
characteristics	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
educated	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
public	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
he	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
alliances	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
ancestors	NULL
had	NULL
formed	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
amused	NULL
himself	NULL
by	NULL
wondering	NULL
whether	NULL
Athelny	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
son	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
tradesman	NULL
in	NULL
Winchester	NULL
,	NULL
auctioneer	NULL
or	NULL
coal-merchant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whether	NULL
a	NULL
similarity	NULL
of	NULL
surname	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
his	NULL
only	NULL
connection	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
ancient	NULL
family	NULL
whose	NULL
tree	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
displaying	NULL

LXXXVIII	NULL
There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
knock	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
troop	NULL
of	NULL
children	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
clean	NULL
and	NULL
tidy	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
faces	NULL
shone	NULL
with	NULL
soap	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
plastered	NULL
down	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
Sunday	NULL
school	NULL
under	NULL
Sally	NULL
's	NULL
charge	NULL
.	NULL

Athelny	NULL
joked	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
dramatic	NULL
,	NULL
exuberant	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
devoted	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
pride	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
good	NULL
health	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
good	NULL
looks	NULL
was	NULL
touching	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
shy	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
presence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
their	NULL
father	NULL
sent	NULL
them	NULL
off	NULL
they	NULL
fled	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
in	NULL
evident	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
appeared	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
curling	NULL
pins	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
wore	NULL
an	NULL
elaborate	NULL
fringe	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
plain	NULL
black	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
hat	NULL
with	NULL
cheap	NULL
flowers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
forcing	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
red	NULL
and	NULL
coarse	NULL
from	NULL
much	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
into	NULL
black	NULL
kid	NULL
gloves	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

'm	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

she	NULL
smiled	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
drawled	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
calmly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
buttoning	NULL
her	NULL
gloves	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
kindly	NULL

slightly	NULL
embarrassed	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

Athelny	NULL

Of	NULL

'll	NULL

said	NULL
Athelny	NULL

Then	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
strait-laced	NULL
in	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
shocked	NULL

It	NULL

well	NULL
as	NULL

your	NULL

I	NULL
wanted	NULL
Betty	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
Roman	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL

she	NULL

Besides	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
religion	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
school	NULL

morality	NULL

It	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
contrary	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
ideas	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
still	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
Christianity	NULL

a	NULL
degrading	NULL
bondage	NULL
that	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
cast	NULL
away	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
connected	NULL
subconsciously	NULL

the	NULL

services	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cathedral	NULL
at	NULL
Tercanbury	NULL

the	NULL
long	NULL
hours	NULL
of	NULL
boredom	NULL
in	NULL

cold	NULL
church	NULL
at	NULL
Blackstable	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
morality	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
Athelny	NULL
spoke	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL

the	NULL
religion	NULL

a	NULL
halting	NULL
intelligence	NULL
preserved	NULL

when	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
laid	NULL
aside	NULL
the	NULL

it	NULL
reasonable	NULL

But	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
meditating	NULL
a	NULL

Athelny	NULL

more	NULL
interested	NULL

in	NULL

broke	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
tirade	NULL

For	NULL
him	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
essential	NULL
part	NULL

Spain	NULL

Spain	NULL
meant	NULL

Philip	NULL
remembered	NULL
how	NULL
Clutton	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
affected	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
strange	NULL
master	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
work	NULL
he	NULL
now	NULL
saw	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
Clutton	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
interesting	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
sardonic	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
hostile	NULL
aloofness	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
tragic	NULL
force	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
sought	NULL
vainly	NULL
to	NULL
express	NULL
itself	NULL
in	NULL
painting	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
unusual	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
mystical	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
fashion	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
leaning	NULL
to	NULL
mysticism	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
impatient	NULL
with	NULL
life	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
obscure	NULL
impulses	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
suggested	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
intellect	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
fashioned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
uses	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
spirit	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
surprising	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
sympathy	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Greek	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
devised	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
technique	NULL
to	NULL
express	NULL
the	NULL
yearnings	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
again	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
series	NULL
of	NULL
portraits	NULL
of	NULL
Spanish	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
ruffles	NULL
and	NULL
pointed	NULL
beards	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
faces	NULL
pale	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
sober	NULL
black	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
clothes	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
background	NULL
.	NULL

El	NULL
Greco	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
painter	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
these	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
,	NULL
wan	NULL
and	NULL
wasted	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
by	NULL
exhaustion	NULL
but	NULL
by	NULL
restraint	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
tortured	NULL
minds	NULL
,	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
unaware	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL

for	NULL
their	NULL
eyes	NULL
look	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL

and	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
dazzled	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
glory	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
unseen	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
painter	NULL
has	NULL
shown	NULL
more	NULL
pitilessly	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
is	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
passage	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
souls	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
he	NULL
painted	NULL
speak	NULL
their	NULL
strange	NULL
longings	NULL
through	NULL
their	NULL
eyes	NULL

their	NULL
senses	NULL
are	NULL
miraculously	NULL
acute	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
sounds	NULL

but	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
subtle	NULL
sensations	NULL

the	NULL
soul	NULL

The	NULL
noble	NULL
walks	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
monkish	NULL

within	NULL
him	NULL

his	NULL
eyes	NULL

things	NULL

in	NULL

he	NULL
is	NULL
unastounded	NULL

His	NULL
lips	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
lips	NULL
that	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
silent	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
photograph	NULL
of	NULL
Toledo	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
arresting	NULL
picture	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
off	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
strangely	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
threshold	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
new	NULL
discovery	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
tremulous	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
adventure	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
love	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
consumed	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
love	NULL
seemed	NULL
very	NULL
trivial	NULL
beside	NULL
the	NULL
excitement	NULL
which	NULL
now	NULL
leaped	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
picture	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
houses	NULL
crowded	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
hill	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
corner	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
was	NULL
holding	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
map	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
classical	NULL
figure	NULL
representing	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
Tagus	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
Virgin	NULL
surrounded	NULL
by	NULL
angels	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
landscape	NULL
alien	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
notion	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
circles	NULL
that	NULL
worshipped	NULL
exact	NULL
realism	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
here	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
strangely	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
reality	NULL
greater	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
achieved	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
masters	NULL
in	NULL
whose	NULL
steps	NULL
humbly	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sought	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
heard	NULL
Athelny	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
representation	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
precise	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
citizens	NULL
of	NULL
Toledo	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
picture	NULL
they	NULL
recognised	NULL
their	NULL
houses	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
painter	NULL
had	NULL
painted	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
spirit	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
unearthly	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
city	NULL
of	NULL
pale	NULL
gray	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
city	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
seen	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
wan	NULL
light	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
neither	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
night	NULL
nor	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
green	NULL
hill	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
green	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
surrounded	NULL
by	NULL
massive	NULL
walls	NULL
and	NULL
bastions	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
stormed	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL
machines	NULL
or	NULL
engines	NULL
of	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
invention	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
by	NULL
prayer	NULL
and	NULL
fasting	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
contrite	NULL
sighs	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
mortifications	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
flesh	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
stronghold	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
.	NULL

Those	NULL
gray	NULL
houses	NULL
were	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
stone	NULL
known	NULL
to	NULL
masons	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
terrifying	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
aspect	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
men	NULL
might	NULL
live	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
might	NULL
walk	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
unamazed	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
deserted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
not	NULL
empty	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
presence	NULL
invisible	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
manifest	NULL
to	NULL
every	NULL
inner	NULL
sense	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mystical	NULL
city	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
imagination	NULL
faltered	NULL
like	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
steps	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
into	NULL
darkness	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
walked	NULL
naked	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
fro	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
the	NULL
unknowable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
conscious	NULL
strangely	NULL
of	NULL
experience	NULL
,	NULL
intimate	NULL
but	NULL
inexpressible	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
absolute	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
without	NULL
surprise	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
blue	NULL
sky	NULL
,	NULL
real	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
reality	NULL
that	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
confesses	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
rack	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
clouds	NULL
driven	NULL
by	NULL
strange	NULL
breezes	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
cries	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sighs	NULL
of	NULL
lost	NULL
souls	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
Blessed	NULL
Virgin	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
gown	NULL
of	NULL
red	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
cloak	NULL
of	NULL
blue	NULL
,	NULL
surrounded	NULL
by	NULL
winged	NULL
angels	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
inhabitants	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
city	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
the	NULL
apparition	NULL
without	NULL
astonishment	NULL
,	NULL
reverent	NULL
and	NULL
thankful	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
their	NULL
ways	NULL
.	NULL

Athelny	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mystical	NULL
writers	NULL
of	NULL
Spain	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
Teresa	NULL
de	NULL
Avila	NULL
,	NULL
San	NULL
Juan	NULL

Cruz	NULL

in	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL

was	NULL
that	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
unseen	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pictures	NULL
of	NULL
El	NULL
Greco	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
to	NULL
touch	NULL
the	NULL
incorporeal	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
invisible	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
Spaniards	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
whom	NULL
were	NULL
tremulous	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
mighty	NULL
exploits	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
nation	NULL
:	NULL
their	NULL
fancies	NULL
were	NULL
rich	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
glories	NULL
of	NULL
America	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
islands	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Caribbean	NULL
Sea	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
veins	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
age-long	NULL
battling	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Moor	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
proud	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
masters	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
felt	NULL
in	NULL
themselves	NULL
the	NULL
wide	NULL
distances	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
tawny	NULL
wastes	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
snow-capped	NULL
mountains	NULL
of	NULL
Castile	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sunshine	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
sky	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
flowering	NULL
plains	NULL
of	NULL
Andalusia	NULL
.	NULL

Life	NULL
was	NULL
passionate	NULL
and	NULL
manifold	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
offered	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
they	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
restless	NULL
yearning	NULL
for	NULL
something	NULL
more	NULL
;	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
human	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
unsatisfied	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
threw	NULL
this	NULL
eager	NULL
vitality	NULL
of	NULL
theirs	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
vehement	NULL
striving	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
ineffable	NULL
.	NULL

Athelny	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
displeased	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
someone	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
translations	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
amused	NULL
his	NULL
leisure	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
fine	NULL
,	NULL
vibrating	NULL
voice	NULL
he	NULL
recited	NULL
the	NULL
canticle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Soul	NULL
and	NULL
Christ	NULL
her	NULL
lover	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
lovely	NULL
poem	NULL
which	NULL
begins	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
en	NULL
una	NULL
noche	NULL
oscura	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
noche	NULL
serena	NULL
of	NULL
Fray	NULL
Luis	NULL
de	NULL
Leon	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
translated	NULL
them	NULL
quite	NULL
simply	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
skill	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
words	NULL
which	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
events	NULL
suggested	NULL
the	NULL
rough-hewn	NULL
grandeur	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
original	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pictures	NULL
of	NULL
El	NULL
Greco	NULL
explained	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
explained	NULL
the	NULL
pictures	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
cultivated	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
disdain	NULL
for	NULL
idealism	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
idealism	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
across	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
part	NULL
a	NULL
cowardly	NULL
shrinking	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
idealist	NULL
withdrew	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
suffer	NULL
the	NULL
jostling	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
human	NULL
crowd	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
strength	NULL
to	NULL
fight	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
battle	NULL
vulgar	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
vain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
since	NULL
his	NULL
fellows	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
estimate	NULL
,	NULL
consoled	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
despising	NULL
his	NULL
fellows	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
Philip	NULL
his	NULL
type	NULL
was	NULL
Hayward	NULL
,	NULL
fair	NULL
,	NULL
languid	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
fat	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
rather	NULL
bald	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
cherishing	NULL
the	NULL
remains	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
good	NULL
looks	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
delicately	NULL
proposing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
exquisite	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
uncertain	NULL
future	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
were	NULL
whiskey	NULL
and	NULL
vulgar	NULL
amours	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
reaction	NULL
from	NULL
what	NULL
Hayward	NULL
represented	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
clamoured	NULL
for	NULL
life	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
stood	NULL
;	NULL
sordidness	NULL
,	NULL
vice	NULL
,	NULL
deformity	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
offend	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
declared	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
nakedness	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
rubbed	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
when	NULL
an	NULL
instance	NULL
came	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
meanness	NULL
,	NULL
cruelty	NULL
,	NULL
selfishness	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
lust	NULL
:	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
Paris	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
neither	NULL
ugliness	NULL
nor	NULL
beauty	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
truth	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
search	NULL
after	NULL
beauty	NULL
was	NULL
sentimental	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
painted	NULL
an	NULL
advertisement	NULL
of	NULL
chocolat	NULL
Menier	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
landscape	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
escape	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
tyranny	NULL
of	NULL
prettiness	NULL
?	NULL

But	NULL
here	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
divine	NULL
something	NULL
new	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
hesitating	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
now	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
brink	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
discovery	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
vaguely	NULL
that	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
realism	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
adored	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
certainly	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
bloodless	NULL
idealism	NULL
which	NULL
stepped	NULL
aside	NULL
from	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
weakness	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
strong	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
virile	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
accepted	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
its	NULL
vivacity	NULL
,	NULL
ugliness	NULL
and	NULL
beauty	NULL
,	NULL
squalor	NULL
and	NULL
heroism	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
realism	NULL
still	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
realism	NULL
carried	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
higher	NULL
pitch	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
facts	NULL
were	NULL
transformed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
vivid	NULL
light	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
seen	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
things	NULL
more	NULL
profoundly	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
grave	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
dead	NULL
noblemen	NULL
of	NULL
Castile	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
gestures	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
saints	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
wild	NULL
and	NULL
distorted	NULL
,	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
some	NULL
mysterious	NULL
significance	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
what	NULL
that	NULL
significance	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
message	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
important	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
unknown	NULL
tongue	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
seeking	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
meaning	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
meaning	NULL
was	NULL
offered	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
obscure	NULL
and	NULL
vague	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
profoundly	NULL
troubled	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
what	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
as	NULL
by	NULL
flashes	NULL
of	NULL
lightning	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
stormy	NULL
night	NULL
you	NULL
might	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
mountain	NULL
range	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
need	NULL
not	NULL
leave	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
to	NULL
chance	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
will	NULL
was	NULL
powerful	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
self-control	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
passionate	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
active	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
surrender	NULL
to	NULL
passion	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
inward	NULL
life	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
manifold	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
varied	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
rich	NULL
with	NULL
experience	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
conquered	NULL
realms	NULL
and	NULL
explored	NULL
unknown	NULL
lands	NULL
.	NULL

LXXXIX	NULL
The	NULL
conversation	NULL
between	NULL
Philip	NULL
and	NULL
Athelny	NULL
was	NULL
broken	NULL
into	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
clatter	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
.	NULL

Athelny	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
coming	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
Sunday	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
laughter	NULL
and	NULL
shouting	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Gaily	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
them	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
appeared	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
instructions	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
that	NULL
father	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
amuse	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
tea	NULL
ready	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Athelny	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
them	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Hans	NULL
Andersen	NULL
's	NULL
stories	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
shy	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
quickly	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
formidable	NULL
.	NULL

Jane	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
by	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
settled	NULL
herself	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
lonely	NULL
life	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
present	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
circle	NULL
:	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
smiled	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
rested	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
fair	NULL
children	NULL
engrossed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fairy	NULL
tale	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
new	NULL
friend	NULL
,	NULL
eccentric	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
appeared	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
glance	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
perfect	NULL
naturalness	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
tea	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Jane	NULL
slipped	NULL
off	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
knees	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
cloth	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
Spanish	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mother	NULL
says	NULL
,	NULL
shall	NULL
she	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
tea	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
their	NULL
tea	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Tell	NULL
your	NULL

honoured	NULL

she	NULL
will	NULL
favour	NULL
us	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
company	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Athelny	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
say	NULL
anything	NULL
without	NULL
an	NULL
oratorical	NULL
flourish	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
lay	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Sally	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
tray	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
cottage	NULL
loaf	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
slab	NULL
of	NULL
butter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
jar	NULL
of	NULL
strawberry	NULL
jam	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
she	NULL
placed	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
chaffed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
walking	NULL
out	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
proud	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
aspirants	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
honour	NULL
who	NULL
lined	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
by	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
Sunday	NULL
school	NULL
and	NULL
craved	NULL
the	NULL
honour	NULL
of	NULL
escorting	NULL
her	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
do	NULL
talk	NULL

said	NULL
Sally	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
slow	NULL
,	NULL
good-natured	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL

at	NULL

I	NULL
shudder	NULL

puts	NULL
her	NULL

up	NULL

"	NULL
Mother	NULL
'll	NULL

said	NULL
Sally	NULL

"	NULL
Sally	NULL
never	NULL

"	NULL
laughed	NULL
Athelny	NULL

looking	NULL
at	NULL

"	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tea	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
proceeded	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
amused	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
treated	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL

She	NULL
spread	NULL
jam	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL

cut	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
into	NULL
convenient	NULL

for	NULL
him	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
hat	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
Sunday	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
tight	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
farmers	NULL

wives	NULL
whom	NULL
Philip	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
on	NULL
sometimes	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
why	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
was	NULL
familiar	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
spoke	NULL
just	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
round	NULL
Blackstable	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
interest	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
brightness	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
faded	NULL
eyes	NULL

She	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
Ferne	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
village	NULL
about	NULL
ten	NULL
miles	NULL
across	NULL
country	NULL
from	NULL
Blackstable	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
over	NULL
sometimes	NULL
to	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
harvest	NULL
thanksgiving	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
mentioned	NULL
names	NULL
of	NULL
various	NULL
farmers	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
delighted	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
again	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
youth	NULL
was	NULL
spent	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pleasure	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
recall	NULL
scenes	NULL

people	NULL

had	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
memory	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
tenacity	NULL
peculiar	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
class	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
gave	NULL
Philip	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
sensation	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
breath	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
country-side	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
wafted	NULL
into	NULL
that	NULL
panelled	NULL
room	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
fat	NULL
Kentish	NULL
fields	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
stately	NULL
elms	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
nostrils	NULL
dilated	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
scent	NULL

it	NULL

laden	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
North	NULL

that	NULL
makes	NULL
it	NULL
keen	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
Athelnys	NULL
'	NULL

ten	NULL
o'clock	NULL

The	NULL
children	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
good-night	NULL
at	NULL
eight	NULL
and	NULL
quite	NULL
naturally	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
their	NULL
faces	NULL

Philip	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL

Sally	NULL

held	NULL
out	NULL

"	NULL

added	NULL
her	NULL

had	NULL
supper	NULL

bread	NULL

while	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
was	NULL

bed	NULL

when	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
to	NULL
bid	NULL
her	NULL
good-night	NULL
(	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sitting	NULL
there	NULL

resting	NULL
herself	NULL

reading	NULL
The	NULL
Weekly	NULL

she	NULL
invited	NULL
him	NULL
cordially	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
again	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL

a	NULL
good	NULL
dinner	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL

it	NULL

him	NULL

"	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
Saturday	NULL
Philip	NULL
received	NULL
a	NULL
postcard	NULL
from	NULL
Athelny	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
expecting	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
fearing	NULL
their	NULL
means	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
such	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
would	NULL
desire	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
wrote	NULL
back	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
only	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
tea	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
bought	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
plum	NULL
cake	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
entertainment	NULL
should	NULL
cost	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
family	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
cake	NULL
completed	NULL
his	NULL
conquest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
insisted	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
all	NULL
have	NULL
tea	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
meal	NULL
was	NULL
noisy	NULL
and	NULL
hilarious	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
Philip	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
Athelny	NULL
's	NULL
every	NULL
Sunday	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
favourite	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
simple	NULL
and	NULL
unaffected	NULL
and	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
plain	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
heard	NULL
his	NULL
ring	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
popped	NULL
a	NULL
head	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
window	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
sure	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
rushed	NULL
downstairs	NULL
tumultuously	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
flung	NULL
themselves	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
tea	NULL
they	NULL
fought	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
privilege	NULL
of	NULL
sitting	NULL
next	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
they	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
him	NULL
Uncle	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Athelny	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
communicative	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
little	NULL
by	NULL
little	NULL
Philip	NULL
learned	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
stages	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
followed	NULL
many	NULL
occupations	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
mess	NULL
of	NULL
everything	NULL
he	NULL
attempted	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
tea	NULL
plantation	NULL
in	NULL
Ceylon	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
traveller	NULL
in	NULL
America	NULL
for	NULL
Italian	NULL
wines	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
secretaryship	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
company	NULL
in	NULL
Toledo	NULL
had	NULL
lasted	NULL
longer	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
employments	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
journalist	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
had	NULL
worked	NULL
as	NULL
police-court	NULL
reporter	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
evening	NULL
paper	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sub-editor	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
paper	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Midlands	NULL
and	NULL
editor	NULL
of	NULL
another	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Riviera	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
occupations	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gathered	NULL
amusing	NULL
anecdotes	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
keen	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
powers	NULL
of	NULL
entertainment	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
,	NULL
chiefly	NULL
delighting	NULL
in	NULL
books	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
unusual	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
poured	NULL
forth	NULL
his	NULL
stores	NULL
of	NULL
abstruse	NULL
knowledge	NULL
with	NULL
child-like	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
amazement	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
hearers	NULL
.	NULL

Three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
abject	NULL
poverty	NULL
had	NULL
driven	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
job	NULL
of	NULL
press-representative	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
firm	NULL
of	NULL
drapers	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
unworthy	NULL
his	NULL
abilities	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
rated	NULL
highly	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
firmness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
needs	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
stick	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

XC	NULL
When	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
Athelnys	NULL
'	NULL
Philip	NULL
walked	NULL
down	NULL
Chancery	NULL
Lane	NULL
and	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
Strand	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
'	NULL
bus	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
Parliament	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
Sunday	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
them	NULL
about	NULL
six	NULL
weeks	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
this	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
Kennington	NULL
'	NULL
bus	NULL
full	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
June	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
rained	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
was	NULL
raw	NULL
and	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
Piccadilly	NULL
Circus	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
seat	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
bus	NULL
waited	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
fountain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
arrived	NULL
there	NULL
seldom	NULL
had	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
service	NULL
ran	NULL
every	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
idly	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
crowd	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
public-houses	NULL
were	NULL
closing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
many	NULL
people	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
busy	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
ideas	NULL
Athelny	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
charming	NULL
gift	NULL
of	NULL
suggesting	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
weeks	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
crossing	NULL
over	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
Shaftesbury	NULL
Avenue	NULL
and	NULL
stopped	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
shelter	NULL
till	NULL
a	NULL
string	NULL
of	NULL
cabs	NULL
passed	NULL
by	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
watching	NULL
her	NULL
opportunity	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
eyes	NULL
for	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
black	NULL
straw	NULL
hat	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
feathers	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
silk	NULL
dress	NULL
;	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
fashionable	NULL
for	NULL
women	NULL
to	NULL
wear	NULL
trains	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
crossed	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
skirt	NULL
trailing	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
down	NULL
Piccadilly	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
beating	NULL
excitedly	NULL
,	NULL
followed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
hour	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
walked	NULL
slowly	NULL
along	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
down	NULL
Air	NULL
Street	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
got	NULL
through	NULL
into	NULL
Regent	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
walked	NULL
up	NULL
again	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
Circus	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
puzzled	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
somebody	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
curiosity	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
who	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
overtook	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
bowler	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
strolling	NULL
very	NULL
slowly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
direction	NULL
as	NULL
herself	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
sidelong	NULL
glance	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
passed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
walked	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
steps	NULL
more	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
Swan	NULL
and	NULL
Edgar	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
stopped	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
,	NULL
facing	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
she	NULL
smiled	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
man	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sauntered	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Philip	NULL
understood	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
overwhelmed	NULL
with	NULL
horror	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
weakness	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
legs	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
stand	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
quickly	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
touched	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
arm	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
violent	NULL
start	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
reddened	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
obscurity	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
they	NULL
stood	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
without	NULL
speaking	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Fancy	NULL
seeing	NULL
you	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
answer	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
horribly	NULL
shaken	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
phrases	NULL
that	NULL
chased	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
brain	NULL
seemed	NULL
incredibly	NULL
melodramatic	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
awful	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
gasped	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
anything	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
pavement	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
distorted	NULL
with	NULL
misery	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
n't	NULL
there	NULL
anywhere	NULL
we	NULL
can	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
talk	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
sullenly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Leave	NULL
me	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
thought	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
urgent	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
afford	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
hour	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
sovereigns	NULL
on	NULL
me	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
hard	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
blurted	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL
mean	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
walking	NULL
along	NULL
here	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
way	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
lodgings	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
from	NULL
where	NULL
I	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
For	NULL
God	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
lie	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
crying	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
repeated	NULL
his	NULL
question	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ca	NULL
n't	NULL
we	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
talk	NULL
somewhere	NULL
?	NULL

Ca	NULL
n't	NULL
I	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
your	NULL
rooms	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
sobbed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
in	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
you	NULL
like	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
meet	NULL
you	NULL
tomorrow	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
keep	NULL
an	NULL
appointment	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
must	NULL
take	NULL
me	NULL
somewhere	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL

but	NULL
they	NULL
'll	NULL
charge	NULL
six	NULL
shillings	NULL
for	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

Where	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
address	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
cab	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
drove	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
shabby	NULL
street	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
British	NULL
Museum	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Gray	NULL
's	NULL
Inn	NULL
Road	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
stopped	NULL
the	NULL
cab	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
words	NULL
either	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
since	NULL
getting	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
cab	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
walked	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
yards	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
knocked	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
sharply	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
noticed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fanlight	NULL
a	NULL
cardboard	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
announcement	NULL
that	NULL
apartments	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
door	NULL
was	NULL
opened	NULL
quietly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
elderly	NULL
,	NULL
tall	NULL
woman	NULL
let	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
Philip	NULL
a	NULL
stare	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
Mildred	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
undertone	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
led	NULL
Philip	NULL
along	NULL
a	NULL
passage	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
dark	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
match	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lit	NULL
the	NULL
gas	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
globe	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
gas	NULL
flared	NULL
shrilly	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dingy	NULL
little	NULL
bed-room	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
suite	NULL
of	NULL
furniture	NULL
,	NULL
painted	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
like	NULL
pine	NULL
much	NULL
too	NULL
large	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
lace	NULL
curtains	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
dirty	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
grate	NULL
was	NULL
hidden	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
paper	NULL
fan	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
sank	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
chair	NULL
which	NULL
stood	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chimney-piece	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
ashamed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
cheeks	NULL
were	NULL
thick	NULL
with	NULL
rouge	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
were	NULL
blackened	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
thin	NULL
and	NULL
ill	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
red	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
exaggerated	NULL
the	NULL
greenish	NULL
pallor	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
skin	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
fan	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
listless	NULL
fashion	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
choking	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
throat	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
covered	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
awful	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
groaned	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
broke	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
sob	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

n't	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

cried	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
anguish	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
account	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sick	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
recollection	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
pain	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
recollection	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
sorry	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
free	NULL
.	NULL

Watching	NULL
her	NULL
gravely	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
besotted	NULL
with	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
paused	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
flushed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
hate	NULL
asking	NULL

gave	NULL

he	NULL
smiled	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
talked	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
thing	NULL
were	NULL
natural	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
horror	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL

and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
both	NULL
standing	NULL

"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

he	NULL
answered	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL

Those	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
they	NULL
implied	NULL
,	NULL
tore	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
painful	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
weary	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
sank	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
chair	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
silence	NULL
lasted	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
embarrassment	NULL
lit	NULL
a	NULL
cigarette	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
crying	NULL
again	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
how	NULL

him	NULL
when	NULL
Emil	NULL
Miller	NULL
had	NULL
deserted	NULL

The	NULL

seemed	NULL
to	NULL
render	NULL

"	NULL

in	NULL

broke	NULL
down	NULL

Philip	NULL
could	NULL

Philip	NULL
showed	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL

which	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL

put	NULL
the	NULL

suddenly	NULL

Mildred	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bedroom	NULL
to	NULL
undo	NULL
her	NULL
things	NULL

put	NULL
them	NULL
away	NULL

Philip	NULL
tried	NULL

his	NULL
spirits	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
high	NULL

he	NULL
leaned	NULL
back	NULL

smoking	NULL
a	NULL
cigarette	NULL

with	NULL
smiling	NULL
eyes	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sleeping	NULL
child	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
very	NULL
happy	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL

Mildred	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
feeling	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
completely	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
discerned	NULL
in	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL
physical	NULL
repulsion	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL

he	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL

lightly	NULL

He	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
some	NULL

out	NULL

came	NULL
in	NULL
half	NULL

He	NULL
smiled	NULL

her	NULL
humility	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
twist	NULL

remembered	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL

tears	NULL
rolled	NULL
heavily	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL

Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
from	NULL

experience	NULL

the	NULL
hospital	NULL

women	NULL

looked	NULL

could	NULL
not	NULL

a	NULL
little	NULL
impatient	NULL

he	NULL
blamed	NULL
himself	NULL

for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL

ill	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
helped	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
lay	NULL
another	NULL
place	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
baby	NULL
was	NULL
awake	NULL

Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
prepared	NULL
some	NULL
Mellin	NULL
's	NULL

it	NULL

The	NULL
liver	NULL

bacon	NULL
were	NULL
ready	NULL

they	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
economy	NULL
's	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
drinking	NULL
anything	NULL

water	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
thought	NULL

did	NULL
his	NULL

up	NULL

Philip	NULL
lit	NULL
his	NULL
pipe	NULL

began	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
somebody	NULL
moving	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
his	NULL
loneliness	NULL
had	NULL
oppressed	NULL
him	NULL

Mildred	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
clear	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
clatter	NULL
of	NULL
plates	NULL

she	NULL
washed	NULL
up	NULL

Philip	NULL
smiled	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
how	NULL
characteristic	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
do	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
brought	NULL
his	NULL
book	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
reading	NULL
Osler	NULL

Mildred	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL

rolling	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
sleeves	NULL

Philip	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL

the	NULL
occasion	NULL

feared	NULL

going	NULL

he	NULL
did	NULL

reassure	NULL
her	NULL

The	NULL

was	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
offer	NULL
to	NULL
shake	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
shut	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
quietly	NULL

heard	NULL
her	NULL
moving	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL

The	NULL
baby	NULL

sitting	NULL
on	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL

broke	NULL
into	NULL

sat	NULL
down	NULL

her	NULL

their	NULL

often	NULL

the	NULL

they	NULL

towards	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
evening	NULL

This	NULL

Philip	NULL

them	NULL
both	NULL
there	NULL

Lawson	NULL

Lawson	NULL

more	NULL

out	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
on	NULL
excellent	NULL

Hayward	NULL

Lawson	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

Lawson	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL
extravagant	NULL

heard	NULL

a	NULL

last	NULL

I	NULL
asked	NULL
these	NULL

if	NULL

I	NULL
bought	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL

I	NULL
sold	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
sick	NULL
with	NULL
envy	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
recently	NULL
sold	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
mortgage	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL

fortune	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
invested	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
six	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
left	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
panic-stricken	NULL
sometimes	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
still	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL

then	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
for	NULL
hospital	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
expect	NULL

anything	NULL

three	NULL

With	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL

economy	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL

left	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
stand-by	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ill	NULL

could	NULL
not	NULL

found	NULL
himself	NULL

any	NULL

A	NULL

Macalister	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Kaffir	NULL

often	NULL
told	NULL
them	NULL
stories	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
talking	NULL
till	NULL
nearly	NULL
midnight	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
furthest	NULL
off	NULL

was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
catch	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
tram	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
very	NULL
late	NULL

As	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
reach	NULL
home	NULL
till	NULL
nearly	NULL
half	NULL
past	NULL
twelve	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
upstairs	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL

find	NULL
Mildred	NULL
still	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL

arm-chair	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
move	NULL

noticed	NULL
that	NULL

her	NULL
black	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
shadow	NULL

a	NULL
smile	NULL
played	NULL
upon	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sure	NULL
whether	NULL

not	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
slightly	NULL
embarrassed	NULL

assumed	NULL

said	NULL
coldly	NULL

She	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL

a	NULL
little	NULL
sulkily	NULL

went	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL

He	NULL
smiled	NULL
when	NULL

The	NULL
next	NULL

passed	NULL

settled	NULL
down	NULL

off	NULL

made	NULL
herself	NULL

she	NULL
took	NULL

when	NULL

You	NULL

a	NULL
past	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
cock-and-bull	NULL

said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
vaguely	NULL
irritated	NULL
that	NULL
Mildred	NULL
still	NULL
had	NULL
this	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
telling	NULL
fibs	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
learnt	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
shrugged	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
When	NULL
all	NULL
's	NULL
said	NULL
and	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
reflected	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
has	NULL
n't	NULL
had	NULL
much	NULL
chance	NULL

"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
beautiful	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
warm	NULL
and	NULL
cloudless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
of	NULL
South	NULL
London	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
restlessness	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
which	NULL
seizes	NULL
the	NULL
cockney	NULL
sometimes	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
turn	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
calls	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
cleared	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
supper	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
street	NULL
noises	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
noises	NULL
of	NULL
people	NULL
calling	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
passing	NULL
traffic	NULL

of	NULL
a	NULL
barrel-organ	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
work	NULL
tonight	NULL

Philip	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
wistful	NULL
expression	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
ought	NULL

but	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
just	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
hat	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
joyfully	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
night	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
almost	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
indoors	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
baby	NULL
was	NULL
asleep	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
safely	NULL
left	NULL
;	NULL
Mildred	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
left	NULL
it	NULL
alone	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
never	NULL
woke	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
high	NULL
spirits	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
hat	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
rouge	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
excitement	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL
colour	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
pale	NULL
cheeks	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
touched	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
child-like	NULL
delight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
reproached	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
austerity	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
treated	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
laughed	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
tram	NULL
they	NULL
saw	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
towards	NULL
Westminster	NULL
Bridge	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
smoked	NULL
his	NULL
pipe	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
crowded	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
shops	NULL
were	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
gaily	NULL
lit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
doing	NULL
their	NULL
shopping	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
passed	NULL
a	NULL
music-hall	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
Canterbury	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
cried	NULL
out	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL
let	NULL
's	NULL
go	NULL
there	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL

to	NULL
a	NULL
music-hall	NULL
for	NULL
months	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
afford	NULL
stalls	NULL

you	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
quite	NULL
happy	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
gallery	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
got	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
back	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
doors	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
got	NULL
capital	NULL
seats	NULL
for	NULL
sixpence	NULL
each	NULL
,	NULL
high	NULL
up	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
gallery	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
fine	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
glistened	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
herself	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
simple-mindedness	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
which	NULL
touched	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
puzzle	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Certain	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
still	NULL
pleased	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
badly	NULL
brought	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
hard	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
blamed	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
fault	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
virtues	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
power	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
.	NULL

Under	NULL
different	NULL
circumstances	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
charming	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
extraordinarily	NULL
unfit	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
battle	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
watched	NULL
her	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
profile	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
slightly	NULL
open	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
delicate	NULL
flush	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
strangely	NULL
virginal	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
an	NULL
overwhelming	NULL
compassion	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
he	NULL
forgave	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
misery	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
caused	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
smoky	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
made	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
ache	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
suggested	NULL
going	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
beseeching	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
smiled	NULL
and	NULL
consented	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
held	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
performance	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
streamed	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
audience	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
crowded	NULL
street	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
home	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
wandered	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
Westminster	NULL
Bridge	NULL
Road	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
not	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
time	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
for	NULL
months	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thankful	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fates	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
carried	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
sudden	NULL
impulse	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
Mildred	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
baby	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
flat	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
happy	NULL
gratitude	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
she	NULL
grew	NULL
tired	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
jumped	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
tram	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
home	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
late	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
into	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
street	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
slipped	NULL
her	NULL
arm	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
just	NULL
like	NULL
old	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
Phil	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
called	NULL
him	NULL
Phil	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
called	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
now	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
pang	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
then	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
pain	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
great	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
quite	NULL
seriously	NULL
of	NULL
committing	NULL
suicide	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
all	NULL
seemed	NULL
very	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
smiled	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
past	NULL
self	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
nothing	NULL
for	NULL
Mildred	NULL
but	NULL
infinite	NULL
pity	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
Philip	NULL
lit	NULL
the	NULL
gas	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
just	NULL

"	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
stirred	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL

Philip	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL

slamming	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

XCIII	NULL
Next	NULL
morning	NULL
Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
sulky	NULL
and	NULL
taciturn	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
dinner	NULL
ready	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
cook	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
chops	NULL
and	NULL
steaks	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
up	NULL
odds	NULL
and	NULL
ends	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
more	NULL
money	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
served	NULL
up	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
opposite	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
would	NULL
eat	NULL
nothing	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
remarked	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
headache	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
hungry	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
somewhere	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
Athelnys	NULL
were	NULL
cheerful	NULL
and	NULL
friendly	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
delightful	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
unexpected	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
realise	NULL
that	NULL
everyone	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
household	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
with	NULL
pleasure	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
visit	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
supper	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
haughty	NULL
expression	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
frown	NULL
between	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
made	NULL
Philip	NULL
impatient	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
considerate	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
allowance	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
very	NULL
silent	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
smile	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
paid	NULL

expected	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
an	NULL
ungracious	NULL
answer	NULL

but	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL

he	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
awkward	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL

apparently	NULL
it	NULL

puzzled	NULL

very	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL

also	NULL
she	NULL

Life	NULL
went	NULL
smoothly	NULL
enough	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL

Philip	NULL
spent	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL

worked	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
except	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Athelnys	NULL
'	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tavern	NULL
in	NULL
Beak	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
the	NULL
physician	NULL
for	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
clerked	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
solemn	NULL
dinner	NULL

two	NULL

three	NULL

he	NULL
went	NULL

Mildred	NULL
accepted	NULL
the	NULL
monotony	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
minded	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
sometimes	NULL
by	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
mentioned	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Occasionally	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
music	NULL
hall	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
carried	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
intention	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
tie	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
domestic	NULL

did	NULL
in	NULL

She	NULL

up	NULL
her	NULL

it	NULL

work	NULL
that	NULL

with	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
approval	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
autumn	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL

something	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
grew	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
attached	NULL
to	NULL
Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
naturally	NULL
affectionate	NULL
disposition	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
little	NULL
opportunity	NULL
to	NULL
display	NULL
itself	NULL

Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
unkind	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
girl	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL

once	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
cold	NULL
proved	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL
devoted	NULL
nurse	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
bored	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
sharply	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
bothered	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
maternal	NULL
passion	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
induced	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
forget	NULL
herself	NULL

Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
demonstrativeness	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
manifestations	NULL
of	NULL
affection	NULL
ridiculous	NULL

When	NULL
Philip	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
,	NULL
playing	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL

kissing	NULL
it	NULL

she	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL

Philip	NULL
flushed	NULL

for	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL

laughed	NULL
at	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
absurd	NULL
to	NULL

so	NULL
devoted	NULL
to	NULL
another	NULL
man	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
ashamed	NULL

the	NULL

his	NULL
heart	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL

feeling	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL

would	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL

It	NULL

Philip	NULL
remembered	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
one	NULL

the	NULL
tavern	NULL
in	NULL
Beak	NULL

found	NULL
nobody	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL
together	NULL

chatting	NULL
about	NULL

after	NULL
a	NULL

Macalister	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

now	NULL
that	NULL

answered	NULL
coldly	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL

looked	NULL
upon	NULL

Philip	NULL

Philip	NULL
quickly	NULL

out	NULL

it	NULL

Philip	NULL
agreed	NULL

it	NULL
happened	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL

Mildred	NULL
stiffly	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL

,	NULL
retiring	NULL
huffily	NULL
into	NULL

sat	NULL
by	NULL

made	NULL

The	NULL

from	NULL
the	NULL

up	NULL

with	NULL
its	NULL

"	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
boarding-house	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
ate	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
narrow	NULL
,	NULL
dark	NULL
room	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
landlady	NULL
sat	NULL
and	NULL
carved	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
food	NULL
was	NULL
bad	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
landlady	NULL
called	NULL
it	NULL
French	NULL
cooking	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
quality	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
materials	NULL
was	NULL
disguised	NULL
by	NULL
ill-made	NULL
sauces	NULL
:	NULL
plaice	NULL
masqueraded	NULL
as	NULL
sole	NULL
and	NULL
New	NULL

mutton	NULL
as	NULL
lamb	NULL

The	NULL
kitchen	NULL
was	NULL
small	NULL
and	NULL
inconvenient	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
everything	NULL
was	NULL
served	NULL
up	NULL
lukewarm	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
dull	NULL
and	NULL
pretentious	NULL
;	NULL
old	NULL
ladies	NULL
with	NULL
elderly	NULL
maiden	NULL
daughters	NULL

funny	NULL
old	NULL

were	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL

they	NULL
discussed	NULL

and	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
liked	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Alma-Tadema	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
Lord	NULL
Leighton	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
soon	NULL
told	NULL
the	NULL
ladies	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
romantic	NULL
marriage	NULL
with	NULL
Philip	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
an	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
interest	NULL
because	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
county	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
cut	NULL
him	NULL
off	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
shilling	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
married	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
stoodent	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
place	NULL
down	NULL
Devonshire	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
why	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
boarding-house	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
nurse	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
two	NULL
rooms	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
both	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
accommodation	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
care	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
cramped	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
other	NULL
visitors	NULL
also	NULL
had	NULL
explanations	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
presence	NULL
:	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
single	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
generally	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Metropole	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
holiday	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
cheerful	NULL
company	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
get	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
expensive	NULL
hotels	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
middle-aged	NULL
daughter	NULL
was	NULL
having	NULL
her	NULL
beautiful	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
done	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
daughter	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Gwennie	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
cheap	NULL
holiday	NULL
this	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
found	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
superior	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
hated	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
common	NULL
,	NULL
rough	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
liked	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
When	NULL
people	NULL
are	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
and	NULL
ladies	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
like	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
and	NULL
ladies	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
remark	NULL
seemed	NULL
cryptic	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
to	NULL
different	NULL
persons	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
aroused	NULL
hearty	NULL
agreement	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
obscure	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
intelligence	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
thrown	NULL
entirely	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
London	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
home	NULL
the	NULL
household	NULL
affairs	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
neighbours	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
he	NULL
spent	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
day	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
breakfast	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
beach	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
went	NULL
easily	NULL
enough	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
bathe	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
stroll	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
spent	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
pier	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
tolerable	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
music	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
constant	NULL
stream	NULL
of	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
;	NULL
(	NULL
Philip	NULL
amused	NULL
himself	NULL
by	NULL
imagining	NULL
who	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
and	NULL
weaving	NULL
little	NULL
stories	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
answering	NULL
Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
remarks	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
only	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
remained	NULL
undisturbed	NULL
;)	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
afternoons	NULL
were	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
dreary	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
beach	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
said	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
get	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
benefit	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
Doctor	NULL
Brighton	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
read	NULL
because	NULL
Mildred	NULL
made	NULL
observations	NULL
frequently	NULL
about	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
paid	NULL
no	NULL
attention	NULL
she	NULL
complained	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
leave	NULL
that	NULL
silly	NULL
old	NULL
book	NULL
alone	NULL

It	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
always	NULL
reading	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
'll	NULL
addle	NULL
your	NULL
brain	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
rot	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Besides	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
so	NULL
unsociable	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
attending	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
herself	NULL
saying	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
dog	NULL
running	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
passing	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
loud	NULL
blazer	NULL
would	NULL
call	NULL
forth	NULL
a	NULL
remark	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
forget	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
speaking	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
memory	NULL
for	NULL
names	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
irritated	NULL
her	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
pause	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
story	NULL
to	NULL
rack	NULL
her	NULL
brains	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
often	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
interrupt	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Collins	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Collins	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
remember	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
exasperated	NULL
him	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
showed	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
anything	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
reproached	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
sulkiness	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
order	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
deal	NULL
for	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
abstract	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
gave	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
taste	NULL
for	NULL
generalising	NULL
she	NULL
very	NULL
quickly	NULL
showed	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
bored	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
dreamt	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
accurate	NULL
memory	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
dreams	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
relate	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
with	NULL
prolixity	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
received	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
Thorpe	NULL
Athelny	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
taking	NULL
his	NULL
holiday	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
theatrical	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
sound	NULL
sense	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
characterised	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
thing	NULL
for	NULL
ten	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
whole	NULL
family	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
hop-field	NULL
in	NULL
Kent	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
's	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
spent	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
hopping	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
kept	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
earned	NULL
them	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
's	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
renewed	NULL
their	NULL
contact	NULL
with	NULL
mother	NULL
earth	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
upon	NULL
this	NULL
that	NULL
Athelny	NULL
laid	NULL
stress	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sojourn	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fields	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
strength	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
magic	NULL
ceremony	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
renewed	NULL
their	NULL
youth	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
limbs	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sweetness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
spirit	NULL
:	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
say	NULL
many	NULL
fantastic	NULL
,	NULL
rhetorical	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
picturesque	NULL
things	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
Athelny	NULL
invited	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
over	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
certain	NULL
meditations	NULL
on	NULL
Shakespeare	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
musical	NULL
glasses	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
desired	NULL
to	NULL
impart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
were	NULL
clamouring	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
Uncle	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
with	NULL
Mildred	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
beach	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
,	NULL
cheerful	NULL
mother	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
kindly	NULL
hospitality	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
good	NULL
humour	NULL
;	NULL
of	NULL
Sally	NULL
,	NULL
grave	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
funny	NULL
little	NULL
maternal	NULL
ways	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
authority	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
long	NULL
plait	NULL
of	NULL
fair	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
broad	NULL
forehead	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
bunch	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
merry	NULL
,	NULL
boisterous	NULL
,	NULL
healthy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
handsome	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
quality	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
remember	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
noticed	NULL
in	NULL
people	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
goodness	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
till	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
goodness	NULL
which	NULL
attracted	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
theory	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
:	NULL
if	NULL
morality	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
convenience	NULL
good	NULL
and	NULL
evil	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
meaning	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
illogical	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
simple	NULL
goodness	NULL
,	NULL
natural	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
effort	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
beautiful	NULL
.	NULL

Meditating	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
slowly	NULL
tore	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
into	NULL
little	NULL
pieces	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
without	NULL
Mildred	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
hot	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
was	NULL
cloudless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
driven	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
shady	NULL
corner	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
baby	NULL
was	NULL
gravely	NULL
playing	NULL
with	NULL
stones	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
beach	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
crawled	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
away	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
placed	NULL
it	NULL
carefully	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
playing	NULL
a	NULL
mysterious	NULL
and	NULL
complicated	NULL
game	NULL
known	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
asleep	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
lay	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
thrown	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
slightly	NULL
open	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
legs	NULL
were	NULL
stretched	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
boots	NULL
protruded	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
petticoats	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
grotesque	NULL
fashion	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
eyes	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
resting	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
vaguely	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
peculiar	NULL
attention	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
how	NULL
passionately	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
why	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
entirely	NULL
indifferent	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
dull	NULL
pain	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sheer	NULL
waste	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
had	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
ecstasy	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
desired	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
share	NULL
every	NULL
thought	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
feeling	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
acutely	NULL
because	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
silence	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
remark	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
showed	NULL
how	NULL
far	NULL
their	NULL
thoughts	NULL
had	NULL
travelled	NULL
apart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
rebelled	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
unsurmountable	NULL
wall	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
divide	NULL
every	NULL
personality	NULL
from	NULL
every	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
strangely	NULL
tragic	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
madly	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
incapable	NULL
of	NULL
learning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
experience	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
had	NULL
taught	NULL
her	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
unmannerly	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
revolted	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
insolence	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
treated	NULL
the	NULL
hard-worked	NULL
servant	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
boarding-house	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
he	NULL
considered	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
plans	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fourth	NULL
year	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
his	NULL
examination	NULL
in	NULL
midwifery	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
more	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
qualified	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
manage	NULL
a	NULL
journey	NULL
to	NULL
Spain	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
pictures	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
only	NULL
from	NULL
photographs	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
deeply	NULL
that	NULL
El	NULL
Greco	NULL
held	NULL
a	NULL
secret	NULL
of	NULL
peculiar	NULL
moment	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
fancied	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
Toledo	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
surely	NULL
find	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
things	NULL
grandly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
live	NULL
for	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
in	NULL
Spain	NULL
:	NULL
if	NULL
Macalister	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
another	NULL
good	NULL
thing	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
that	NULL
easily	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
warmed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
old	NULL
beautiful	NULL
cities	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tawny	NULL
plains	NULL
of	NULL
Castile	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
more	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
than	NULL
offered	NULL
itself	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
Spain	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
live	NULL
with	NULL
greater	NULL
intensity	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
practise	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
old	NULL
cities	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
many	NULL
foreigners	NULL
,	NULL
passing	NULL
or	NULL
resident	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
pick	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
living	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
much	NULL
later	NULL
;	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
get	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
hospital	NULL
appointments	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
gave	NULL
experience	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
jobs	NULL
afterwards	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
berth	NULL
as	NULL
ship	NULL
's	NULL
doctor	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
tramps	NULL
that	NULL
took	NULL
things	NULL
leisurely	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
places	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
stopped	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
East	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
fancy	NULL
was	NULL
rich	NULL
with	NULL
pictures	NULL
of	NULL
Bangkok	NULL
and	NULL
Shanghai	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
ports	NULL
of	NULL
Japan	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
pictured	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
palm-trees	NULL
and	NULL
skies	NULL
blue	NULL
and	NULL
hot	NULL
,	NULL
dark-skinned	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
pagodas	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
scents	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Orient	NULL
intoxicated	NULL
his	NULL
nostrils	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
with	NULL
passionate	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
strangeness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
awoke	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
believe	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
been	NULL
asleep	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL

you	NULL

what	NULL

Her	NULL

XCV	NULL
When	NULL
they	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
Philip	NULL
began	NULL
his	NULL
dressing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
surgical	NULL
wards	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
surgery	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
medicine	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
empirical	NULL
science	NULL
,	NULL
offered	NULL
greater	NULL
scope	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
imagination	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
harder	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
corresponding	NULL
work	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
medical	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lecture	NULL
from	NULL
nine	NULL
till	NULL
ten	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
wards	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
wounds	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
dressed	NULL
,	NULL
stitches	NULL
taken	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
bandages	NULL
renewed	NULL
:	NULL
Philip	NULL
prided	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
skill	NULL
in	NULL
bandaging	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
amused	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
wring	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
of	NULL
approval	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
nurse	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
certain	NULL
afternoons	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
operations	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
well	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
theatre	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
jacket	NULL
,	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
hand	NULL
the	NULL
operating	NULL
surgeon	NULL
any	NULL
instrument	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
sponge	NULL
the	NULL
blood	NULL
away	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
some	NULL
rare	NULL
operation	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
performed	NULL
the	NULL
theatre	NULL
would	NULL
fill	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
generally	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
students	NULL
present	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
proceedings	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
cosiness	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
at	NULL
large	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
appendicitis	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
many	NULL
cases	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
operating	NULL
theatre	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
complaint	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
surgeon	NULL
for	NULL
whom	NULL
Philip	NULL
dressed	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
friendly	NULL
rivalry	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
colleague	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
remove	NULL
an	NULL
appendix	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shortest	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
smallest	NULL
incision	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
due	NULL
course	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
accident	NULL
duty	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dressers	NULL
took	NULL
this	NULL
in	NULL
turn	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
lasted	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
hospital	NULL
and	NULL
ate	NULL
their	NULL
meals	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
common-room	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
floor	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
casualty	NULL
ward	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
bed	NULL
that	NULL
shut	NULL
up	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
cupboard	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dresser	NULL
on	NULL
duty	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
night	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
casualty	NULL
that	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
move	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL

and	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL

night	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL

bell	NULL

above	NULL

made	NULL
you	NULL
leap	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL

instinctively	NULL

Saturday	NULL
night	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
the	NULL
busiest	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
closing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
public-houses	NULL
the	NULL
busiest	NULL
hour	NULL

Men	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
brought	NULL

it	NULL
would	NULL

rather	NULL
the	NULL
worse	NULL

liquor	NULL

would	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL

a	NULL
wound	NULL
on	NULL

the	NULL
law	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL

others	NULL

ashamed	NULL

would	NULL

What	NULL
the	NULL
dresser	NULL
could	NULL
manage	NULL
himself	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL

if	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
anything	NULL

and	NULL
sullen	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
secret	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
try	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
kill	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
released	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wards	NULL
were	NULL
crowded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
house-surgeon	NULL
was	NULL
faced	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
dilemma	NULL
when	NULL
patients	NULL
were	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
police	NULL
:	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
sent	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
and	NULL
died	NULL
there	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
said	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
papers	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
difficult	NULL
sometimes	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
dying	NULL
or	NULL
drunk	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
bother	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
up	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
casualty	NULL
ward	NULL
talking	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
intervals	NULL
of	NULL
work	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
night-nurse	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
gray-haired	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
masculine	NULL
appearance	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
night-nurse	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
casualty	NULL
department	NULL
for	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
liked	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
mistress	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
sister	NULL
to	NULL
bother	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
movements	NULL
were	NULL
slow	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
immensely	NULL
capable	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
failed	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
emergency	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dressers	NULL
,	NULL
often	NULL
inexperienced	NULL
or	NULL
nervous	NULL
,	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
tower	NULL
of	NULL
strength	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
thousands	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
impression	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
always	NULL
called	NULL
them	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brown	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
expostulated	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
their	NULL
real	NULL
names	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
merely	NULL
nodded	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
calling	NULL
them	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brown	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
interested	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bare	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
two	NULL
horse-hair	NULL
couches	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
flaring	NULL
gas	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
listen	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
as	NULL
human	NULL
beings	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
drunks	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
broken	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
cut	NULL
throats	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
vice	NULL
and	NULL
misery	NULL
and	NULL
cruelty	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
praise	NULL
or	NULL
blame	NULL
in	NULL
human	NULL
actions	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
accepted	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
grim	NULL
humour	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
one	NULL
suicide	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
who	NULL
threw	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
Thames	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
fished	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ten	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL
he	NULL
developed	NULL
typhoid	NULL
fever	NULL
from	NULL
swallowing	NULL
Thames	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Did	NULL
he	NULL
die	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
suicide	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
're	NULL
a	NULL
funny	NULL
lot	NULL
,	NULL
suicides	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
one	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
get	NULL
any	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
died	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
pawned	NULL
his	NULL
clothes	NULL
and	NULL
bought	NULL
a	NULL
revolver	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
mess	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
shot	NULL
out	NULL
an	NULL
eye	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
please	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
eye	NULL
gone	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
blow	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
place	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
lived	NULL
happily	NULL
ever	NULL
afterwards	NULL
.	NULL

Thing	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
always	NULL
noticed	NULL
,	NULL
people	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
commit	NULL
suicide	NULL
for	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
'd	NULL
expect	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
fancy	NULL
of	NULL
novelists	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
commit	NULL
suicide	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL
got	NULL
any	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wonder	NULL
why	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
money	NULL
's	NULL
more	NULL
important	NULL
than	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
suggested	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Money	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
case	NULL
occupying	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
thoughts	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
discovered	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
truth	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
airy	NULL
saying	NULL
which	NULL
himself	NULL
had	NULL
repeated	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
two	NULL
could	NULL
live	NULL
as	NULL
cheaply	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
expenses	NULL
were	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
worry	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
manager	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
cost	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
eaten	NULL
in	NULL
restaurants	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
needed	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
boots	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
umbrella	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
small	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
without	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
returned	NULL
from	NULL
Brighton	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
announced	NULL
her	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
a	NULL
job	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
definite	NULL
steps	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
cold	NULL
laid	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
advertisements	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
nothing	NULL
came	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
:	NULL
either	NULL
she	NULL
arrived	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
vacant	NULL
place	NULL
was	NULL
filled	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
strong	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
an	NULL
offer	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
wages	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
fourteen	NULL
shillings	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
letting	NULL
oneself	NULL
be	NULL
put	NULL
upon	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
remarked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
People	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
respect	NULL
you	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
let	NULL
yourself	NULL
go	NULL
too	NULL
cheap	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
fourteen	NULL
shillings	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
bad	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
answered	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
drily	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
thinking	NULL
how	NULL
useful	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
expenses	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
household	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
hint	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
decent	NULL
dress	NULL
to	NULL
interview	NULL
employers	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
more	NULL
attempts	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
serious	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
way	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
money	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Stock	NULL
Exchange	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
repeat	NULL
the	NULL
lucky	NULL
experiment	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
war	NULL
had	NULL
broken	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Transvaal	NULL
and	NULL
nothing	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
in	NULL
South	NULL
Africans	NULL
.	NULL

Macalister	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
Redvers	NULL
Buller	NULL
would	NULL
march	NULL
into	NULL
Pretoria	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
everything	NULL
would	NULL
boom	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
patiently	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
they	NULL
wanted	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
British	NULL
reverse	NULL
to	NULL
knock	NULL
things	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
worth	NULL
while	NULL
buying	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
began	NULL
reading	NULL
assiduously	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
city	NULL
chat	NULL
'	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
favourite	NULL
newspaper	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
worried	NULL
and	NULL
irritable	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
sharply	NULL
to	NULL
Mildred	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
neither	NULL
tactful	NULL
nor	NULL
patient	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
with	NULL
temper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
quarrelled	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
always	NULL
expressed	NULL
his	NULL
regret	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
forgiving	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
sulk	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
nerves	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
ways	NULL
;	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
manner	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
ate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
untidiness	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
leave	NULL
articles	NULL
of	NULL
clothing	NULL
about	NULL
their	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
:	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
excited	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
and	NULL
devoured	NULL
the	NULL
papers	NULL
,	NULL
morning	NULL
and	NULL
evening	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
anything	NULL
that	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
curate	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
wedding-ring	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
herself	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
walls	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
drawings	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
nudes	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
women	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Miguel	NULL
Ajuria	NULL
,	NULL
standing	NULL
very	NULL
square	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
clenched	NULL
fists	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
kept	NULL
them	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
things	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
reminded	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
happy	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
disfavour	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
you	NULL
'd	NULL

him	NULL

When	NULL
Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
cross	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
she	NULL
punished	NULL
him	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
little	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
indifferent	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
angry	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
grew	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
having	NULL
her	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

Christmas	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
days	NULL
holiday	NULL
for	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
brought	NULL
some	NULL
holly	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
decorated	NULL
the	NULL
flat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
Christmas	NULL
Day	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
small	NULL
presents	NULL
to	NULL
Mildred	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
so	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
turkey	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Mildred	NULL
roasted	NULL
a	NULL
chicken	NULL
and	NULL
boiled	NULL
a	NULL
Christmas	NULL
pudding	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
local	NULL
grocer	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
stood	NULL
themselves	NULL
a	NULL
bottle	NULL
of	NULL
wine	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
dined	NULL
Philip	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arm-chair	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
smoking	NULL
his	NULL
pipe	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
unaccustomed	NULL
wine	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
forget	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
anxiety	NULL
about	NULL
money	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
constantly	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
happy	NULL
and	NULL
comfortable	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
Mildred	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
wanted	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
her	NULL
good-night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
bed-room	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
telling	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
gas	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
open	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
she	NULL
cried	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Where	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
sit	NULL
in	NULL
your	NULL
chair	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
she	NULL
settled	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
and	NULL
leaned	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
remembering	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
sat	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
rooms	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Vauxhall	NULL
Bridge	NULL
Road	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
positions	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
reversed	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
and	NULL
leaned	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
against	NULL
her	NULL
knee	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
passionately	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
then	NULL
!	NULL

Now	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
tenderness	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
known	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
still	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
twined	NULL
round	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
's	NULL
soft	NULL
little	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL
comfy	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
nodded	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
gazed	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
dreamily	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
speaking	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
and	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
curiously	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
D'you	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL
kissed	NULL
me	NULL
once	NULL
since	NULL
I	NULL
came	NULL
here	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
suddenly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
D'you	NULL
want	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
smiled	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
much	NULL
fonder	NULL
of	NULL
baby	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
laid	NULL
her	NULL
cheek	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
not	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL

"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
presently	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
cast	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
on	NULL
earth	NULL
should	NULL
I	NULL
be	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
never	NULL

now	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
only	NULL
since	NULL
I	NULL

through	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
learnt	NULL

you	NULL

"	NULL

It	NULL
chilled	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
her	NULL
make	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
phrase	NULL
she	NULL
read	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
penny	NULL
novelettes	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
devoured	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
meaning	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
:	NULL
perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
express	NULL
her	NULL
genuine	NULL
feelings	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
stilted	NULL
language	NULL
of	NULL
The	NULL
Family	NULL

.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
seems	NULL
so	NULL
funny	NULL

living	NULL
together	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
reply	NULL
for	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
silence	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
and	NULL
seemed	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
interval	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
must	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
angry	NULL

these	NULL
things	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
wicked	NULL

cruel	NULL
because	NULL
you	NULL
did	NULL
this	NULL

She	NULL

presently	NULL
she	NULL

up	NULL

He	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
laugh	NULL

blushed	NULL
slightly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL

XCVI	NULL
The	NULL
climax	NULL
came	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
later	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
driven	NULL
by	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
behaviour	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
pitch	NULL
of	NULL
strange	NULL
exasperation	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
many	NULL
different	NULL
emotions	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
passed	NULL
from	NULL
mood	NULL
to	NULL
mood	NULL
with	NULL
facility	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
spent	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
alone	NULL
and	NULL
brooded	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
position	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
put	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
feelings	NULL
into	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
certain	NULL
things	NULL
stood	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
understood	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
had	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
pleased	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
impressed	NULL
because	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
doctor	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
despised	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
quite	NULL
comfortable	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
presence	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
herself	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
criticising	NULL
her	NULL
manners	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
first	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
rooms	NULL
in	NULL
Kennington	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
ashamed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
left	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
comfort	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
rent	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
need	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
weathers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
lie	NULL
quietly	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
hated	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
she	NULL
led	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
horrible	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
affable	NULL
and	NULL
subservient	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
now	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
crossed	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
she	NULL
cried	NULL
with	NULL
pity	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
roughness	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
brutal	NULL
language	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
crossed	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
very	NULL
seldom	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
grateful	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
for	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
rescue	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
remembered	NULL
how	NULL
honestly	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
badly	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
treated	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
pang	NULL
of	NULL
remorse	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
meant	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
refused	NULL
her	NULL
suggestion	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
shrugged	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
:	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
airs	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
anxious	NULL
enough	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
her	NULL
turn	NULL
to	NULL
refuse	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
any	NULL
deprivation	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
mistaken	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
power	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
peculiar	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
him	NULL
through	NULL
and	NULL
through	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
quarrelled	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
sworn	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
begging	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
forgiven	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
thrill	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
cringed	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
lie	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
cry	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
exactly	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
treat	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
pay	NULL
no	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
pretend	NULL
you	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
notice	NULL
his	NULL
tempers	NULL
,	NULL
leave	NULL
him	NULL
severely	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
to	NULL
grovel	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
laughed	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
good-humouredly	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
eaten	NULL
dirt	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
fling	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
anything	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
settle	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sneezed	NULL
at	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
no	NULL
hurry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
step	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
fond	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
growing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
tickled	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
comic	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
set	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
store	NULL
on	NULL
another	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
peculiar	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
mistake	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
things	NULL
surprised	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
subservience	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
too	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
cast	NULL
down	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
cross	NULL
word	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
ecstasy	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
one	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
different	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
improved	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
never	NULL
struck	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
any	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
feelings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
acting	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
paid	NULL
no	NULL
heed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
bad	NULL
temper	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
sometimes	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
stop	NULL
talking	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
to	NULL
flare	NULL
up	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
sulk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
puzzled	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
neither	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
intended	NULL
their	NULL
relations	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
platonic	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
remembering	NULL
an	NULL
incident	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
common	NULL
past	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
dreaded	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
being	NULL
pregnant	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
pains	NULL
to	NULL
reassure	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
difference	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
realise	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
obsession	NULL
with	NULL
sex	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
relations	NULL
with	NULL
men	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
purely	NULL
on	NULL
those	NULL
lines	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
ever	NULL
had	NULL
other	NULL
interests	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
thought	NULL
struck	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
somebody	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
watched	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
suspecting	NULL
nurses	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
or	NULL
people	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
out	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
artful	NULL
questions	NULL
led	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
dangerous	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Athelny	NULL
household	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
forced	NULL
itself	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
most	NULL
medical	NULL
students	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
unconscious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sex	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
nurses	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
threw	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
contact	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
associated	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL
odour	NULL
of	NULL
iodoform	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
received	NULL
no	NULL
letters	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
photograph	NULL
among	NULL
his	NULL
belongings	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
someone	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
clever	NULL
at	NULL
hiding	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
all	NULL
Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
questions	NULL
with	NULL
frankness	NULL
and	NULL
apparently	NULL
without	NULL
suspicion	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
any	NULL
motive	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
believe	NULL
he	NULL
's	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
anybody	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
relief	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
case	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
still	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
behaviour	NULL
very	NULL
puzzling	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
treat	NULL
her	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
why	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
ask	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
live	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
flat	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
unnatural	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
conceived	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
compassion	NULL
,	NULL
generosity	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
kindness	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
only	NULL
conclusion	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
queer	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
reasons	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
conduct	NULL
were	NULL
chivalrous	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
imagination	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
extravagances	NULL
of	NULL
cheap	NULL
fiction	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
pictured	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
romantic	NULL
explanations	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
delicacy	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
fancy	NULL
ran	NULL
riot	NULL
with	NULL
bitter	NULL
misunderstandings	NULL
,	NULL
purifications	NULL
by	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
snow-white	NULL
souls	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
death	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cruel	NULL
cold	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Christmas	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Brighton	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
put	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
nonsense	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
alone	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
everyone	NULL
would	NULL
think	NULL
them	NULL
husband	NULL
and	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
pier	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
band	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
would	NULL
induce	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
share	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
room	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
tone	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
heard	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
suddenly	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
astounded	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
remembered	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
desperately	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
humiliated	NULL
and	NULL
angry	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
native	NULL
insolence	NULL
which	NULL
carried	NULL
her	NULL
through	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
need	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
hated	NULL
him	NULL
sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
longed	NULL
to	NULL
humble	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
singularly	NULL
powerless	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
which	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
handle	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
nervous	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
she	NULL
cried	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
she	NULL
set	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
particularly	NULL
nice	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
while	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
some	NULL
excuse	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
to	NULL
release	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
touched	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
hold	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
fonder	NULL
and	NULL
fonder	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
white	NULL
with	NULL
anger	NULL
by	NULL
giving	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
a	NULL
slap	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
push	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
tender	NULL
smile	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
was	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
noticed	NULL
it	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
photographed	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
beach	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
afterwards	NULL
she	NULL
often	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
way	NULL
for	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
Mildred	NULL
began	NULL
looking	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
asserted	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
independent	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
announce	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
into	NULL
rooms	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
failed	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
closer	NULL
contact	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
unused	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beck	NULL
and	NULL
call	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
manageress	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
dignity	NULL
revolted	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
wearing	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
a	NULL
uniform	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
neighbours	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
comfortably	NULL
off	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
come-down	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
natural	NULL
indolence	NULL
asserted	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
provide	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
her	NULL
board	NULL
and	NULL
lodging	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
get	NULL
better	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
uncle	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
might	NULL
die	NULL
any	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
as	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
slaving	NULL
from	NULL
morning	NULL
till	NULL
night	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
shillings	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
efforts	NULL
relaxed	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
kept	NULL
on	NULL
reading	NULL
the	NULL
advertisement	NULL
columns	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
daily	NULL
paper	NULL
merely	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
something	NULL
if	NULL
anything	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
her	NULL
while	NULL
presented	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
panic	NULL
seized	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
would	NULL
grow	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
supporting	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
hold	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
fancied	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
allowed	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
there	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
brooded	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
angrily	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
pay	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
some	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
reconcile	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
suffered	NULL
from	NULL
pique	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
fashion	NULL
she	NULL
desired	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
cold	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
exasperated	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
way	NULL
incessantly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
treating	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
badly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
to	NULL
deserve	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
kept	NULL
on	NULL
saying	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
unnatural	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
live	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
different	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
baby	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
funny	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
deny	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
it	NULL
became	NULL
an	NULL
obsession	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
force	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
relations	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
even	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
remembered	NULL
how	NULL
ardently	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
press	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
feeling	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
often	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
February	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dining	NULL
with	NULL
Lawson	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
giving	NULL
a	NULL
party	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
studio	NULL
to	NULL
celebrate	NULL
his	NULL
birthday	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
till	NULL
late	NULL
;	NULL
Lawson	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
bottles	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
punch	NULL
they	NULL
favoured	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
tavern	NULL
in	NULL
Beak	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
proposed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
merry	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
asked	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
women	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
;	NULL
only	NULL
men	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
invited	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
just	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
and	NULL
talk	NULL
and	NULL
smoke	NULL
:	NULL
Mildred	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
sounded	NULL
very	NULL
amusing	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
painter	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
models	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
struck	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
fixed	NULL
the	NULL
catch	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
wicket	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
landing	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
about	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
curse	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
wicket	NULL
was	NULL
closed	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL

turned	NULL
up	NULL

She	NULL
followed	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL

began	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
boots	NULL

His	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
shining	NULL

his	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
sober	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
talking	NULL

laughing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
excited	NULL
still	NULL

An	NULL
evening	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL

reminded	NULL
him	NULL

He	NULL

Philip	NULL
laughed	NULL
with	NULL
pleasure	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

She	NULL

she	NULL
settled	NULL
herself	NULL

She	NULL
seized	NULL

kisses	NULL

he	NULL
cried	NULL

she	NULL
dropped	NULL

the	NULL

gave	NULL
a	NULL

sidled	NULL

the	NULL

instinctively	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

she	NULL

sought	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL

tore	NULL
them	NULL
roughly	NULL
apart	NULL

pushed	NULL

away	NULL

herself	NULL

two	NULL

gave	NULL
a	NULL

She	NULL
paused	NULL

drew	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
breath	NULL
sharply	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
furious	NULL
torrent	NULL

abuse	NULL

She	NULL
shouted	NULL
at	NULL

She	NULL
called	NULL
him	NULL

used	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL
tumultuous	NULL
speech	NULL
the	NULL

dribbled	NULL
over	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
burst	NULL
again	NULL
into	NULL
abominable	NULL
invective	NULL

accused	NULL
him	NULL

every	NULL

She	NULL

XCVII	NULL
Philip	NULL
awoke	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
start	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
late	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
watch	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
nine	NULL
o'clock	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
jumped	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
himself	NULL
some	NULL
hot	NULL
water	NULL
to	NULL
shave	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
Mildred	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
used	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
supper	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
still	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sink	NULL
unwashed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knocked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Wake	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
awfully	NULL
late	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
louder	NULL
knocking	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
concluded	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sulking	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
too	NULL
great	NULL
a	NULL
hurry	NULL
to	NULL
bother	NULL
about	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
some	NULL
water	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
boil	NULL
and	NULL
jumped	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
bath	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
chill	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
presumed	NULL
that	NULL
Mildred	NULL
would	NULL
cook	NULL
his	NULL
breakfast	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dressing	NULL
and	NULL
leave	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
that	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
temper	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
no	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
moving	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
it	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
irritated	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
play	NULL
him	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
trick	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
morning	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
over-slept	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
no	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
moving	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
getting	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
himself	NULL
some	NULL
tea	NULL
and	NULL
cut	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
pieces	NULL
of	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
ate	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
putting	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
boots	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
bolted	NULL
downstairs	NULL
and	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
main	NULL
road	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
his	NULL
tram	NULL

While	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
sought	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
newspaper	NULL
shops	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
news	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
placards	NULL

he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL

now	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL

slept	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
thinking	NULL
it	NULL
grotesque	NULL

he	NULL
supposed	NULL

been	NULL
ridiculous	NULL

he	NULL

his	NULL
feelings	NULL
;	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
overwhelming	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
Mildred	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
forced	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
that	NULL
absurd	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
renewed	NULL
astonishment	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
outburst	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
filthy	NULL
language	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
used	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
flushing	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
her	NULL
final	NULL
jibe	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
shrugged	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
contemptuously	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
known	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
fellows	NULL
were	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
they	NULL
never	NULL
failed	NULL
to	NULL
taunt	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
deformity	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
men	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
imitate	NULL
his	NULL
walk	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
used	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
looking	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
no	NULL
wilful	NULL
unkindness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
because	NULL
man	NULL
is	NULL
naturally	NULL
an	NULL
imitative	NULL
animal	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
easy	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
people	NULL
laugh	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
resign	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
ward	NULL
seemed	NULL
pleasant	NULL
and	NULL
friendly	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
entered	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sister	NULL
greeted	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
,	NULL
business-like	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
very	NULL
late	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
loose	NULL
last	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
look	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Thank	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Laughing	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
cases	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
with	NULL
tuberculous	NULL
ulcers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
removed	NULL
his	NULL
bandages	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
was	NULL
pleased	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
chaffed	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
a	NULL
clean	NULL
dressing	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
wound	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
favourite	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
patients	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
treated	NULL
them	NULL
good-humouredly	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gentle	NULL
,	NULL
sensitive	NULL
hands	NULL
which	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
hurt	NULL
them	NULL
:	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dressers	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
rough	NULL
and	NULL
happy-go-lucky	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
methods	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
lunched	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
club-room	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
frugal	NULL
meal	NULL
consisting	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
scone	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
cocoa	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
.	NULL

Several	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
authorities	NULL
were	NULL
particular	NULL
and	NULL
refused	NULL
everyone	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
hospital	NULL
appointment	NULL
.	NULL

Someone	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
anyone	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
qualified	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
opinion	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
over	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
that	NULL
Roberts	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
things	NULL
would	NULL
get	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
no	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
Macalister	NULL
's	NULL
opinion	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
watch	NULL
their	NULL
chance	NULL
and	NULL
buy	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
peace	NULL
was	NULL
declared	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
boom	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
all	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
with	NULL
Macalister	NULL
instructions	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
him	NULL
stock	NULL
whenever	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
presented	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
appetite	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
whetted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
thirty	NULL
pounds	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
hundred	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
finished	NULL
his	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
and	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
tram	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Kennington	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
how	NULL
Mildred	NULL
would	NULL
behave	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
nuisance	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
be	NULL
surly	NULL
and	NULL
refuse	NULL
to	NULL
answer	NULL
his	NULL
questions	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
warm	NULL
evening	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
gray	NULL
streets	NULL
of	NULL
South	NULL
London	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
languor	NULL
of	NULL
February	NULL
;	NULL
nature	NULL
is	NULL
restless	NULL
then	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
winter	NULL
months	NULL
,	NULL
growing	NULL
things	NULL
awake	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
rustle	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
forerunner	NULL
of	NULL
spring	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
resumes	NULL
its	NULL
eternal	NULL
activities	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
on	NULL
further	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
distasteful	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
clutched	NULL
suddenly	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
heartstrings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
smiled	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
toddling	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
crow	NULL
of	NULL
delight	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
mechanically	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
light	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
upstairs	NULL
and	NULL
knocked	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
got	NULL
no	NULL
answer	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Mildred	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
she	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
key	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
mat	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
there	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
let	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
going	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
struck	NULL
a	NULL
match	NULL
.	NULL

Something	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
the	NULL
gas	NULL
on	NULL
full	NULL
and	NULL
lit	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
suddenly	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
glare	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
gasped	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
whole	NULL
place	NULL
was	NULL
wrecked	NULL
.	NULL

Everything	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
wilfully	NULL
destroyed	NULL
.	NULL

Anger	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
rushed	NULL
into	NULL
Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
empty	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
away	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
things	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
's	NULL
(	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
noticed	NULL
on	NULL
entering	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
go-cart	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
usual	NULL
place	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
landing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
thought	NULL
Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
out	NULL
;)	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
washing-stand	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
broken	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
knife	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
drawn	NULL
cross-ways	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
seats	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
chairs	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
pillow	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
slit	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
large	NULL
gashes	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sheets	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
counterpane	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
looking-glass	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
broken	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
hammer	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
bewildered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
too	NULL
everything	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
confusion	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
basin	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
ewer	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
smashed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
looking-glass	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
fragments	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sheets	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
ribands	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
slit	NULL
large	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
pillow	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
scattered	NULL
the	NULL
feathers	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
jabbed	NULL
a	NULL
knife	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
blankets	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
dressing-table	NULL
were	NULL
photographs	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
frames	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
smashed	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
glass	NULL
shivered	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
tiny	NULL
kitchen	NULL
.	NULL

Everything	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
breakable	NULL
was	NULL
broken	NULL
,	NULL
glasses	NULL
,	NULL
pudding-basins	NULL
,	NULL
plates	NULL
,	NULL
dishes	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
took	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
breath	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
no	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
ruin	NULL
to	NULL
mark	NULL
her	NULL
anger	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
imagine	NULL
the	NULL
set	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
astonished	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
felt	NULL
angry	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
curiously	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen-knife	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
coal-hammer	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
lying	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
his	NULL
eye	NULL
caught	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
carving-knife	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fireplace	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
broken	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
damage	NULL
.	NULL

Lawson	NULL
's	NULL
portrait	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
cut	NULL
cross-ways	NULL
and	NULL
gaped	NULL
hideously	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
own	NULL
drawings	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
ripped	NULL
in	NULL
pieces	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
photographs	NULL
,	NULL
Manet	NULL
's	NULL
Olympia	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Odalisque	NULL
of	NULL
Ingres	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
portrait	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
IV	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
smashed	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
blows	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
coal-hammer	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
gashes	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
table-cloth	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
curtains	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
arm-chairs	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
quite	NULL
ruined	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
one	NULL
wall	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
used	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
desk	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
Persian	NULL
rug	NULL
which	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
hated	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
rug	NULL
it	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
dirty	NULL
stinking	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
stuff	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
furious	NULL
because	NULL
Philip	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
it	NULL
contained	NULL
the	NULL
answer	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
riddle	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
fun	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
drawn	NULL
the	NULL
knife	NULL
right	NULL
through	NULL
it	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
required	NULL
some	NULL
strength	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
hung	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
tatters	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
blue	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
plates	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
value	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
them	NULL
one	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
for	NULL
very	NULL
small	NULL
sums	NULL
and	NULL
liked	NULL
them	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
associations	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
littered	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
in	NULL
fragments	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
long	NULL
gashes	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
backs	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
tear	NULL
pages	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
unbound	NULL
French	NULL
ones	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
little	NULL
ornaments	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
chimney-piece	NULL
lay	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
hearth	NULL
in	NULL
bits	NULL
.	NULL

Everything	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
destroy	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
knife	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
hammer	NULL
was	NULL
destroyed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
belongings	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
sold	NULL
for	NULL
thirty	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
old	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
domestic	NULL
creature	NULL
,	NULL
attached	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
odds	NULL
and	NULL
ends	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
his	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
little	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
money	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
pretty	NULL
and	NULL
characteristic	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sank	NULL
down	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
cruel	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
sudden	NULL
fear	NULL
got	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
stood	NULL
a	NULL
cupboard	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
his	NULL
clothes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
opened	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
of	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
apparently	NULL
forgotten	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
things	NULL
was	NULL
touched	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
surveying	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
,	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
things	NULL
straight	NULL
;	NULL
besides	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
food	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
hungry	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
got	NULL
himself	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
cooler	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
little	NULL
pang	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
miss	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
forgotten	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thankful	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
wrath	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
overwhelming	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
boredom	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
hope	NULL
to	NULL
God	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
aloud	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
now	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
notice	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
afford	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
good	NULL
the	NULL
damage	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
money	NULL
left	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
find	NULL
cheaper	NULL
lodgings	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
expense	NULL
had	NULL
worried	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL
recollection	NULL
of	NULL
Mildred	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
always	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
impatient	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
rest	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
action	NULL
the	NULL
plan	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
mind	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
afternoon	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dealer	NULL
in	NULL
second-hand	NULL
furniture	NULL
who	NULL
offered	NULL
him	NULL
three	NULL
pounds	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
goods	NULL
damaged	NULL
and	NULL
undamaged	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL
he	NULL
moved	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
opposite	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
rooms	NULL
when	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
medical	NULL
student	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
landlady	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
decent	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
bed-room	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
have	NULL
for	NULL
six	NULL
shillings	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
small	NULL
and	NULL
shabby	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
yard	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
that	NULL
backed	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
now	NULL
except	NULL
his	NULL
clothes	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
box	NULL
of	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
lodge	NULL
so	NULL
cheaply	NULL
.	NULL

XCVIII	NULL
And	NULL
now	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
fortunes	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
Carey	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
consequence	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
but	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
affected	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
events	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
country	NULL
was	NULL
passing	NULL
.	NULL

History	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
made	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
process	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
significant	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
absurd	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
touch	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
obscure	NULL
medical	NULL
student	NULL
.	NULL

Battle	NULL
after	NULL
battle	NULL
,	NULL
Magersfontein	NULL
,	NULL
Colenso	NULL
,	NULL
Spion	NULL
Kop	NULL
,	NULL
lost	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
playing	NULL
fields	NULL
of	NULL
Eton	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
humiliated	NULL
the	NULL
nation	NULL
and	NULL
dealt	NULL
the	NULL
death-blow	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
prestige	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
aristocracy	NULL
and	NULL
gentry	NULL
who	NULL
till	NULL
then	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
seriously	NULL
to	NULL
oppose	NULL
their	NULL
assertion	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
possessed	NULL
a	NULL
natural	NULL
instinct	NULL
of	NULL
government	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
order	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
swept	NULL
away	NULL
:	NULL
history	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
made	NULL
indeed	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
colossus	NULL
put	NULL
forth	NULL
his	NULL
strength	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
blundering	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
blundered	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
semblance	NULL
of	NULL
victory	NULL
.	NULL

Cronje	NULL
surrendered	NULL
at	NULL
Paardeberg	NULL
,	NULL
Ladysmith	NULL
was	NULL
relieved	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
March	NULL
Lord	NULL
Roberts	NULL
marched	NULL
into	NULL
Bloemfontein	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
reached	NULL
London	NULL
that	NULL
Macalister	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
tavern	NULL
in	NULL
Beak	NULL
Street	NULL
and	NULL
announced	NULL
joyfully	NULL
that	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
looking	NULL
brighter	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Stock	NULL
Exchange	NULL
.	NULL

Peace	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
sight	NULL
,	NULL
Roberts	NULL
would	NULL
march	NULL
into	NULL
Pretoria	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shares	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
up	NULL
already	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
boom	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
waiting	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
gets	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
now	NULL
or	NULL
never	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
inside	NULL
information	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
manager	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mine	NULL
in	NULL
South	NULL
Africa	NULL
had	NULL
cabled	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
senior	NULL
partner	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
firm	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
plant	NULL
was	NULL
uninjured	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
start	NULL
working	NULL
again	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
a	NULL
speculation	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
investment	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
show	NULL
how	NULL
good	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
the	NULL
senior	NULL
partner	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
Macalister	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
five	NULL
hundred	NULL
shares	NULL
for	NULL
both	NULL
his	NULL
sisters	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
put	NULL
them	NULL
into	NULL
anything	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
as	NULL
safe	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
Bank	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
my	NULL
shirt	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
shares	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
eighth	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
advised	NULL
Philip	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
greedy	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
satisfied	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
ten-shilling	NULL
rise	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
buying	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
should	NULL
do	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
hold	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
sell	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
fit	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
great	NULL
faith	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
partly	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Scotsman	NULL
and	NULL
therefore	NULL
by	NULL
nature	NULL
cautious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
partly	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
right	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
jumped	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
suggestion	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
daresay	NULL
we	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
sell	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
account	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Macalister	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
arrange	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
them	NULL
over	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
capital	NULL
system	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
held	NULL
on	NULL
till	NULL
you	NULL
got	NULL
your	NULL
profit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
never	NULL
even	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
your	NULL
hand	NULL
in	NULL
your	NULL
pocket	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
watch	NULL
the	NULL
Stock	NULL
Exchange	NULL
columns	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
with	NULL
new	NULL
interest	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
everything	NULL
was	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Macalister	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
two	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
shares	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
market	NULL
was	NULL
firm	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
set-back	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
news	NULL
that	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
South	NULL
Africa	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
reassuring	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
with	NULL
anxiety	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
shares	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
to	NULL
two	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Macalister	NULL
was	NULL
optimistic	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Boers	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
hold	NULL
out	NULL
much	NULL
longer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
bet	NULL
a	NULL
top-hat	NULL
that	NULL
Roberts	NULL
would	NULL
march	NULL
into	NULL
Johannesburg	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
April	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
account	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
out	NULL
nearly	NULL
forty	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
worried	NULL
him	NULL
considerably	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
course	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
on	NULL
:	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
circumstances	NULL
the	NULL
loss	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
great	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
pocket	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
nothing	NULL
happened	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
Boers	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
beaten	NULL
and	NULL
nothing	NULL
remained	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
surrender	NULL
:	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
small	NULL
successes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
shares	NULL
fell	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
crown	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
became	NULL
evident	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
finished	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
selling	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Macalister	NULL
saw	NULL
Philip	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
pessimistic	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
sure	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
thing	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
the	NULL
loss	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
've	NULL
been	NULL
paying	NULL
out	NULL
about	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
in	NULL
differences	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
sick	NULL
with	NULL
anxiety	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
sleep	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
bolted	NULL
his	NULL
breakfast	NULL
,	NULL
reduced	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
tea	NULL
and	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
club	NULL
reading-room	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
;	NULL
sometimes	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
was	NULL
bad	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
news	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
shares	NULL
moved	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
sold	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
lose	NULL
altogether	NULL
hard	NULL
on	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
and	NULL
fifty	NULL
pounds	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
leave	NULL
him	NULL
only	NULL
eighty	NULL
pounds	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
dabble	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Stock	NULL
Exchange	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
on	NULL
;	NULL
something	NULL
decisive	NULL
might	NULL
happen	NULL
any	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
shares	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
up	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
hope	NULL
now	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
profit	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
good	NULL
his	NULL
loss	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
only	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
finishing	NULL
his	NULL
course	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Summer	NULL
session	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
in	NULL
May	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
examination	NULL
in	NULL
midwifery	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
only	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
more	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
reckoned	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
carefully	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
manage	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
fees	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
and	NULL
fifty	NULL
pounds	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
possibly	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Early	NULL
in	NULL
April	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tavern	NULL
in	NULL
Beak	NULL
Street	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Macalister	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
eased	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
to	NULL
discuss	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
realise	NULL
that	NULL
numerous	NULL
people	NULL
beside	NULL
himself	NULL
were	NULL
suffering	NULL
from	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
trouble	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
less	NULL
intolerable	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
arrived	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
but	NULL
Hayward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
sooner	NULL
had	NULL
Philip	NULL
seated	NULL
himself	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
sailing	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Cape	NULL
on	NULL
Sunday	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

exclaimed	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Hayward	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
person	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
numbers	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
Government	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
anyone	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
qualified	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
as	NULL
troopers	NULL
,	NULL
wrote	NULL
home	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
hospital	NULL
work	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
learned	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
medical	NULL
students	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
wave	NULL
of	NULL
patriotic	NULL
feeling	NULL
had	NULL
swept	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
volunteers	NULL
were	NULL
coming	NULL
from	NULL
all	NULL
ranks	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
going	NULL
as	NULL

"	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
Dorset	NULL
Yeomanry	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
Hayward	NULL
for	NULL
eight	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
youthful	NULL
intimacy	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
enthusiastic	NULL
admiration	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL

literature	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
since	NULL
vanished	NULL

habit	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
its	NULL
place	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
Hayward	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
they	NULL
saw	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
once	NULL

twice	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL

He	NULL
still	NULL
talked	NULL
about	NULL
books	NULL

a	NULL

appreciation	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

Hayward	NULL

conversation	NULL

him	NULL

He	NULL
no	NULL

believed	NULL
implicitly	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
consequence	NULL

He	NULL
resented	NULL
Hayward	NULL

contempt	NULL

success	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
stirring	NULL
his	NULL
punch	NULL

thought	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
early	NULL
friendship	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
ardent	NULL
expectation	NULL
that	NULL
Hayward	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
great	NULL
things	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
long	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
all	NULL
such	NULL
illusions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
Hayward	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
but	NULL
talk	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
his	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
more	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
on	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thirty-five	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
still	NULL
made	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
tailor	NULL

were	NULL
worn	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
longer	NULL
than	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
stout	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
artful	NULL
arrangement	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fair	NULL
hair	NULL
could	NULL
conceal	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
bald	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
dull	NULL
and	NULL
pale	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
guess	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
drank	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
on	NULL
earth	NULL
made	NULL
you	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Cape	NULL

"	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
I	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
rather	NULL
silly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
understood	NULL
that	NULL
Hayward	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
driven	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
uneasiness	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
account	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
power	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
seem	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
fight	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
strange	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
considered	NULL
patriotism	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
prejudice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
flattering	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
cosmopolitanism	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
England	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
exile	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
countrymen	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mass	NULL
wounded	NULL
his	NULL
susceptibilities	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
people	NULL
do	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
contrary	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
their	NULL
theories	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
reasonable	NULL
for	NULL
Hayward	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
aside	NULL
and	NULL
watch	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
barbarians	NULL
slaughtered	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
puppets	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
unknown	NULL
force	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
drove	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
they	NULL
used	NULL
their	NULL
reason	NULL
to	NULL
justify	NULL
their	NULL
actions	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
actions	NULL
in	NULL
despite	NULL
of	NULL
reason	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
People	NULL
are	NULL
very	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
never	NULL

expected	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

Hayward	NULL
smiled	NULL
,	NULL
slightly	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
examined	NULL
yesterday	NULL

he	NULL
remarked	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL

was	NULL
perfectly	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
still	NULL
used	NULL
a	NULL
French	NULL
word	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
affected	NULL
way	NULL
when	NULL
an	NULL
English	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
served	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
Macalister	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wanted	NULL

you	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
sank	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
meant	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
accept	NULL
the	NULL

His	NULL
pride	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
answer	NULL
calmly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
anything	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
collect	NULL
himself	NULL

"	NULL
D'you	NULL

Macalister	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
narrowly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
hard	NULL
hit	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL
matter	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
One	NULL
has	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
chance	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
moved	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
Macalister	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
dumfounded	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
suddenly	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
ache	NULL
furiously	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
him	NULL
unmanly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
laughed	NULL
feverishly	NULL
at	NULL
everything	NULL
they	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
pretty	NULL
coolly	NULL

said	NULL
Macalister	NULL

him	NULL

When	NULL
Philip	NULL
got	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
shabby	NULL
little	NULL
room	NULL
he	NULL
flung	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
himself	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
kept	NULL
on	NULL
regretting	NULL
his	NULL
folly	NULL
bitterly	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
absurd	NULL
to	NULL
regret	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
was	NULL
inevitable	NULL
just	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
utterly	NULL
miserable	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
ways	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
wasted	NULL
money	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
few	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
head	NULL
ached	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
following	NULL
evening	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
post	NULL
the	NULL
statement	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
account	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
examined	NULL
his	NULL
pass-book	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
paid	NULL
everything	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
seven	NULL
pounds	NULL
left	NULL
.	NULL

Seven	NULL
pounds	NULL
!	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
thankful	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
horrible	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
confess	NULL
to	NULL
Macalister	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
dressing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
eye-department	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
session	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
an	NULL
ophthalmoscope	NULL
off	NULL
a	NULL
student	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
sell	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
paid	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
lacked	NULL
the	NULL
courage	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
student	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
bargain	NULL
.	NULL

Also	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
certain	NULL
books	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
about	NULL
five	NULL
pounds	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
lasted	NULL
him	NULL
six	NULL
weeks	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
very	NULL
business-like	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
grave	NULL
losses	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
studies	NULL
unless	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
help	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
should	NULL
lend	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
and	NULL
fifty	NULL
pounds	NULL
paid	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
eighteen	NULL
months	NULL
in	NULL
monthly	NULL
instalments	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
pay	NULL
interest	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
and	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
refund	NULL
the	NULL
capital	NULL
by	NULL
degrees	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
earn	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
qualified	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
latest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
pretty	NULL
sure	NULL
then	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
an	NULL
assistantship	NULL
at	NULL
three	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
uncle	NULL
wrote	NULL
back	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
fair	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
sell	NULL
out	NULL
when	NULL
everything	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
worst	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
illness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
ended	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
homily	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
warned	NULL
Philip	NULL
time	NULL
after	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
paid	NULL
any	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
honestly	NULL
say	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
expected	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
extravagance	NULL
and	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
balance	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
grew	NULL
hot	NULL
and	NULL
cold	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
would	NULL
refuse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
furious	NULL
anger	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
succeeded	NULL
by	NULL
utter	NULL
blankness	NULL
:	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
.	NULL

Panic	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
putting	NULL
aside	NULL
his	NULL
pride	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wrote	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
of	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
,	NULL
placing	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
urgently	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
explain	NULL
himself	NULL
properly	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
realise	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
desperate	NULL
straits	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
change	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
;	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
twenty-five	NULL
and	NULL
really	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
earning	NULL
his	NULL
living	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
died	NULL
Philip	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
till	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
penny	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
the	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
had	NULL
disapproved	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
courses	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
saw	NULL
himself	NULL
justified	NULL
.	NULL

XCIX	NULL
Philip	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
pawn	NULL
his	NULL
clothes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
reduced	NULL
his	NULL
expenses	NULL
by	NULL
eating	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
meal	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
beside	NULL
his	NULL
breakfast	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
ate	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
and	NULL
cocoa	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
four	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
last	NULL
him	NULL
till	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
hungry	NULL
by	NULL
nine	NULL
o'clock	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
borrowing	NULL
money	NULL
from	NULL
Lawson	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
refusal	NULL
held	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
;	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
five	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

Lawson	NULL
lent	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
pleasure	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL

Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
Lawson	NULL
would	NULL
think	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
ashamed	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
days	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
back	NULL
untouched	NULL
.	NULL

Lawson	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
luncheon	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
eat	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
some	NULL
solid	NULL
food	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
Sunday	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
dinner	NULL
from	NULL
Athelny	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hesitated	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
Athelnys	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
comparatively	NULL
well-to-do	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
dread	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
think	NULL
less	NULL
well	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
penniless	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
not	NULL
having	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
among	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
lived	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
ashamed	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
disgraceful	NULL
disease	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
situation	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
range	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
experience	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
taken	NULL
aback	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
else	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
vague	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
would	NULL
turn	NULL
up	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
happening	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
how	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
term	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
thought	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
awake	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
himself	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
very	NULL
soon	NULL
he	NULL
foresaw	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
money	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
set	NULL
about	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
earn	NULL
something	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
qualified	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
club-foot	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Cape	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
demand	NULL
for	NULL
medical	NULL
men	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
great	NULL
.	NULL

Except	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
deformity	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
enlisted	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
yeomanry	NULL
regiments	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
constantly	NULL
being	NULL
sent	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
secretary	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Medical	NULL
School	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
coaching	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
backward	NULL
student	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
secretary	NULL
held	NULL
out	NULL
no	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
him	NULL
anything	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
advertisement	NULL
columns	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
medical	NULL
papers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
applied	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
post	NULL
of	NULL
unqualified	NULL
assistant	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
dispensary	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Fulham	NULL
Road	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
glance	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
club-foot	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
hearing	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
fourth	NULL
year	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
experience	NULL
was	NULL
insufficient	NULL
:	NULL
Philip	NULL
understood	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
an	NULL
excuse	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
assistant	NULL
who	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
active	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
turned	NULL
his	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
other	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
earning	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
French	NULL
and	NULL
German	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
some	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
finding	NULL
a	NULL
job	NULL
as	NULL
correspondence	NULL
clerk	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
sink	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
set	NULL
his	NULL
teeth	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
else	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
too	NULL
shy	NULL
to	NULL
answer	NULL
the	NULL
advertisements	NULL
which	NULL
demanded	NULL
a	NULL
personal	NULL
application	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
replied	NULL
to	NULL
those	NULL
which	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
letters	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
experience	NULL
to	NULL
state	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
recommendations	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
neither	NULL
his	NULL
German	NULL
nor	NULL
his	NULL
French	NULL
was	NULL
commercial	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ignorant	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
terms	NULL
used	NULL
in	NULL
business	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
neither	NULL
shorthand	NULL
nor	NULL
typewriting	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
recognising	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
case	NULL
was	NULL
hopeless	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
writing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
solicitor	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
executor	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bring	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
contrary	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
express	NULL
advice	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sold	NULL
the	NULL
mortgages	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
invested	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Nixon	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
disapproved	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
gathered	NULL
from	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
year	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
accountant	NULL
's	NULL
office	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
idle	NULL
and	NULL
incompetent	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
sooner	NULL
starve	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Philip	NULL
muttered	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
suicide	NULL
presented	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
something	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
dispensary	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
comfort	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
painless	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
course	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
considered	NULL
seriously	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Mildred	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
his	NULL
anguish	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
great	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Casualty	NULL
Sister	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
how	NULL
people	NULL
oftener	NULL
did	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
themselves	NULL
for	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
than	NULL
for	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
chuckled	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
exception	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
talk	NULL
his	NULL
worries	NULL
over	NULL
with	NULL
somebody	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bring	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
confess	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
ashamed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
looking	NULL
for	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
left	NULL
his	NULL
rent	NULL
unpaid	NULL
for	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
,	NULL
explaining	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
landlady	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
get	NULL
money	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
month	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
pursed	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
grim	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
month	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
convenient	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
something	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
very	NULL
sick	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
settle	NULL
his	NULL
bill	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
Saturday	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'	NULL
ope	NULL
you	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
afford	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
accounts	NULL
run	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
with	NULL
anger	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
determination	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
frightening	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
paused	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
'll	NULL
be	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
and	NULL
glanced	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
bare	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
emphasis	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
natural	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL

the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
welcome	NULL

bit	NULL
of	NULL
dinner	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
redden	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
soles	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
sob	NULL
caught	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
throat	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Thank	NULL
you	NULL

much	NULL

"	NULL
Very	NULL

"	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
Philip	NULL
threw	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
clench	NULL
his	NULL
fists	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
crying	NULL
.	NULL

C	NULL
Saturday	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
his	NULL
landlady	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
expecting	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
no	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
driven	NULL
to	NULL
extremities	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
dazed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
preposterous	NULL
joke	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
coppers	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sold	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
clothes	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
without	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
books	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
odds	NULL
and	NULL
ends	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
shilling	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
landlady	NULL
was	NULL
keeping	NULL
an	NULL
eye	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
comings	NULL
and	NULL
goings	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
stop	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
anything	NULL
more	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
pay	NULL
his	NULL
bill	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
courage	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
June	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
night	NULL
was	NULL
fine	NULL
and	NULL
warm	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
slowly	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
Chelsea	NULL
Embankment	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
was	NULL
restful	NULL
and	NULL
quiet	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
bench	NULL
and	NULL
dozed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
long	NULL
he	NULL
slept	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
awoke	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
start	NULL
,	NULL
dreaming	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
shaken	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
policeman	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
on	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
opened	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
Chiswick	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
slept	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
the	NULL
hardness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bench	NULL
roused	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
night	NULL
seemed	NULL
very	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
shivered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
seized	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
misery	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
on	NULL
earth	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ashamed	NULL
at	NULL
having	NULL
slept	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Embankment	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
peculiarly	NULL
humiliating	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
cheeks	NULL
flush	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
stories	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
officers	NULL
,	NULL
clergymen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
universities	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
become	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
line	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
soup	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
charitable	NULL
institution	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
much	NULL

commit	NULL
suicide	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
:	NULL
Lawson	NULL
would	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
straits	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
absurd	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
his	NULL
pride	NULL
prevent	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
asking	NULL
for	NULL
assistance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
cropper	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
best	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
everything	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
wrong	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
helped	NULL
people	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
selfish	NULL
than	NULL
anyone	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
horribly	NULL
unjust	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
reduced	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
pass	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
thinking	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
light	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
was	NULL
beautiful	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
mysterious	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
fine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
,	NULL
pale	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dawn	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
cloudless	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
very	NULL
tired	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hunger	NULL
was	NULL
gnawing	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
entrails	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
sit	NULL
still	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
constantly	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
policeman	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
dreaded	NULL
the	NULL
mortification	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
dirty	NULL
and	NULL
wished	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
wash	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
Hampton	NULL
Court	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
cry	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
chose	NULL
a	NULL
cheap	NULL
eating-house	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
smell	NULL
of	NULL
hot	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
slightly	NULL
sick	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
something	NULL
nourishing	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
stomach	NULL
revolted	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
food	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
tea	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Sunday	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Athelnys	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
roast	NULL
beef	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Yorkshire	NULL
pudding	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
eat	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
fearfully	NULL
tired	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
face	NULL
the	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
noisy	NULL
family	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
feeling	NULL
morose	NULL
and	NULL
wretched	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
left	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
gardens	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
palace	NULL
and	NULL
lie	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
bones	NULL
ached	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
pump	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
wash	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
drink	NULL
something	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
thirsty	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
hungry	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
with	NULL
pleasure	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
flowers	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
lawns	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
leafy	NULL
trees	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
out	NULL
better	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
lay	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shade	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lit	NULL
his	NULL
pipe	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
economy	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
confined	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
two	NULL
pipes	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thankful	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
pouch	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
people	NULL
did	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
he	NULL
fell	NULL
asleep	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
awoke	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
mid-day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
soon	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
setting	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
London	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
morning	NULL
and	NULL
answer	NULL
any	NULL
advertisements	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
promise	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
leave	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
death	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
;	NULL
Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
raise	NULL
money	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
reversion	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
consent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
give	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
hang	NULL
on	NULL
somehow	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
dies	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
reckoned	NULL
his	NULL
age	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Vicar	NULL
of	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
over	NULL
seventy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
chronic	NULL
bronchitis	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
many	NULL
old	NULL
men	NULL
had	NULL
that	NULL
and	NULL
lived	NULL
on	NULL
indefinitely	NULL
.	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
something	NULL
must	NULL
turn	NULL
up	NULL
;	NULL
Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
was	NULL
altogether	NULL
abnormal	NULL
;	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
particular	NULL
station	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
starve	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bring	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
reality	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
experience	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
give	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
utter	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
borrow	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
sovereign	NULL
from	NULL
Lawson	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stayed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
smoked	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
very	NULL
hungry	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
anything	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
setting	NULL
out	NULL
again	NULL
for	NULL
London	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
way	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
keep	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
strength	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
started	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
cooler	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
slept	NULL
on	NULL
benches	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
disturbed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
wash	NULL
and	NULL
brush	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
shave	NULL
at	NULL
Victoria	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
tea	NULL
and	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
eating	NULL
this	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
advertisement	NULL
columns	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
paper	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
them	NULL
his	NULL
eye	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
an	NULL
announcement	NULL
asking	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
salesman	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
furnishing	NULL
drapery	NULL
'	NULL
department	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
well-known	NULL
stores	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
little	NULL
sinking	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
middle-class	NULL
prejudices	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
dreadful	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
shop	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
shrugged	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
what	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
matter	NULL
?	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
shot	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
by	NULL
accepting	NULL
every	NULL
humiliation	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
it	NULL
even	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
forcing	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
of	NULL
fate	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
presented	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
horribly	NULL
shy	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
department	NULL
at	NULL
nine	NULL
o'clock	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
many	NULL
others	NULL
were	NULL
there	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
ages	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
boys	NULL
of	NULL
sixteen	NULL
to	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
forty	NULL
;	NULL
some	NULL
were	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
in	NULL
undertones	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
most	NULL
were	NULL
silent	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
place	NULL
those	NULL
around	NULL
him	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
hostility	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
heard	NULL
one	NULL
man	NULL
say	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
I	NULL
look	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
is	NULL
getting	NULL
my	NULL
refusal	NULL

enough	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
me	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
elsewhere	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
standing	NULL
next	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Had	NULL
any	NULL
experience	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
paused	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
remark	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Even	NULL
the	NULL
smaller	NULL
houses	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
without	NULL
appointment	NULL
after	NULL
lunch	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
assistants	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
were	NULL
draping	NULL
chintzes	NULL
and	NULL
cretonnes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
neighbour	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
were	NULL
preparing	NULL
country	NULL
orders	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
by	NULL
post	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
past	NULL
nine	NULL
the	NULL
buyer	NULL
arrived	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
heard	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
waiting	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
another	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Gibbons	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
middle-aged	NULL
,	NULL
short	NULL
and	NULL
corpulent	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
beard	NULL
and	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
greasy	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
brisk	NULL
movements	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
clever	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
silk	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
frock	NULL
coat	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
lapel	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
adorned	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
geranium	NULL
surrounded	NULL
by	NULL
leaves	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
office	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
open	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
small	NULL
and	NULL
contained	NULL
only	NULL
an	NULL
American	NULL
roll-desk	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
bookcase	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
cupboard	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
men	NULL
standing	NULL
outside	NULL
watched	NULL
him	NULL
mechanically	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
geranium	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
coat	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
ink-pot	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
rules	NULL
to	NULL
wear	NULL
flowers	NULL
in	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
the	NULL
department	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
governor	NULL
admired	NULL
the	NULL
flower	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL

"	NULL
they	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL

n't	NULL
grow	NULL
it	NULL
yourself	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
smiled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
gleam	NULL
of	NULL
pride	NULL
filled	NULL
his	NULL
intelligent	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
changed	NULL
his	NULL
coat	NULL
,	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
letters	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
waiting	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
sign	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
finger	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
queue	NULL
stepped	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
filed	NULL
past	NULL
him	NULL
one	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
and	NULL
answered	NULL
his	NULL
questions	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
them	NULL
very	NULL
briefly	NULL
,	NULL
keeping	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
fixed	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
applicant	NULL
's	NULL

"	NULL
Age	NULL

Why	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL
leave	NULL
your	NULL

He	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
replies	NULL
without	NULL
expression	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
turn	NULL
he	NULL
fancied	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Gibbons	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
curiously	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
clothes	NULL
were	NULL
neat	NULL
and	NULL
tolerably	NULL
cut	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
walked	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
ordeal	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
less	NULL
painful	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
expected	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
no	NULL
particular	NULL
disappointment	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
hope	NULL
to	NULL
succeed	NULL
in	NULL
getting	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL

he	NULL
tried	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
kept	NULL
the	NULL
newspaper	NULL

now	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
advertisements	NULL
again	NULL
:	NULL
a	NULL
shop	NULL
in	NULL
Holborn	NULL
needed	NULL
a	NULL
salesman	NULL
too	NULL

he	NULL
went	NULL
there	NULL

but	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
arrived	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
someone	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
been	NULL
engaged	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
anything	NULL

eat	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL

go	NULL

Lawson	NULL

out	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
incredible	NULL
the	NULL
difficulty	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
in	NULL
asking	NULL

money	NULL

he	NULL

the	NULL

almost	NULL
they	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
baths	NULL
in	NULL
Westminster	NULL
and	NULL
spent	NULL
sixpence	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
bath	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
himself	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
anyone	NULL
should	NULL
ask	NULL
him	NULL
questions	NULL

and	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
there	NULL
now	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
wonder	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
departments	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
worked	NULL
in	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
think	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
chose	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
matter	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
student	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
dropped	NULL
out	NULL
without	NULL
warning	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
free	NULL
library	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
papers	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
wearied	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
out	NULL
Stevenson	NULL
's	NULL
New	NULL
Arabian	NULL
Nights	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
read	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
meant	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
brood	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
helplessness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
kept	NULL
on	NULL
thinking	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
things	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fixity	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
ache	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
craving	NULL
for	NULL
fresh	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
Green	NULL
Park	NULL
and	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
miserably	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
deformity	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
and	NULL
dreamt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
suddenly	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
foot	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Cape	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
regiment	NULL
of	NULL
Yeomanry	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
pictures	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
illustrated	NULL
papers	NULL
gave	NULL
materials	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
fancy	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Veldt	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
khaki	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
with	NULL
other	NULL
men	NULL
round	NULL
a	NULL
fire	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
awoke	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
quite	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
Big	NULL
Ben	NULL
strike	NULL
seven	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
twelve	NULL
hours	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
through	NULL
with	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
dreaded	NULL
the	NULL
interminable	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sky	NULL
was	NULL
overcast	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
feared	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
rain	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
lodging-house	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
bed	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
them	NULL
advertised	NULL
on	NULL
lamps	NULL
outside	NULL
houses	NULL
in	NULL
Lambeth	NULL
:	NULL
Good	NULL
Beds	NULL
sixpence	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
inside	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dreaded	NULL
the	NULL
foul	NULL
smell	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
vermin	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
air	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
possibly	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
park	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
closed	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
tired	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
thought	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
an	NULL
accident	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
luck	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
hospital	NULL
and	NULL
lie	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
clean	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
weeks	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
midnight	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
hungry	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
without	NULL
food	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
coffee	NULL
stall	NULL
at	NULL
Hyde	NULL
Park	NULL
Corner	NULL
and	NULL
ate	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
potatoes	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
coffee	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
too	NULL
restless	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
horrible	NULL
dread	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
moved	NULL
on	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
police	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
noted	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
constable	NULL
from	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
angle	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
night	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
benches	NULL
in	NULL
Piccadilly	NULL
and	NULL
towards	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
strolled	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
The	NULL
Embankment	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
striking	NULL
of	NULL
Big	NULL
Ben	NULL
,	NULL
marking	NULL
every	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
reckoned	NULL
out	NULL
how	NULL
long	NULL
it	NULL
left	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
woke	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
spent	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
coppers	NULL
on	NULL
making	NULL
himself	NULL
neat	NULL
and	NULL
clean	NULL
,	NULL
bought	NULL
a	NULL
paper	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
advertisements	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
set	NULL
out	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
search	NULL
for	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
for	NULL
several	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
food	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
weak	NULL
and	NULL
ill	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
hardly	NULL
enough	NULL
energy	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
looking	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
desperately	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
growing	NULL
used	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
waiting	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
shop	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
chance	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
curt	NULL
dismissal	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
parts	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
in	NULL
answer	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
advertisements	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
by	NULL
sight	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
applied	NULL
as	NULL
fruitlessly	NULL
as	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
friends	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
tired	NULL
and	NULL
too	NULL
wretched	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
their	NULL
advances	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
Lawson	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
owed	NULL
him	NULL
five	NULL
shillings	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
too	NULL
dazed	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
clearly	NULL
and	NULL
ceased	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
care	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
cried	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
and	NULL
ashamed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
relieved	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
somehow	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
less	NULL
hungry	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
early	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
suffered	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
from	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
night	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
his	NULL
linen	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
slipped	NULL
in	NULL
about	NULL
three	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
sure	NULL
everyone	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
asleep	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
again	NULL
at	NULL
five	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
lay	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
softness	NULL
was	NULL
enchanting	NULL
;	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
bones	NULL
ached	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
lay	NULL
he	NULL
revelled	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pleasure	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
delicious	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
growing	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
food	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
very	NULL
hungry	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
weak	NULL
.	NULL

Constantly	NULL
now	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
strength	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
dwell	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
the	NULL
temptation	NULL
would	NULL
get	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
kept	NULL
on	NULL
saying	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
absurd	NULL
to	NULL
commit	NULL
suicide	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
something	NULL
must	NULL
happen	NULL
soon	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
situation	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
preposterous	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
quite	NULL
seriously	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
illness	NULL
which	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
endured	NULL
but	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
recover	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
night	NULL
he	NULL
swore	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
would	NULL
induce	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
another	NULL
and	NULL
determined	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Nixon	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
solicitor	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
Lawson	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
came	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bring	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
humiliating	NULL
confession	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
utter	NULL
failure	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
Lawson	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
their	NULL
friendship	NULL
Lawson	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
scatter-brained	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
prided	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
common	NULL
sense	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
history	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
folly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
uneasy	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
Lawson	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
helping	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
turn	NULL
the	NULL
cold	NULL
shoulder	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
uncle	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
solicitor	NULL
would	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
do	NULL
something	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
dreaded	NULL
their	NULL
reproaches	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
anyone	NULL
to	NULL
reproach	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
clenched	NULL
his	NULL
teeth	NULL
and	NULL
repeated	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
was	NULL
inevitable	NULL
just	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL

Regret	NULL
was	NULL
absurd	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
days	NULL
were	NULL
unending	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
five	NULL
shillings	NULL
Lawson	NULL
had	NULL
lent	NULL
him	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
last	NULL
much	NULL
longer	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
longed	NULL
for	NULL
Sunday	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Athelny	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
prevented	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
going	NULL
there	NULL
sooner	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
perhaps	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
so	NULL
badly	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
through	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
Athelny	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
straits	NULL
as	NULL
desperate	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
person	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
after	NULL
dinner	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
bring	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
Athelny	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
difficulties	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
repeated	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
again	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
afraid	NULL
that	NULL
Athelny	NULL
would	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
off	NULL
with	NULL
airy	NULL
phrases	NULL
:	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
horrible	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
delay	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
the	NULL
putting	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
test	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
all	NULL
confidence	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
fellows	NULL
.	NULL

Saturday	NULL
night	NULL
was	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
raw	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
suffered	NULL
horribly	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
midday	NULL
on	NULL
Saturday	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
dragged	NULL
himself	NULL
wearily	NULL
to	NULL
Athelny	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
he	NULL
ate	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spent	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
twopence	NULL
on	NULL
Sunday	NULL
morning	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
wash	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
brush	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lavatory	NULL
at	NULL
Charing	NULL
Cross	NULL
.	NULL

CI	NULL
When	NULL
Philip	NULL
rang	NULL
a	NULL
head	NULL
was	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
noisy	NULL
clatter	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
ran	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
anxious	NULL
,	NULL
thin	NULL
face	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
bent	NULL
down	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
moved	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
exuberant	NULL
affection	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
himself	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
recover	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
excuses	NULL
to	NULL
linger	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
hysterical	NULL
state	NULL
and	NULL
almost	NULL
anything	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
cry	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
previous	NULL
Sunday	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
them	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
ill	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
amuse	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
suggested	NULL
a	NULL
mysterious	NULL
ailment	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
double-barrelled	NULL
and	NULL
barbarous	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
mixture	NULL
of	NULL
Greek	NULL
and	NULL
Latin	NULL
(	NULL
medical	NULL
nomenclature	NULL
bristled	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
them	NULL
shriek	NULL
with	NULL
delight	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
dragged	NULL
Philip	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
parlour	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
repeat	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
edification	NULL
.	NULL

Athelny	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
bulging	NULL
eyes	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
stare	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
occasion	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
self-conscious	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
missed	NULL
you	NULL
last	NULL
Sunday	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
tell	NULL
lies	NULL
without	NULL
embarrassment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
scarlet	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
finished	NULL
his	NULL
explanation	NULL
for	NULL
not	NULL
coming	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
entered	NULL
and	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
hope	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
anything	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
door	NULL
was	NULL
closed	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Dinner	NULL

n't	NULL
be	NULL
ready	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL
slow	NULL

"	NULL
Wo	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
concern	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
Philip	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
forced	NULL
a	NULL
laugh	NULL
and	NULL
answered	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
hungry	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
chaff	NULL
her	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL

Philip	NULL

"	NULL
Nothing	NULL

she	NULL

As	NULL

he	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ravenous	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
stomach	NULL
turned	NULL
against	NULL
food	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
eat	NULL
hardly	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
brain	NULL
was	NULL
weary	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
notice	NULL
that	NULL
Athelny	NULL
,	NULL
contrary	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
habit	NULL
,	NULL
spoke	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
relieved	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
comfortable	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
every	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
prevent	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
glancing	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
day	NULL
was	NULL
tempestuous	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fine	NULL
weather	NULL
had	NULL
broken	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bitter	NULL
wind	NULL
;	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
gusts	NULL
of	NULL
rain	NULL
drove	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Athelnys	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
early	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
stay	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
after	NULL
ten	NULL
o'clock	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
sank	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bleak	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
more	NULL
terrible	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
than	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
outside	NULL
and	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
kept	NULL
on	NULL
saying	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
plenty	NULL
more	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
spending	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
doors	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
strove	NULL
to	NULL
distract	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
by	NULL
talking	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
a	NULL
spatter	NULL
of	NULL
rain	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
start	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
like	NULL
March	NULL
weather	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Athelny	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

sort	NULL

"	NULL

Presently	NULL
they	NULL
finished	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Sally	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
cleared	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Would	NULL
you	NULL

twopenny	NULL

said	NULL
Athelny	NULL
,	NULL
handing	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
cigar	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
inhaled	NULL
the	NULL
smoke	NULL
with	NULL
delight	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
soothed	NULL
him	NULL
extraordinarily	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Sally	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
Athelny	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
shut	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
we	NULL
sha	NULL
n't	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL

turning	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
startled	NULL
look	NULL

but	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
take	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

Athelny	NULL

fixing	NULL

him	NULL

went	NULL

Philip	NULL
turned	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
beat	NULL
violently	NULL
.	NULL

Athelny	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
seemed	NULL
intolerable	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL

word	NULL

It	NULL
made	NULL
Philip	NULL
sick	NULL

stared	NULL
out	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL

was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
very	NULL
weak	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
shut	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
frowned	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
control	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
flash	NULL
of	NULL
anger	NULL
with	NULL
Athelny	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
broken	NULL

presently	NULL

his	NULL
eyes	NULL
still	NULL
closed	NULL

slowly	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL

keep	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
steady	NULL

he	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL

adventures	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
behaved	NULL
inanely	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
still	NULL
harder	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL

felt	NULL
that	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

their	NULL

Philip	NULL

touched	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
expected	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
it	NULL
surprised	NULL
and	NULL
moved	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
prevent	NULL
two	NULL
large	NULL
tears	NULL
from	NULL
rolling	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Athelnys	NULL
discussed	NULL
the	NULL
arrangements	NULL

pretended	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
notice	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL

weakness	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
left	NULL
them	NULL
Philip	NULL
leaned	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looking	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
laughed	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
not	NULL

"	NULL

CII	NULL
Athelny	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
easily	NULL
get	NULL
him	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
firm	NULL
of	NULL
linendrapers	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
himself	NULL
worked	NULL
.	NULL

Several	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
assistants	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Lynn	NULL
and	NULL
Sedley	NULL
with	NULL
patriotic	NULL
zeal	NULL
had	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
their	NULL
places	NULL
open	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
heroes	NULL
on	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
remained	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
since	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
increase	NULL
the	NULL
wages	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
were	NULL
able	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
to	NULL
exhibit	NULL
public	NULL
spirit	NULL
and	NULL
effect	NULL
an	NULL
economy	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
continued	NULL
and	NULL
trade	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
depressed	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
holidays	NULL
were	NULL
coming	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
numbers	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
staff	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
engage	NULL
more	NULL
assistants	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
experience	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
doubtful	NULL
whether	NULL
even	NULL
then	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
engage	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Athelny	NULL
,	NULL
representing	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
of	NULL
consequence	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
firm	NULL
,	NULL
insisted	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
manager	NULL
could	NULL
refuse	NULL
him	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
training	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
useful	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
waiting	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
well-paid	NULL
job	NULL
to	NULL
design	NULL
costumes	NULL
and	NULL
draw	NULL
posters	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
poster	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
sale	NULL
and	NULL
Athelny	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL
he	NULL
brought	NULL
it	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
manager	NULL
admired	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
and	NULL
regretted	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
vacancy	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
department	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
asked	NULL
whether	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
else	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
afraid	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL
quite	NULL
sure	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
is	NULL
they	NULL
're	NULL
advertising	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Athelny	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
doubtfully	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
glasses	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
D'you	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
stand	NULL
any	NULL
chance	NULL

getting	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL

Athelny	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
confused	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
led	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
expect	NULL
something	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
splendid	NULL
;	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
poor	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
providing	NULL
him	NULL
indefinitely	NULL
with	NULL
board	NULL
and	NULL
lodging	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
might	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
while	NULL
you	NULL
wait	NULL
for	NULL
something	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
always	NULL
stand	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
chance	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
engaged	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
firm	NULL
already	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
proud	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
smiled	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
decide	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
there	NULL

Notwithstanding	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
much	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
finding	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
many	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
waiting	NULL
already	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
recognised	NULL
some	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
searching	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
noticed	NULL
lying	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
park	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
Philip	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
homeless	NULL
as	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
doors	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
,	NULL
old	NULL
and	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
tall	NULL
and	NULL
short	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
himself	NULL
smart	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
interview	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
manager	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
carefully	NULL
brushed	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
scrupulously	NULL
clean	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
waited	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
passage	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
learnt	NULL
afterwards	NULL
led	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dining-hall	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
rooms	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
broken	NULL
every	NULL
few	NULL
yards	NULL
by	NULL
five	NULL
or	NULL
six	NULL
steps	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
electric	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
gas	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
wire	NULL
cages	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
protection	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
flared	NULL
noisily	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
arrived	NULL
punctually	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
ten	NULL
o'clock	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
admitted	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
three-cornered	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
cut	NULL
of	NULL
cheese	NULL
lying	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL
side	NULL
:	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL
were	NULL
pictures	NULL
of	NULL
women	NULL
in	NULL
corsets	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
poster-proofs	NULL

one	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL

in	NULL
pyjamas	NULL

green	NULL

white	NULL
in	NULL
large	NULL
stripes	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
a	NULL

in	NULL
full	NULL

ploughing	NULL
an	NULL
azure	NULL

the	NULL

The	NULL
widest	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

was	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

was	NULL
being	NULL
dressed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL

an	NULL
assistant	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
fro	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
interview	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
manager	NULL
was	NULL
reading	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
florid	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
sandy	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
sandy	NULL
moustache	NULL
;	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
watch-chain	NULL
hung	NULL
a	NULL
bunch	NULL
of	NULL
football	NULL
medals	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
shirt	NULL
sleeves	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
desk	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
telephone	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL

before	NULL
him	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL

and	NULL
cuttings	NULL

pasted	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL

He	NULL
gave	NULL
Philip	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
but	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
dictated	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
typist	NULL

a	NULL
girl	NULL
who	NULL
sat	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
table	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
corner	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
experience	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
cockney	NULL
twang	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
high	NULL
,	NULL
metallic	NULL
voice	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
not	NULL
able	NULL
always	NULL
to	NULL
control	NULL
;	NULL
Philip	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
upper	NULL
teeth	NULL
were	NULL
large	NULL
and	NULL
protruding	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
gave	NULL
you	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
loose	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
sharp	NULL
tug	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
Philip	NULL
up	NULL

down	NULL

seemed	NULL

notice	NULL

could	NULL

engage	NULL
him	NULL

his	NULL

which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
proud	NULL
,	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
French	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Any	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
stationed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
costumes	NULL
.	NULL
'	NULL

His	NULL
work	NULL
consisted	NULL
in	NULL
directing	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
departments	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Sampson	NULL
tripped	NULL
them	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
tongue	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
he	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
limped	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

it	NULL

The	NULL
buyer	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
doubtfully	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
surmised	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
wondering	NULL
why	NULL
the	NULL
manager	NULL
had	NULL
engaged	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
noticed	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
anything	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Sampson	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
where	NULL
this	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
department	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
watched	NULL
anxiously	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
customer	NULL
in	NULL
search	NULL
of	NULL
information	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
one	NULL
o'clock	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dining-room	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
floor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vast	NULL
building	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
large	NULL
,	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
well	NULL
lit	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
were	NULL
shut	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
dust	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
horrid	NULL
smell	NULL
of	NULL
cooking	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
long	NULL
tables	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
cloths	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
big	NULL
glass	NULL
bottles	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
at	NULL
intervals	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
salt	NULL
cellars	NULL
and	NULL
bottles	NULL
of	NULL
vinegar	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
assistants	NULL
crowded	NULL
in	NULL
noisily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
forms	NULL
still	NULL
warm	NULL
from	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
dined	NULL
at	NULL
twelve-thirty	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
pickles	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
remarked	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
next	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
thin	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
hooked	NULL
nose	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
pasty	NULL
face	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
unevenly	NULL
shaped	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
skull	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
pushed	NULL
in	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
oddly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
forehead	NULL
and	NULL
neck	NULL
were	NULL
large	NULL
acne	NULL
spots	NULL
red	NULL
and	NULL
inflamed	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
Harris	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
on	NULL
some	NULL
days	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
large	NULL
soup-plates	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
mixed	NULL
pickles	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
popular	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
knives	NULL
and	NULL
forks	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
fat	NULL
boy	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
coat	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
handfuls	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
threw	NULL
them	NULL
loudly	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

Each	NULL
man	NULL
took	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
warm	NULL
and	NULL
greasy	NULL
from	NULL
recent	NULL
washing	NULL
in	NULL
dirty	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

Plates	NULL
of	NULL
meat	NULL
swimming	NULL
in	NULL
gravy	NULL
were	NULL
handed	NULL
round	NULL
by	NULL
boys	NULL
in	NULL
white	NULL
jackets	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
flung	NULL
each	NULL
plate	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
quick	NULL
gesture	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
prestidigitator	NULL
the	NULL
gravy	NULL
slopped	NULL
over	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
table-cloth	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
brought	NULL
large	NULL
dishes	NULL
of	NULL
cabbages	NULL
and	NULL
potatoes	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
turned	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
stomach	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
everyone	NULL
poured	NULL
quantities	NULL
of	NULL
vinegar	NULL
over	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
noise	NULL
was	NULL
awful	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
talked	NULL
and	NULL
laughed	NULL
and	NULL
shouted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
clatter	NULL
of	NULL
knives	NULL
and	NULL
forks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
strange	NULL
sounds	NULL
of	NULL
eating	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
department	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
where	NULL
each	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
less	NULL
often	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
assistants	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
somebody	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
First	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

Second	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
madam	NULL

"	NULL

One	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
when	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
slack	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
taking	NULL
his	NULL
measure	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
five	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sent	NULL
up	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
for	NULL
tea	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
large	NULL
slices	NULL
of	NULL
bread	NULL
heavily	NULL
spread	NULL
with	NULL
butter	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
many	NULL
had	NULL
pots	NULL
of	NULL
jam	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
kept	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
store	NULL
'	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
their	NULL
names	NULL
written	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
exhausted	NULL
when	NULL
work	NULL
stopped	NULL
at	NULL
half	NULL
past	NULL
six	NULL
.	NULL

Harris	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sat	NULL
next	NULL
to	NULL
at	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
offered	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
him	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
Harrington	NULL
Street	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
him	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
spare	NULL
bed	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
rooms	NULL
were	NULL
full	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
expected	NULL
Philip	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
put	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
Harrington	NULL
Street	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
bootmaker	NULL
's	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
was	NULL
used	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
bed-room	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
boarded	NULL
three	NULL
parts	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
open	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
ventilation	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
skylight	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
far	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
musty	NULL
smell	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
thankful	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

Harris	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
floor	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
piano	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
keyboard	NULL
that	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
row	NULL
of	NULL
decayed	NULL
teeth	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cigar-box	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
lid	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
set	NULL
of	NULL
dominoes	NULL
;	NULL
old	NULL
numbers	NULL
of	NULL
The	NULL
Strand	NULL
Magazine	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
The	NULL
Graphic	NULL
were	NULL
lying	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
other	NULL
rooms	NULL
were	NULL
used	NULL
as	NULL
bed-rooms	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
six	NULL
beds	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
trunk	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
box	NULL
stood	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
furniture	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
chest	NULL
of	NULL
drawers	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
four	NULL
large	NULL
drawers	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
small	NULL
ones	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
new-comer	NULL
had	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
keys	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
alike	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
much	NULL
use	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Harris	NULL
advised	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
his	NULL
valuables	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
trunk	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
looking-glass	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
chimney-piece	NULL
.	NULL

Harris	NULL
showed	NULL
Philip	NULL
the	NULL
lavatory	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fairly	NULL
large	NULL
room	NULL
with	NULL
eight	NULL
basins	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
row	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
inmates	NULL
did	NULL
their	NULL
washing	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
led	NULL
into	NULL
another	NULL
room	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
baths	NULL
,	NULL
discoloured	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
woodwork	NULL
stained	NULL
with	NULL
soap	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
dark	NULL
rings	NULL
at	NULL
various	NULL
intervals	NULL
which	NULL
indicated	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
marks	NULL
of	NULL
different	NULL
baths	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Harris	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
bed-room	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
man	NULL
changing	NULL
his	NULL
clothes	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
of	NULL
sixteen	NULL
whistling	NULL
as	NULL
loud	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
brushed	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
without	NULL
saying	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
to	NULL
anybody	NULL
the	NULL
tall	NULL
man	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Harris	NULL
winked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
whistling	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
winked	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

Harris	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
Prior	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
army	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
served	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
silks	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
pretty	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
off	NULL
every	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
good-evening	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

Harris	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
remained	NULL
to	NULL
watch	NULL
Philip	NULL
curiously	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
unpacked	NULL
his	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
Bell	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
serving	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
haberdashery	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
evening	NULL
clothes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
every	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
question	NULL
about	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
cheerful	NULL
youth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
intervals	NULL
of	NULL
conversation	NULL
sang	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
half-broken	NULL
voice	NULL
snatches	NULL
of	NULL
music-hall	NULL
songs	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
crowd	NULL
;	NULL
occasionally	NULL
he	NULL
stopped	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
doors	NULL
of	NULL
restaurants	NULL
and	NULL
watched	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
going	NULL
in	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
hungry	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
bought	NULL
a	NULL
bath	NULL
bun	NULL
and	NULL
ate	NULL
it	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
strolled	NULL
along	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
given	NULL
a	NULL
latch-key	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
prefect	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
gas	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
past	NULL
eleven	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
locked	NULL
out	NULL
he	NULL
returned	NULL
in	NULL
good	NULL
time	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
already	NULL
the	NULL
system	NULL
of	NULL
fines	NULL
:	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
a	NULL
shilling	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
after	NULL
eleven	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
crown	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
past	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
reported	NULL
besides	NULL
:	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
dismissed	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
soldier	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
arrived	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
were	NULL
already	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
greeted	NULL
with	NULL
cries	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
Clarence	NULL
!	NULL

Naughty	NULL
boy	NULL

He	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
Bell	NULL
had	NULL
dressed	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
bolster	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
evening	NULL
clothes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
was	NULL
delighted	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
joke	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

them	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL

stopped	NULL

The	NULL
soldier	NULL
rolled	NULL
in	NULL
;	NULL
silently	NULL
,	NULL
rapidly	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
clothes	NULL
and	NULL
threw	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
bed	NULL

At	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
past	NULL
eleven	NULL
the	NULL
gas	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
big	NULL
jump	NULL
and	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
later	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL

The	NULL
soldier	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
crowded	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL

passed	NULL

The	NULL
house	NULL
opposite	NULL
,	NULL
six	NULL
storeys	NULL
high	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL
workshop	NULL
for	NULL
Jewish	NULL
tailors	NULL
who	NULL
left	NULL
off	NULL
work	NULL
at	NULL
eleven	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL
were	NULL
brightly	NULL

there	NULL
were	NULL

The	NULL

,	NULL
two	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL

went	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
lights	NULL
when	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL

and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
she	NULL
allowed	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
love	NULL
to	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tailors	NULL

The	NULL
shop	NULL
assistants	NULL
in	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
amusement	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
manoeuvres	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
man	NULL
or	NULL
another	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
behind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
made	NULL
small	NULL
bets	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
succeed	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
midnight	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Harrington	NULL
Arms	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
after	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
:	NULL
Bell	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
slept	NULL
nearest	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
by	NULL
jumping	NULL
from	NULL
bed	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
stop	NULL
talking	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
everything	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
steady	NULL
snoring	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
soldier	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
awaked	NULL
at	NULL
seven	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
loud	NULL
ringing	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bell	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
to	NULL
eight	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
dressed	NULL
and	NULL
hurrying	NULL
downstairs	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
stockinged	NULL
feet	NULL
to	NULL
pick	NULL
out	NULL
their	NULL
boots	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
laced	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
ran	NULL
along	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
in	NULL
Oxford	NULL
Street	NULL
for	NULL
breakfast	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
later	NULL
than	NULL
eight	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
none	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
,	NULL
once	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
they	NULL
allowed	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
themselves	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
building	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
stopped	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
shop	NULL
near	NULL
their	NULL
quarters	NULL
and	NULL
bought	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
buns	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
cost	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
went	NULL
without	NULL
food	NULL
till	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
ate	NULL
some	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
,	NULL
drank	NULL
a	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
half	NULL
past	NULL
eight	NULL
began	NULL
his	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
First	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

Second	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
madam	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Soon	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
answer	NULL
the	NULL
questions	NULL
quite	NULL
mechanically	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
monotonous	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
tiring	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
hurt	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
stand	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
thick	NULL
soft	NULL
carpets	NULL
made	NULL
them	NULL
burn	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
his	NULL
socks	NULL
were	NULL
painful	NULL
to	NULL
remove	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
common	NULL
complaint	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
fellow	NULL
'	NULL
floormen	NULL
'	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
socks	NULL
and	NULL
boots	NULL
just	NULL
rotted	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
continual	NULL
sweating	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
suffered	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
relieved	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
by	NULL
sleeping	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
feet	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
bed-clothes	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
walk	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
evenings	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
at	NULL
Harrington	NULL
Street	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
pail	NULL
of	NULL
cold	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
companion	NULL
on	NULL
these	NULL
occasions	NULL
was	NULL
Bell	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
lad	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
haberdashery	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
stayed	NULL
in	NULL
often	NULL
to	NULL
arrange	NULL
the	NULL
stamps	NULL
he	NULL
collected	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
fastened	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
little	NULL
pieces	NULL
of	NULL
stamp-paper	NULL
he	NULL
whistled	NULL
monotonously	NULL
.	NULL

CIV	NULL
The	NULL
social	NULL
evenings	NULL
took	NULL
place	NULL
on	NULL
alternate	NULL
Mondays	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

Philip	NULL

He	NULL
arranged	NULL
to	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL

called	NULL
him	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

he	NULL
treated	NULL
her	NULL
simply	NULL

so	NULL
she	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL

preferred	NULL

they	NULL

the	NULL
pin	NULL

the	NULL
girls	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

One	NULL
addressed	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
Phil	NULL

he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL

idea	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL

Needing	NULL

a	NULL

After	NULL

In	NULL
due	NULL

one	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL
young	NULL

remarked	NULL

The	NULL

Miss	NULL
Bennett	NULL
liked	NULL
dancing	NULL
and	NULL
poetry	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
anything	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
danced	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
very	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
expression	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
her	NULL
thoughts	NULL
were	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
far	NULL
away	NULL

She	NULL
talked	NULL
breathlessly	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL

the	NULL
heat	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
supper	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Portman	NULL

the	NULL
best	NULL
floor	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
always	NULL

they	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
select	NULL

she	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
bear	NULL
dancing	NULL

men	NULL
you	NULL

n't	NULL

you	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
exposing	NULL
yourself	NULL

you	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
all	NULL

Nearly	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
danced	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
themselves	NULL

Sweat	NULL
poured	NULL
down	NULL
their	NULL
faces	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
high	NULL
collars	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
grew	NULL
limp	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
greater	NULL
depression	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
intolerably	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
to	NULL
seem	NULL
supercilious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
talked	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL

laughed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
unhappiness	NULL

Miss	NULL
Bennett	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

he	NULL
smiled	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
eleven	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
party	NULL
broke	NULL
up	NULL

Philip	NULL
could	NULL

sleep	NULL

Like	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
his	NULL
aching	NULL
feet	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
bed-clothes	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
might	NULL

think	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
leading	NULL

The	NULL
soldier	NULL
was	NULL

quietly	NULL

CV	NULL
The	NULL
wages	NULL
were	NULL
paid	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL

by	NULL
the	NULL
secretary	NULL

On	NULL
pay-day	NULL
each	NULL
batch	NULL
of	NULL
assistants	NULL
,	NULL
coming	NULL
down	NULL
from	NULL
tea	NULL

went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL

joined	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
people	NULL
waiting	NULL
orderly	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
audience	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL

One	NULL
by	NULL

they	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL

The	NULL
secretary	NULL
sat	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
desk	NULL
with	NULL
wooden	NULL
bowls	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
the	NULL
employe	NULL
's	NULL
name	NULL

he	NULL
referred	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
,	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
suspicious	NULL
glance	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
assistant	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL
aloud	NULL
the	NULL
sum	NULL
due	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
taking	NULL
money	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bowl	NULL
counted	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL

Next	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Thank	NULL

was	NULL
the	NULL
reply	NULL

The	NULL
assistant	NULL
passed	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
secretary	NULL
and	NULL
before	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
paid	NULL
him	NULL
four	NULL
shillings	NULL
for	NULL
washing	NULL
money	NULL

two	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL
club	NULL

any	NULL

With	NULL
what	NULL

left	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
department	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
waited	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

Most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
debt	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
sold	NULL
the	NULL
sandwiches	NULL
they	NULL
generally	NULL
ate	NULL
for	NULL
supper	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
funny	NULL
old	NULL
thing	NULL

very	NULL
fat	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
broad	NULL
,	NULL
red	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
black	NULL
hair	NULL
plastered	NULL
neatly	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
forehead	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fashion	NULL
shown	NULL
in	NULL
early	NULL
pictures	NULL
of	NULL
Queen	NULL
Victoria	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
always	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
black	NULL
bonnet	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
apron	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
sleeves	NULL
were	NULL
tucked	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
elbow	NULL

she	NULL
cut	NULL
the	NULL
sandwiches	NULL
with	NULL
large	NULL
,	NULL
dirty	NULL
,	NULL
greasy	NULL
hands	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
grease	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
bodice	NULL
,	NULL
grease	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
apron	NULL
,	NULL
grease	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
skirt	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Fletcher	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
everyone	NULL
addressed	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
'	NULL
Ma	NULL
'	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
assistants	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
boys	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
minded	NULL
giving	NULL
credit	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
month	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
known	NULL
that	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
lent	NULL
someone	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
shillings	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
straits	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
leaving	NULL
or	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
holidays	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
fat	NULL
red	NULL
cheek	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
dismissed	NULL
and	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
another	NULL
job	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
for	NULL
nothing	NULL
food	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
body	NULL
and	NULL
soul	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boys	NULL
were	NULL
sensible	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
large	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
repaid	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
genuine	NULL
affection	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
story	NULL
they	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
well	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
Bradford	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
five	NULL
shops	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
after	NULL
fifteen	NULL
years	NULL
and	NULL
visited	NULL
Ma	NULL
Fletcher	NULL
and	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
gold	NULL
watch	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
eighteen	NULL
shillings	NULL
left	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
month	NULL
's	NULL
pay	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
money	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
earned	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pride	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
merely	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
dismay	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
smallness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sum	NULL
emphasised	NULL
the	NULL
hopelessness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
fifteen	NULL
shillings	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
back	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
owed	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL

Athelny	NULL
kept	NULL

saying	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

about	NULL
Philip	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL

quietly	NULL

took	NULL
no	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
treated	NULL
Philip	NULL
with	NULL
motherly	NULL
kindness	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL

was	NULL
touched	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
anxiety	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL

meal	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
solace	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
(	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
monotony	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
chiefly	NULL
appalled	NULL
him	NULL
)	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
every	NULL
Sunday	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
friendly	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
joy	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
stately	NULL
Spanish	NULL
chairs	NULL
and	NULL
discuss	NULL
all	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
with	NULL
Athelny	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
his	NULL
condition	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
desperate	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Harrington	NULL
Street	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
exultation	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
forget	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
,	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
reading	NULL
his	NULL
medical	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
useless	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
fix	NULL
his	NULL
attention	NULL
on	NULL
them	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
exhausting	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
hopeless	NULL
to	NULL
continue	NULL
working	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
in	NULL
how	NULL
long	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
dreamed	NULL
constantly	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wards	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
awakening	NULL
was	NULL
painful	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sensation	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
sleeping	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
inexpressibly	NULL
irksome	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
solitude	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
with	NULL
others	NULL
always	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
by	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
these	NULL
moments	NULL
horrible	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
most	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
combat	NULL
his	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
himself	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
first	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
second	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
madam	NULL
,	NULL
indefinitely	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
thankful	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sent	NULL
away	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
coming	NULL
home	NULL
soon	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
firm	NULL
had	NULL
guaranteed	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
them	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
must	NULL
mean	NULL
that	NULL
others	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
sacked	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
stir	NULL
himself	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
the	NULL
wretched	NULL
post	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
free	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
finish	NULL
his	NULL
course	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
wish	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
might	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
reckoned	NULL
out	NULL
how	NULL
long	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
possibly	NULL
live	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
over	NULL
seventy	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
his	NULL
exact	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
seventy-five	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
suffered	NULL
from	NULL
chronic	NULL
bronchitis	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
winter	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
cough	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
them	NULL
by	NULL
heart	NULL
Philip	NULL
read	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
details	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
text-book	NULL
of	NULL
medicine	NULL
of	NULL
chronic	NULL
bronchitis	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
severe	NULL
winter	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
Philip	NULL
longed	NULL
for	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
rain	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
constantly	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
monomania	NULL
.	NULL

Uncle	NULL
William	NULL
was	NULL
affected	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
heat	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
August	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
of	NULL
sweltering	NULL
weather	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
imagined	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
telegram	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
pictured	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
his	NULL
unutterable	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
and	NULL
directed	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
departments	NULL
they	NULL
wanted	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
occupied	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
with	NULL
thinking	NULL
incessantly	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
five	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
even	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
bother	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
notice	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
pack	NULL
his	NULL
box	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
without	NULL
saying	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
to	NULL
anybody	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

Would	NULL
he	NULL
have	NULL
forgotten	NULL
much	NULL
?	NULL

In	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
his	NULL
three	NULL
examinations	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
midwifery	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
medicine	NULL
and	NULL
surgery	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
awful	NULL
fear	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
his	NULL
promises	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
leave	NULL
everything	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
parish	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
thought	NULL
made	NULL
Philip	NULL
sick	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
cruel	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
if	NULL
that	NULL
happened	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
determined	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
way	NULL
indefinitely	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
tolerable	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
look	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
something	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
hope	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
fear	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
brave	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
then	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
commit	NULL
suicide	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
this	NULL
over	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
decided	NULL
minutely	NULL
what	NULL
painless	NULL
drug	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
get	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
encouraged	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
things	NULL
became	NULL
unendurable	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
events	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Second	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
madam	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
.	NULL

First	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
and	NULL
straight	NULL
through	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Philips	NULL
,	NULL
forward	NULL
please	NULL

Once	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
'	NULL
on	NULL
duty	NULL
.	NULL
'	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
department	NULL
at	NULL
seven	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
and	NULL
keep	NULL
an	NULL
eye	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sweepers	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
finished	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
sheets	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
cases	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
models	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
assistants	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
sheets	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
models	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
cases	NULL
and	NULL
'	NULL
gang	NULL

the	NULL
sweepers	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dusty	NULL

dirty	NULL
job	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
or	NULL
write	NULL
or	NULL
smoke	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
just	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
hung	NULL
heavily	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
off	NULL
at	NULL
half	NULL
past	NULL
nine	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
supper	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
consolation	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
tea	NULL
at	NULL
five	NULL
o'clock	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
healthy	NULL
appetite	NULL

cheese	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
Lynn	NULL
's	NULL
for	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Sampson	NULL

the	NULL
buyer	NULL

came	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL

fuming	NULL
with	NULL
anger	NULL

happening	NULL
to	NULL
notice	NULL

window	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL

had	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL

buyer	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
satirical	NULL
remarks	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
colour	NULL

Forced	NULL
to	NULL
submit	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
superior	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Sampson	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
rated	NULL
the	NULL
wretched	NULL
fellow	NULL
whose	NULL
duty	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
dress	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL

Mr.	NULL

stormed	NULL

He	NULL
threw	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
assistants	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
bitterest	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL

his	NULL
eye	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL

When	NULL

came	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sickening	NULL
sense	NULL

His	NULL
cheeks	NULL
were	NULL
burning	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

regularly	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL

himself	NULL

he	NULL
dreaded	NULL
Friday	NULL
morning	NULL

on	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL

dressed	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
terror	NULL

him	NULL
awake	NULL
at	NULL
five	NULL

lie	NULL
sleepless	NULL
with	NULL
sickness	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL

The	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

noticed	NULL
his	NULL

way	NULL

they	NULL
very	NULL
soon	NULL
discovered	NULL
his	NULL
trick	NULL

standing	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL

They	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL

called	NULL
him	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
got	NULL

thought	NULL
him	NULL

his	NULL

moment	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
ashamed	NULL

tell	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
shame	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
angered	NULL
him	NULL

he	NULL
forced	NULL
himself	NULL

speak	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL

"	NULL

choked	NULL
Philip	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
not	NULL

shirk	NULL
the	NULL

He	NULL
kept	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL

saw	NULL
his	NULL
embarrassment	NULL

smiled	NULL
savagely	NULL

Lawson	NULL

seeing	NULL

it	NULL

laughed	NULL
awkwardly	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL

The	NULL
picture	NULL
that	NULL

received	NULL

in	NULL

people	NULL

troubled	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
behaviour	NULL

seemed	NULL
inexplicable	NULL

took	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL

Philip	NULL
quickly	NULL
limped	NULL
away	NULL

was	NULL
heavy	NULL

as	NULL
was	NULL
usual	NULL

him	NULL

presently	NULL
Lawson	NULL

calling	NULL
him	NULL

he	NULL
stopped	NULL

suddenly	NULL
the	NULL

got	NULL
the	NULL

walked	NULL
away	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
shiver	NULL

through	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL

they	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
talk	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
their	NULL
first	NULL
meeting	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
pleasant	NULL
months	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
sank	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lost	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
on	NULL
mechanically	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
noticing	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
realised	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
movement	NULL
of	NULL
irritation	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
turning	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
Haymarket	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sauntered	NULL
along	NULL
Shaftesbury	NULL
Avenue	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
bored	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
retrace	NULL
his	NULL
steps	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
news	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
alone	NULL
and	NULL
think	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
British	NULL
Museum	NULL
.	NULL

Solitude	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
his	NULL
only	NULL
luxury	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
Lynn	NULL
's	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
gone	NULL
there	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
groups	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Parthenon	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
deliberately	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
allowed	NULL
their	NULL
divine	NULL
masses	NULL
to	NULL
rest	NULL
his	NULL
troubled	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
afternoon	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
,	NULL
impatiently	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wandered	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
many	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
provincials	NULL
with	NULL
foolish	NULL
faces	NULL
,	NULL
foreigners	NULL
poring	NULL
over	NULL
guide-books	NULL
;	NULL
their	NULL
hideousness	NULL
besmirched	NULL
the	NULL
everlasting	NULL
masterpieces	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
restlessness	NULL
troubled	NULL
the	NULL
god	NULL
's	NULL
immortal	NULL
repose	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
another	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
hardly	NULL
anyone	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
wearily	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
nerves	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
edge	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
at	NULL
Lynn	NULL
's	NULL
they	NULL
affected	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
file	NULL
past	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
horror	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
ugly	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
meanness	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
faces	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
terrifying	NULL
;	NULL
their	NULL
features	NULL
were	NULL
distorted	NULL
with	NULL
paltry	NULL
desires	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
felt	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
strange	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
ideas	NULL
of	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
furtive	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
weak	NULL
chins	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
wickedness	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
pettiness	NULL
and	NULL
vulgarity	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
humour	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
facetiousness	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
animal	NULL
they	NULL
resembled	NULL
(	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
quickly	NULL
became	NULL
an	NULL
obsession	NULL
,	NULL
)	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
sheep	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
horse	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
fox	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
goat	NULL
.	NULL

Human	NULL
beings	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
disgust	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
presently	NULL
the	NULL
influence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
descended	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
quieter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
absently	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
tombstones	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
lined	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
Athenian	NULL
stone	NULL
masons	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fourth	NULL
and	NULL
fifth	NULL
centuries	NULL
before	NULL
Christ	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
simple	NULL
,	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
great	NULL
talent	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
exquisite	NULL
spirit	NULL
of	NULL
Athens	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
time	NULL
had	NULL
mellowed	NULL
the	NULL
marble	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
colour	NULL
of	NULL
honey	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
one	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bees	NULL
of	NULL
Hymettus	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
softened	NULL
their	NULL
outlines	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
represented	NULL
a	NULL
nude	NULL
figure	NULL
,	NULL
seated	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
bench	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
the	NULL
departure	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
from	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
clasping	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
remained	NULL
behind	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
tragic	NULL
word	NULL
farewell	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
and	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
simplicity	NULL
was	NULL
infinitely	NULL
touching	NULL
.	NULL

Friend	NULL
parted	NULL
from	NULL
friend	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
son	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
restraint	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
survivor	NULL
's	NULL
grief	NULL
more	NULL
poignant	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
century	NULL
upon	NULL
century	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
over	NULL
that	NULL
unhappiness	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
thousand	NULL
years	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
wept	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
dust	NULL
as	NULL
those	NULL
they	NULL
wept	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
the	NULL
woe	NULL
was	NULL
alive	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
filled	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
compassion	NULL
spring	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Poor	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
gaping	NULL
sight-seers	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fat	NULL
strangers	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
guide-books	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
mean	NULL
,	NULL
common	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
thronged	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
trivial	NULL
desires	NULL
and	NULL
vulgar	NULL
cares	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
mortal	NULL
and	NULL
must	NULL
die	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
too	NULL
loved	NULL
and	NULL
must	NULL
part	NULL
from	NULL
those	NULL
they	NULL
loved	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
son	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
wife	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
tragic	NULL
because	NULL
their	NULL
lives	NULL
were	NULL
ugly	NULL
and	NULL
sordid	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
that	NULL
gave	NULL
beauty	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
stone	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
beautiful	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
bas	NULL
relief	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
holding	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
's	NULL
hand	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
reticence	NULL
of	NULL
line	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
simplicity	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
one	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
sculptor	NULL
here	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
touched	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
genuine	NULL
emotion	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
exquisite	NULL
memorial	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
than	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
offers	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
more	NULL
precious	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
friendship	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
tears	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Hayward	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
eager	NULL
admiration	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
first	NULL
they	NULL
met	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
disillusion	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
indifference	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
nothing	NULL
held	NULL
them	NULL
together	NULL
but	NULL
habit	NULL
and	NULL
old	NULL
memories	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
queer	NULL
things	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
for	NULL
months	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
intimate	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
imagine	NULL
existence	NULL
without	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
separation	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
everything	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
companion	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
essential	NULL
proved	NULL
unnecessary	NULL
.	NULL

Your	NULL
life	NULL
proceeded	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
miss	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
early	NULL
days	NULL
in	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
when	NULL
Hayward	NULL
,	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
great	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
,	NULL
little	NULL
by	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
achieving	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
resigned	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
failure	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
death	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
as	NULL
futile	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
died	NULL
ingloriously	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
stupid	NULL
disease	NULL
,	NULL
failing	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
accomplish	NULL
anything	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
now	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
lived	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
desperately	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
living	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
all	NULL
seemed	NULL
inane	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
with	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
unimportant	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
and	NULL
forgotten	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
book	NULL
of	NULL
poems	NULL
sold	NULL
in	NULL
remainder	NULL
by	NULL
second-hand	NULL
booksellers	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
served	NULL
nothing	NULL
except	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
pushing	NULL
journalist	NULL
occasion	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
an	NULL
article	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
review	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Philip	NULL
cried	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
What	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
effort	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
incommensurate	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bright	NULL
hopes	NULL
of	NULL
youth	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
paid	NULL
for	NULL
at	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
bitter	NULL
price	NULL
of	NULL
disillusionment	NULL
.	NULL

Pain	NULL
and	NULL
disease	NULL
and	NULL
unhappiness	NULL
weighed	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
scale	NULL
so	NULL
heavily	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
mean	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
hopes	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
entered	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
limitations	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
body	NULL
forced	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
friendlessness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
lack	NULL
of	NULL
affection	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
surrounded	NULL
his	NULL
youth	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
done	NULL
anything	NULL
but	NULL
what	NULL
seemed	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
cropper	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
!	NULL

Other	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
advantages	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
succeeded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
others	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
many	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
failed	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
pure	NULL
chance	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rain	NULL
fell	NULL
alike	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
just	NULL
and	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
unjust	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
nothing	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
a	NULL
why	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
wherefore	NULL
.	NULL

Thinking	NULL
of	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
Persian	NULL
rug	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
telling	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
offered	NULL
an	NULL
answer	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
question	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
meaning	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
suddenly	NULL
the	NULL
answer	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
chuckled	NULL
:	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
puzzles	NULL
which	NULL
you	NULL
worry	NULL
over	NULL
till	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
shown	NULL
the	NULL
solution	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
imagine	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
ever	NULL
have	NULL
escaped	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
answer	NULL
was	NULL
obvious	NULL
.	NULL

Life	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
meaning	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
,	NULL
satellite	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
star	NULL
speeding	NULL
through	NULL
space	NULL
,	NULL
living	NULL
things	NULL
had	NULL
arisen	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
influence	NULL
of	NULL
conditions	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
planet	NULL
's	NULL
history	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
influence	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
conditions	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
:	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
significant	NULL
than	NULL
other	NULL
forms	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
climax	NULL
of	NULL
creation	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
physical	NULL
reaction	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
environment	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Eastern	NULL
King	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
desiring	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
history	NULL
of	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
brought	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
sage	NULL
five	NULL
hundred	NULL
volumes	NULL
;	NULL
busy	NULL
with	NULL
affairs	NULL
of	NULL
state	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
bade	NULL
him	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
condense	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
the	NULL
sage	NULL
returned	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
history	NULL
now	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
fifty	NULL
volumes	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
King	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
old	NULL
then	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
ponderous	NULL
tomes	NULL
,	NULL
bade	NULL
him	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
shorten	NULL
it	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
;	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
passed	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sage	NULL
,	NULL
old	NULL
and	NULL
gray	NULL
,	NULL
brought	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
book	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
knowledge	NULL
the	NULL
King	NULL
had	NULL
sought	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
King	NULL
lay	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
death-bed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
even	NULL
that	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
sage	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
history	NULL
of	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
line	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
born	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
suffered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
died	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
meaning	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
man	NULL
by	NULL
living	NULL
served	NULL
no	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
immaterial	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
born	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
born	NULL
,	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
lived	NULL
or	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
.	NULL

Life	NULL
was	NULL
insignificant	NULL
and	NULL

without	NULL
consequence	NULL

Philip	NULL
exulted	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
exulted	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
boyhood	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
weight	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
belief	NULL
in	NULL
God	NULL
was	NULL
lifted	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
burden	NULL
of	NULL
responsibility	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
utterly	NULL
free	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
insignificance	NULL
was	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
power	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
suddenly	NULL
equal	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
cruel	NULL
fate	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
persecute	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
meaningless	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
robbed	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
cruelty	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
or	NULL
left	NULL
undone	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

Failure	NULL
was	NULL
unimportant	NULL
and	NULL
success	NULL
amounted	NULL
to	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
inconsiderate	NULL
creature	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
swarming	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
mankind	NULL
which	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
brief	NULL
space	NULL
occupied	NULL
the	NULL
surface	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
almighty	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
wrenched	NULL
from	NULL
chaos	NULL
the	NULL
secret	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
nothingness	NULL
.	NULL

Thoughts	NULL
came	NULL
tumbling	NULL
over	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
in	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
eager	NULL
fancy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
long	NULL
breaths	NULL
of	NULL
joyous	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
leap	NULL
and	NULL
sing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
happy	NULL
for	NULL
months	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
cried	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
is	NULL
thy	NULL
sting	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
uprush	NULL
of	NULL
fancy	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
shown	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
mathematical	NULL
demonstration	NULL
that	NULL
life	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
meaning	NULL
,	NULL
brought	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
another	NULL
idea	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
why	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
imagined	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
Persian	NULL
rug	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
weaver	NULL
elaborated	NULL
his	NULL
pattern	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
end	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
pleasure	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
aesthetic	NULL
sense	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
might	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
live	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
if	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
actions	NULL
were	NULL
outside	NULL
his	NULL
choosing	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
might	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
pattern	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
little	NULL
need	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
as	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
use	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
merely	NULL
something	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
pleasure	NULL
.	NULL

Out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
manifold	NULL
events	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
deeds	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
feelings	NULL

his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
design	NULL
,	NULL
regular	NULL
,	NULL
elaborate	NULL
,	NULL
complicated	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
beautiful	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
an	NULL
illusion	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
selection	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
fantastic	NULL
legerdemain	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
appearances	NULL
were	NULL
interwoven	NULL
with	NULL
moonbeams	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
matter	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
vast	NULL
warp	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
(	NULL
a	NULL
river	NULL
arising	NULL
from	NULL
no	NULL
spring	NULL
and	NULL
flowing	NULL
endlessly	NULL
to	NULL
no	NULL
sea	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
background	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
fancies	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
meaning	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
was	NULL
important	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
might	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
personal	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
in	NULL
selecting	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
strands	NULL
that	NULL
worked	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
pattern	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
pattern	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
obvious	NULL
,	NULL
perfect	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
beautiful	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
born	NULL
,	NULL
grew	NULL
to	NULL
manhood	NULL
,	NULL
married	NULL
,	NULL
produced	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
toiled	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
bread	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
died	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
intricate	NULL
and	NULL
wonderful	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
happiness	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
enter	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
success	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
attempted	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
discovered	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
troubling	NULL
grace	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
lives	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Hayward	NULL
's	NULL
was	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
blind	NULL
indifference	NULL
of	NULL
chance	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
design	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
imperfect	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
solace	NULL
was	NULL
comfortable	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
matter	NULL
;	NULL
other	NULL
lives	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
Cronshaw	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
offered	NULL
a	NULL
pattern	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
shifted	NULL
and	NULL
old	NULL
standards	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
altered	NULL
before	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
justification	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
throwing	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
happiness	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
casting	NULL
aside	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
illusions	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
life	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
horrible	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
measured	NULL
by	NULL
its	NULL
happiness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
gather	NULL
strength	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
measured	NULL
by	NULL
something	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

Happiness	NULL
mattered	NULL
as	NULL
little	NULL
as	NULL
pain	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
details	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
elaboration	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
design	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
accidents	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
existence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
affect	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

Whatever	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
one	NULL
more	NULL
motive	NULL
to	NULL
add	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
complexity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pattern	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
approached	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
rejoice	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
completion	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
none	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
beautiful	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
alone	NULL
knew	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
existence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
death	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
cease	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
happy	NULL

CVII	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Sampson	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
buyer	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
fancy	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Sampson	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
dashing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
department	NULL
said	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
surprised	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
married	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rich	NULL
customers	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
lived	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
town	NULL
and	NULL
often	NULL
impressed	NULL
the	NULL
assistants	NULL
by	NULL
putting	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
evening	NULL
clothes	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
by	NULL
those	NULL
on	NULL
sweeping	NULL
duty	NULL
coming	NULL
in	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
still	NULL
dressed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
wink	NULL
gravely	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
office	NULL
and	NULL
changed	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
frock	NULL
coat	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
these	NULL
occasions	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
slipped	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
hurried	NULL
breakfast	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
also	NULL
would	NULL
wink	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
rub	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL

What	NULL
a	NULL
night	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
word	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
gentleman	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
fellows	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
said	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
changed	NULL
his	NULL
manner	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
called	NULL
Philip	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
assumed	NULL
the	NULL
importance	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
as	NULL
buyer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
Philip	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
shop-walker	NULL
.	NULL

Lynn	NULL
and	NULL
Sedley	NULL
received	NULL
fashion	NULL
papers	NULL
from	NULL
Paris	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
and	NULL
adapted	NULL
the	NULL
costumes	NULL
illustrated	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
needs	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
customers	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
clientele	NULL
was	NULL
peculiar	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
most	NULL
substantial	NULL
part	NULL
consisted	NULL
of	NULL
women	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
smaller	NULL
manufacturing	NULL
towns	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
elegant	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
their	NULL
frocks	NULL
made	NULL
locally	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
acquainted	NULL
with	NULL
London	NULL
to	NULL
discover	NULL
good	NULL
dressmakers	NULL
within	NULL
their	NULL
means	NULL
.	NULL

Beside	NULL
these	NULL
,	NULL
incongruously	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
music-hall	NULL
artistes	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
connection	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Sampson	NULL
had	NULL
worked	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
great	NULL
pride	NULL

had	NULL
begun	NULL

stage-costumes	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL

with	NULL
him	NULL
which	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
customers	NULL

Mr.	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
certain	NULL

her	NULL
the	NULL

He	NULL
showed	NULL
her	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

nothing	NULL

impatiently	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL
buyer	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
bland	NULL
smile	NULL

his	NULL
eyes	NULL
grew	NULL
blank	NULL

stupid	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
swept	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
department	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Sampson	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
worried	NULL

discussed	NULL

remarked	NULL
the	NULL
buyer	NULL
,	NULL
irritably	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
scored	NULL
a	NULL
point	NULL
against	NULL
her	NULL

His	NULL
ideas	NULL

music-hall	NULL

never	NULL

beyond	NULL
short	NULL
skirts	NULL

a	NULL
swirl	NULL

glittering	NULL

but	NULL
Miss	NULL
Antonia	NULL
had	NULL
expressed	NULL
herself	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL

in	NULL
no	NULL
uncertain	NULL
terms	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
aunt	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
invocation	NULL
was	NULL
uttered	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
tone	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
indicate	NULL
a	NULL

antipathy	NULL

anything	NULL

even	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Sampson	NULL
'	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL

one	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

told	NULL
him	NULL
frankly	NULL
she	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
who	NULL
gave	NULL
Philip	NULL
the	NULL
suggestion	NULL

you	NULL

Philip	NULL
bought	NULL
a	NULL
cheap	NULL
box	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
colours	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
while	NULL
Bell	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
noisy	NULL
lad	NULL
of	NULL
sixteen	NULL
,	NULL
whistling	NULL
three	NULL
notes	NULL
,	NULL
busied	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
stamps	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
sketches	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
costumes	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
adapted	NULL
one	NULL

getting	NULL
his	NULL
effect	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL

The	NULL

amused	NULL
him	NULL

next	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
showed	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Hodges	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
somewhat	NULL
astonished	NULL

took	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
buyer	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL

It	NULL
puzzled	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
his	NULL
trained	NULL
eye	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
admirably	NULL

To	NULL
save	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
making	NULL
suggestions	NULL
for	NULL
altering	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Hodges	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
sense	NULL
,	NULL
advised	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Antonia	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

When	NULL
Miss	NULL

was	NULL
announced	NULL

the	NULL
buyer	NULL
placed	NULL
the	NULL
design	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

such	NULL

The	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
thrill	NULL
of	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
costume	NULL
completed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
buyer	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Hodges	NULL
took	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
credit	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Tivoli	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Miss	NULL
Antonia	NULL
wear	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
elation	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
answer	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
questions	NULL
he	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
told	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Hodges	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
learnt	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
--	NULL
fearing	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL

lived	NULL

think	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL

put	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
care	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
past	NULL
occupations	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
repeated	NULL
the	NULL
information	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Sampson	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
buyer	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
treat	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
deferentially	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
designs	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
customers	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
clients	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
clever	NULL

soon	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
ensconced	NULL
behind	NULL
a	NULL

,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
shirt	NULL
sleeves	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
drawing	NULL
from	NULL
morning	NULL

night	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL

dine	NULL
at	NULL
three	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
stragglers	NULL

He	NULL
liked	NULL
it	NULL

because	NULL
there	NULL

them	NULL

they	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
too	NULL
tired	NULL

the	NULL
food	NULL

Philip	NULL

to	NULL
designer	NULL
of	NULL
costumes	NULL

a	NULL
great	NULL
effect	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
department	NULL

He	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL

was	NULL
an	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
envy	NULL
.	NULL

Harris	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
assistant	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
queer-shaped	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
person	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
attached	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
conceal	NULL
his	NULL
bitterness	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Some	NULL
people	NULL
'	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL
luck	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

all	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
demand	NULL
higher	NULL
wages	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
the	NULL
difficult	NULL
work	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
engaged	NULL
in	NULL

he	NULL
received	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
six	NULL
shillings	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
started	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
ticklish	NULL
matter	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
rise	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
manager	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
sardonic	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
dealing	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
applicants	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Think	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL

How	NULL
much	NULL

think	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
assistant	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
suggest	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
another	NULL
two	NULL
shillings	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

You	NULL
can	NULL
'	NULL

"	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
paused	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
steely	NULL
eye	NULL
,	NULL
added	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL

no	NULL

to	NULL
withdraw	NULL
your	NULL
request	NULL

you	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL

The	NULL
manager	NULL
's	NULL
idea	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
assistants	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
dissatisfied	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
work	NULL
properly	NULL

and	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
worth	NULL
a	NULL
rise	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
sack	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
result	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
never	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
unless	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
prepared	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
hesitated	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
suspicious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
who	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
buyer	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
without	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
decent	NULL
fellows	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
their	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
humour	NULL
was	NULL
primitive	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
seemed	NULL
funny	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
persuaded	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
for	NULL
more	NULL
wages	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
sacked	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
forget	NULL
the	NULL
mortification	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
in	NULL
looking	NULL
for	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
expose	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
small	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
getting	NULL
elsewhere	NULL
a	NULL
post	NULL
as	NULL

there	NULL
were	NULL
hundreds	NULL

people	NULL
about	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
draw	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL

he	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
money	NULL
very	NULL
badly	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
clothes	NULL
were	NULL
worn	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
heavy	NULL
carpets	NULL
rotted	NULL
his	NULL
socks	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
almost	NULL
persuaded	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
venturesome	NULL
step	NULL
when	NULL
one	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
passing	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
breakfast	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
basement	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
that	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
manager	NULL

he	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL

of	NULL
men	NULL
waiting	NULL
in	NULL
answer	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
advertisement	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL

whichever	NULL
was	NULL
engaged	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
offered	NULL
his	NULL
keep	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
six	NULL
shillings	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
cast	NULL
envious	NULL
glances	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
employment	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
shudder	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
risk	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

CVIII	NULL
The	NULL
winter	NULL
passed	NULL

Now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL

slinking	NULL
in	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL

At	NULL
Easter	NULL
he	NULL

him	NULL

the	NULL
Vicar	NULL

Blackstable	NULL

a	NULL
dozen	NULL
letters	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
whole	NULL
life	NULL

and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
business	NULL
matters	NULL
.	NULL

Dear	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
holiday	NULL
soon	NULL
and	NULL
care	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
here	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
pleased	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
ill	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
bronchitis	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
and	NULL
Doctor	NULL
Wigram	NULL
never	NULL
expected	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
pull	NULL
through	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
wonderful	NULL
constitution	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
made	NULL
,	NULL
thank	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
marvellous	NULL
recovery	NULL
.	NULL

Yours	NULL
affectionately	NULL
,	NULL
William	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
letter	NULL
made	NULL
Philip	NULL
angry	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
did	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
living	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
inquire	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
starved	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
cared	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
home	NULL
something	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
stopped	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
lamp-post	NULL
and	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
handwriting	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
the	NULL
business-like	NULL
firmness	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
characterised	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
larger	NULL
and	NULL
wavering	NULL
:	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
illness	NULL
had	NULL
shaken	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
confess	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
sought	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
formal	NULL
note	NULL
to	NULL
express	NULL
a	NULL
yearning	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
relation	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
wrote	NULL
back	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
in	NULL
July	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
invitation	NULL
was	NULL
convenient	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
known	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
brief	NULL
holiday	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Athelnys	NULL
went	NULL
hopping	NULL
in	NULL
September	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
then	NULL
be	NULL
spared	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
during	NULL
that	NULL
month	NULL
the	NULL
autumn	NULL
models	NULL
were	NULL
prepared	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rule	NULL
of	NULL
Lynn	NULL
's	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
everyone	NULL
must	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
it	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
during	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
nowhere	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
assistant	NULL
might	NULL
sleep	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
allowed	NULL
food	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
number	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
friends	NULL
within	NULL
reasonable	NULL
distance	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
these	NULL
the	NULL
holiday	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
awkward	NULL
interval	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
provide	NULL
food	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
small	NULL
wages	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
day	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
since	NULL
his	NULL
visit	NULL
to	NULL
Brighton	NULL
with	NULL
Mildred	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
longed	NULL
for	NULL
fresh	NULL
air	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
passionate	NULL
desire	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
through	NULL
May	NULL
and	NULL
June	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
came	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
listless	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
talked	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
buyer	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
jobs	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Sampson	NULL
suddenly	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
What	NULL
wages	NULL
have	NULL
you	NULL
been	NULL
getting	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Six	NULL
shillings	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
enough	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
twelve	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Thank	NULL
you	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
smiled	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
want	NULL
some	NULL
new	NULL
clothes	NULL
badly	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
stick	NULL
to	NULL
your	NULL
work	NULL
and	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
go	NULL
larking	NULL
about	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
like	NULL
what	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL

Mind	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
promising	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL

you	NULL

you	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL

week	NULL

soon	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
deserve	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
wondered	NULL
how	NULL
long	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
years	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
startled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
stout	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
held	NULL
himself	NULL
upright	NULL
,	NULL
clean-shaven	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
sensual	NULL
face	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
in	NULL
strangely	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
skin	NULL
was	NULL
yellow	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
great	NULL
bags	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
bent	NULL
and	NULL
old	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
a	NULL
beard	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
illness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
very	NULL
slowly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
my	NULL
best	NULL
today	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
just	NULL
arrived	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
heat	NULL
upsets	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
asking	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
affairs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
parish	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
wondered	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
longer	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
hot	NULL
summer	NULL
would	NULL
finish	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
Philip	NULL
noticed	NULL
how	NULL
thin	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
were	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
trembled	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
meant	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
died	NULL
that	NULL
summer	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
session	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
leaped	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
returning	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
Lynn	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
dinner	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
sat	NULL
humped	NULL
up	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
housekeeper	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
since	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Shall	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Philip	NULL
carve	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
from	NULL
disinclination	NULL
to	NULL
confess	NULL
his	NULL
weakness	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
glad	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
suggestion	NULL
to	NULL
relinquish	NULL
the	NULL
attempt	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
appetite	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
always	NULL
eat	NULL
well	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL

you	NULL
were	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL

to	NULL
be	NULL
thinner	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL

being	NULL
so	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Wigram	NULL
thinks	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
for	NULL
being	NULL

I	NULL

When	NULL
dinner	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
housekeeper	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
some	NULL
medicine	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Show	NULL

said	NULL

He	NULL

that	NULL

thinks	NULL
it	NULL

I	NULL
told	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Wigram	NULL
that	NULL
now	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
studying	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
doctor	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL

charges	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
dreadful	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
months	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
charges	NULL
five	NULL
shillings	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL

comes	NULL
twice	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
send	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
eagerly	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
prescriptions	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
narcotics	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
medicine	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
explained	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
only	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
neuritis	NULL
grew	NULL
unendurable	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL

to	NULL

into	NULL
the	NULL
opium	NULL
habit	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mention	NULL
his	NULL
nephew	NULL
's	NULL
affairs	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
fancied	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
precaution	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
kept	NULL
dwelling	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
financial	NULL
calls	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
chemist	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ill	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
fire	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
bed-room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
on	NULL
Sunday	NULL
he	NULL
needed	NULL
a	NULL
carriage	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
angrily	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
he	NULL
need	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
afraid	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
borrow	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
his	NULL
tongue	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
everything	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
now	NULL
but	NULL
two	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
food	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
grasping	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
hideous	NULL
old	NULL
age	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Wigram	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
visit	NULL
Philip	NULL
walked	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
gate	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
d'you	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Wigram	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
anxious	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
wrong	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
hazarded	NULL
a	NULL
definite	NULL
opinion	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
practised	NULL
at	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
for	NULL
five-and-thirty	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
reputation	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
very	NULL
safe	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
patients	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
doctor	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
safe	NULL
than	NULL
clever	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
man	NULL
at	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
settled	NULL
there	NULL
for	NULL
ten	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
still	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
interloper	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
clever	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
practice	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
really	NULL
knew	NULL
anything	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

he	NULL
's	NULL

the	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL

suggested	NULL

after	NULL

I	NULL

"	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
tip	NULL
of	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
tongue	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
:	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
longer	NULL
can	NULL
he	NULL
live	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
shock	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
these	NULL
matters	NULL
a	NULL
periphrase	NULL
was	NULL
demanded	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
decorum	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
another	NULL
question	NULL
instead	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
flashed	NULL
through	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
impatience	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sick	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
relatives	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
see	NULL
through	NULL
their	NULL
sympathetic	NULL

Philip	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL

the	NULL

With	NULL

looked	NULL
grotesque	NULL

suddenly	NULL

that	NULL

a	NULL

The	NULL

clung	NULL
to	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
implicitly	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL

taught	NULL
him	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

In	NULL
his	NULL

how	NULL
many	NULL

persons	NULL
must	NULL
he	NULL
have	NULL
administered	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL

could	NULL
get	NULL
no	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
puzzled	NULL

shocked	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
eager	NULL
cleaving	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL
nameless	NULL
horror	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL

probe	NULL

his	NULL
soul	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL

might	NULL
see	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
nakedness	NULL
the	NULL
dreadful	NULL

the	NULL

which	NULL
he	NULL
suspected	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fortnight	NULL
passed	NULL
quickly	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
passed	NULL
a	NULL
sweltering	NULL
August	NULL
behind	NULL
his	NULL
screen	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
costumes	NULL
department	NULL

drawing	NULL

his	NULL

The	NULL
assistants	NULL

went	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
holidays	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
Philip	NULL
generally	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
Hyde	NULL
Park	NULL

listened	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
band	NULL
.	NULL

Growing	NULL
more	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
it	NULL
tired	NULL
him	NULL
less	NULL

and	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
recovering	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
long	NULL
stagnation	NULL
,	NULL
sought	NULL
for	NULL
fresh	NULL
activity	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
whole	NULL
desire	NULL
now	NULL
was	NULL
set	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL

He	NULL
kept	NULL
on	NULL
dreaming	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
dream	NULL
:	NULL
a	NULL
telegram	NULL
was	NULL
handed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
one	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
early	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
announced	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
's	NULL
sudden	NULL
demise	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
freedom	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
grasp	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
awoke	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
sombre	NULL
rage	NULL

He	NULL
occupied	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

seemed	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
happen	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
elaborate	NULL
plans	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
these	NULL
he	NULL
passed	NULL
rapidly	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
spend	NULL
before	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
qualified	NULL
and	NULL
dwelt	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
journey	NULL
to	NULL
Spain	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
set	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
read	NULL
books	NULL
about	NULL
that	NULL
country	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
borrowed	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
free	NULL
library	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
already	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
from	NULL
photographs	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
each	NULL
city	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
himself	NULL
lingering	NULL
in	NULL
Cordova	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bridge	NULL
that	NULL
spanned	NULL
the	NULL
Gaudalquivir	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wandered	NULL
through	NULL
tortuous	NULL
streets	NULL
in	NULL
Toledo	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
churches	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
wrung	NULL
from	NULL
El	NULL
Greco	NULL
the	NULL
secret	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
mysterious	NULL
painter	NULL
held	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL

Athelny	NULL
entered	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
humour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
Sunday	NULL
afternoons	NULL
they	NULL
made	NULL
out	NULL
elaborate	NULL
itineraries	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
should	NULL
miss	NULL
nothing	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
noteworthy	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
cheat	NULL
his	NULL
impatience	NULL
Philip	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
teach	NULL
himself	NULL
Spanish	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
deserted	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
in	NULL
Harrington	NULL
Street	NULL
he	NULL
spent	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
every	NULL
evening	NULL
doing	NULL
Spanish	NULL
exercises	NULL

puzzling	NULL
out	NULL

an	NULL
English	NULL

side	NULL
the	NULL

gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
lesson	NULL
once	NULL

learned	NULL
a	NULL

sentences	NULL

journey	NULL

Athelny	NULL
in	NULL

Philip	NULL

no	NULL

neither	NULL

Fury	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
seemed	NULL
useless	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
reconcile	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
belief	NULL

life	NULL

no	NULL
meaning	NULL

everything	NULL
he	NULL

all	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL

added	NULL

But	NULL
though	NULL
fury	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

fury	NULL

Life	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

if	NULL

left	NULL
his	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL

went	NULL
once	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

a	NULL

on	NULL
an	NULL
envelope	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
handwriting	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
hoped	NULL
never	NULL

It	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
feeling	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL

take	NULL
it	NULL

at	NULL

Dear	NULL

I	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL

Mildred	NULL

He	NULL
tore	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
into	NULL
little	NULL
bits	NULL
and	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
scattered	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
damned	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
muttered	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
disgust	NULL
surged	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
distress	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
served	NULL
her	NULL
right	NULL
whatever	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
hatred	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
love	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
aroused	NULL
his	NULL
loathing	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
recollections	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
nausea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
Thames	NULL
he	NULL
drew	NULL
himself	NULL
aside	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
instinctive	NULL
withdrawal	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
sleep	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
the	NULL
fear	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
ill	NULL
and	NULL
hungry	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
unless	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
desperate	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
weakness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
peace	NULL
unless	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
wrote	NULL
a	NULL
letter-card	NULL
and	NULL
posted	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
stiff	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
merely	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sorry	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
difficulties	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
address	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
at	NULL
seven	NULL
o'clock	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
shabby	NULL
lodging-house	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sordid	NULL
street	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
sick	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
wild	NULL
hope	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
looked	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
place	NULL
people	NULL
moved	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
frequently	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
postmark	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
letter	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
many	NULL
days	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
lain	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rack	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
answered	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
reply	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
inquiry	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
silently	NULL
preceded	NULL
him	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
and	NULL
knocked	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
door	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Miller	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
called	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
door	NULL
was	NULL
slightly	NULL
opened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
looked	NULL
out	NULL
suspiciously	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
small	NULL
bed-room	NULL
,	NULL
untidy	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
every	NULL
place	NULL
she	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
shoes	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
lying	NULL
apart	NULL
from	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
and	NULL
uncleaned	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
hat	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
chest	NULL
of	NULL
drawers	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
false	NULL
curls	NULL
beside	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
blouse	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
for	NULL
somewhere	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hooks	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
were	NULL
laden	NULL
with	NULL
skirts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
muddy	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hem	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Sit	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
awkward	NULL
laugh	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
surprised	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
from	NULL
me	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
awfully	NULL
hoarse	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Have	NULL
you	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
sore	NULL
throat	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
anything	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
clearly	NULL
enough	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
photograph	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
chimney-piece	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
sign	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
was	NULL
ever	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
was	NULL
holding	NULL
her	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
ball	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
nervous	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
without	NULL
meeting	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
thinner	NULL
than	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
skin	NULL
,	NULL
yellow	NULL
and	NULL
dryish	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
drawn	NULL
more	NULL
tightly	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
cheekbones	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
dyed	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
flaxen	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
altered	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
look	NULL
more	NULL
vulgar	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
relieved	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
your	NULL
letter	NULL

tell	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
for	NULL
another	NULL
moment	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL

with	NULL
coldness	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
glance	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
away	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
reddened	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
dabbed	NULL
her	NULL
palms	NULL
nervously	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
've	NULL

She	NULL
jerked	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
out	NULL
quite	NULL
oddly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
entirely	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

Her	NULL
voice	NULL
sank	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
hoarse	NULL
whisper	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
coldly	NULL

with	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

such	NULL
examination	NULL

he	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
he	NULL

horrible	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
terrified	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
reassure	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
pleadingly	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
daring	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
for	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
comfort	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
nerves	NULL
astrung	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
them	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
none	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
afraid	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
very	NULL
ill	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
d'you	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
she	NULL
grew	NULL
deathly	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
even	NULL
turned	NULL
,	NULL
yellow	NULL
.	NULL

she	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
,	NULL
hopelessly	NULL
,	NULL
quietly	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
choking	NULL
sobs	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
awfully	NULL
sorry	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
kill	NULL
myself	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
threat	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Have	NULL
you	NULL
got	NULL
any	NULL
money	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Six	NULL
or	NULL
seven	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
must	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
this	NULL
life	NULL

you	NULL
know	NULL

Do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
think	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
some	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL
afraid	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
help	NULL
you	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
only	NULL
get	NULL
twelve	NULL
bob	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
is	NULL
there	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
now	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
cried	NULL
impatiently	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Damn	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
MUST	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
something	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
gravely	NULL
,	NULL
telling	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
danger	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
danger	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
exposed	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
listened	NULL
sullenly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
console	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
brought	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
sulky	NULL
acquiescence	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
advised	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wrote	NULL
a	NULL
prescription	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
leave	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
nearest	NULL
chemist	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
impressed	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
necessity	NULL
of	NULL
taking	NULL
her	NULL
medicine	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
regularity	NULL
.	NULL

Getting	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
downhearted	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL
soon	NULL
get	NULL
over	NULL
your	NULL
throat	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
became	NULL
suddenly	NULL
distorted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
caught	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
coat	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
leave	NULL
me	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
cried	NULL
hoarsely	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
so	NULL
afraid	NULL

do	NULL
n't	NULL
leave	NULL
me	NULL

Phil	NULL
,	NULL
please	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
's	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
friend	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
ever	NULL

.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
terror	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
strangely	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
terror	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
feared	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
die	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

Twice	NULL
that	NULL
woman	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
wretched	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
claim	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
deep	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
aching	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
received	NULL
her	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
peace	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
obeyed	NULL
her	NULL
summons	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
never	NULL
really	NULL
quite	NULL
get	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
perplexed	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
physical	NULL
distaste	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
near	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
want	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
's	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
dine	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
pay	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
hesitated	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
creeping	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
watched	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
sickening	NULL
anxiety	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
treated	NULL
you	NULL
shocking	NULL

but	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL

alone	NULL
now	NULL

You	NULL
've	NULL
had	NULL
your	NULL
revenge	NULL

If	NULL
you	NULL
leave	NULL
me	NULL
by	NULL

now	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL

it	NULL

money	NULL

these	NULL
days	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
shoes	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
changed	NULL
her	NULL
skirt	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
hat	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
out	NULL
together	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
restaurant	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Tottenham	NULL
Court	NULL
Road	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
eating	NULL
at	NULL
those	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
's	NULL
throat	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
sore	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
swallow	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
cold	NULL
ham	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
drank	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL
of	NULL
beer	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL
opposite	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
sat	NULL
before	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
remembered	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
if	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
forced	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
bright	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
restaurant	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
vulgar	NULL
looking-glasses	NULL
that	NULL
reflected	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
endless	NULL
series	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
old	NULL
and	NULL
haggard	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
courage	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
know	NULL
baby	NULL
died	NULL
last	NULL
summer	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
might	NULL
say	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
sorry	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
very	NULL
glad	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
understanding	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
away	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
were	NULL
rare	NULL
stuck	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
always	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
funny	NULL
like	NULL
how	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
child	NULL

"	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
eating	NULL
they	NULL
called	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
chemist	NULL
's	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
medicine	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
ordered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
going	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
shabby	NULL
room	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
dose	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
sat	NULL
together	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Harrington	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
hideously	NULL
bored	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
medicine	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
prescribed	NULL
and	NULL
followed	NULL
his	NULL
directions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
the	NULL
results	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
apparent	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
gained	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
confidence	NULL
in	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
skill	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
grew	NULL
better	NULL
she	NULL
grew	NULL
less	NULL
despondent	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
talked	NULL
more	NULL
freely	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
job	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
all	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
had	NULL
my	NULL
lesson	NULL
now	NULL

I	NULL

No	NULL
more	NULL

about	NULL

yours	NULL
truly	NULL

"	NULL

Each	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
asked	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
worry	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
find	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
several	NULL
strings	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
bow	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
deny	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
more	NULL
insistent	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
cheerful	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fussy	NULL
old	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
long	NULL
stories	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
manageresses	NULL
she	NULL
interviewed	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
idea	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
work	NULL
at	NULL
some	NULL
eating-house	NULL
;	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
said	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
definite	NULL
was	NULL
fixed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
to	NULL
settle	NULL
something	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
week	NULL
:	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
use	NULL
hurrying	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
mistake	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
something	NULL
unsuitable	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
absurd	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
impatiently	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
must	NULL
take	NULL
anything	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
get	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
help	NULL
you	NULL

and	NULL
your	NULL
money	NULL

n't	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
yet	NULL
and	NULL
chance	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
sharply	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
since	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
visit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
then	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
seven	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

Suspicion	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
two	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
any	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
lying	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
strange	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
money	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
lasted	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
is	NULL
your	NULL
rent	NULL
here	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
landlady	NULL
's	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL

to	NULL

till	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
convenient	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
he	NULL
suspected	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
horrible	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
hesitated	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
use	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
deny	NULL
everything	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
leaving	NULL
her	NULL
every	NULL
evening	NULL
at	NULL
eight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
clock	NULL
struck	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Harrington	NULL
Street	NULL
he	NULL
stationed	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
Fitzroy	NULL
Square	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
anyone	NULL
who	NULL
came	NULL
along	NULL
William	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
an	NULL
interminable	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
his	NULL
surmise	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
mistaken	NULL

when	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
No.	NULL
7	NULL
opened	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
fell	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
and	NULL
watched	NULL
her	NULL
walk	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
hat	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
quantity	NULL
of	NULL
feathers	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
dress	NULL
he	NULL
recognized	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
showy	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
and	NULL
unsuitable	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL

she	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL

Oxford	NULL

she	NULL
stopped	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL

and	NULL
crossed	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
music-hall	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
touched	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
arm	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
rouged	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
painted	NULL
her	NULL

.	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
started	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

his	NULL

reddened	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
always	NULL

the	NULL

anger	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
instinctively	NULL
sought	NULL
to	NULL
defend	NULL
herself	NULL
by	NULL
abuse	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
tip	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
tongue	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
arm	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
thinking	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
tried	NULL

the	NULL

Nothing	NULL

his	NULL

that	NULL

just	NULL

him	NULL

he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
trouble	NULL

what	NULL
Phil	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL

he	NULL
seemed	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
him	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
how	NULL
long	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
stay	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
leave	NULL
on	NULL
Tuesday	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
expressed	NULL
a	NULL
wish	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL

repeated	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL

him	NULL

He	NULL
broke	NULL
off	NULL

ring	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
Mrs.	NULL

came	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL

gone	NULL
he	NULL
explained	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
uneasy	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
that	NULL

tired	NULL

that	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
heavy	NULL
from	NULL
want	NULL

suggested	NULL
that	NULL

was	NULL
working	NULL
her	NULL
too	NULL
hard	NULL

the	NULL
Vicar	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL

And	NULL
when	NULL
next	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
medicine	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

Presently	NULL
the	NULL
medicine	NULL
took	NULL

Mr.	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL

whether	NULL

saw	NULL
that	NULL

peace	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL

She	NULL
washed	NULL
and	NULL
dressed	NULL
him	NULL

gave	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
food	NULL

was	NULL
up	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
times	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL

for	NULL
she	NULL
slept	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
room	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
and	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
awoke	NULL
he	NULL
tinkled	NULL
his	NULL
little	NULL
bell	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL

He	NULL
might	NULL
die	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
moment	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
live	NULL
for	NULL
months	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
wonderful	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
stranger	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
patient	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL

alone	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
religion	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL

preached	NULL
all	NULL

now	NULL

him	NULL

every	NULL
Sunday	NULL
the	NULL
curate	NULL
came	NULL

administered	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
Holy	NULL
Communion	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
often	NULL
read	NULL
his	NULL
Bible	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
death	NULL
with	NULL
horror	NULL

He	NULL
believed	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
gateway	NULL
to	NULL
life	NULL
everlasting	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL

enter	NULL
upon	NULL
that	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
constant	NULL
pain	NULL
,	NULL
chained	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL

given	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
hope	NULL

ever	NULL

out	NULL

In	NULL
Philip	NULL

a	NULL
question	NULL

never	NULL

a	NULL
conventional	NULL
answer	NULL

wondered	NULL
whether	NULL

very	NULL

now	NULL
that	NULL

painfully	NULL

out	NULL

clergyman	NULL
still	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
immortality	NULL

perhaps	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
shape	NULL
itself	NULL
into	NULL
words	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
it	NULL
became	NULL

the	NULL
conviction	NULL

Boxing	NULL
Day	NULL
Philip	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
start	NULL
very	NULL
early	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
by	NULL
nine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
good-night	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Vicar	NULL
of	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
was	NULL
dozing	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
lying	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
let	NULL
his	NULL
book	NULL
fall	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
idly	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
furniture	NULL
would	NULL
fetch	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
walked	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
childhood	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
pieces	NULL
of	NULL
china	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
go	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
decent	NULL
price	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
worth	NULL
while	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
them	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
furniture	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Victorian	NULL
order	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
mahogany	NULL
,	NULL
solid	NULL
and	NULL
ugly	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
for	NULL
nothing	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
auction	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
thousand	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
everyone	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
badly	NULL
they	NULL
sold	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
probable	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
fetch	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
would	NULL
leave	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
reckoned	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
hundredth	NULL
time	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
sum	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
finish	NULL
the	NULL
curriculum	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
,	NULL
take	NULL
his	NULL
degree	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
live	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
on	NULL
hospital	NULL
appointments	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
sleeping	NULL
restlessly	NULL
:	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
humanity	NULL
left	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
shrivelled	NULL
face	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
queer	NULL
animal	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
how	NULL
easy	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
finish	NULL
that	NULL
useless	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
each	NULL
evening	NULL
when	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Foster	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
the	NULL
medicine	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
easy	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
bottles	NULL
:	NULL
one	NULL
contained	NULL
a	NULL
drug	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
regularly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
an	NULL
opiate	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
grew	NULL
unendurable	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
bed-side	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
generally	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
simple	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
double	NULL
the	NULL
dose	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
die	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
suspect	NULL
anything	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
Doctor	NULL
Wigram	NULL
expected	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
end	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
painless	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
clenched	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
so	NULL
badly	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
more	NULL
months	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
wretched	NULL
life	NULL
could	NULL
matter	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
more	NULL
months	NULL
meant	NULL
everything	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
endurance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
shuddered	NULL
with	NULL
horror	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
quickly	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
which	NULL
obsessed	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
easy	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
desperately	NULL
easy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
feeling	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
selfish	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
selfish	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
who	NULL
adored	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
indifferent	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
charge	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
cruel	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
stupid	NULL
,	NULL
hard	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
eaten	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
sensuality	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
easy	NULL
,	NULL
desperately	NULL
easy	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
dare	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
remorse	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
having	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
regretted	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
himself	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
that	NULL
regret	NULL
was	NULL
futile	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
certain	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
occasionally	NULL
and	NULL
worried	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
conscience	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
uncle	NULL
opened	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
;	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
human	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
frankly	NULL
horrified	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
murder	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
meditating	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
thoughts	NULL
or	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
abnormal	NULL
and	NULL
depraved	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
supposed	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
constantly	NULL
recurring	NULL
:	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
from	NULL
fear	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
uncle	NULL
spoke	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
not	NULL
looking	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
chest	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Good	NULL
heavens	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
'll	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
pass	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
n't	NULL
look	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
profit	NULL
you	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
anxiety	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
tone	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
sent	NULL
a	NULL
pang	NULL
into	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL
strange	NULL
insight	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
led	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
surmise	NULL
what	NULL
strange	NULL
desires	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
hope	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL
live	NULL
for	NULL
another	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
expect	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL

but	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
take	NULL
care	NULL
of	NULL
myself	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
see	NULL
why	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
n't	NULL
last	NULL
another	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
found	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
thinking	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
spoke	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Everyone	NULL
has	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
can	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
distract	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
By	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
you	NULL
never	NULL
hear	NULL
from	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wilkinson	NULL
now	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
this	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL

"	NULL
Really	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

she	NULL
married	NULL
a	NULL
widower	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
they	NULL
're	NULL
quite	NULL
comfortable	NULL

"	NULL

CXI	NULL
Next	NULL
day	NULL
Philip	NULL
began	NULL
work	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
expected	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
weeks	NULL
passed	NULL
into	NULL
months	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
winter	NULL
wore	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
parks	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
bud	NULL
and	NULL
into	NULL
leaf	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
terrible	NULL
lassitude	NULL
settled	NULL
upon	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Time	NULL
was	NULL
passing	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
went	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
heavy	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
youth	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
lost	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
nothing	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
accomplished	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
work	NULL
seemed	NULL
more	NULL
aimless	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
certainty	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
leaving	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
became	NULL
skilful	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
designing	NULL
of	NULL
costumes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
inventive	NULL
faculty	NULL
acquired	NULL
quickness	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
adaptation	NULL
of	NULL
French	NULL
fashions	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
market	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
displeased	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
drawings	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
always	NULL
bungled	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
execution	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
amused	NULL
to	NULL
notice	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
suffered	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
lively	NULL
irritation	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
ideas	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
adequately	NULL
carried	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
warily	NULL
.	NULL

Whenever	NULL
he	NULL
suggested	NULL
something	NULL
original	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Sampson	NULL
turned	NULL
it	NULL
down	NULL
:	NULL
their	NULL
customers	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
anything	NULL
outre	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
respectable	NULL
class	NULL
of	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
connection	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
worth	NULL
while	NULL
taking	NULL
liberties	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
sharply	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
above	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
ideas	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
coincide	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
jolly	NULL
well	NULL
take	NULL
care	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
fine	NULL
young	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
days	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL
find	NULL
yourself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
longed	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
punch	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
nose	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
restrained	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
all	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
possibly	NULL
last	NULL
much	NULL
longer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
people	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
in	NULL
comic	NULL
desperation	NULL
he	NULL
cried	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
iron	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
a	NULL
constitution	NULL
!	NULL

The	NULL
ills	NULL
he	NULL
suffered	NULL
from	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
killed	NULL
any	NULL
decent	NULL
person	NULL
twelve	NULL
months	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
came	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
was	NULL
dying	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
by	NULL
surprise	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
July	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
fortnight	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
holiday	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
received	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Foster	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
give	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
many	NULL
days	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
Philip	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
come	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
buyer	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Sampson	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
decent	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
difficulties	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
said	NULL
good-bye	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
department	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
reason	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
leaving	NULL
had	NULL
spread	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
exaggerated	NULL
form	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
fortune	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Hodges	NULL
had	NULL
tears	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
we	NULL
sha	NULL
n't	NULL
often	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
Lynn	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
strange	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
actually	NULL
sorry	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
these	NULL
people	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
loathed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
drove	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
Harrington	NULL
Street	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
exultation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
anticipated	NULL
the	NULL
emotions	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
experience	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
occasion	NULL
that	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
nothing	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
unconcerned	NULL
as	NULL

He	NULL
reached	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
early	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Foster	NULL
met	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

dead	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
's	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
's	NULL

She	NULL
led	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bed-room	NULL
where	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
lay	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
gave	NULL
Philip	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
trace	NULL
of	NULL
satisfied	NULL
cunning	NULL
at	NULL
having	NULL
circumvented	NULL
his	NULL
enemy	NULL
once	NULL

I	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
exhausted	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
'd	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL

"	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Foster	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
must	NULL
not	NULL
talk	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
tire	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
treated	NULL
him	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
kindly	NULL
despotism	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
childish	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
at	NULL
having	NULL
cheated	NULL
all	NULL
their	NULL
expectations	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
amused	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
brought	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
's	NULL
errand	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
avoid	NULL
another	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
attacks	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
get	NULL
well	NULL
enough	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
attacks	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL
before	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
all	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
constitution	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
strong	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
pretending	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
holiday	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL

Philip	NULL
answered	NULL
cheerfully	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
A	NULL

Presently	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Wigram	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
talked	NULL
with	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
adopted	NULL
an	NULL
appropriate	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

'll	NULL

Philip	NULL

The	NULL
doctor	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
suddenly	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

said	NULL
anything	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
're	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Of	NULL
course	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL

For	NULL
several	NULL
days	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
continued	NULL
without	NULL
change	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
appetite	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
excellent	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
eat	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Wigram	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
hesitate	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
still	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
neuritis	NULL
which	NULL
tormented	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
constant	NULL
shaking	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
palsied	NULL
limbs	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
gradually	NULL
exhausting	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
mind	NULL
remained	NULL
clear	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Foster	NULL
nursed	NULL
him	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
tired	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
many	NULL
months	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
attentive	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
wants	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
sitting	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
patient	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
her	NULL
night	NULL
's	NULL
rest	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
hours	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
arm-chair	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
sleep	NULL
soundly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
read	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
shaded	NULL
candles	NULL
The	NULL
Thousand	NULL
and	NULL
One	NULL
Nights	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
read	NULL
them	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
brought	NULL
back	NULL
his	NULL
childhood	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
effects	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
opiate	NULL
wore	NULL
off	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
grew	NULL
restless	NULL
and	NULL
kept	NULL
him	NULL
constantly	NULL
busy	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
early	NULL
one	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
birds	NULL
were	NULL
chattering	NULL
noisily	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
called	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
ceiling	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
turn	NULL
them	NULL
on	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
sweat	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
forehead	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
towel	NULL
and	NULL
wiped	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
startled	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
was	NULL
suddenly	NULL
changed	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
hoarse	NULL
and	NULL
low	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
would	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
speak	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
cold	NULL
with	NULL
fear	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
d'you	NULL
want	NULL
anything	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pause	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
the	NULL
unseeing	NULL
eyes	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
ceiling	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
a	NULL
twitch	NULL
passed	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
nonsense	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

cried	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Two	NULL
tears	NULL
were	NULL
wrung	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
moved	NULL
Philip	NULL
horribly	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
uncle	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
betrayed	NULL
any	NULL
particular	NULL
emotion	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
affairs	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
dreadful	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
signified	NULL
a	NULL
terror	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
unspeakable	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Send	NULL
for	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Simmonds	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
Communion	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Simmonds	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
curate	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Soon	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
else	NULL
it	NULL
'll	NULL
be	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
awake	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Foster	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
later	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
up	NULL
already	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
the	NULL
gardener	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
message	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Have	NULL
you	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Simmonds	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
sat	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
bed-side	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
occasionally	NULL
wiped	NULL
the	NULL
sweating	NULL
forehead	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
me	NULL
hold	NULL
your	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
said	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
clung	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
comfort	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
extremity	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
really	NULL
loved	NULL
anyone	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
instinctively	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
human	NULL
being	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
hand	NULL
was	NULL
wet	NULL
and	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
grasped	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
with	NULL
feeble	NULL
,	NULL
despairing	NULL
energy	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
fighting	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
through	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

Oh	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
monstrous	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
God	NULL
that	NULL
allowed	NULL
his	NULL
creatures	NULL
to	NULL
suffer	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
cruel	NULL
torture	NULL
!	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
longed	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
death	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
overcome	NULL
the	NULL
compassion	NULL
that	NULL
filled	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
a	NULL
price	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
for	NULL
being	NULL
other	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
beasts	NULL
!	NULL

They	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
broken	NULL
only	NULL
once	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
inquiry	NULL
from	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Has	NULL
n't	NULL
he	NULL
come	NULL
yet	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
the	NULL
housekeeper	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
softly	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Simmonds	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
carried	NULL
a	NULL
bag	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
his	NULL
surplice	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
hood	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Foster	NULL
brought	NULL
the	NULL
communion	NULL
plate	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Simmonds	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
silently	NULL
with	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
professional	NULL
gravity	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sick	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
walked	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
all	NULL
fresh	NULL
and	NULL
dewy	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
birds	NULL
were	NULL
singing	NULL
gaily	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sky	NULL
was	NULL
blue	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
salt-laden	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
sweet	NULL
and	NULL
cool	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
roses	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
full	NULL
bloom	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
green	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lawns	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
eager	NULL
and	NULL
brilliant	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
walked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mystery	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
proceeding	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
bedroom	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
emotion	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Foster	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
curate	NULL
was	NULL
putting	NULL
his	NULL
things	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
bag	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sick	NULL
man	NULL
turned	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
and	NULL
greeted	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
astonished	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
change	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
the	NULL
terror-stricken	NULL
look	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
pinching	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
happy	NULL
and	NULL
serene	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
quite	NULL
prepared	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL

his	NULL

it	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
was	NULL
sincere	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
a	NULL
miracle	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
and	NULL
blood	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
Savior	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
strength	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
feared	NULL
the	NULL
inevitable	NULL
passage	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
resigned	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
only	NULL
said	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
more	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
rejoin	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
startled	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
with	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
callous	NULL
selfishness	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
had	NULL
treated	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
obtuse	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
humble	NULL
,	NULL
devoted	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
curate	NULL
,	NULL
deeply	NULL
moved	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Foster	NULL
,	NULL
weeping	NULL
,	NULL
accompanied	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
,	NULL
exhausted	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
effort	NULL
,	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
doze	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
morning	NULL
wore	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
breathing	NULL
grew	NULL
stertorous	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
doctor	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dying	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
unconscious	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
pecked	NULL
feebly	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sheets	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
restless	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
cried	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Wigram	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
hypodermic	NULL
injection	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
do	NULL
any	NULL
good	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
may	NULL
die	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
moment	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
doctor	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
watch	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
patient	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
o'clock	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Wigram	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
no	NULL
use	NULL
your	NULL
waiting	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
's	NULL
nothing	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Foster	NULL
asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
carpenter	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
the	NULL
undertaker	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
to	NULL
lay	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
want	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
fresh	NULL
air	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
it	NULL
'll	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
undertaker	NULL
lived	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Philip	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
message	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
When	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
die	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
hesitated	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
seem	NULL
brutal	NULL
to	NULL
fetch	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
to	NULL
wash	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
while	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
still	NULL
lived	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
why	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Foster	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
hurry	NULL
to	NULL
kill	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
undertaker	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
oddly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
repeated	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
irritated	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
business	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
When	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
pass	NULL
away	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
first	NULL
impulse	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
seem	NULL
inexplicable	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
sick	NULL
man	NULL
lingered	NULL
for	NULL
several	NULL
hours	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
reddened	NULL
and	NULL
answered	NULL
awkwardly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
exactly	NULL
dead	NULL
yet	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
undertaker	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
perplexity	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
hurried	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Foster	NULL
is	NULL
all	NULL
alone	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
wants	NULL

You	NULL

you	NULL

He	NULL

The	NULL
undertaker	NULL
nodded	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
yes	NULL

I	NULL
see	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
send	NULL
someone	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL

"	NULL

When	NULL
Philip	NULL
got	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bed-room	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Foster	NULL
rose	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
chair	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
bed-side	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
's	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
herself	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
watched	NULL
curiously	NULL
the	NULL
process	NULL
of	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
human	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
unconscious	NULL
being	NULL
that	NULL
struggled	NULL
feebly	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
a	NULL
muttered	NULL
ejaculation	NULL
issued	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
loose	NULL
mouth	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
beat	NULL
down	NULL
hotly	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
cloudless	NULL
sky	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
were	NULL
pleasant	NULL
and	NULL
cool	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lovely	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
bluebottle	NULL
buzzed	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
windowpane	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
loud	NULL
rattle	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
Philip	NULL
start	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
horribly	NULL
frightening	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
movement	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
limbs	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
machine	NULL
had	NULL
run	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bluebottle	NULL
buzzed	NULL
,	NULL
buzzed	NULL
noisily	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
windowpane	NULL
.	NULL

CXII	NULL
Josiah	NULL
Graves	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
masterful	NULL
way	NULL
made	NULL
arrangements	NULL
,	NULL
becoming	NULL
but	NULL
economical	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
funeral	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
vicarage	NULL
with	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
will	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
charge	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
due	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fitness	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
over	NULL
an	NULL
early	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
tea	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
written	NULL
on	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
sheet	NULL
of	NULL
paper	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
everything	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carey	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
nephew	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
furniture	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
eighty	NULL
pounds	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bank	NULL
,	NULL
twenty	NULL
shares	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
A.	NULL
B.	NULL
C.	NULL
company	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
in	NULL
Allsop	NULL
's	NULL
brewery	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Oxford	NULL
music-hall	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
more	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
London	NULL
restaurant	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
bought	NULL
under	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Graves	NULL
'	NULL
direction	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
with	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
people	NULL
must	NULL
eat	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
will	NULL
drink	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
want	NULL
amusement	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
're	NULL
always	NULL
safe	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
put	NULL
your	NULL
money	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
thinks	NULL
necessities	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

His	NULL
words	NULL
showed	NULL
a	NULL
nice	NULL
discrimination	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
grossness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vulgar	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
deplored	NULL
but	NULL
accepted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
finer	NULL
taste	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
elect	NULL
.	NULL

Altogether	NULL
in	NULL
investments	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
five	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
added	NULL
the	NULL
balance	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bank	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
furniture	NULL
would	NULL
fetch	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
riches	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
happy	NULL
but	NULL
infinitely	NULL
relieved	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Graves	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
discussed	NULL
the	NULL
auction	NULL
which	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
held	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
sat	NULL
himself	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
papers	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
deceased	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Rev.	NULL
William	NULL
Carey	NULL
had	NULL
prided	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
never	NULL
destroying	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
piles	NULL
of	NULL
correspondence	NULL
dating	NULL
back	NULL
for	NULL
fifty	NULL
years	NULL
and	NULL
bundles	NULL
upon	NULL
bundles	NULL
of	NULL
neatly	NULL
docketed	NULL
bills	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
kept	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
letters	NULL
addressed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
letters	NULL
which	NULL
himself	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
yellow	NULL
packet	NULL
of	NULL
letters	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
forties	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
Oxford	NULL
undergraduate	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
Germany	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
vacation	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
read	NULL
them	NULL
idly	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
William	NULL
Carey	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
William	NULL
Carey	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
traces	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
acute	NULL
observer	NULL
have	NULL
suggested	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
letters	NULL
were	NULL
formal	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
stilted	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
showed	NULL
himself	NULL
strenuous	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
noteworthy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
described	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
the	NULL
castles	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Rhine	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
falls	NULL
of	NULL
Schaffhausen	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
'	NULL
offer	NULL
reverent	NULL
thanks	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
all-powerful	NULL
Creator	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
universe	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
works	NULL
were	NULL
wondrous	NULL
and	NULL
beautiful	NULL
,	NULL
'	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
'	NULL
this	NULL
handiwork	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
blessed	NULL
Maker	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
moved	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
contemplation	NULL
to	NULL
lead	NULL
pure	NULL
and	NULL
holy	NULL
lives	NULL
.	NULL
'	NULL

Among	NULL
some	NULL
bills	NULL
Philip	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
miniature	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
painted	NULL
of	NULL
William	NULL
Carey	NULL
soon	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ordained	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
represented	NULL
a	NULL
thin	NULL
young	NULL
curate	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
long	NULL
hair	NULL
that	NULL
fell	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
in	NULL
natural	NULL
curls	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
dark	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
large	NULL
and	NULL
dreamy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
pale	NULL
ascetic	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
chuckle	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dozens	NULL
of	NULL
slippers	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
worked	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
adoring	NULL
ladies	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
Philip	NULL
toiled	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
innumerable	NULL
correspondence	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
address	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
signature	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
tore	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL
and	NULL
threw	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
washing-basket	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
upon	NULL
one	NULL
signed	NULL
Helen	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
writing	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
angular	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
began	NULL
:	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
William	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ended	NULL
:	NULL
your	NULL
affectionate	NULL
sister	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
it	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
handwriting	NULL
was	NULL
strange	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
dear	NULL
William	NULL
,	NULL
Stephen	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
thank	NULL
you	NULL
for	NULL
your	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
birth	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL

Now	NULL

I	NULL

honest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Christian	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
guide	NULL
him	NULL
I	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
soldier	NULL
in	NULL
Christ	NULL
's	NULL
Faith	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
God-fearing	NULL
,	NULL
humble	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pious	NULL
.	NULL

Your	NULL
affectionate	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
Helen	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
pushed	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
leaning	NULL
forward	NULL
,	NULL
rested	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
deeply	NULL
touched	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
surprised	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
astonished	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
religious	NULL
tone	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
neither	NULL
mawkish	NULL
nor	NULL
sentimental	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
dead	NULL
now	NULL
for	NULL
nearly	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
beautiful	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
strange	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
simple	NULL
and	NULL
pious	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
read	NULL
again	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
expected	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
very	NULL
differently	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
;	NULL
perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
impulse	NULL
caused	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
tear	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
;	NULL
its	NULL
tenderness	NULL
and	NULL
simplicity	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
seem	NULL
peculiarly	NULL
private	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
indecent	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
reading	NULL
what	NULL
exposed	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
gentle	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
's	NULL
dreary	NULL
correspondence	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
entered	NULL
by	NULL
day	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
of	NULL
St.	NULL
Luke	NULL
's	NULL
Hospital	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
secretary	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Medical	NULL
School	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
curiously	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
doing	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
experiences	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
confidence	NULL
in	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
outlook	NULL
upon	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL
:	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
him	NULL
before	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
coolly	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
deliberate	NULL
vagueness	NULL
which	NULL
prevented	NULL
further	NULL
inquiry	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
private	NULL
affairs	NULL
had	NULL
obliged	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
break	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
curriculum	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
qualify	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
examination	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
take	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
midwifery	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
diseases	NULL
of	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
clerk	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ward	NULL
devoted	NULL
to	NULL
feminine	NULL
ailments	NULL
;	NULL
since	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
holiday	NULL
time	NULL
there	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
getting	NULL
a	NULL
post	NULL
as	NULL
obstetric	NULL
clerk	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
arranged	NULL
to	NULL
undertake	NULL
that	NULL
duty	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
week	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
September	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
this	NULL
interview	NULL
Philip	NULL
walked	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
Medical	NULL
School	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
deserted	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
examinations	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
session	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wandered	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
terrace	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
river-side	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
begin	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
put	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
errors	NULL
,	NULL
follies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
miseries	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
flowing	NULL
river	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
everything	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
passing	NULL
always	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
nothing	NULL
mattered	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
was	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
rich	NULL
with	NULL
possibilities	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
and	NULL
busied	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
settling	NULL
up	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
estate	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
auction	NULL
was	NULL
fixed	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
visitors	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
holidays	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
better	NULL
prices	NULL
.	NULL

Catalogues	NULL
were	NULL
made	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
sent	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
dealers	NULL
in	NULL
second-hand	NULL
books	NULL
at	NULL
Tercanbury	NULL
,	NULL
Maidstone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ashford	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
afternoon	NULL
Philip	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
Tercanbury	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
there	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
relief	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
thenceforward	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
master	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
strange	NULL
to	NULL
wander	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
narrow	NULL
streets	NULL
of	NULL
Tercanbury	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
shops	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
selling	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
things	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
booksellers	NULL
with	NULL
school-books	NULL
,	NULL
pious	NULL
works	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
latest	NULL
novels	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
window	NULL
and	NULL
photographs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Cathedral	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
games	NULL
shop	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
cricket	NULL
bats	NULL
,	NULL
fishing	NULL
tackle	NULL
,	NULL
tennis	NULL
rackets	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
footballs	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
tailor	NULL
from	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
clothes	NULL
all	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
boyhood	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fishmonger	NULL
where	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
Tercanbury	NULL
bought	NULL
fish	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wandered	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
sordid	NULL
street	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
behind	NULL
a	NULL
high	NULL
wall	NULL
,	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
red	NULL
brick	NULL
house	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
preparatory	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

Further	NULL
on	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
gateway	NULL
that	NULL
led	NULL
into	NULL
King	NULL
's	NULL
School	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
quadrangle	NULL
round	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
buildings	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
four	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
were	NULL
hurrying	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
masters	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
gowns	NULL
and	NULL
mortar-boards	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
strange	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
ten	NULL
years	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
and	NULL
many	NULL
changes	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
headmaster	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
slowly	NULL
down	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
schoolhouse	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
big	NULL
boy	NULL
who	NULL
Philip	NULL
supposed	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sixth	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
changed	NULL
,	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
cadaverous	NULL
,	NULL
romantic	NULL
as	NULL
Philip	NULL
remembered	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
wild	NULL
eyes	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
beard	NULL
was	NULL
streaked	NULL
with	NULL
gray	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
sallow	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
deeply	NULL
lined	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
impulse	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
forgotten	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
explaining	NULL
who	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

Boys	NULL
lingered	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
some	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
hurried	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
fives	NULL
;	NULL
others	NULL
straggled	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
twos	NULL
and	NULL
threes	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
gateway	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
cricket	NULL
ground	NULL
;	NULL
others	NULL
again	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
precincts	NULL
to	NULL
bat	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
nets	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
stood	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
stranger	NULL
;	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
indifferent	NULL
glance	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
visitors	NULL
,	NULL
attracted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Norman	NULL
staircase	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
rare	NULL
and	NULL
excited	NULL
little	NULL
attention	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
curiously	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
with	NULL
melancholy	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
that	NULL
separated	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
bitterly	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
little	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
vanished	NULL
beyond	NULL
recall	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
utterly	NULL
wasted	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
fresh	NULL
and	NULL
buoyant	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
doing	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
place	NULL
where	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
by	NULL
name	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
everybody	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
years	NULL
these	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
others	NULL
taking	NULL
their	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
stand	NULL
alien	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
reflection	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
solace	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
merely	NULL
impressed	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
futility	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
existence	NULL
.	NULL

Each	NULL
generation	NULL
repeated	NULL
the	NULL
trivial	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
his	NULL
companions	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
nearly	NULL
thirty	NULL
now	NULL
;	NULL
some	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
others	NULL
were	NULL
married	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
children	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
soldiers	NULL
and	NULL
parsons	NULL
,	NULL
doctors	NULL
,	NULL
lawyers	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
staid	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
youth	NULL
behind	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
made	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
hash	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
devoted	NULL
to	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
funny	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
recall	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
greatest	NULL
friend	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
back	NULL
with	NULL
amusement	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
jealous	NULL
emotions	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
account	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
irritating	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
recollect	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
longed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
those	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
sauntering	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
quadrangle	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
avoiding	NULL
his	NULL
mistakes	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
start	NULL
fresh	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
something	NULL
more	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
an	NULL
intolerable	NULL
loneliness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
almost	NULL
regretted	NULL
the	NULL
penury	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
desperate	NULL
struggle	NULL
merely	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
body	NULL
and	NULL
soul	NULL
together	NULL
had	NULL
deadened	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
of	NULL
living	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
sweat	NULL
of	NULL
thy	NULL
brow	NULL
shalt	NULL
thou	NULL
earn	NULL
thy	NULL
daily	NULL
bread	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
curse	NULL
upon	NULL
mankind	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
balm	NULL
which	NULL
reconciled	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
existence	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
impatient	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
to	NULL
mind	NULL
his	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pattern	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
unhappiness	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
decoration	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
elaborate	NULL
and	NULL
beautiful	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
himself	NULL
strenuously	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
accept	NULL
with	NULL
gaiety	NULL
everything	NULL
,	NULL
dreariness	NULL
and	NULL
excitement	NULL
,	NULL
pleasure	NULL
and	NULL
pain	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
richness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
design	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sought	NULL
for	NULL
beauty	NULL
consciously	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
how	NULL
even	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Gothic	NULL
cathedral	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
precincts	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
there	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
massive	NULL
pile	NULL
,	NULL
gray	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
cloudy	NULL
sky	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
central	NULL
tower	NULL
that	NULL
rose	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
praise	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
God	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
were	NULL
batting	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
nets	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
lissom	NULL
and	NULL
strong	NULL
and	NULL
active	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
hearing	NULL
their	NULL
shouts	NULL
and	NULL
laughter	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
cry	NULL
of	NULL
youth	NULL
was	NULL
insistent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
thing	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
only	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

CXIII	NULL
At	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
week	NULL
in	NULL
August	NULL
Philip	NULL
entered	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
duties	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
district	NULL
.	NULL
'	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
arduous	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
attend	NULL
on	NULL
an	NULL
average	NULL
three	NULL
confinements	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
patient	NULL
had	NULL
obtained	NULL
a	NULL
'	NULL
card	NULL
'	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
before	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
her	NULL
time	NULL
came	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
porter	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
messenger	NULL
,	NULL
generally	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
sent	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
lodged	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
night	NULL
the	NULL
porter	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
latch-key	NULL
,	NULL
himself	NULL
came	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
awoke	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
mysterious	NULL
then	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
and	NULL
walk	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
deserted	NULL
streets	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
South	NULL
Side	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
those	NULL
hours	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
generally	NULL
the	NULL
husband	NULL
who	NULL
brought	NULL
the	NULL
card	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
babies	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
part	NULL
with	NULL
surly	NULL
indifference	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
newly	NULL
married	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
nervous	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
sometimes	NULL
strove	NULL
to	NULL
allay	NULL
his	NULL
anxiety	NULL
by	NULL
getting	NULL
drunk	NULL
.	NULL

Often	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
Philip	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
messenger	NULL
discussed	NULL
the	NULL
conditions	NULL
of	NULL
labour	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
cost	NULL
of	NULL
living	NULL
;	NULL
Philip	NULL
learnt	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
trades	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
practised	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
inspired	NULL
confidence	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
among	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thrown	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
hours	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
stuffy	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
labour	NULL
lying	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
bed	NULL
that	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
midwife	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
naturally	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
circumstances	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
had	NULL
taught	NULL
him	NULL
several	NULL
things	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
amused	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
impressed	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
deceived	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
little	NULL
subterfuges	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gentle	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
lose	NULL
his	NULL
temper	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
pleased	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
above	NULL
drinking	NULL
a	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
tea	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
dawn	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
waiting	NULL
they	NULL
offered	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
slice	NULL
of	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
dripping	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
squeamish	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
eat	NULL
most	NULL
things	NULL
now	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
appetite	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
houses	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
filthy	NULL
courts	NULL
off	NULL
a	NULL
dingy	NULL
street	NULL
,	NULL
huddled	NULL
against	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
without	NULL
light	NULL
or	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
merely	NULL
squalid	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
unexpectedly	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
dilapidated	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
worm-eaten	NULL
floors	NULL
and	NULL
leaking	NULL
roofs	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
grand	NULL
air	NULL
:	NULL
you	NULL
found	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
oak	NULL
balusters	NULL
exquisitely	NULL
carved	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL
had	NULL
still	NULL
their	NULL
panelling	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
were	NULL
thickly	NULL
inhabited	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
family	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
each	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
daytime	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
incessant	NULL
noise	NULL
of	NULL
children	NULL
playing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
court	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
walls	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
breeding-place	NULL
of	NULL
vermin	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
foul	NULL
that	NULL
often	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
sick	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
light	NULL
his	NULL
pipe	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
dwelt	NULL
here	NULL
lived	NULL
from	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
mouth	NULL
.	NULL

Babies	NULL
were	NULL
unwelcome	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
received	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
surly	NULL
anger	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
mother	NULL
with	NULL
despair	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
more	NULL
mouth	NULL
to	NULL
feed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
enough	NULL
wherewith	NULL
to	NULL
feed	NULL
those	NULL
already	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
often	NULL
discerned	NULL
the	NULL
wish	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
born	NULL
dead	NULL
or	NULL
might	NULL
die	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
delivered	NULL
one	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
twins	NULL
(	NULL
a	NULL
source	NULL
of	NULL
humour	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
facetious	NULL
)	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
told	NULL
she	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
shrill	NULL
wail	NULL
of	NULL
misery	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
mother	NULL
said	NULL
outright	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
they	NULL
're	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
feed	NULL
'em	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Maybe	NULL
the	NULL
Lord	NULL
'll	NULL
see	NULL
fit	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
'em	NULL
to	NULL
'	NULL
imself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
midwife	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
caught	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
tiny	NULL
pair	NULL
lying	NULL
side	NULL
by	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
ferocious	NULL
sullenness	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
which	NULL
startled	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
assembled	NULL
there	NULL
a	NULL
hideous	NULL
resentment	NULL
against	NULL
those	NULL
poor	NULL
atoms	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
unwished	NULL
for	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
suspicion	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
firmly	NULL
an	NULL
'	NULL
accident	NULL
'	NULL
would	NULL
occur	NULL
.	NULL

Accidents	NULL
occurred	NULL
often	NULL
;	NULL
mothers	NULL
'	NULL
overlay	NULL
'	NULL
their	NULL
babies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
errors	NULL
of	NULL
diet	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
carelessness	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
come	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
warn	NULL
you	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
anything	NULL
happens	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
there	NULL
'll	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
an	NULL
inquest	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
father	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
reply	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
Philip	NULL
a	NULL
scowl	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
murder	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Bless	NULL
their	NULL
little	NULL
'	NULL
earts	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
grandmother	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
what	NULL
should	NULL
'	NULL
appen	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
great	NULL
difficulty	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
the	NULL
mothers	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
for	NULL
ten	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
minimum	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
practice	NULL
insisted	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
awkward	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
without	NULL
payment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
husband	NULL
tumbled	NULL
because	NULL
his	NULL
tea	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
right	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
home	NULL
tired	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
and	NULL
hungry	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
helped	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
woman	NULL
after	NULL
woman	NULL
complained	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
anyone	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
clean	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
's	NULL
dinner	NULL
without	NULL
paying	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
service	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
afford	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
talked	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
chance	NULL
remarks	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
deduce	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
unsaid	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
learned	NULL
how	NULL
little	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
common	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
classes	NULL
above	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
envy	NULL
their	NULL
betters	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
different	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
ideal	NULL
of	NULL
ease	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
existence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
middle-classes	NULL
seem	NULL
formal	NULL
and	NULL
stiff	NULL
;	NULL
moreover	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
contempt	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
soft	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
work	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
proud	NULL
merely	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
left	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
majority	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
well-to-do	NULL
as	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
exploited	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
such	NULL
advantages	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
charitable	NULL
put	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
disposal	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
accepted	NULL
benefits	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
which	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
folly	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
superiors	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
astuteness	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
bore	NULL
the	NULL
curate	NULL
with	NULL
contemptuous	NULL
indifference	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
district	NULL
visitor	NULL
excited	NULL
their	NULL
bitter	NULL
hatred	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
opened	NULL
your	NULL
windows	NULL
without	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL

Philip	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
tragedy	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
to	NULL
these	NULL
people	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
separation	NULL
or	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
grief	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
assuaged	NULL
with	NULL
tears	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
come	NULL
home	NULL
one	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
confinement	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
dismissed	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
builder	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
slack	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
stated	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
tea	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
Jim	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
man	NULL
ate	NULL
stolidly	NULL
some	NULL
mess	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
stewing	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sauce-pan	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
coming	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
plate	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
little	NULL
startled	NULL
glances	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
quite	NULL
silently	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
builder	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
uncouth	NULL
little	NULL
fellow	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
rough	NULL
,	NULL
weather-beaten	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
white	NULL
scar	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
forehead	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
large	NULL
,	NULL
stubbly	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
he	NULL
pushed	NULL
aside	NULL
his	NULL
plate	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
effort	NULL
to	NULL
force	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
a	NULL
fixed	NULL
gaze	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
saw	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
sullen	NULL
clouds	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
silence	NULL
seemed	NULL
heavy	NULL
with	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
go	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
away	NULL
wearily	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
up	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
rage	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
cruelty	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
hopelessness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
search	NULL
for	NULL
work	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
desolation	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
harder	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
than	NULL
hunger	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
thankful	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
then	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
condition	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
intolerable	NULL
;	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
reconcile	NULL
oneself	NULL
to	NULL
existence	NULL
only	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
meaningless	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
spent	NULL
their	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
helping	NULL
the	NULL
poorer	NULL
classes	NULL
erred	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
sought	NULL
to	NULL
remedy	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
harass	NULL
them	NULL
if	NULL
themselves	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
endure	NULL
them	NULL
without	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
disturb	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
poor	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
large	NULL
airy	NULL
rooms	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
suffered	NULL
from	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
food	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
nourishing	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
circulation	NULL
bad	NULL
;	NULL
space	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
chilliness	NULL
,	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
address	NULL
,	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
was	NULL
familiar	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
told	NULL
the	NULL
porter	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL

his	NULL

He	NULL
dressed	NULL

in	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
black	NULL
bag	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL

stepped	NULL
into	NULL

A	NULL

whom	NULL
he	NULL

came	NULL
up	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
true	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
black	NULL
bag	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
passport	NULL
through	NULL
wretched	NULL
alleys	NULL

down	NULL
foul-smelling	NULL
courts	NULL

a	NULL

Philip	NULL
curiously	NULL

Philip	NULL

not	NULL

he	NULL

Sixteen	NULL
shillings	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
and	NULL
child	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
room	NULL
the	NULL
couple	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
showed	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
poverty	NULL
was	NULL
extreme	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fair	NULL
size	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
looked	NULL
quite	NULL
large	NULL

since	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
hardly	NULL
any	NULL
furniture	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL

there	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
pictures	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL

and	NULL
most	NULL
rooms	NULL
had	NULL
something	NULL

the	NULL
Christmas	NULL
numbers	NULL

The	NULL
patient	NULL
lay	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
iron	NULL
bed	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cheapest	NULL
sort	NULL

It	NULL
startled	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
young	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
By	NULL
Jove	NULL

she	NULL

he	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
'	NULL

She	NULL

her	NULL

the	NULL
card	NULL

when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
young	NULL
they	NULL
often	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL

two	NULL

Also	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
pretty	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
rare	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL

in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
delicate	NULL

eyes	NULL

a	NULL

Philip	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
better	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
again	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
boyish	NULL
air	NULL
:	NULL
you	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
larking	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
lads	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
waiting	NULL
anxiously	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
birth	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL

The	NULL
hours	NULL
passed	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
till	NULL
nearly	NULL
two	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL

born	NULL

Everything	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
going	NULL
satisfactorily	NULL

the	NULL
husband	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
in	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
touched	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
awkward	NULL

shy	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL

Philip	NULL
packed	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
things	NULL

felt	NULL

looked	NULL

the	NULL
'	NULL

in	NULL
his	NULL

Philip	NULL
scribbled	NULL
a	NULL
note	NULL

and	NULL
giving	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
husband	NULL

told	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL

bade	NULL
him	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL

The	NULL
man	NULL
set	NULL
off	NULL

Philip	NULL
waited	NULL
anxiously	NULL

he	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
was	NULL
bleeding	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL

die	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
chief	NULL
arrived	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
what	NULL
steps	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL

He	NULL
hoped	NULL
fervently	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
S.	NULL
O.	NULL
C.	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
called	NULL
elsewhere	NULL

The	NULL
minutes	NULL
were	NULL
interminable	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL

and	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
examined	NULL
the	NULL
patient	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
voice	NULL
asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
questions	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
very	NULL
grave	NULL

His	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
Chandler	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
few	NULL
words	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
nose	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
thin	NULL
face	NULL
much	NULL
lined	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
age	NULL

He	NULL
shook	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
step	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
flight	NULL
that	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
's	NULL

The	NULL
S.	NULL

hesitated	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
painful	NULL

forced	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
brusque	NULL

She	NULL
's	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
man	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
a	NULL

he	NULL
stopped	NULL
quite	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL

who	NULL
lay	NULL

pale	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL

gradually	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
seemed	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
the	NULL
dawn	NULL

the	NULL
dawn	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL

Chandler	NULL
was	NULL
keeping	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
alive	NULL
by	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
means	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
power	NULL

but	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
slipping	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
suddenly	NULL
she	NULL
died	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL

stood	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cheap	NULL
iron	NULL

with	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
resting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
rail	NULL

he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
very	NULL
pale	NULL
and	NULL
once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
Chandler	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
uneasy	NULL
glance	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
faint	NULL
:	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
were	NULL
gray	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
midwife	NULL
sobbed	NULL
noisily	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
fixed	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL

and	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL

reminded	NULL

When	NULL

very	NULL
hot	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
morning	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
balminess	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
street	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
need	NULL
not	NULL
hurry	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
strolled	NULL
along	NULL
,	NULL
glad	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fresh	NULL
air	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bridge	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
day	NULL
break	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
policeman	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
bade	NULL
him	NULL
good-morning	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
who	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
bag	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Out	NULL
late	NULL
tonight	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
nodded	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
leaned	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
parapet	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
hour	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
city	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
city	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sky	NULL
was	NULL
cloudless	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
stars	NULL
were	NULL
dim	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
approach	NULL
of	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
mist	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
buildings	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
north	NULL
side	NULL
were	NULL
like	NULL
palaces	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
enchanted	NULL
island	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
barges	NULL
was	NULL
moored	NULL
in	NULL
midstream	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
unearthly	NULL
violet	NULL
,	NULL
troubling	NULL
somehow	NULL
and	NULL
awe-inspiring	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
quickly	NULL
everything	NULL
grew	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gray	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
rose	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
ray	NULL
of	NULL
yellow	NULL
gold	NULL
stole	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
was	NULL
iridescent	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
girl	NULL
lying	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
wan	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
who	NULL
stood	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
stricken	NULL
beast	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bareness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
squalid	NULL
room	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
more	NULL
poignant	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
cruel	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
stupid	NULL
chance	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
entering	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
saying	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
store	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
bearing	NULL
of	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
dreary	NULL
fight	NULL
with	NULL
poverty	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
youth	NULL
broken	NULL
by	NULL
toil	NULL
and	NULL
deprivation	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
slatternly	NULL
middle	NULL
age	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
pretty	NULL
face	NULL
grow	NULL
thin	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
hair	NULL
grow	NULL
scanty	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
pretty	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
worn	NULL
down	NULL
brutally	NULL
by	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
become	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
claws	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
animal	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
past	NULL
his	NULL
prime	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
difficulty	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
jobs	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
wages	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
inevitable	NULL
,	NULL
abject	NULL
penury	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
energetic	NULL
,	NULL
thrifty	NULL
,	NULL
industrious	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
saved	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
workhouse	NULL
or	NULL
subsistence	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
charity	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
could	NULL
pity	NULL
her	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
when	NULL
life	NULL
offered	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
?	NULL

But	NULL
pity	NULL
was	NULL
inane	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
these	NULL
people	NULL
needed	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
pity	NULL
themselves	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
accepted	NULL
their	NULL
fate	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
natural	NULL
order	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

Otherwise	NULL
,	NULL
good	NULL
heavens	NULL
!	NULL

otherwise	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
swarm	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
multitude	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
where	NULL
those	NULL
great	NULL
buildings	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
secure	NULL
and	NULL
stately	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
pillage	NULL
,	NULL
burn	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sack	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
tender	NULL
and	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
broken	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
mist	NULL
was	NULL
tenuous	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
bathed	NULL
everything	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
soft	NULL
radiance	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Thames	NULL
was	NULL
gray	NULL
,	NULL
rosy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
green	NULL
;	NULL
gray	NULL
like	NULL
mother-of-pearl	NULL
and	NULL
green	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
yellow	NULL
rose	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wharfs	NULL
and	NULL
store-houses	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Surrey	NULL
Side	NULL
were	NULL
massed	NULL
in	NULL
disorderly	NULL
loveliness	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
scene	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
exquisite	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
passionately	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
overwhelmed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

Beside	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

CXV	NULL
Philip	NULL
spent	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
that	NULL
remained	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
session	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
out-patients	NULL
'	NULL
department	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
October	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
regular	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
very	NULL
largely	NULL
among	NULL
new	NULL
people	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
different	NULL
years	NULL
had	NULL
little	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
contemporaries	NULL
were	NULL
now	NULL
mostly	NULL
qualified	NULL
:	NULL
some	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
up	NULL
assistantships	NULL
or	NULL
posts	NULL
in	NULL
country	NULL
hospitals	NULL
and	NULL
infirmaries	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
held	NULL
appointments	NULL
at	NULL
St.	NULL
Luke	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
had	NULL
lain	NULL
fallow	NULL
had	NULL
refreshed	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
fancied	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
with	NULL
energy	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Athelnys	NULL
were	NULL
delighted	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
fortune	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
kept	NULL
aside	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
things	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
sale	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
effects	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
presents	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
gave	NULL
Sally	NULL
a	NULL
gold	NULL
chain	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
belonged	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
grown	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
apprenticed	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
dressmaker	NULL
and	NULL
set	NULL
out	NULL
every	NULL
morning	NULL
at	NULL
eight	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
shop	NULL
in	NULL
Regent	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
had	NULL
frank	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
broad	NULL
brow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
plentiful	NULL
shining	NULL
hair	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
buxom	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
broad	NULL
hips	NULL
and	NULL
full	NULL
breasts	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
discussing	NULL
her	NULL
appearance	NULL
,	NULL
warned	NULL
her	NULL
constantly	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
not	NULL
grow	NULL
fat	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
attracted	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
healthy	NULL
,	NULL
animal	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
feminine	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
many	NULL
admirers	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
unmoved	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
one	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
love-making	NULL
as	NULL
nonsense	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
that	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
unapproachable	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
was	NULL
old	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
years	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
household	NULL
work	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
care	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
acquired	NULL
a	NULL
managing	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
Sally	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
too	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
things	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
grew	NULL
older	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
acquiring	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
humour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
uttered	NULL
a	NULL
remark	NULL
which	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
beneath	NULL
her	NULL
impassive	NULL
exterior	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
quietly	NULL
bubbling	NULL
with	NULL
amusement	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
fellow-creatures	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
terms	NULL
of	NULL
affectionate	NULL
intimacy	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
Athelny	NULL
's	NULL
huge	NULL
family	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
her	NULL
indifference	NULL
slightly	NULL
irritated	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
enigmatic	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Philip	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
necklace	NULL
Athelny	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
boisterous	NULL
way	NULL
insisted	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
kiss	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Sally	NULL
reddened	NULL
and	NULL
drew	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ungrateful	NULL
hussy	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

cried	NULL
Athelny	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
not	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
being	NULL
kissed	NULL
by	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
embarrassment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
amused	NULL
,	NULL
turned	NULL
Athelny	NULL
's	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
something	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
difficult	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
evidently	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
next	NULL
time	NULL
Philip	NULL
came	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
alone	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
minutes	NULL
to	NULL
refer	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
last	NULL
week	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
kiss	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
laughed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
not	NULL
because	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
grateful	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
blushed	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
uttered	NULL
the	NULL
formal	NULL
phrase	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
prepared	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
always	NULL
value	NULL
the	NULL
necklace	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
it	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
always	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
very	NULL
competently	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
no	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
conversation	NULL
;	NULL
yet	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
unsociable	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
Sunday	NULL
afternoon	NULL
when	NULL
Athelny	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
treated	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
sat	NULL
reading	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
parlour	NULL
,	NULL
Sally	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
to	NULL
sew	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girls	NULL
'	NULL
clothes	NULL
were	NULL
made	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
Sally	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
afford	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
Sundays	NULL
in	NULL
idleness	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
book	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Go	NULL
on	NULL
reading	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
only	NULL
thought	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
alone	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
sit	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
silent	NULL
person	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
ever	NULL
struck	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
another	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
's	NULL
talkative	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
irony	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
tone	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
merely	NULL
stating	NULL
a	NULL
fact	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
suggested	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
measured	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
alas	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
the	NULL
hero	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
childhood	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
joined	NULL
together	NULL
his	NULL
entertaining	NULL
conversation	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
thriftlessness	NULL
which	NULL
often	NULL
brought	NULL
difficulties	NULL
into	NULL
their	NULL
life	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
compared	NULL
his	NULL
rhetoric	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
practical	NULL
common	NULL
sense	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
liveliness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
amused	NULL
her	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
sometimes	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
impatient	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
bent	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
healthy	NULL
,	NULL
strong	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
normal	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
odd	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
girls	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
flat	NULL
chests	NULL
and	NULL
anaemic	NULL
faces	NULL
.	NULL

Mildred	NULL
suffered	NULL
from	NULL
anaemia	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
it	NULL
appeared	NULL
that	NULL
Sally	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
suitor	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
occasionally	NULL
with	NULL
friends	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
work-room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
electrical	NULL
engineer	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL

One	NULL

she	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL

asked	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL

She	NULL
paused	NULL
a	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
on	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
occasion	NULL
that	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
Athelny	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
rehearsed	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
play	NULL
the	NULL
heavy	NULL

he	NULL
reduced	NULL
his	NULL

Just	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
due	NULL
Athelny	NULL
routed	NULL
out	NULL
an	NULL
Egyptian	NULL

insisted	NULL
on	NULL
putting	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL

"	NULL
Go	NULL

Athelny	NULL

said	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL

which	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

She	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
pull	NULL
it	NULL
off	NULL

the	NULL
little	NULL
man	NULL
skipped	NULL
nimbly	NULL
out	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
severe	NULL
ordeal	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
exposed	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
Athelny	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
brown	NULL
velvet	NULL
jacket	NULL
,	NULL
flowing	NULL
black	NULL
tie	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
red	NULL
tarboosh	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
startling	NULL
spectacle	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
innocent	NULL
electrical	NULL
engineer	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
greeted	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
host	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
proud	NULL
courtesy	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Spanish	NULL
grandee	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
altogether	NULL
homely	NULL
and	NULL
natural	NULL
fashion	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
ironing-table	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
high-backed	NULL
monkish	NULL
chairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
poured	NULL
tea	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
lustre	NULL
teapot	NULL
which	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
note	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
country-side	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
festivity	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
little	NULL
cakes	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
was	NULL
home-made	NULL
jam	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
farm-house	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
very	NULL
quaint	NULL
and	NULL
charming	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
Jacobean	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

Athelny	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
fantastic	NULL
reason	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
to	NULL
discourse	NULL
upon	NULL
Byzantine	NULL
history	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
reading	NULL
the	NULL
later	NULL
volumes	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Decline	NULL
and	NULL
Fall	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
forefinger	NULL
dramatically	NULL
extended	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
poured	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
astonished	NULL
ears	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
suitor	NULL
scandalous	NULL
stories	NULL
about	NULL
Theodora	NULL
and	NULL
Irene	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
addressed	NULL
himself	NULL
directly	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
guest	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
torrent	NULL
of	NULL
rhodomontade	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
reduced	NULL
to	NULL
helpless	NULL
silence	NULL
and	NULL
shy	NULL
,	NULL
nodded	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
at	NULL
intervals	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
an	NULL
intelligent	NULL
interest	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
paid	NULL
no	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
Thorpe	NULL
's	NULL
conversation	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
interrupted	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
more	NULL
tea	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
press	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
cake	NULL
and	NULL
jam	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
watched	NULL
Sally	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
downcast	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
calm	NULL
,	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
observant	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
long	NULL
eye-lashes	NULL
cast	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
shadow	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
cheek	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
amused	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
or	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
inscrutable	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
certain	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
electrical	NULL
engineer	NULL
was	NULL
good-looking	NULL
,	NULL
fair	NULL
and	NULL
clean-shaven	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
pleasant	NULL
,	NULL
regular	NULL
features	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
honest	NULL
face	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
tall	NULL
and	NULL
well-made	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
thinking	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
mate	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
pang	NULL
of	NULL
envy	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
happiness	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
fancied	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
store	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
the	NULL
suitor	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
along	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
rose	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
and	NULL
accompanied	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
burst	NULL
out	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
Sally	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
think	NULL
your	NULL

are	NULL
prepared	NULL

welcome	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL

Sally	NULL
set	NULL
about	NULL
clearing	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
tea-things	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
she	NULL
shot	NULL
a	NULL
swift	NULL
glance	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL

Mr.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
him	NULL
Uncle	NULL
Phil	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
children	NULL
did	NULL

and	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
call	NULL
him	NULL
Philip	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
you	NULL
'd	NULL
make	NULL
an	NULL
awfully	NULL
handsome	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
quickly	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
blush	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
him	NULL

very	NULL
nice	NULL

said	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL

Sally	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
reply	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
curiously	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
meditating	NULL
upon	NULL
what	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL

"	NULL

n't	NULL
you	NULL

remarked	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL

a	NULL
little	NULL
irritably	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
clear	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
refer	NULL
so	NULL
directly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
difficulties	NULL

life	NULL

saw	NULL
how	NULL

provided	NULL

Philip	NULL
caught	NULL
Sally	NULL
's	NULL
eye	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
glimmer	NULL
of	NULL
amusement	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
to	NULL
touch	NULL
her	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
humour	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
odd	NULL
girl	NULL

CXVI	NULL
During	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
year	NULL
at	NULL
St.	NULL
Luke	NULL
's	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
hard	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
contented	NULL
with	NULL
life	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
comfortable	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
heart-free	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
enough	NULL
money	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
needs	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
people	NULL
speak	NULL
contemptuously	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
without	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
lack	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
petty	NULL
,	NULL
mean	NULL
,	NULL
grasping	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
distorted	NULL
his	NULL
character	NULL
and	NULL
caused	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
view	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
vulgar	NULL
angle	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
consider	NULL
every	NULL
penny	NULL

money	NULL
became	NULL
of	NULL
grotesque	NULL
importance	NULL

you	NULL
needed	NULL
a	NULL

rate	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
proper	NULL
value	NULL

He	NULL
lived	NULL
a	NULL
solitary	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
Athelnys	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
lonely	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
busied	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
plans	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL

and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
recollection	NULL
dwelt	NULL
now	NULL

then	NULL
on	NULL
old	NULL
friends	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
effort	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL

know	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL

of	NULL
Norah	NULL
Nesbit	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
Norah	NULL
something	NULL

One	NULL
evening	NULL
about	NULL
half	NULL
past	NULL
eleven	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
Lawson	NULL
,	NULL
walking	NULL
along	NULL
Piccadilly	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
evening	NULL
clothes	NULL

might	NULL
be	NULL
supposed	NULL

be	NULL
coming	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
theatre	NULL

Philip	NULL
gave	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
impulse	NULL
and	NULL
quickly	NULL
turned	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
side	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL

felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
now	NULL
take	NULL
up	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
interrupted	NULL

He	NULL

Lawson	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL

one	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL

to	NULL
him	NULL

beauty	NULL

greater	NULL
force	NULL
than	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL

but	NULL
art	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
unimportant	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL

forming	NULL

out	NULL

the	NULL
manifold	NULL
chaos	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL

the	NULL
materials	NULL

very	NULL
trivial	NULL

Lawson	NULL
had	NULL
served	NULL
his	NULL

Philip	NULL

merely	NULL
sentimental	NULL
to	NULL
ignore	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
painter	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
interest	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
avoided	NULL
deliberately	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
occasionally	NULL
some	NULL
feeling	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
curiosity	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
something	NULL
deeper	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
acknowledge	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
wander	NULL
about	NULL
Piccadilly	NULL
and	NULL
Regent	NULL
Street	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
hours	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
then	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
or	NULL
dreaded	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
back	NULL
which	NULL
reminded	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
sensation	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
sharp	NULL
pain	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
fear	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
sickening	NULL
dismay	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
hurried	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
mistaken	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
relief	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
experienced	NULL
or	NULL
disappointment	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
Philip	NULL
passed	NULL
his	NULL
surgery	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
examination	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
received	NULL
his	NULL
diploma	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
seven	NULL
years	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
entered	NULL
St.	NULL
Luke	NULL
's	NULL
Hospital	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
thirty	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Royal	NULL
College	NULL
of	NULL
Surgeons	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
roll	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
which	NULL
qualified	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
practice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
with	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
really	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
secretary	NULL
's	NULL
office	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
down	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
appointments	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
secretary	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
little	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
beard	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
found	NULL
very	NULL
affable	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
congratulated	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
success	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL

Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
secretary	NULL
's	NULL
manner	NULL
that	NULL
puzzled	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
doubtful	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
crab	NULL
in	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
secretary	NULL
hesitated	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
and	NULL
laughed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
conciliating	NULL
fashion	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

the	NULL
fact	NULL

speaks	NULL

very	NULL
openly	NULL

n't	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
d'you	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
'll	NULL
be	NULL
satisfied	NULL
with	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
ought	NULL

be	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
secretary	NULL
diplomatically	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chance	NULL
to	NULL
earn	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
aside	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
holiday	NULL
in	NULL
Spain	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
promised	NULL
himself	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
his	NULL
appointment	NULL
at	NULL
St.	NULL
Luke	NULL
's	NULL
or	NULL

if	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
anything	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
hospital	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL

If	NULL

Philip	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
the	NULL
Athelnys	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
(	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
them	NULL
his	NULL
good	NULL
news	NULL
)	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
start	NULL
immediately	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
little	NULL
luggage	NULL
to	NULL
pack	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
after	NULL
seven	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
at	NULL
Farnley	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
cab	NULL
to	NULL
Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
broad	NULL
low	NULL
stucco	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
Virginia	NULL
creeper	NULL
growing	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
shown	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
consulting-room	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
writing	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
desk	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
ushered	NULL
Philip	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
merely	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
aback	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
expecting	NULL
me	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL

I	NULL
kept	NULL

half	NULL
an	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
amused	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
odd	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
middle	NULL
height	NULL
,	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
white	NULL
hair	NULL
cut	NULL
very	NULL
short	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
mouth	NULL
closed	NULL
so	NULL
tightly	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
lips	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
clean-shaven	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
small	NULL
white	NULL
whiskers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
increased	NULL
the	NULL
squareness	NULL
of	NULL
face	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
firm	NULL
jaw	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
brown	NULL
tweed	NULL
suit	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
stock	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
clothes	NULL
hung	NULL
loosely	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
larger	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
respectable	NULL
farmer	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
nineteenth	NULL
century	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
pointing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
opposite	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

when	NULL

're	NULL

"	NULL

During	NULL
dinner	NULL
Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
was	NULL
examining	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
his	NULL
assistant	NULL
talk	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
When	NULL
were	NULL
you	NULL
qualified	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
suddenly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yesterday	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Were	NULL
you	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
university	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Last	NULL

when	NULL
my	NULL
assistant	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
holiday	NULL
they	NULL
sent	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL

Varsity	NULL

I	NULL
told	NULL
'em	NULL

it	NULL
again	NULL

Too	NULL
damned	NULL

for	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
another	NULL
pause	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dinner	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
simple	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
preserved	NULL
a	NULL
sedate	NULL
exterior	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
bubbling	NULL
over	NULL
with	NULL
excitement	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
immensely	NULL
elated	NULL
at	NULL
being	NULL
engaged	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
locum	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
extremely	NULL
grown	NULL
up	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
insane	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
laugh	NULL
at	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
particular	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
professional	NULL
dignity	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
chuckle	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
broke	NULL
suddenly	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
old	NULL
are	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Poverty	NULL

"	NULL

Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
odd	NULL
look	NULL
and	NULL
relapsed	NULL
into	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
dinner	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
D'you	NULL

of	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

"	NULL
answered	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mostly	NULL
fishermen	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
Union	NULL

I	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
rivalry	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sore	NULL
point	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
none	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
without	NULL
another	NULL
word	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
Philip	NULL
by	NULL
himself	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
clear	NULL
away	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL

seven	NULL

Philip	NULL
fetched	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
lit	NULL
his	NULL
pipe	NULL

and	NULL
settled	NULL
himself	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL

nothing	NULL

At	NULL
ten	NULL

Doctor	NULL

came	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL

Philip	NULL
hated	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
up	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
dragged	NULL
up	NULL

them	NULL

"	NULL

Doctor	NULL

The	NULL

were	NULL
sent	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
knew	NULL
only	NULL

they	NULL
came	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
unconcealed	NULL
scorn	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL

which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
absorbed	NULL

they	NULL

seen	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL

cases	NULL

appeared	NULL
in	NULL

were	NULL
helpless	NULL
when	NULL
consulted	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
knowledge	NULL
was	NULL
theoretical	NULL

their	NULL
self-assurance	NULL
unbounded	NULL

Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
watched	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
tightened	NULL
lips	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
savage	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
showing	NULL
them	NULL
how	NULL
great	NULL
was	NULL
their	NULL
ignorance	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
unjustified	NULL
their	NULL
conceit	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
practice	NULL

of	NULL
fishing	NULL
folk	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL

Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
asked	NULL
his	NULL

how	NULL
he	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
both	NULL
ends	NULL

He	NULL
complained	NULL
too	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
medical	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
uneducated	NULL

their	NULL
reading	NULL
consisted	NULL

For	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
watched	NULL
Philip	NULL
closely	NULL
,	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
fall	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
acid	NULL
sarcasm	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
amusement	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
pleased	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
occupation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
liked	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
independence	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
responsibility	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
people	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
consulting-room	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
gratified	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
inspire	NULL
his	NULL
patients	NULL
with	NULL
confidence	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
entertaining	NULL
to	NULL
watch	NULL
the	NULL
process	NULL
of	NULL
cure	NULL
which	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
hospital	NULL
necessarily	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
watched	NULL
only	NULL
at	NULL
distant	NULL
intervals	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
rounds	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
low-roofed	NULL
cottages	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
fishing	NULL
tackle	NULL
and	NULL
sails	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
mementoes	NULL
of	NULL
deep-sea	NULL
travelling	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
lacquer	NULL
box	NULL
from	NULL
Japan	NULL
,	NULL
spears	NULL
and	NULL
oars	NULL
from	NULL
Melanesia	NULL

or	NULL
daggers	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
bazaars	NULL

Stamboul	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
romance	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
stuffy	NULL
little	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
salt	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
bitter	NULL
freshness	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sailor-men	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
supercilious	NULL
they	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
long	NULL
yarns	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
distant	NULL
journeys	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
youth	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
mistake	NULL
in	NULL
diagnosis	NULL
:	NULL
(	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
measles	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
confronted	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
rash	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
obscure	NULL
disease	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
skin	NULL
;)	NULL
and	NULL
once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
his	NULL
ideas	NULL
of	NULL
treatment	NULL
differed	NULL
from	NULL
Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
this	NULL
happened	NULL
Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
attacked	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
savage	NULL
irony	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
good	NULL
humour	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
gift	NULL
for	NULL
repartee	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
answers	NULL
which	NULL
caused	NULL
Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
to	NULL
stop	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
curiously	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
grave	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
twinkling	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
avoid	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
chaffing	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
being	NULL
disliked	NULL
and	NULL
feared	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
assistants	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
experience	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
fly	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
and	NULL
pack	NULL
Philip	NULL
off	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
train	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
that	NULL
before	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
assistants	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
uneasy	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
then	NULL
would	NULL
simply	NULL
laugh	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
outright	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
suddenly	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
amused	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
mouth	NULL
formed	NULL
itself	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
amusing	NULL
himself	NULL
systematically	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
expense	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
aback	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
diverted	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Damn	NULL
his	NULL
impudence	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
chuckled	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Damn	NULL
his	NULL
impudence	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

CXVII	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
Athelny	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
a	NULL
locum	NULL
in	NULL
Dorsetshire	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
due	NULL
course	NULL
received	NULL
an	NULL
answer	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
written	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
formal	NULL
manner	NULL
he	NULL
affected	NULL
,	NULL
studded	NULL
with	NULL
pompous	NULL
epithets	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
Persian	NULL
diadem	NULL
was	NULL
studded	NULL
with	NULL
precious	NULL
stones	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
black	NULL
letter	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
prided	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
should	NULL
join	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Kentish	NULL
hop-field	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
every	NULL
year	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
persuade	NULL
him	NULL
said	NULL
various	NULL
beautiful	NULL
and	NULL
complicated	NULL
things	NULL
about	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
soul	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
winding	NULL
tendrils	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hops	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
replied	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
free	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
not	NULL
born	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
affection	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Isle	NULL
of	NULL
Thanet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
fired	NULL
with	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
spending	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
so	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
and	NULL
amid	NULL
conditions	NULL
which	NULL
needed	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
blue	NULL
sky	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
idyllic	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
olive	NULL
groves	NULL
of	NULL
Arcady	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
four	NULL
weeks	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
engagement	NULL
at	NULL
Farnley	NULL
passed	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
cliff	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
town	NULL
was	NULL
springing	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
red	NULL
brick	NULL
villas	NULL
round	NULL
golf	NULL
links	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
hotel	NULL
had	NULL
recently	NULL
been	NULL
opened	NULL
to	NULL
cater	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
visitors	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Philip	NULL
went	NULL
there	NULL
seldom	NULL
.	NULL

Down	NULL
below	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
harbour	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
stone	NULL
houses	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
past	NULL
century	NULL
were	NULL
clustered	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
delightful	NULL
confusion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
narrow	NULL
streets	NULL
,	NULL
climbing	NULL
down	NULL
steeply	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
antiquity	NULL
which	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
imagination	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
's	NULL
edge	NULL
were	NULL
neat	NULL
cottages	NULL
with	NULL
trim	NULL
,	NULL
tiny	NULL
gardens	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
inhabited	NULL
by	NULL
retired	NULL
captains	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
merchant	NULL
service	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
mothers	NULL
or	NULL
widows	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
gained	NULL
their	NULL
living	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
appearance	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
quaint	NULL
and	NULL
peaceful	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
harbour	NULL
came	NULL
tramps	NULL
from	NULL
Spain	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Levant	NULL
,	NULL
ships	NULL
of	NULL
small	NULL
tonnage	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
a	NULL
windjammer	NULL
was	NULL
borne	NULL
in	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
winds	NULL
of	NULL
romance	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
reminded	NULL
Philip	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dirty	NULL
little	NULL
harbour	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
colliers	NULL
at	NULL
Blackstable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
first	NULL
acquired	NULL
the	NULL
desire	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
an	NULL
obsession	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Eastern	NULL
lands	NULL
and	NULL
sunlit	NULL
islands	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
tropic	NULL
sea	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
here	NULL
you	NULL
felt	NULL
yourself	NULL
closer	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
wide	NULL
,	NULL
deep	NULL
ocean	NULL
than	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
shore	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
North	NULL
Sea	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
always	NULL
circumscribed	NULL
;	NULL
here	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
draw	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
breath	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
looked	NULL
out	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
even	NULL
vastness	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
west	NULL
wind	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
dear	NULL
soft	NULL
salt	NULL
wind	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
,	NULL
uplifted	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
melted	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
tenderness	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
reached	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
week	NULL
with	NULL
Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
surgery	NULL
door	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
doctor	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
were	NULL
making	NULL
up	NULL
prescriptions	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
ragged	NULL
girl	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
dirty	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
bare	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Please	NULL

called	NULL
out	NULL

in	NULL
his	NULL
rasping	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
child	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
addressed	NULL
herself	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL

The	NULL

hesitated	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL

and	NULL
putting	NULL
a	NULL
dirty	NULL
finger	NULL

a	NULL

stood	NULL

Doctor	NULL

came	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL

passage	NULL

barked	NULL

The	NULL
little	NULL
girl	NULL
looked	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL

then	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
better	NULL

it	NULL

she	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
tongue	NULL
deliberately	NULL
at	NULL
Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
recover	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
astonishment	NULL
,	NULL
bolted	NULL
off	NULL
as	NULL
fast	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL

Philip	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
was	NULL
annoyed	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

by	NULL

giving	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL

Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
snarl	NULL

Philip	NULL
reddened	NULL

stood	NULL
silent	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
patient	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
hard	NULL
upon	NULL
eight	NULL
o'clock	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL

Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL

the	NULL
fireplace	NULL

"	NULL

stopped	NULL

I	NULL

Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
reply	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
servant	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
grilled	NULL
sprats	NULL

Philip	NULL
ate	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
appetite	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
shot	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sunset	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
answered	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
full	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Because	NULL

happy	NULL

"	NULL

Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
odd	NULL
look	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
flickered	NULL
across	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL

tired	NULL
face	NULL

They	NULL
ate	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dinner	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL

given	NULL
them	NULL
the	NULL
port	NULL

left	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
leaned	NULL
back	NULL

fixed	NULL
his	NULL
sharp	NULL
eyes	NULL
on	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
stung	NULL
you	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
People	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

Philip	NULL
faced	NULL
him	NULL

at	NULL
him	NULL
steadily	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL
very	NULL
glad	NULL

The	NULL
doctor	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
chuckle	NULL

bitter	NULL
mirth	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL

staring	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL

Then	NULL
Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
surprised	NULL
Philip	NULL
extremely	NULL

It	NULL

Doctor	NULL

grumpily	NULL

"	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL

with	NULL
surprise	NULL

"	NULL

met	NULL

your	NULL

Philip	NULL
said	NULL
drily	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

Philip	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
reply	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
proposal	NULL

but	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
astonished	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
very	NULL

for	NULL
someone	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
a	NULL
partnership	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
newly	NULL
qualified	NULL
man	NULL

he	NULL
realised	NULL

although	NULL
nothing	NULL

induce	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
fancy	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
how	NULL
amused	NULL
the	NULL
secretary	NULL
at	NULL

out	NULL

you	NULL

when	NULL

Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
that	NULL
most	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
profession	NULL
would	NULL
jump	NULL
at	NULL

the	NULL
profession	NULL
was	NULL
over-crowded	NULL

and	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL

be	NULL
thankful	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
the	NULL
certainty	NULL

even	NULL
so	NULL
modest	NULL
a	NULL
competence	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
awfully	NULL
sorry	NULL

but	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

It	NULL

everything	NULL

one	NULL

Now	NULL
the	NULL
goal	NULL
seemed	NULL
very	NULL
near	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
finished	NULL
his	NULL
appointment	NULL
at	NULL
St.	NULL
Luke	NULL
's	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Spain	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
afford	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
several	NULL
months	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
rambling	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
which	NULL
stood	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
romance	NULL
;	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
ship	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
East	NULL
.	NULL

Life	NULL
was	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
account	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
wander	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
unfrequented	NULL
places	NULL
,	NULL
amid	NULL
strange	NULL
peoples	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
led	NULL
in	NULL
strange	NULL
ways	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
sought	NULL
or	NULL
what	NULL
his	NULL
journeys	NULL
would	NULL
bring	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
learn	NULL
something	NULL
new	NULL
about	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
gain	NULL
some	NULL
clue	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
mystery	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
solved	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
more	NULL
mysterious	NULL

And	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
nothing	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
allay	NULL
the	NULL
unrest	NULL
which	NULL
gnawed	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
was	NULL
showing	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
kindness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
ungrateful	NULL
to	NULL
refuse	NULL
his	NULL
offer	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
adequate	NULL
reason	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
shy	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
appear	NULL
as	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
some	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
why	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
important	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
plans	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
cherished	NULL
so	NULL
passionately	NULL
.	NULL

Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
listened	NULL
quietly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
gentle	NULL
look	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
shrewd	NULL
old	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
an	NULL
added	NULL
kindness	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
press	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
his	NULL
offer	NULL
.	NULL

Benevolence	NULL
is	NULL
often	NULL
very	NULL
peremptory	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
reasons	NULL
as	NULL
sound	NULL
.	NULL

Dropping	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
youth	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Royal	NULL
Navy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
long	NULL
connection	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
retired	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
settle	NULL
at	NULL
Farnley	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
days	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Pacific	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
wild	NULL
adventures	NULL
in	NULL
China	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
part	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
expedition	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
head-hunters	NULL
of	NULL
Borneo	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
Samoa	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
an	NULL
independent	NULL
state	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
touched	NULL
at	NULL
coral	NULL
islands	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
entranced	NULL
.	NULL

Little	NULL
by	NULL
little	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
about	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
widower	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
thirty	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
daughter	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
a	NULL
farmer	NULL
in	NULL
Rhodesia	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
quarrelled	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
England	NULL
for	NULL
ten	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
wife	NULL
or	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
lonely	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
gruffness	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
protection	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
wore	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
a	NULL
complete	NULL
disillusionment	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
tragic	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
just	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
impatiently	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
rather	NULL
with	NULL
loathing	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
hating	NULL
old	NULL
age	NULL
and	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
resign	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
limitations	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
death	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
solution	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bitterness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
crossed	NULL
his	NULL
path	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
natural	NULL
affection	NULL
which	NULL
long	NULL
separation	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
daughter	NULL
had	NULL
killed	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
part	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
quarrel	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
children	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
--	NULL
settled	NULL
itself	NULL
upon	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
angry	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
himself	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
dotage	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
Philip	NULL
that	NULL
attracted	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
smiling	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL

Philip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
bore	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
shoulder	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
near	NULL
a	NULL
caress	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
since	NULL
his	NULL
daughter	NULL
left	NULL
England	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
came	NULL
for	NULL
Philip	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
accompanied	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
unaccountably	NULL
depressed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
ripping	NULL
time	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
've	NULL
been	NULL
awfully	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
very	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
myself	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
you	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
?	NULL

Ah	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
youth	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
hesitated	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
change	NULL
your	NULL
mind	NULL
my	NULL
offer	NULL
still	NULL
stands	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
's	NULL
awfully	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
steamed	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fortnight	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hop-field	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
happy	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
rejoiced	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
was	NULL
fine	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
walked	NULL
slowly	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
empty	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
very	NULL
old	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
lonely	NULL
.	NULL

CXVIII	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
late	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
when	NULL
Philip	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
Ferne	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
's	NULL
native	NULL
village	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
accustomed	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
childhood	NULL
to	NULL
pick	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hop-field	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
children	NULL
she	NULL
still	NULL
went	NULL
every	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

Like	NULL
many	NULL
Kentish	NULL
folk	NULL
her	NULL
family	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
regularly	NULL
,	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
earn	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
especially	NULL
regarding	NULL
the	NULL
annual	NULL
outing	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
for	NULL
months	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
holidays	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
hard	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
common	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
delightful	NULL
picnic	NULL
;	NULL
here	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
met	NULL
the	NULL
maidens	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
evenings	NULL
when	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
they	NULL
wandered	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
lanes	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
love	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
hopping	NULL
season	NULL
was	NULL
generally	NULL
followed	NULL
by	NULL
weddings	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
carts	NULL
with	NULL
bedding	NULL
,	NULL
pots	NULL
and	NULL
pans	NULL
,	NULL
chairs	NULL
and	NULL
tables	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Ferne	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
hopping	NULL
lasted	NULL
was	NULL
deserted	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
exclusive	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
resented	NULL
the	NULL
intrusion	NULL
of	NULL
foreigners	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
London	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
feared	NULL
them	NULL
too	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
rough	NULL
lot	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
respectable	NULL
country	NULL
folk	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
mix	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
days	NULL
the	NULL
hoppers	NULL
slept	NULL
in	NULL
barns	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
ten	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
a	NULL
row	NULL
of	NULL
huts	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
erected	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
meadow	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Athelnys	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
many	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
hut	NULL
every	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

Athelny	NULL
met	NULL
Philip	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cart	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
borrowed	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
public-house	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
for	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
hop-field	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
left	NULL
his	NULL
bag	NULL
there	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
meadow	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
huts	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
low	NULL
shed	NULL
,	NULL
divided	NULL
into	NULL
little	NULL
rooms	NULL
about	NULL
twelve	NULL
feet	NULL
square	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fire	NULL
of	NULL
sticks	NULL
,	NULL
round	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
was	NULL
grouped	NULL
,	NULL
eagerly	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
cooking	NULL
of	NULL
supper	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sea-air	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
had	NULL
browned	NULL
already	NULL
the	NULL
faces	NULL
of	NULL
Athelny	NULL
's	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
sun-bonnet	NULL
:	NULL
you	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
years	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
real	NULL
difference	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
woman	NULL
born	NULL
and	NULL
bred	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
frying	NULL
bacon	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
keeping	NULL
an	NULL
eye	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
younger	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
hearty	NULL
handshake	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
jolly	NULL
smile	NULL
for	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Athelny	NULL
was	NULL
enthusiastic	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
delights	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
rural	NULL
existence	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

She	NULL
stepped	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
little	NULL
hut	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
flames	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

leaped	NULL
up	NULL

the	NULL

were	NULL
tucked	NULL
up	NULL

showed	NULL
her	NULL
strong	NULL

She	NULL
too	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL

Philip	NULL

looked	NULL

the	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL

hops	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
happy	NULL
pickers	NULL
slept	NULL
like	NULL
tops	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
nine	NULL
o'clock	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
quiet	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
meadow	NULL
and	NULL
everyone	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
still	NULL
lingered	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
public-house	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
closed	NULL
at	NULL
ten	NULL
.	NULL

Athelny	NULL
walked	NULL
there	NULL
with	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
We	NULL
breakfast	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
to	NULL
six	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
daresay	NULL
you	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
early	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
at	NULL
six	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Of	NULL
course	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
early	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
cried	NULL
Athelny	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
work	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
's	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
earn	NULL
his	NULL
board	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
dinner	NULL

my	NULL
lad	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
children	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
bathe	NULL
before	NULL
breakfast	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
can	NULL
give	NULL
you	NULL
a	NULL
call	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
way	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
pass	NULL
The	NULL
Jolly	NULL
Sailor	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
they	NULL
'll	NULL
wake	NULL
me	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
bathe	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Jane	NULL
and	NULL
Harold	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
shouted	NULL
with	NULL
delight	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
awakened	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sound	NULL
sleep	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
bursting	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boys	NULL
jumped	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
chase	NULL
them	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
slippers	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
coat	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
trousers	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
day	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
just	NULL
broken	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
nip	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
was	NULL
cloudless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
shining	NULL
yellow	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
,	NULL
holding	NULL
Connie	NULL
's	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
towel	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
bathing-dress	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
arm	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
sun-bonnet	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
colour	NULL
of	NULL
lavender	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
against	NULL
it	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
red	NULL
and	NULL
brown	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
apple	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
greeted	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
slow	NULL
,	NULL
sweet	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
noticed	NULL
suddenly	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
teeth	NULL
were	NULL
small	NULL
and	NULL
regular	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
white	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
why	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
caught	NULL
his	NULL
attention	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
letting	NULL
you	NULL
sleep	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
wake	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
said	NULL
you	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
really	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
walked	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
cut	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
marshes	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
way	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
water	NULL
looked	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
gray	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
shivered	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
tore	NULL
off	NULL
their	NULL
clothes	NULL
and	NULL
ran	NULL
in	NULL
shouting	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
did	NULL
everything	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
till	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
were	NULL
splashing	NULL
round	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

Swimming	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
only	NULL
accomplishment	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
imitating	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
played	NULL
at	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
porpoise	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
drowning	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
fat	NULL
lady	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
wetting	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bathe	NULL
was	NULL
uproarious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
Sally	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
severe	NULL
to	NULL
induce	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
as	NULL
bad	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
grave	NULL
,	NULL
maternal	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
comic	NULL
and	NULL
touching	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
're	NULL
not	NULL
anything	NULL
like	NULL
so	NULL
naughty	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
not	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
walked	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
Sally	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
bright	NULL
hair	NULL
streaming	NULL
over	NULL
one	NULL
shoulder	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
sun-bonnet	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
huts	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
started	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
hop-garden	NULL
.	NULL

Athleny	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
oldest	NULL
trousers	NULL
anyone	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
worn	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
jacket	NULL
buttoned	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
shirt	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
wide-brimmed	NULL
soft	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
frying	NULL
kippers	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
fire	NULL
of	NULL
sticks	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
delighted	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
every	NULL
inch	NULL
a	NULL
brigand	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
party	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
shout	NULL
the	NULL
witches	NULL
'	NULL
chorus	NULL
from	NULL
Macbeth	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
odorous	NULL
kippers	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
must	NULL
n't	NULL
dawdle	NULL
over	NULL
your	NULL
breakfast	NULL
or	NULL
mother	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
angry	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
,	NULL
Harold	NULL
and	NULL
Jane	NULL
with	NULL
pieces	NULL
of	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
sauntered	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
meadow	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
hop-field	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
hop-garden	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sights	NULL
connected	NULL
with	NULL
Philip	NULL
's	NULL
boyhood	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
oast-houses	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
typical	NULL
feature	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Kentish	NULL
scene	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
strangeness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
followed	NULL
Sally	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
lines	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hops	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
bright	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
cast	NULL
a	NULL
sharp	NULL
shadow	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
feasted	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
richness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
leaves	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hops	NULL
were	NULL
yellowing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
passion	NULL
which	NULL
poets	NULL
in	NULL
Sicily	NULL
have	NULL
found	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
purple	NULL
grape	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
along	NULL
Philip	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
overwhelmed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
rich	NULL
luxuriance	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
sweet	NULL
scent	NULL
arose	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
fat	NULL
Kentish	NULL
soil	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fitful	NULL
September	NULL
breeze	NULL
was	NULL
heavy	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
goodly	NULL
perfume	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hops	NULL
.	NULL

Athelstan	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
exhilaration	NULL
instinctively	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
lifted	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
and	NULL
sang	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
cracked	NULL
voice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
of	NULL
fifteen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Sally	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
be	NULL
quiet	NULL
,	NULL
Athelstan	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
we	NULL
shall	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
thunderstorm	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
they	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
hum	NULL
of	NULL
voices	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
more	NULL
came	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
pickers	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
hard	NULL
at	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
talking	NULL
and	NULL
laughing	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
picked	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
chairs	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
stools	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
boxes	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
baskets	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
sides	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
stood	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
bin	NULL
throwing	NULL
the	NULL
hops	NULL
they	NULL
picked	NULL
straight	NULL
into	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
children	NULL
about	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
many	NULL
babies	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
in	NULL
makeshift	NULL
cradles	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
tucked	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
rug	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
soft	NULL
brown	NULL
dry	NULL
earth	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
children	NULL
picked	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
and	NULL
played	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
women	NULL
worked	NULL
busily	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
pickers	NULL
from	NULL
childhood	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
pick	NULL
twice	NULL
as	NULL
fast	NULL
as	NULL
foreigners	NULL
from	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
boasted	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
bushels	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
picked	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
complained	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
money	NULL
now	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
former	NULL
times	NULL
:	NULL
then	NULL
they	NULL
paid	NULL
you	NULL
a	NULL
shilling	NULL
for	NULL
five	NULL
bushels	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL
rate	NULL
was	NULL
eight	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
nine	NULL
bushels	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
shilling	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
days	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
picker	NULL
could	NULL
earn	NULL
enough	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
you	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
holiday	NULL
for	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Hill	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL
pianner	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
picking	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
near	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
near	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
people	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
was	NULL
known	NULL
perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
savings	NULL
bank	NULL
towards	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hoppers	NULL
were	NULL
divided	NULL
into	NULL
bin	NULL
companies	NULL
of	NULL
ten	NULL
pickers	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
counting	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Athelny	NULL
loudly	NULL
boasted	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
company	NULL
consisting	NULL
entirely	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
family	NULL
.	NULL

Each	NULL
company	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
bin-man	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
duty	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
supply	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
strings	NULL
of	NULL
hops	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
bins	NULL
(	NULL
the	NULL
bin	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
sack	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
wooden	NULL
frame	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
seven	NULL
feet	NULL
high	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
long	NULL
rows	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
placed	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
rows	NULL
of	NULL
hops	NULL
;)	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
position	NULL
that	NULL
Athelny	NULL
aspired	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL
was	NULL
old	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
form	NULL
a	NULL
company	NULL
.	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
he	NULL
worked	NULL
rather	NULL
by	NULL
encouraging	NULL
others	NULL
than	NULL
by	NULL
exertions	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sauntered	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
busy	NULL
for	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
emptied	NULL
a	NULL
basket	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
cigarette	NULL
between	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
pick	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
asserted	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
pick	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
anyone	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
mother	NULL
;	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
pick	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
mother	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
reminded	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
trials	NULL
which	NULL
Aphrodite	NULL
put	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
curious	NULL
Psyche	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
his	NULL
children	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
unseen	NULL
bridegroom	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
listening	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
tale	NULL
fitted	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sky	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
blue	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
lovely	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
Greece	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
children	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
fair	NULL
hair	NULL

rosy	NULL
cheeks	NULL

strong	NULL

healthy	NULL

vivacious	NULL

the	NULL
delicate	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hops	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
challenging	NULL
emerald	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
leaves	NULL

like	NULL
a	NULL
blare	NULL
of	NULL
trumpets	NULL

the	NULL
magic	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
alley	NULL

narrowing	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
point	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
row	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
pickers	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
sun-bonnets	NULL
:	NULL
perhaps	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Greek	NULL
spirit	NULL
there	NULL
than	NULL
you	NULL

find	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
thankful	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
winding	NULL
white	NULL
roads	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
hedgerows	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
meadows	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
elm-trees	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
delicate	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hills	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
copses	NULL
that	NULL
crowned	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
flatness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
marshes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
melancholy	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
North	NULL
Sea	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
glad	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
its	NULL
loveliness	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
presently	NULL
Athelny	NULL
grew	NULL
restless	NULL
and	NULL
announced	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
ask	NULL
how	NULL
Robert	NULL
Kemp	NULL
's	NULL
mother	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
everyone	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
Christian	NULL
names	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
their	NULL
family	NULL
histories	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
birth	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
harmless	NULL
vanity	NULL
he	NULL
played	NULL
the	NULL
fine	NULL
gentleman	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
condescension	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
familiarity	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
earn	NULL
my	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Quite	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
answered	NULL
Athelny	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
wave	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
strolled	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

CXIX	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
basket	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
Sally	NULL
.	NULL

Jane	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
monstrous	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
help	NULL
her	NULL
elder	NULL
sister	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
promise	NULL
to	NULL
pick	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
Sally	NULL
's	NULL
basket	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
quick	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Wo	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL
hurt	NULL
your	NULL
hands	NULL
for	NULL
sewing	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
wants	NULL
soft	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
's	NULL
why	NULL
women	NULL
pick	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
your	NULL
hands	NULL
are	NULL
hard	NULL
and	NULL
your	NULL
fingers	NULL
all	NULL
stiff	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
rough	NULL
work	NULL
you	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
pick	NULL
near	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
deft	NULL
movements	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
watched	NULL
him	NULL
too	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
maternal	NULL
spirit	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
amusing	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
so	NULL
charming	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
clumsy	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
bent	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
showed	NULL
him	NULL
how	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
deal	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
whole	NULL
line	NULL
their	NULL
hands	NULL
met	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
blush	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
persuade	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
;	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
flapper	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
looking	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
still	NULL
;	NULL
yet	NULL
the	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
admirers	NULL
showed	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
been	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Sally	NULL
's	NULL
cousins	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
so	NULL
attentive	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
endure	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
chaffing	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
Peter	NULL
Gann	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
son	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
's	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
a	NULL
farmer	NULL
near	NULL
Ferne	NULL
.	NULL

Everyone	NULL
knew	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
hop-field	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
call-off	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sounding	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
horn	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
for	NULL
breakfast	NULL
at	NULL
eight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
told	NULL
them	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
deserved	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
ate	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
heartily	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
worked	NULL
till	NULL
twelve	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
horn	NULL
sounded	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
for	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
intervals	NULL
the	NULL
measurer	NULL
went	NULL
his	NULL
round	NULL
from	NULL
bin	NULL
to	NULL
bin	NULL
,	NULL
accompanied	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
booker	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
entered	NULL
first	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
book	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hopper	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
bushels	NULL
picked	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
each	NULL
bin	NULL
was	NULL
filled	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
measured	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
bushel	NULL
baskets	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
huge	NULL
bag	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
poke	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
the	NULL
measurer	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
pole-puller	NULL
carried	NULL
off	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
waggon	NULL
.	NULL

Athelny	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
stories	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Heath	NULL
or	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Jones	NULL
had	NULL
picked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
conjured	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL
to	NULL
beat	NULL
her	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
wanting	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
records	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
picked	NULL
steadily	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
chief	NULL
amusement	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
showed	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
graceful	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
excessively	NULL
proud	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spent	NULL
much	NULL
time	NULL
manicuring	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
stretched	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
tapering	NULL
fingers	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Spanish	NULL
grandees	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
slept	NULL
in	NULL
oiled	NULL
gloves	NULL
to	NULL
preserve	NULL
their	NULL
whiteness	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hand	NULL
that	NULL
wrung	NULL
the	NULL
throat	NULL
of	NULL
Europe	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
remarked	NULL
dramatically	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
shapely	NULL
and	NULL
exquisite	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
delicately	NULL
picked	NULL
the	NULL
hops	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sighed	NULL
with	NULL
self-satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
rolled	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
cigarette	NULL
and	NULL
discoursed	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL
and	NULL
literature	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
it	NULL
grew	NULL
very	NULL
hot	NULL
.	NULL

Work	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
proceed	NULL
so	NULL
actively	NULL
and	NULL
conversation	NULL
halted	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
incessant	NULL
chatter	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
dwindled	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
desultory	NULL
remarks	NULL
.	NULL

Tiny	NULL
beads	NULL
of	NULL
sweat	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
Sally	NULL
's	NULL
upper	NULL
lip	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
worked	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
were	NULL
slightly	NULL
parted	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
rosebud	NULL
bursting	NULL
into	NULL
flower	NULL
.	NULL

Calling-off	NULL
time	NULL
depended	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
oast-house	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
filled	NULL
early	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
many	NULL
hops	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
picked	NULL
by	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
as	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
dried	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
stopped	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
generally	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
measuring	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
began	NULL
at	NULL
five	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
each	NULL
company	NULL
had	NULL
its	NULL
bin	NULL
measured	NULL
it	NULL
gathered	NULL
up	NULL
its	NULL
things	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
chatting	NULL
again	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
sauntered	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
women	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
huts	NULL
to	NULL
clean	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
prepare	NULL
the	NULL
supper	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
strolled	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
public-house	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
glass	NULL
of	NULL
beer	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
pleasant	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Athelnys	NULL
'	NULL
bin	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
dealt	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
measurer	NULL
came	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
of	NULL
relief	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
stretched	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
position	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
hours	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
stiff	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
,	NULL
let	NULL
's	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
The	NULL
Jolly	NULL
Sailor	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Athelny	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
rites	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
duly	NULL
performed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
none	NULL
more	NULL
sacred	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Take	NULL
a	NULL
jug	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
Athelny	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
bring	NULL
back	NULL
a	NULL
pint	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
for	NULL
supper	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
copper	NULL
by	NULL
copper	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bar-parlour	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
well	NULL
filled	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
sanded	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
benches	NULL
round	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yellow	NULL
pictures	NULL
of	NULL
Victorian	NULL
prize-fighters	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
licencee	NULL
knew	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
customers	NULL
by	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
leaned	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
bar	NULL
smiling	NULL
benignly	NULL
at	NULL
two	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
throwing	NULL
rings	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
stick	NULL
that	NULL
stood	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
:	NULL
their	NULL
failure	NULL
was	NULL
greeted	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
hearty	NULL
chaff	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL
.	NULL

Room	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
arrivals	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
sitting	NULL
between	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
labourer	NULL
in	NULL
corduroys	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
string	NULL
tied	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
shiny-faced	NULL
lad	NULL
of	NULL
seventeen	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
love-lock	NULL
neatly	NULL
plastered	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
red	NULL
forehead	NULL
.	NULL

Athelny	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
trying	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
throwing	NULL
of	NULL
rings	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
backed	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
pint	NULL
and	NULL
won	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
drank	NULL
the	NULL
loser	NULL
's	NULL
health	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
sooner	NULL
have	NULL
won	NULL
this	NULL
than	NULL
won	NULL
the	NULL
Derby	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
outlandish	NULL
figure	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
wide-brimmed	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
pointed	NULL
beard	NULL
,	NULL
among	NULL
those	NULL
country	NULL
folk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
thought	NULL
him	NULL
very	NULL
queer	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
spirits	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
high	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
so	NULL
contagious	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
like	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Conversation	NULL
went	NULL
easily	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
certain	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
pleasantries	NULL
were	NULL
exchanged	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
broad	NULL
,	NULL
slow	NULL
accent	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Isle	NULL
of	NULL
Thanet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
uproarious	NULL
laughter	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sallies	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
local	NULL
wag	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
pleasant	NULL
gathering	NULL
!	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
hard-hearted	NULL
person	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
a	NULL
glow	NULL
of	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
fellows	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
wandered	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
bright	NULL
and	NULL
sunny	NULL
still	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
little	NULL
white	NULL
curtains	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
tied	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
red	NULL
ribbon	NULL
like	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cottage	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sill	NULL
were	NULL
pots	NULL
of	NULL
geraniums	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
due	NULL
course	NULL
one	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
the	NULL
idlers	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
sauntered	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
meadow	NULL
where	NULL
supper	NULL
was	NULL
cooking	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
expect	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL
be	NULL
ready	NULL
for	NULL
your	NULL
bed	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
to	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
not	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
getting	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
five	NULL

staying	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
air	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

n't	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

the	NULL
boys	NULL
cried	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Rather	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
and	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
supper	NULL
,	NULL
balancing	NULL
himself	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hut	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
chair	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
smoked	NULL
his	NULL
pipe	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
was	NULL
busy	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
passed	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hut	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
lazily	NULL
watched	NULL
her	NULL
methodical	NULL
actions	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
walk	NULL
attracted	NULL
his	NULL
notice	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
particularly	NULL
graceful	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
easy	NULL
and	NULL
assured	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
swung	NULL
her	NULL
legs	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
hips	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
tread	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
with	NULL
decision	NULL
.	NULL

Athelny	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
gossip	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
neighbours	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
Philip	NULL
heard	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
address	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL

A	NULL
pause	NULL

then	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
was	NULL
raised	NULL

"	NULL
Sally	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Black	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
cottage	NULL
about	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
combined	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
of	NULL
postmistress	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
universal	NULL
provider	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hut	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
sleeves	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Shall	NULL
I	NULL
come	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
Sally	NULL
?	NULL

asked	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
trouble	NULL

I	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL

but	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
getting	NULL
near	NULL
my	NULL
bedtime	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
thinking	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL

stretch	NULL
my	NULL
legs	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Sally	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
set	NULL
out	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
road	NULL
was	NULL
white	NULL
and	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
sound	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
quite	NULL
hot	NULL
even	NULL
now	NULL

is	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
wonderful	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
their	NULL
silence	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
awkward	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
side	NULL
by	NULL
side	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
no	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
stile	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hedgerow	NULL
they	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
murmur	NULL
of	NULL
voices	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
they	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
outline	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
sitting	NULL
very	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
move	NULL
as	NULL
Philip	NULL
and	NULL
Sally	NULL
passed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wonder	NULL
who	NULL
that	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Sally	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
looked	NULL
happy	NULL
enough	NULL

did	NULL
n't	NULL
they	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
expect	NULL
they	NULL
took	NULL
us	NULL
for	NULL
lovers	NULL
too	NULL

"	NULL

They	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cottage	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
shop	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
glare	NULL
dazzled	NULL
them	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
are	NULL
late	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Black	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
shut	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
clock	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Getting	NULL
on	NULL
for	NULL
nine	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Sally	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
half	NULL
pound	NULL
of	NULL
tea	NULL
(	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
bring	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
pound	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
set	NULL
off	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
some	NULL
beast	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
sharp	NULL
sound	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
more	NULL
marked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Sally	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
strained	NULL
their	NULL
ears	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
fancy	NULL
presented	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
little	NULL
waves	NULL
lapping	NULL
up	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
shingle	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
stile	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
lovers	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
speaking	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
's	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
lips	NULL
were	NULL
pressed	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
seem	NULL
busy	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Sally	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
turned	NULL
a	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
breath	NULL
of	NULL
warm	NULL
wind	NULL
beat	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
against	NULL
their	NULL
faces	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
earth	NULL
gave	NULL
forth	NULL
its	NULL
freshness	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
strange	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tremulous	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
what	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
waiting	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
pregnant	NULL
with	NULL
meaning	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
feeling	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
very	NULL
full	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
melt	NULL
(	NULL
the	NULL
hackneyed	NULL
phrases	NULL
expressed	NULL
precisely	NULL
the	NULL
curious	NULL
sensation	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
happy	NULL
and	NULL
anxious	NULL
and	NULL
expectant	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
his	NULL
memory	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
those	NULL
lines	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Jessica	NULL
and	NULL
Lorenzo	NULL
murmur	NULL
melodious	NULL
words	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
capping	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
's	NULL
utterance	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
passion	NULL
shines	NULL
bright	NULL
and	NULL
clear	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
conceits	NULL
that	NULL
amuse	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
senses	NULL
so	NULL
strangely	NULL
alert	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
pure	NULL
soul	NULL
to	NULL
enjoy	NULL
the	NULL
scents	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sounds	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
savours	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
felt	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
exquisite	NULL
capacity	NULL
for	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
that	NULL
Sally	NULL
by	NULL
speaking	NULL
would	NULL
break	NULL
the	NULL
spell	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
never	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

Its	NULL
low	NULL
richness	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
night	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
huts	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
open	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
here	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
say	NULL
good-night	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Thank	NULL
you	NULL
for	NULL
coming	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
way	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL
you	NULL
'd	NULL
kiss	NULL
me	NULL
good-night	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
in	NULL
jest	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
merely	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
happy	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
lovely	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Good-night	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
laugh	NULL
,	NULL
drawing	NULL
her	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
warm	NULL
and	NULL
full	NULL
and	NULL
soft	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
lingered	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
flower	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
how	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
meaning	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
flung	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
yielded	NULL
quite	NULL
silently	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
body	NULL
was	NULL
firm	NULL
and	NULL
strong	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
lost	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
senses	NULL
overwhelmed	NULL
him	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
flood	NULL
of	NULL
rushing	NULL
waters	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
drew	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
darker	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hedge	NULL
.	NULL

CXX	NULL
Philip	NULL
slept	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
log	NULL
and	NULL
awoke	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
start	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
Harold	NULL
tickling	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
feather	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
shout	NULL
of	NULL
delight	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
opened	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
drunken	NULL
with	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
lazybones	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Jane	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Sally	NULL
says	NULL
she	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
wait	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
unless	NULL
you	NULL
hurry	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
sank	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
bed	NULL
already	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
stopped	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
overwhelmed	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
rush	NULL
of	NULL
self-reproach	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
bitterly	NULL
,	NULL
bitterly	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
regretted	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
would	NULL
she	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
dreaded	NULL
meeting	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
time	NULL
;	NULL
Edward	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
bathing-drawers	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
towel	NULL
,	NULL
Athelstan	NULL
tore	NULL
the	NULL
bed-clothes	NULL
away	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
three	NULL
minutes	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
clattered	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
sweet	NULL
and	NULL
innocent	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
do	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
dress	NULL
yourself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
coming	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
particle	NULL
of	NULL
difference	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
some	NULL
change	NULL
,	NULL
subtle	NULL
or	NULL
abrupt	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
fancied	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
shame	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
she	NULL
treated	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
anger	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
perhaps	NULL
some	NULL
increase	NULL
of	NULL
familiarity	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
exactly	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
as	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
walked	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
all	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
talking	NULL
and	NULL
laughing	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Sally	NULL
was	NULL
quiet	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
reserved	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
otherwise	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gentle	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
neither	NULL
sought	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
nor	NULL
avoided	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
astounded	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
the	NULL
incident	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
caused	NULL
some	NULL
revolution	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
nothing	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
along	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
girl	NULL
holding	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
boy	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
chatted	NULL
as	NULL
unconcernedly	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
sought	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
explanation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL
Sally	NULL
meant	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
forgotten	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
her	NULL
senses	NULL
had	NULL
run	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
treating	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
occurred	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
accident	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
unusual	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
decided	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
ascribing	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
thought	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
mature	NULL
wisdom	NULL
which	NULL
fitted	NULL
neither	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
age	NULL
nor	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
character	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
always	NULL
something	NULL
enigmatic	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
played	NULL
leap-frog	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
bathe	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
uproarious	NULL
as	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
previous	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
mothered	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
keeping	NULL
a	NULL
watchful	NULL
eye	NULL
on	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
calling	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
too	NULL
far	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
swam	NULL
staidly	NULL
backwards	NULL
and	NULL
forwards	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
larks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
turned	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
float	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
drying	NULL
herself	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
called	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
peremptorily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
only	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
hard	NULL
swim	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
cold	NULL
water	NULL
this	NULL
second	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
revelled	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
salt	NULL
freshness	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
rejoiced	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
his	NULL
limbs	NULL
freely	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
covered	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
with	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
firm	NULL
strokes	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Sally	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
towel	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
's	NULL
edge	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
this	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
Philip	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
called	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
boy	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
charge	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
smiling	NULL
with	NULL
amusement	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
authoritative	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
upbraided	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
naughty	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
in	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

Your	NULL
lips	NULL
are	NULL
quite	NULL
blue	NULL

and	NULL
just	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
your	NULL
teeth	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
're	NULL
chattering	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
manner	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
right	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
dressed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
noticed	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Just	NULL
look	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
're	NULL
quite	NULL
blue	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
circulation	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
shall	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
blood	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Give	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
in	NULL
hers	NULL
and	NULL
rubbed	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
first	NULL
one	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
colour	NULL
returned	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
,	NULL
touched	NULL
and	NULL
puzzled	NULL
,	NULL
watched	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
meet	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
avoid	NULL
his	NULL
purposely	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
just	NULL
happened	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
meet	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
behaviour	NULL
to	NULL
suggest	NULL
a	NULL
consciousness	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
anything	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
talkative	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
sitting	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hop-field	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
how	NULL
naughty	NULL
Philip	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
not	NULL
coming	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
blue	NULL
with	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
incredible	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
incident	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
arouse	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
protection	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
instinctive	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
mother	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
with	NULL
regard	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
brothers	NULL
and	NULL
sisters	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
alone	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
cooking	NULL
the	NULL
supper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Athelny	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
some	NULL
shopping	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
were	NULL
scattered	NULL
in	NULL
various	NULL
pursuits	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
hesitated	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
nervous	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
attended	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
business	NULL
with	NULL
serene	NULL
competence	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
accepted	NULL
placidly	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
embarrassing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
seldom	NULL
spoke	NULL
unless	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
or	NULL
had	NULL
something	NULL
particular	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
it	NULL
any	NULL
longer	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
not	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
Sally	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
blurted	NULL
out	NULL
suddenly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
raised	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
quietly	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
without	NULL
emotion	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Me	NULL
?	NULL

No	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
should	NULL
I	NULL
be	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
aback	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
reply	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
lid	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
pot	NULL
,	NULL
stirred	NULL
the	NULL
contents	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
savoury	NULL
smell	NULL
spread	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
smile	NULL
which	NULL
barely	NULL
separated	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
always	NULL
liked	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
thump	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
ribs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
blood	NULL
rushing	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
forced	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL
laugh	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
's	NULL
because	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
a	NULL
silly	NULL

you	NULL
liked	NULL
me	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
either	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
wood	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
I	NULL
liked	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
flushed	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
incident	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
it	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
horror	NULL
and	NULL
shame	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
's	NULL
why	NULL
I	NULL

have	NULL
anything	NULL

You	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
young	NULL
fellow	NULL
mother	NULL
wanted	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL

I	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
tea	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
bothered	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
say	NULL
no	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
surprised	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
feeling	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
unless	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
happiness	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
stirred	NULL
the	NULL
pot	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
those	NULL
children	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL

said	NULL
Philip	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
relief	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
practical	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
without	NULL
embarrassment	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Shall	NULL
I	NULL
come	NULL
for	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

you	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL

He	NULL
waited	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
stars	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stile	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
hedges	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
ripening	NULL
blackberries	NULL
were	NULL
high	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
rose	NULL
rich	NULL
scents	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
was	NULL
soft	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
beating	NULL
madly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
anything	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
associated	NULL
passion	NULL
with	NULL
cries	NULL
and	NULL
tears	NULL
and	NULL
vehemence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
in	NULL
Sally	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
else	NULL
but	NULL
passion	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
caused	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
surprised	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
cousin	NULL
,	NULL
Peter	NULL
Gann	NULL
,	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
spare	NULL

and	NULL
straight	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
sunburned	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
easy	NULL
stride	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
reckoned	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
convinced	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
purity	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
vague	NULL
inkling	NULL
that	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL
had	NULL
combined	NULL
,	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
though	NULL
was	NULL
unconscious	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
intoxication	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
hops	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
healthy	NULL
instincts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
natural	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
tenderness	NULL
that	NULL
overflowed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
affection	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
something	NULL
maternal	NULL
and	NULL
something	NULL
sisterly	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
because	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
charity	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
figure	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Sally	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
murmured	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stopped	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
stile	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
came	NULL
sweet	NULL
,	NULL
clean	NULL
odours	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
country-side	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
scents	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
new-mown	NULL
hay	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
savour	NULL
of	NULL
ripe	NULL
hops	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
freshness	NULL
of	NULL
young	NULL
grass	NULL

Her	NULL
lips	NULL
were	NULL
soft	NULL
and	NULL
full	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
lovely	NULL
,	NULL
strong	NULL
body	NULL
was	NULL
firm	NULL
within	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
close	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
eyelids	NULL
,	NULL
first	NULL
one	NULL

then	NULL
the	NULL

Her	NULL
arm	NULL
,	NULL
strong	NULL

muscular	NULL

was	NULL
bare	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
elbow	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
passed	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
wondered	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
beauty	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
gleamed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
skin	NULL
that	NULL
Rubens	NULL
painted	NULL
,	NULL
astonishingly	NULL
fair	NULL
and	NULL
transparent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
were	NULL
little	NULL
golden	NULL
hairs	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
arm	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Saxon	NULL
goddess	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
immortal	NULL
had	NULL
that	NULL
exquisite	NULL

and	NULL
Philip	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cottage	NULL
garden	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
dear	NULL
flowers	NULL
which	NULL
bloom	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
men	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
insignificant	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
in	NULL
both	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

When	NULL

Philip	NULL
with	NULL

entered	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
duties	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
interesting	NULL
and	NULL
varied	NULL
;	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
learned	NULL
something	NULL
new	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
consequence	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
Sally	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
life	NULL
uncommonly	NULL
pleasant	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
free	NULL
about	NULL
six	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
out-patients	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
Sally	NULL
worked	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
several	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
hung	NULL
about	NULL
opposite	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
trade	NULL
entrance	NULL
'	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
further	NULL
along	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
corner	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
coming	NULL
out	NULL
two	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
in	NULL
little	NULL
groups	NULL
,	NULL
nudged	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
and	NULL
giggled	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
recognised	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
plain	NULL
black	NULL
dress	NULL
looked	NULL
very	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
lass	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
picked	NULL
hops	NULL
side	NULL
by	NULL
side	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
walked	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
slackened	NULL
her	NULL
pace	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
met	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
greeted	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
quiet	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
walked	NULL
together	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
busy	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
doing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
names	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
she	NULL
worked	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
Sally	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
restrained	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
keen	NULL
,	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ridiculous	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
remarks	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
set	NULL
over	NULL
them	NULL
which	NULL
amused	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
unexpected	NULL
drollery	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
saying	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
characteristic	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
gravely	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
nothing	NULL
funny	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
sharp-sighted	NULL
that	NULL
Philip	NULL
broke	NULL
into	NULL
delighted	NULL
laughter	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
glance	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
smiling	NULL
eyes	NULL
showed	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
unaware	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
humour	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
handshake	NULL
and	NULL
parted	NULL
as	NULL
formally	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
Philip	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
tea	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
refused	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
look	NULL
funny	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Never	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
passed	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
seemed	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
desire	NULL
anything	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
companionship	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
walks	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
Philip	NULL
was	NULL
positive	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
puzzled	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
begin	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
her	NULL
conduct	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
fonder	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
competent	NULL
and	NULL
self	NULL
controlled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
charming	NULL
honesty	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
:	NULL
you	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
rely	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
circumstance	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
are	NULL
an	NULL
awfully	NULL
good	NULL
sort	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
propos	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
expect	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
as	NULL
everyone	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
love	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
affection	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
her	NULL
company	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
curiously	NULL
soothing	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
ridiculous	NULL
to	NULL
entertain	NULL
towards	NULL
a	NULL
shop-girl	NULL
of	NULL
nineteen	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
respected	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
admired	NULL
her	NULL
magnificent	NULL
healthiness	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
splendid	NULL
animal	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
defect	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
physical	NULL
perfection	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
always	NULL
with	NULL
admiring	NULL
awe	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
unworthy	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
after	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
unusually	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
serenity	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
expression	NULL
was	NULL
altered	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
line	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
frown	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
Sally	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
straight	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
colour	NULL
darkened	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
understood	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
,	NULL
quick	NULL
beat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
colour	NULL
leave	NULL
his	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
d'you	NULL
mean	NULL
?	NULL

Are	NULL
you	NULL
afraid	NULL
that	NULL
...	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
stopped	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
possibility	NULL
that	NULL
anything	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
could	NULL
happen	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
crossed	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
were	NULL
trembling	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
certain	NULL
yet	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
'll	NULL
be	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
walked	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
Chancery	NULL
Lane	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
held	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
smiled	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
worry	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
yet	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
's	NULL
hope	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
tumult	NULL
of	NULL
thoughts	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
!	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
abject	NULL
,	NULL
miserable	NULL
fool	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
repeated	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
times	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
rush	NULL
of	NULL
angry	NULL
feeling	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
despised	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
mess	NULL
?	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
chased	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
brain	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
hopeless	NULL
confusion	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
pieces	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
jig-saw	NULL
puzzle	NULL
seen	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
nightmare	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

Everything	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
clear	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
aimed	NULL
at	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
within	NULL
reach	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
his	NULL
inconceivable	NULL
stupidity	NULL
had	NULL
erected	NULL
this	NULL
new	NULL
obstacle	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
surmount	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
acknowledged	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
defect	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
resolute	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
well	NULL
ordered	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
living	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
sooner	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
settled	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
busied	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
arrangements	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
travels	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
tried	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
too	NULL
circumstantially	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
plans	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
discouraging	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
goal	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
near	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
harm	NULL
in	NULL
giving	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
longing	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
resist	NULL
.	NULL

First	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Spain	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
imbued	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
spirit	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
romance	NULL
and	NULL
colour	NULL
and	NULL
history	NULL
and	NULL
grandeur	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
message	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
particular	NULL
which	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
country	NULL
could	NULL
give	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
fine	NULL
old	NULL
cities	NULL
already	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
trodden	NULL
their	NULL
tortuous	NULL
streets	NULL
from	NULL
childhood	NULL
.	NULL

Cordova	NULL
,	NULL
Seville	NULL
,	NULL
Toledo	NULL
,	NULL
Leon	NULL
,	NULL
Tarragona	NULL
,	NULL
Burgos	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
great	NULL
painters	NULL
of	NULL
Spain	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
painters	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
pulse	NULL
beat	NULL
quickly	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
pictured	NULL
his	NULL
ecstasy	NULL
on	NULL
standing	NULL
face	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
those	NULL
works	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
more	NULL
significant	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
others	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
tortured	NULL
,	NULL
restless	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
poets	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
characteristic	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
race	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
poets	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
lands	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
drawn	NULL
their	NULL
inspiration	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
currents	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
's	NULL
literature	NULL
but	NULL
directly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
torrid	NULL
,	NULL
scented	NULL
plains	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
bleak	NULL
mountains	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
short	NULL
months	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
hear	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
ears	NULL
all	NULL
around	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
language	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
most	NULL
apt	NULL
for	NULL
grandeur	NULL
of	NULL
soul	NULL
and	NULL
passion	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
fine	NULL
taste	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
inkling	NULL
that	NULL
Andalusia	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
soft	NULL
and	NULL
sensuous	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
vulgar	NULL
even	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
satisfy	NULL
his	NULL
ardour	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
dwelt	NULL
more	NULL
willingly	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
wind-swept	NULL
distances	NULL
of	NULL
Castile	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rugged	NULL
magnificence	NULL
of	NULL
Aragon	NULL
and	NULL
Leon	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
quite	NULL
what	NULL
those	NULL
unknown	NULL
contacts	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
gather	NULL
from	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
strength	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
purpose	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
affronting	NULL
and	NULL
comprehending	NULL
the	NULL
manifold	NULL
wonders	NULL
of	NULL
places	NULL
more	NULL
distant	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
strange	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
beginning	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
communication	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
companies	NULL
which	NULL
took	NULL
surgeons	NULL
out	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
ships	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
knew	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
were	NULL
their	NULL
routes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
on	NULL
them	NULL
what	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
advantages	NULL
and	NULL
disadvantages	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
line	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
aside	NULL
the	NULL
Orient	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
P.	NULL
&	NULL
O	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
berth	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
besides	NULL
their	NULL
passenger	NULL
traffic	NULL
allowed	NULL
the	NULL
medical	NULL
officer	NULL
little	NULL
freedom	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
other	NULL
services	NULL
which	NULL
sent	NULL
large	NULL
tramps	NULL
on	NULL
leisurely	NULL
expeditions	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
East	NULL
,	NULL
stopping	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
ports	NULL
for	NULL
various	NULL
periods	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
often	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
trip	NULL
inland	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pay	NULL
was	NULL
poor	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
food	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
adequate	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
demand	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
posts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
London	NULL
degree	NULL
was	NULL
pretty	NULL
sure	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
one	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
applied	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
passengers	NULL
other	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
casual	NULL
man	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
shipping	NULL
on	NULL
business	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
out-of-the-way	NULL
port	NULL
to	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
on	NULL
board	NULL
was	NULL
friendly	NULL
and	NULL
pleasant	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
knew	NULL
by	NULL
heart	NULL
the	NULL
list	NULL
of	NULL
places	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
touched	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
each	NULL
one	NULL
called	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
visions	NULL
of	NULL
tropical	NULL
sunshine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
magic	NULL
colour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
teeming	NULL
,	NULL
mysterious	NULL
,	NULL
intense	NULL
life	NULL

!	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
close	NULL
quarters	NULL
with	NULL
Life	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
Tokyo	NULL
or	NULL
Shanghai	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
tranship	NULL
into	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
line	NULL
and	NULL
drip	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
islands	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
South	NULL
Pacific	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
doctor	NULL
was	NULL
useful	NULL
anywhere	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
up	NULL
country	NULL
in	NULL
Burmah	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
rich	NULL
jungles	NULL
in	NULL
Sumatra	NULL
or	NULL
Borneo	NULL
might	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
visit	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
young	NULL
still	NULL
and	NULL
time	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
object	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
ties	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
friends	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
learning	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
wonder	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
variedness	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
this	NULL
thing	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
aside	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
that	NULL
Sally	NULL
was	NULL
mistaken	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
strangely	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
;	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
likely	NULL
;	NULL
anyone	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
Nature	NULL
had	NULL
built	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
mother	NULL
of	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
ought	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
incident	NULL
divert	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
hair	NULL
's	NULL
breadth	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
path	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
easily	NULL
imagine	NULL
with	NULL
what	NULL
indifference	NULL
that	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
received	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
news	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
an	NULL
awful	NULL
nuisance	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
heels	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
wise	NULL
fellow	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
to	NULL
deal	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
troubles	NULL
as	NULL
best	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
told	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
this	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
inevitable	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
blame	NULL
than	NULL
Sally	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
risk	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
open	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
madness	NULL
to	NULL
allow	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
accident	NULL
to	NULL
disturb	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
pattern	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
acutely	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
transitoriness	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
necessary	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
for	NULL
Sally	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
afford	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
sufficient	NULL
sum	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
strong	NULL
man	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
allow	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
turned	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
purpose	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
said	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
simply	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
so	NULL
damned	NULL
weak	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
muttered	NULL
despairingly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
trusted	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
been	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
simply	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
reason	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
was	NULL
horrible	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
peace	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
travels	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
constantly	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
wretched	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
treated	NULL
him	NULL
well	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
repay	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
ingratitude	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
Sally	NULL
as	NULL
quickly	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
,	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
married	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
offer	NULL
still	NULL
held	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
practice	NULL
,	NULL
among	NULL
poor	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
possible	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
his	NULL
deformity	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
sneer	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
simple	NULL
manners	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
curious	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
,	NULL
soft	NULL
feeling	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
wave	NULL
of	NULL
emotion	NULL
spread	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
little	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
pictured	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
lead	NULL
with	NULL
Sally	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fishing	NULL
village	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
house	NULL
within	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
watch	NULL
the	NULL
mighty	NULL
ships	NULL
passing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
lands	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
wisest	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

Cronshaw	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
mattered	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
who	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
fancy	NULL
held	NULL
in	NULL
fee	NULL
the	NULL
twin	NULL
realms	NULL
of	NULL
space	NULL
and	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
.	NULL

Forever	NULL
wilt	NULL
thou	NULL
love	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
be	NULL
fair	NULL
!	NULL

His	NULL
wedding	NULL
present	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
high	NULL
hopes	NULL
.	NULL

Self-sacrifice	NULL
!	NULL

Philip	NULL
was	NULL
uplifted	NULL
by	NULL
its	NULL
beauty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
excited	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
read	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
driven	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
rooms	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
Birdcage	NULL
Walk	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
throbbing	NULL
with	NULL
joy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
bear	NULL
his	NULL
impatience	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Sally	NULL
's	NULL
happiness	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
his	NULL
offer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
late	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
there	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
pictured	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
evenings	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
spend	NULL
with	NULL
Sally	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cosy	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
blinds	NULL
undrawn	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
watch	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
bent	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
shaded	NULL
lamp	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
sweet	NULL
face	NULL
more	NULL
fair	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
talk	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
growing	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
fishermen	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
wives	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
his	NULL
patients	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
affection	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
turn	NULL
would	NULL
enter	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
pleasures	NULL
and	NULL
pains	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
simple	NULL
lives	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
son	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
and	NULL
hers	NULL
.	NULL

Already	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
in	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
passionate	NULL
devotion	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
passing	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
little	NULL
perfect	NULL
limbs	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
beautiful	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
dreams	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
rich	NULL
and	NULL
varied	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
thinking	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
pilgrimage	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
past	NULL
he	NULL
accepted	NULL
it	NULL
joyfully	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
accepted	NULL
the	NULL
deformity	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
life	NULL
so	NULL
hard	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
warped	NULL
his	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
by	NULL
reason	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
acquired	NULL
that	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
introspection	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
delight	NULL
.	NULL

Without	NULL
it	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
keen	NULL
appreciation	NULL
of	NULL
beauty	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
art	NULL
and	NULL
literature	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
varied	NULL
spectacle	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
ridicule	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
contempt	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
been	NULL
heaped	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
inward	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
forth	NULL
those	NULL
flowers	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
lose	NULL
their	NULL
fragrance	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
normal	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
rarest	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

Everyone	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
defect	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
body	NULL
or	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
(	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
sick-house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
rhyme	NULL
or	NULL
reason	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
procession	NULL
,	NULL
deformed	NULL
in	NULL
body	NULL
and	NULL
warped	NULL
in	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
with	NULL
illness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
flesh	NULL
,	NULL
weak	NULL
hearts	NULL
or	NULL
weak	NULL
lungs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
with	NULL
illness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
spirit	NULL
,	NULL
languor	NULL
of	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
craving	NULL
for	NULL
liquor	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
feel	NULL
a	NULL
holy	NULL
compassion	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
helpless	NULL
instruments	NULL
of	NULL
blind	NULL
chance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
pardon	NULL
Griffiths	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
treachery	NULL
and	NULL
Mildred	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
caused	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
themselves	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
reasonable	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
patient	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
faults	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dying	NULL
God	NULL
crossed	NULL
his	NULL
memory	NULL
:	NULL
Forgive	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
know	NULL
not	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

CXXII	NULL
He	NULL
had	NULL
arranged	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
Sally	NULL
on	NULL
Saturday	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
National	NULL
Gallery	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
there	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
released	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
agreed	NULL
to	NULL
lunch	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
days	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
exultation	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
rejoiced	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
attempted	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
repeated	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
his	NULL
impatience	NULL
was	NULL
unbearable	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
Doctor	NULL
South	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
a	NULL
telegram	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
received	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Sacking	NULL
the	NULL
mumpish	NULL
fool	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
will	NULL
you	NULL
come	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Philip	NULL
walked	NULL
along	NULL
Parliament	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bright	NULL
,	NULL
frosty	NULL
sun	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
dance	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
crowded	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
tenuous	NULL
mist	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
softened	NULL
exquisitely	NULL
the	NULL
noble	NULL
lines	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
buildings	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
crossed	NULL
Trafalgar	NULL
Square	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
twist	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
body	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
who	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
was	NULL
Mildred	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
figure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
slight	NULL
dragging	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
feet	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
characteristic	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Without	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
beating	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
hurried	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
alongside	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
turned	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
someone	NULL
unknown	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
older	NULL
person	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
lined	NULL
,	NULL
yellow	NULL
skin	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
slackened	NULL
his	NULL
pace	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
infinitely	NULL
relieved	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
relief	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
disappointment	NULL
too	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
seized	NULL
with	NULL
horror	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Would	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
passion	NULL
?	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
everything	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
,	NULL
desperate	NULL
thirst	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
vile	NULL
woman	NULL
would	NULL
always	NULL
linger	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
love	NULL
had	NULL
caused	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
suffering	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
quite	NULL
be	NULL
free	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Only	NULL
death	NULL
could	NULL
finally	NULL
assuage	NULL
his	NULL
desire	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
wrenched	NULL
the	NULL
pang	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Sally	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
kind	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
formed	NULL
themselves	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
steps	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
National	NULL
Gallery	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
always	NULL
comforted	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
among	NULL
pictures	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
none	NULL
in	NULL
particular	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
allowed	NULL
the	NULL
magnificence	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
colour	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
lines	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
imagination	NULL
was	NULL
busy	NULL
with	NULL
Sally	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
London	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
an	NULL
unusual	NULL
figure	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
cornflower	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
shop	NULL
among	NULL
orchids	NULL
and	NULL
azaleas	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Kentish	NULL
hop-field	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
belong	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
blossom	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
soft	NULL
skies	NULL
of	NULL
Dorset	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
rarer	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
black	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
white	NULL
cuffs	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
wrists	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
lawn	NULL
collar	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
neck	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Have	NULL
you	NULL
been	NULL
waiting	NULL
long	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
.	NULL

Ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
.	NULL

Are	NULL
you	NULL
hungry	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
very	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
's	NULL
sit	NULL
here	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
,	NULL
shall	NULL
we	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
like	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL
quietly	NULL
,	NULL
side	NULL
by	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
speaking	NULL
.	NULL

Philip	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
having	NULL
her	NULL
near	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
warmed	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
radiant	NULL
health	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
glow	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
seemed	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
aureole	NULL
to	NULL
shine	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
have	NULL
you	NULL
been	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
false	NULL
alarm	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Was	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
glad	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

An	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
sensation	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
Sally	NULL
's	NULL
suspicion	NULL
was	NULL
well-founded	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
error	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
his	NULL
plans	NULL
were	NULL
suddenly	NULL
overthrown	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
existence	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
elaborately	NULL
pictured	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
realised	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
free	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

Free	NULL
!	NULL

He	NULL
need	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
projects	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
life	NULL
still	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
no	NULL
exhilaration	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
dismay	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
sank	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
future	NULL
stretched	NULL
out	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
desolate	NULL
emptiness	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sailed	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
waste	NULL
of	NULL
waters	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
peril	NULL
and	NULL
privation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
fair	NULL
haven	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
contrary	NULL
wind	NULL
had	NULL
arisen	NULL
and	NULL
drove	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
again	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
sea	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
let	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
dwell	NULL
on	NULL
these	NULL
soft	NULL
meads	NULL
and	NULL
pleasant	NULL
woods	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
vast	NULL
deserts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ocean	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
anguish	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
confront	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
loneliness	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tempest	NULL
.	NULL

Sally	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
clear	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
glad	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
'd	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
pleased	NULL
as	NULL
Punch	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
met	NULL
her	NULL
gaze	NULL
haggardly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
muttered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
are	NULL
funny	NULL
.	NULL

Most	NULL
men	NULL
would	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
deceived	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
self-sacrifice	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
driven	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
marrying	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
love	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
slip	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
fingers	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
seized	NULL
with	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
anything	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
Spain	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
cities	NULL
,	NULL
Cordova	NULL
,	NULL
Toledo	NULL
,	NULL
Leon	NULL
;	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
pagodas	NULL
of	NULL
Burmah	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
lagoons	NULL
of	NULL
South	NULL
Sea	NULL
Islands	NULL
?	NULL

America	NULL
was	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
followed	NULL
the	NULL
ideals	NULL
that	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
words	NULL
or	NULL
their	NULL
writings	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
instilled	NULL
into	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
the	NULL
desires	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

Always	NULL
his	NULL
course	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
swayed	NULL
by	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
do	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
by	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
whole	NULL
soul	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
aside	NULL
now	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
gesture	NULL
of	NULL
impatience	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
always	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
always	NULL
,	NULL
always	NULL
had	NULL
slipped	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
fingers	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
ideals	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
design	NULL
,	NULL
intricate	NULL
and	NULL
beautiful	NULL
,	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
myriad	NULL
,	NULL
meaningless	NULL
facts	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
:	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
simplest	NULL
pattern	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
born	NULL
,	NULL
worked	NULL
,	NULL
married	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
died	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
likewise	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
perfect	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
surrender	NULL
to	NULL
happiness	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
defeat	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
defeat	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
many	NULL
victories	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
glanced	NULL
quickly	NULL
at	NULL
Sally	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
looked	NULL
away	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
you	NULL

marry	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

done	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL
've	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

n't	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
paused	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
spoke	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
,	NULL
hoarse	NULL
whisper	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL

I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wonder	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
move	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
flicker	NULL
of	NULL
emotion	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
look	NULL

He	NULL
smiled	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
her	NULL

They	NULL

up	NULL
