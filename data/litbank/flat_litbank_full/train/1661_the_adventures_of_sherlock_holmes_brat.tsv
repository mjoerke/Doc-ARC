THE	B-PER

I	O
have	O
seldom	O
heard	O
him	O
mention	O
her	O
under	O
any	O
other	O
name	O

In	O
his	O
eyes	O
she	O
eclipses	O
and	O
predominates	O
the	O
whole	O
of	O
her	O
sex	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
that	O
he	O
felt	O
any	O
emotion	O
akin	O
to	O
love	O
for	O
Irene	B-PER
Adler	I-PER
.	O

All	O
emotions	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
one	O

were	O
abhorrent	O
to	O
his	O
cold	O

precise	O

admirably	O

mind	O

He	O
was	O

I	O
take	O
it	O

the	B-PER
most	I-PER
perfect	I-PER
reasoning	I-PER

but	O
as	O
a	B-PER
lover	I-PER
he	O
would	O
have	O
placed	O
himself	O
in	O
a	O
false	O
position	O
.	O

He	O
never	O
spoke	O
of	O
the	O
softer	O
passions	O
,	O
save	O
with	O
a	O
gibe	O
and	O
a	O
sneer	O

They	O
were	O
admirable	O
things	O
for	O
the	B-PER

excellent	O
for	O
drawing	O
the	O
veil	O
from	O

But	O
for	O
the	B-PER

reasoner	I-PER
to	O
admit	O
such	O
intrusions	O
into	O
his	O
own	O
delicate	O

finely	O
adjusted	O
temperament	O
was	O
to	O
introduce	O
a	O
distracting	O
factor	O
which	O
might	O
throw	O
a	O

upon	O
all	O

or	O
a	O
crack	O
in	O
one	O

would	O
not	O

more	O

And	O

there	O

as	O
ever	O
,	O
deeply	O
attracted	O
by	O
the	O
study	O

From	O
time	O
to	O

I	O
heard	O
some	O

account	O
of	O
his	O

As	O
I	O
passed	O
the	O
well-remembered	O
door	O

which	O
must	O
always	O
be	O
associated	O
in	O

and	O
with	O
the	O
dark	O
incidents	O
of	O
the	O
Study	O
in	O
Scarlet	O

I	O
was	O
seized	O
with	O
a	O
keen	O
desire	O
to	O
see	O
Holmes	B-PER
again	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
know	O
how	O
he	O
was	O
employing	O
his	O
extraordinary	O
powers	O

His	B-FAC
rooms	I-FAC
were	O
brilliantly	O
lit	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
even	O
as	O
I	O
looked	O
up	O

I	O
saw	O
his	B-PER
tall	I-PER

spare	I-PER
figure	I-PER
pass	O
twice	O
in	O
a	O
dark	O
silhouette	O
against	O
the	O

He	O
was	O
pacing	O
the	B-FAC
room	I-FAC
swiftly	O
,	O
eagerly	O
,	O
with	O
his	O
head	O
sunk	O
upon	O
his	O

who	O

his	O
every	O

He	O
was	O
at	O

He	O
had	O
risen	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
drug-created	O
dreams	O
and	O
was	O
hot	O
upon	O
the	O
scent	O
of	O
some	O
new	O
problem	O
.	O

I	O
rang	O
the	O
bell	O
and	O
was	O
shown	O
up	O
to	O
the	B-FAC
chamber	I-FAC
which	I-FAC
had	I-FAC
formerly	I-FAC
been	I-FAC
in	I-FAC
part	I-FAC
my	I-FAC
own	I-FAC
.	O

His	O
manner	O
was	O
not	O
effusive	O
.	O

It	O
seldom	O
was	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
glad	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
me	O

With	O
hardly	O
a	O
word	O
spoken	O
,	O
but	O
with	O
a	O
kindly	O
eye	O
,	O
he	O
waved	O
me	O
to	O
an	O
armchair	O

threw	O
across	O
his	O
case	O

and	O
indicated	O
a	O
spirit	O
case	O
and	O
a	O
gasogene	O
in	O
the	O
corner	O

Then	O
he	O
stood	O
before	O
the	O
fire	O
and	O
looked	O
me	O
over	O
in	O
his	O
singular	O
introspective	O
fashion	O

The	NULL

Some	NULL
five	NULL

during	NULL
a	NULL

I	NULL
made	NULL

murmured	NULL
Holmes	NULL
without	NULL
opening	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL

For	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
adopted	NULL
a	NULL
system	NULL
of	NULL
docketing	NULL
all	NULL
paragraphs	NULL
concerning	NULL
men	NULL

things	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
difficult	NULL

on	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL

furnish	NULL

In	NULL

I	NULL
found	NULL

II	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
three	NULL
o'clock	NULL
precisely	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
Baker	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Holmes	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
returned	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
landlady	NULL
informed	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
shortly	NULL
after	NULL
eight	NULL
o'clock	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
beside	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
awaiting	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
long	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
deeply	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
inquiry	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
surrounded	NULL
by	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
grim	NULL
and	NULL
strange	NULL
features	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
associated	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
crimes	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
already	NULL
recorded	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
exalted	NULL
station	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
client	NULL
gave	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
apart	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
investigation	NULL
which	NULL
my	NULL
friend	NULL
had	NULL
on	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
masterly	NULL
grasp	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
situation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
keen	NULL
,	NULL
incisive	NULL
reasoning	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
pleasure	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
study	NULL
his	NULL
system	NULL
of	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
the	NULL
quick	NULL
,	NULL
subtle	NULL
methods	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
disentangled	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
inextricable	NULL
mysteries	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
accustomed	NULL
was	NULL
I	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
invariable	NULL
success	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
failing	NULL
had	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
close	NULL
upon	NULL
four	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
opened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
drunken-looking	NULL
groom	NULL
,	NULL
ill-kempt	NULL
and	NULL
side-whiskered	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
inflamed	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
disreputable	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
walked	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Accustomed	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
friend	NULL
's	NULL
amazing	NULL
powers	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
disguises	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
before	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
indeed	NULL
he	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
nod	NULL
he	NULL
vanished	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bedroom	NULL
,	NULL
whence	NULL
he	NULL
emerged	NULL
in	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
tweed-suited	NULL
and	NULL
respectable	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
.	NULL

Putting	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
pockets	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
stretched	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
legs	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
and	NULL
laughed	NULL
heartily	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
minutes	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
really	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
cried	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
choked	NULL
and	NULL
laughed	NULL
again	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
lie	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
limp	NULL
and	NULL
helpless	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
chair	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
quite	NULL
too	NULL
funny	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
sure	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
guess	NULL
how	NULL
I	NULL
employed	NULL
my	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
ended	NULL
by	NULL
doing	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
imagine	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
habits	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Irene	NULL
Adler	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Quite	NULL
so	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
sequel	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
unusual	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
after	NULL
eight	NULL
o'clock	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
groom	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
wonderful	NULL
sympathy	NULL
and	NULL
freemasonry	NULL
among	NULL
horsey	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

Be	NULL
one	NULL

will	NULL
know	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL

I	NULL
soon	NULL
found	NULL
Briony	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
bijou	NULL
villa	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL

built	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL

right	NULL
up	NULL

the	NULL
road	NULL

Chubb	NULL

Large	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL

well	NULL
furnished	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
long	NULL
windows	NULL
almost	NULL

the	NULL
floor	NULL

and	NULL
those	NULL
preposterous	NULL
English	NULL
window	NULL
fasteners	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
could	NULL
open	NULL
.	NULL

Behind	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
remarkable	NULL
,	NULL
save	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
window	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
reached	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
coach-house	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
walked	NULL
round	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
examined	NULL
it	NULL
closely	NULL
from	NULL
every	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
without	NULL
noting	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
of	NULL
interest	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
then	NULL
lounged	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
expected	NULL

that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
lane	NULL
which	NULL
runs	NULL
down	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
wall	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
lent	NULL
the	NULL
ostlers	NULL
a	NULL
hand	NULL
in	NULL
rubbing	NULL
down	NULL
their	NULL
horses	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
received	NULL
in	NULL
exchange	NULL
twopence	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL
of	NULL
half	NULL
and	NULL
half	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
fills	NULL
of	NULL
shag	NULL
tobacco	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
information	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
desire	NULL
about	NULL
Miss	NULL
Adler	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
in	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
interested	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
whose	NULL
biographies	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
compelled	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
what	NULL
of	NULL
Irene	NULL
Adler	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
has	NULL
turned	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
's	NULL
heads	NULL
down	NULL

that	NULL
part	NULL

She	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
daintiest	NULL
thing	NULL

So	NULL
say	NULL
the	NULL
Serpentine-mews	NULL

a	NULL

She	NULL
lives	NULL

at	NULL
five	NULL

returns	NULL

Seldom	NULL
goes	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
other	NULL

sings	NULL

Has	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
male	NULL
visitor	NULL

a	NULL

him	NULL

never	NULL
calls	NULL

once	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
driven	NULL
him	NULL
home	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
times	NULL
from	NULL
Serpentine-mews	NULL

and	NULL
knew	NULL
all	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL

I	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
up	NULL

down	NULL
near	NULL
Briony	NULL

once	NULL
more	NULL

"	NULL
This	NULL
Godfrey	NULL
Norton	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
an	NULL
important	NULL
factor	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lawyer	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
sounded	NULL
ominous	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
relation	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL

and	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
repeated	NULL
visits	NULL
?	NULL

Was	NULL
she	NULL
his	NULL
client	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
friend	NULL

or	NULL
his	NULL
mistress	NULL
?	NULL

If	NULL
the	NULL
former	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
probably	NULL
transferred	NULL
the	NULL
photograph	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
keeping	NULL

If	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
issue	NULL

whether	NULL

continue	NULL

turn	NULL
my	NULL

a	NULL

evidently	NULL
the	NULL

shouted	NULL

the	NULL
cabman	NULL

brushed	NULL

opened	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
about	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
catch	NULL

him	NULL
in	NULL

pacing	NULL
up	NULL

down	NULL

Of	NULL
her	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL

nothing	NULL

Presently	NULL
he	NULL
emerged	NULL

looking	NULL
even	NULL

he	NULL

at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
playing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
felt	NULL
more	NULL
heartily	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
myself	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
life	NULL
than	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
creature	NULL
against	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
conspiring	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
grace	NULL
and	NULL
kindliness	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
waited	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
injured	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
blackest	NULL
treachery	NULL
to	NULL
Holmes	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
back	NULL
now	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
intrusted	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
hardened	NULL
my	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
smoke-rocket	NULL
from	NULL
under	NULL
my	NULL
ulster	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
injuring	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
are	NULL
but	NULL
preventing	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
injuring	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

Holmes	NULL
had	NULL
sat	NULL
up	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
couch	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
motion	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
maid	NULL
rushed	NULL
across	NULL
and	NULL
threw	NULL
open	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
instant	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
raise	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
signal	NULL
I	NULL
tossed	NULL
my	NULL
rocket	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
cry	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
Fire	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
word	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
sooner	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
mouth	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
crowd	NULL
of	NULL
spectators	NULL
,	NULL
well	NULL
dressed	NULL
and	NULL
ill	NULL
--	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
,	NULL
ostlers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
servant-maids	NULL
--	NULL
joined	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
shriek	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
Fire	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

Thick	NULL
clouds	NULL
of	NULL
smoke	NULL
curled	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
caught	NULL
a	NULL
glimpse	NULL
of	NULL
rushing	NULL
figures	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
later	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
of	NULL
Holmes	NULL
from	NULL
within	NULL
assuring	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
false	NULL
alarm	NULL
.	NULL

Slipping	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
shouting	NULL
crowd	NULL
I	NULL
made	NULL
my	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
was	NULL
rejoiced	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
my	NULL
friend	NULL
's	NULL
arm	NULL
in	NULL
mine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
of	NULL
uproar	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
swiftly	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
until	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
down	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
quiet	NULL
streets	NULL
which	NULL
lead	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
Edgeware	NULL
Road	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
nicely	NULL
,	NULL
Doctor	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
remarked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Nothing	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
better	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
photograph	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
how	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
showed	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
told	NULL
you	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
still	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
mystery	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
laughing	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
matter	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
simple	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
everyone	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
accomplice	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
engaged	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
guessed	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
row	NULL
broke	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
moist	NULL
red	NULL
paint	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
palm	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
rushed	NULL
forward	NULL
,	NULL
fell	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
clapped	NULL
my	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
piteous	NULL
spectacle	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
trick	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
also	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
fathom	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
they	NULL
carried	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
else	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
room	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
suspected	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
lay	NULL
between	NULL
that	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
bedroom	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
which	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
laid	NULL
me	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
couch	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
motioned	NULL
for	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
compelled	NULL
to	NULL
open	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
your	NULL
chance	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
did	NULL
that	NULL
help	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
all-important	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
thinks	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
house	NULL
is	NULL
on	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
instinct	NULL
is	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
to	NULL
rush	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
values	NULL
most	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
perfectly	NULL
overpowering	NULL
impulse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
taken	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Darlington	NULL
substitution	NULL
scandal	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
use	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
also	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Arnsworth	NULL
Castle	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
married	NULL
woman	NULL
grabs	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
baby	NULL
;	NULL
an	NULL
unmarried	NULL
one	NULL
reaches	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
jewel-box	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
our	NULL
lady	NULL
of	NULL
to-day	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
more	NULL
precious	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
than	NULL
what	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
in	NULL
quest	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
rush	NULL
to	NULL
secure	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
alarm	NULL
of	NULL
fire	NULL
was	NULL
admirably	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
smoke	NULL
and	NULL
shouting	NULL
were	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
shake	NULL
nerves	NULL
of	NULL
steel	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
responded	NULL
beautifully	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
photograph	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
recess	NULL
behind	NULL
a	NULL
sliding	NULL
panel	NULL
just	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
bell-pull	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
caught	NULL
a	NULL
glimpse	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
half-drew	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
cried	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
false	NULL
alarm	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
replaced	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
rocket	NULL
,	NULL
rushed	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
since	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
rose	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
my	NULL
excuses	NULL
,	NULL
escaped	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
hesitated	NULL
whether	NULL
to	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
secure	NULL
the	NULL
photograph	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
coachman	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL

and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
watching	NULL
me	NULL
narrowly	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
safer	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
little	NULL
over-precipitance	NULL
may	NULL
ruin	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
now	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
asked	NULL

"	NULL
Our	NULL
quest	NULL

someone	NULL

we	NULL

MY	NULL
DEAR	NULL
MR.	NULL
SHERLOCK	NULL
HOLMES	NULL
,	NULL
--	NULL
You	NULL
really	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
took	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
completely	NULL
.	NULL

Until	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
alarm	NULL
of	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
suspicion	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
how	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
betrayed	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
warned	NULL
against	NULL
you	NULL
months	NULL
ago	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
told	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
King	NULL
employed	NULL
an	NULL
agent	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
certainly	NULL
be	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
your	NULL
address	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
given	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
made	NULL
me	NULL
reveal	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
after	NULL
I	NULL
became	NULL
suspicious	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
evil	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
kind	NULL
old	NULL
clergyman	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
trained	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
actress	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL

Male	NULL
costume	NULL
is	NULL
nothing	NULL
new	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
often	NULL
take	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
freedom	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
gives	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
sent	NULL
John	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
coachman	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
watch	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
ran	NULL
up	NULL
stairs	NULL
,	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
walking-clothes	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
call	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
down	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
departed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
followed	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
your	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
made	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
an	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
interest	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
celebrated	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Sherlock	NULL
Holmes	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
imprudently	NULL
,	NULL
wished	NULL
you	NULL
good-night	NULL
,	NULL

started	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Temple	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
my	NULL
husband	NULL

We	NULL
both	NULL

what	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
without	NULL
hindrance	NULL
from	NULL
one	NULL
whom	NULL

I	NULL
keep	NULL
it	NULL

preserve	NULL
a	NULL

one	NULL
day	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL

by	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
reasoned	NULL
myself	NULL
out	NULL

the	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
I	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
anyhow	NULL

so	NULL
I	NULL
bought	NULL
a	NULL
penny	NULL
bottle	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
quill-pen	NULL

and	NULL
seven	NULL

my	NULL
surprise	NULL

everything	NULL
was	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Duncan	NULL
Ross	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
fairly	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL

He	NULL
started	NULL
me	NULL
off	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
A	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
me	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
drop	NULL

from	NULL
time	NULL

that	NULL
all	NULL

At	NULL
two	NULL

he	NULL
bade	NULL
me	NULL
good-day	NULL

complimented	NULL
me	NULL

the	NULL

Mr.	NULL

on	NULL
Saturday	NULL
the	NULL

was	NULL
the	NULL

Every	NULL
morning	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
at	NULL
ten	NULL

every	NULL

I	NULL
left	NULL

Mr.	NULL

never	NULL

leave	NULL
the	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sure	NULL

come	NULL

the	NULL
billet	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
one	NULL

suited	NULL
me	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL

that	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
risk	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL
Eight	NULL
weeks	NULL
passed	NULL
away	NULL

about	NULL

It	NULL
cost	NULL
me	NULL
something	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
pretty	NULL
nearly	NULL
filled	NULL
a	NULL
shelf	NULL

then	NULL
suddenly	NULL

no	NULL

I	NULL
went	NULL

the	NULL
door	NULL

behind	NULL
it	NULL

the	NULL

completely	NULL
overtopped	NULL
every	NULL

cried	NULL
our	NULL

flushing	NULL

the	NULL

The	NULL

it	NULL

those	NULL

waved	NULL

turned	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
heel	NULL

and	NULL
disappeared	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL

among	NULL

I	NULL
trust	NULL
that	NULL

Here	NULL

from	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL

what	NULL

about	NULL

me	NULL
the	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
drove	NULL
home	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL

Kensington	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
ominous	NULL
words	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
parted	NULL
from	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
nocturnal	NULL
expedition	NULL

and	NULL
why	NULL
should	NULL
I	NULL
go	NULL
armed	NULL

Where	NULL
were	NULL
we	NULL
going	NULL

what	NULL
were	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
hint	NULL
from	NULL
Holmes	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
smooth-faced	NULL
pawnbroker	NULL

assistant	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
formidable	NULL
man	NULL

a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
might	NULL

I	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
puzzle	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL

gave	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
despair	NULL

set	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
aside	NULL
until	NULL
night	NULL
should	NULL
bring	NULL
an	NULL
explanation	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
quarter-past	NULL
nine	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
started	NULL
from	NULL

made	NULL
my	NULL
way	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
Park	NULL

through	NULL

I	NULL
entered	NULL

On	NULL
entering	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL

so	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
a	NULL

of	NULL
cards	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL

as	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
partie	NULL
carrée	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
your	NULL

after	NULL
all	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
enemy	NULL
's	NULL
preparations	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
risk	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
first	NULL

all	NULL

we	NULL

choose	NULL
our	NULL
positions	NULL

we	NULL

them	NULL

they	NULL

us	NULL
some	NULL

stand	NULL
behind	NULL

do	NULL
you	NULL

yourselves	NULL
behind	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
flash	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL

close	NULL
in	NULL
swiftly	NULL

If	NULL

I	NULL
placed	NULL
my	NULL

cocked	NULL

upon	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wooden	NULL

behind	NULL

I	NULL
crouched	NULL

Holmes	NULL
shot	NULL

left	NULL

such	NULL
an	NULL

never	NULL

worked	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL

What	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
!	NULL

From	NULL
comparing	NULL
notes	NULL
afterwards	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
almost	NULL
gone	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
dawn	NULL
be	NULL
breaking	NULL
above	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
limbs	NULL
were	NULL
weary	NULL
and	NULL
stiff	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
feared	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
my	NULL
position	NULL
;	NULL
yet	NULL
my	NULL
nerves	NULL
were	NULL
worked	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
highest	NULL
pitch	NULL
of	NULL
tension	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
my	NULL
hearing	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
acute	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
gentle	NULL
breathing	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
companions	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
distinguish	NULL
the	NULL
deeper	NULL
,	NULL
heavier	NULL
in-breath	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bulky	NULL
Jones	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
sighing	NULL
note	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bank	NULL
director	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
my	NULL
position	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
look	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
my	NULL
eyes	NULL
caught	NULL
the	NULL
glint	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
lurid	NULL
spark	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
stone	NULL
pavement	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
it	NULL
lengthened	NULL
out	NULL
until	NULL
it	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
yellow	NULL
line	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
warning	NULL
or	NULL
sound	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
gash	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
open	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
hand	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
womanly	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
felt	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
area	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
writhing	NULL
fingers	NULL
,	NULL
protruded	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
withdrawn	NULL
as	NULL
suddenly	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
dark	NULL
again	NULL
save	NULL
the	NULL
single	NULL
lurid	NULL
spark	NULL
which	NULL
marked	NULL
a	NULL
chink	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
stones	NULL
.	NULL

Its	NULL
disappearance	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
momentary	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
rending	NULL
,	NULL
tearing	NULL
sound	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
broad	NULL
,	NULL
white	NULL
stones	NULL
turned	NULL
over	NULL
upon	NULL
its	NULL
side	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
a	NULL
square	NULL
,	NULL
gaping	NULL
hole	NULL
,	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
streamed	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
lantern	NULL
.	NULL

Over	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
there	NULL
peeped	NULL
a	NULL
clean-cut	NULL
,	NULL
boyish	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
looked	NULL
keenly	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
either	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
aperture	NULL
,	NULL
drew	NULL
itself	NULL
shoulder-high	NULL
and	NULL
waist-high	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
one	NULL
knee	NULL
rested	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
another	NULL
instant	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hole	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
hauling	NULL
after	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
companion	NULL
,	NULL
lithe	NULL
and	NULL
small	NULL
like	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

a	NULL
shock	NULL

very	NULL
red	NULL
hair	NULL

Sherlock	NULL
Holmes	NULL
had	NULL
sprung	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
seized	NULL
the	NULL

by	NULL
the	NULL
collar	NULL

down	NULL

heard	NULL
the	NULL

house	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
could	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
assistant	NULL
's	NULL
fondness	NULL
for	NULL
photography	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
trick	NULL
of	NULL
vanishing	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
cellar	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
cellar	NULL
!	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
tangled	NULL
clue	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
made	NULL
inquiries	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
mysterious	NULL
assistant	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
deal	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
coolest	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
daring	NULL
criminals	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cellar	NULL
--	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
took	NULL
many	NULL
hours	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
for	NULL
months	NULL
on	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
could	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
save	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
running	NULL
a	NULL
tunnel	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
building	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
So	NULL
far	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
visit	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
of	NULL
action	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
surprised	NULL
you	NULL
by	NULL
beating	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
pavement	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
stick	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
ascertaining	NULL
whether	NULL
the	NULL
cellar	NULL
stretched	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
or	NULL
behind	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
rang	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
hoped	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
assistant	NULL
answered	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
skirmishes	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
set	NULL
eyes	NULL
upon	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
hardly	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
knees	NULL
were	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
must	NULL
yourself	NULL
have	NULL
remarked	NULL
how	NULL
worn	NULL
,	NULL
wrinkled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stained	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
hours	NULL
of	NULL
burrowing	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
remaining	NULL
point	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
burrowing	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
walked	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
City	NULL
and	NULL
Suburban	NULL
Bank	NULL
abutted	NULL
on	NULL
our	NULL
friend	NULL
's	NULL
premises	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
solved	NULL
my	NULL
problem	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
you	NULL
drove	NULL
home	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
concert	NULL
I	NULL
called	NULL
upon	NULL
Scotland	NULL
Yard	NULL
and	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
chairman	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bank	NULL
directors	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
how	NULL
could	NULL
you	NULL
tell	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
their	NULL
attempt	NULL
to-night	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
closed	NULL
their	NULL
League	NULL
offices	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

they	NULL

no	NULL

presence	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL

,	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
completed	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
essential	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
use	NULL
it	NULL
soon	NULL

as	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL

would	NULL

it	NULL

all	NULL

I	NULL
expected	NULL

no	NULL

the	NULL

Sherlock	NULL

welcomed	NULL

the	NULL

for	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
remarkable	NULL

bowed	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL

he	NULL
looked	NULL
her	NULL
over	NULL

the	NULL

was	NULL
peculiar	NULL

him	NULL

suddenly	NULL
realising	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
shy	NULL
man	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Holmes	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
rather	NULL
walk	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
daylight	NULL

for	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
conspicuous	NULL
.	NULL

Very	NULL
retiring	NULL
and	NULL
gentlemanly	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
was	NULL
gentle	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
'd	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
quinsy	NULL
and	NULL
swollen	NULL
glands	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL

it	NULL

left	NULL
him	NULL

a	NULL
weak	NULL
throat	NULL

a	NULL
hesitating	NULL

whispering	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
well	NULL
dressed	NULL

very	NULL
neat	NULL

plain	NULL

his	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
weak	NULL

just	NULL

he	NULL
wore	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

and	NULL
what	NULL
happened	NULL
when	NULL
Mr.	NULL

returned	NULL
to	NULL
France	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Hosmer	NULL
Angel	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
proposed	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
marry	NULL
before	NULL
father	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
dreadful	NULL
earnest	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
me	NULL
swear	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
hands	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Testament	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
whatever	NULL
happened	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
always	NULL
be	NULL
true	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Mother	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
me	NULL
swear	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
passion	NULL
.	NULL

Mother	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
favour	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
even	NULL
fonder	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
marrying	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
about	NULL
father	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
both	NULL
said	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
mind	NULL
about	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
just	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
quite	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Holmes	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
funny	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
ask	NULL
his	NULL
leave	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
years	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
me	NULL

but	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sly	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
father	NULL
at	NULL
Bordeaux	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL
has	NULL
its	NULL
French	NULL
offices	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
morning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wedding	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
missed	NULL
him	NULL

then	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

sir	NULL

just	NULL
before	NULL
it	NULL
arrived	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Ha	NULL
!	NULL

that	NULL
was	NULL
unfortunate	NULL
.	NULL

Your	NULL
wedding	NULL
was	NULL
arranged	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Friday	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
church	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
very	NULL
quietly	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
at	NULL
St.	NULL
Saviour	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
near	NULL
King	NULL
's	NULL
Cross	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
breakfast	NULL
afterwards	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
St.	NULL
Pancras	NULL
Hotel	NULL
.	NULL

Hosmer	NULL
came	NULL
for	NULL
us	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
hansom	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
us	NULL
both	NULL
into	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
stepped	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
four-wheeler	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
other	NULL
cab	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
four-wheeler	NULL
drove	NULL
up	NULL
we	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
step	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
cabman	NULL
got	NULL
down	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
box	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
there	NULL
!	NULL

The	NULL
cabman	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
imagine	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
get	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
last	NULL
Friday	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Holmes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
or	NULL
heard	NULL
anything	NULL
since	NULL
then	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
any	NULL
light	NULL
upon	NULL
what	NULL
became	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
seems	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
shamefully	NULL
treated	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Holmes	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL
!	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
good	NULL
and	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
me	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
saying	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
whatever	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
true	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
something	NULL
quite	NULL
unforeseen	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
separate	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
pledged	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
claim	NULL
his	NULL
pledge	NULL
sooner	NULL
or	NULL
later	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
strange	NULL
talk	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
wedding-morning	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
what	NULL
has	NULL
happened	NULL
since	NULL
gives	NULL
a	NULL
meaning	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Most	NULL
certainly	NULL
it	NULL
does	NULL
.	NULL

Your	NULL
own	NULL
opinion	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
unforeseen	NULL
catastrophe	NULL
has	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
foresaw	NULL
some	NULL
danger	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
else	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
talked	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
foresaw	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
notion	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
None	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
One	NULL
more	NULL
question	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
did	NULL
your	NULL
mother	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
your	NULL
father	NULL
?	NULL

Did	NULL
you	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
hear	NULL
of	NULL
Hosmer	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
interest	NULL
could	NULL
anyone	NULL
have	NULL
in	NULL
bringing	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
doors	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
leaving	NULL
me	NULL
?	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
borrowed	NULL
my	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
me	NULL
and	NULL
got	NULL
my	NULL
money	NULL
settled	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
some	NULL
reason	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Hosmer	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
independent	NULL
about	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
would	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
shilling	NULL
of	NULL
mine	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
happened	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
why	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
write	NULL
?	NULL

Oh	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
drives	NULL
me	NULL
half-mad	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
sleep	NULL
a	NULL
wink	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
pulled	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
muff	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
sob	NULL
heavily	NULL
into	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
glance	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Holmes	NULL

rising	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
shall	NULL
reach	NULL
some	NULL

Let	NULL
the	NULL

Pon	NULL
my	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
Watson	NULL

you	NULL
are	NULL
coming	NULL
along	NULL
wonderfully	NULL

You	NULL
have	NULL
really	NULL
done	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
indeed	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
missed	NULL
everything	NULL
of	NULL
importance	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
hit	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
method	NULL

and	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
eye	NULL
for	NULL
colour	NULL

Never	NULL
trust	NULL
to	NULL
general	NULL
impressions	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
concentrate	NULL
yourself	NULL
upon	NULL
details	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
first	NULL
glance	NULL
is	NULL
always	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
sleeve	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
perhaps	NULL
better	NULL
first	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
knee	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
trouser	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
you	NULL
observe	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
woman	NULL
had	NULL
plush	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
sleeves	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
useful	NULL
material	NULL
for	NULL
showing	NULL
traces	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
double	NULL
line	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
wrist	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
typewritist	NULL
presses	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
beautifully	NULL
defined	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sewing-machine	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
type	NULL

leaves	NULL
a	NULL
similar	NULL
mark	NULL

only	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
arm	NULL

and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
farthest	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
thumb	NULL

instead	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
right	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
broadest	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
then	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
observing	NULL
the	NULL
dint	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
pince-nez	NULL
at	NULL
either	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
nose	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
ventured	NULL
a	NULL
remark	NULL
upon	NULL
short	NULL
sight	NULL
and	NULL
typewriting	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
surprise	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
surprised	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
,	NULL
surely	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
obvious	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
much	NULL
surprised	NULL
and	NULL
interested	NULL
on	NULL
glancing	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
observe	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
boots	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
wearing	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
unlike	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
really	NULL
odd	NULL
ones	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
slightly	NULL
decorated	NULL
toe-cap	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
a	NULL
plain	NULL
one	NULL

One	NULL
was	NULL
buttoned	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
lower	NULL
buttons	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
five	NULL

the	NULL
other	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL

fifth	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
lady	NULL
,	NULL
otherwise	NULL
neatly	NULL
dressed	NULL
,	NULL
has	NULL
come	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
home	NULL
with	NULL
odd	NULL
boots	NULL

half-buttoned	NULL

it	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
great	NULL
deduction	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
away	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
hurry	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
what	NULL
else	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
asked	NULL
,	NULL
keenly	NULL
interested	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
always	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
my	NULL
friend	NULL
's	NULL
incisive	NULL
reasoning	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
noted	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
passing	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
a	NULL
note	NULL
before	NULL
leaving	NULL
home	NULL
but	NULL
after	NULL
being	NULL
fully	NULL
dressed	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
observed	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
right	NULL
glove	NULL
was	NULL
torn	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
forefinger	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
you	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
apparently	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
both	NULL
glove	NULL
and	NULL
finger	NULL
were	NULL
stained	NULL
with	NULL
violet	NULL
ink	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
hurry	NULL
and	NULL
dipped	NULL
her	NULL
pen	NULL
too	NULL
deep	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
mark	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
remain	NULL
clear	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
finger	NULL

up	NULL

with	NULL

head	NULL
sunk	NULL
upon	NULL

breast	NULL

up	NULL

corner	NULL

mantelpiece	NULL

,	NULL
leaning	NULL
back	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
in	NULL

began	NULL
talking	NULL

rather	NULL
to	NULL

the	NULL
money	NULL

the	NULL
daughter	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL

she	NULL
lived	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
considerable	NULL
sum	NULL

for	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
position	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
serious	NULL
difference	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL

preserve	NULL
it	NULL

The	NULL
daughter	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL

affectionate	NULL

that	NULL

was	NULL
evident	NULL

with	NULL
her	NULL
fair	NULL

her	NULL
little	NULL
income	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
remain	NULL
single	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
would	NULL
mean	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL

the	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL

a	NULL
year	NULL

so	NULL
what	NULL
does	NULL
her	NULL
stepfather	NULL
do	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
it	NULL

He	NULL
takes	NULL
the	NULL
obvious	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
keeping	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL

forbidding	NULL
her	NULL

seek	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL

age	NULL

But	NULL
soon	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
forever	NULL

She	NULL
became	NULL
restive	NULL

insisted	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
rights	NULL

and	NULL
finally	NULL
announced	NULL
her	NULL
positive	NULL
intention	NULL

going	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
ball	NULL

What	NULL
does	NULL
her	NULL
clever	NULL
stepfather	NULL
do	NULL
then	NULL

He	NULL
conceives	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
more	NULL

his	NULL
heart	NULL

With	NULL
the	NULL
connivance	NULL
and	NULL
assistance	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
he	NULL
disguised	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
covered	NULL
those	NULL
keen	NULL
eyes	NULL
with	NULL
tinted	NULL
glasses	NULL
,	NULL
masked	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

bushy	NULL
whiskers	NULL

sunk	NULL

and	NULL
doubly	NULL
secure	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL

sight	NULL
,	NULL

appears	NULL
as	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Hosmer	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
joke	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL

groaned	NULL
our	NULL
visitor	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
never	NULL
thought	NULL

"	NULL
Very	NULL
likely	NULL
not	NULL

However	NULL
that	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
lady	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
decidedly	NULL
carried	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
quite	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
stepfather	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
France	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
suspicion	NULL
of	NULL
treachery	NULL
never	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
entered	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
flattered	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
gentleman	NULL
's	NULL
attentions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
was	NULL
increased	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
loudly	NULL
expressed	NULL
admiration	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Angel	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
obvious	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
pushed	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
effect	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
produced	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
meetings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
engagement	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
finally	NULL
secure	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
affections	NULL
from	NULL
turning	NULL
towards	NULL
anyone	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
deception	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
kept	NULL
up	NULL
forever	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
pretended	NULL
journeys	NULL
to	NULL
France	NULL
were	NULL
rather	NULL
cumbrous	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
was	NULL
clearly	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
the	NULL
business	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
dramatic	NULL
manner	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
leave	NULL
a	NULL
permanent	NULL
impression	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
lady	NULL

prevent	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
looking	NULL
upon	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
suitor	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL

Hence	NULL
those	NULL
vows	NULL
of	NULL
fidelity	NULL
exacted	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
Testament	NULL

The	NULL

after	NULL
the	NULL

when	NULL
William	NULL

The	NULL

thickly	NULL

fourteen	NULL

the	NULL
daughter	NULL

the	NULL
lodge-keeper	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Boscombe	NULL
Valley	NULL
estate	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
woods	NULL
picking	NULL
flowers	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
states	NULL
that	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL
border	NULL

the	NULL
wood	NULL

close	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
lake	NULL

Mr.	NULL
McCarthy	NULL

his	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
violent	NULL
quarrel	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
heard	NULL
Mr.	NULL
McCarthy	NULL
the	NULL
elder	NULL
using	NULL
very	NULL
strong	NULL
language	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL

she	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL
raise	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
to	NULL
strike	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
frightened	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
violence	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
ran	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
reached	NULL
home	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
McCarthys	NULL
quarrelling	NULL
near	NULL
Boscombe	NULL

,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
fight	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
hardly	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
when	NULL
young	NULL
Mr.	NULL
McCarthy	NULL
came	NULL
running	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
lodge	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
dead	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wood	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
help	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lodge-keeper	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
excited	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
either	NULL
his	NULL
gun	NULL
or	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
right	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
sleeve	NULL
were	NULL
observed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
stained	NULL
with	NULL
fresh	NULL
blood	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
following	NULL
him	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
body	NULL
stretched	NULL
out	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
beside	NULL
the	NULL
pool	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
head	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
beaten	NULL
in	NULL
by	NULL
repeated	NULL
blows	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
heavy	NULL
and	NULL
blunt	NULL
weapon	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
injuries	NULL
were	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
might	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
inflicted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
butt-end	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL

was	NULL
found	NULL
lying	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
paces	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

Under	NULL
these	NULL

the	NULL

instantly	NULL
arrested	NULL

a	NULL
verdict	NULL

it	NULL

the	NULL

,	NULL
looking	NULL
out	NULL

him	NULL
get	NULL

out	NULL

though	NULL
I	NULL

took	NULL

out	NULL

the	NULL
direction	NULL

the	NULL
Boscombe	NULL

On	NULL
my	NULL

I	NULL

William	NULL

the	NULL
game-keeper	NULL

as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
stated	NULL
in	NULL

he	NULL
is	NULL
mistaken	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL

was	NULL
in	NULL

When	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL

from	NULL
the	NULL

I	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
cry	NULL
of	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL
usual	NULL
signal	NULL
between	NULL
my	NULL

I	NULL
then	NULL
hurried	NULL
forward	NULL

found	NULL
him	NULL
standing	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
pool	NULL

He	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
much	NULL
surprised	NULL
at	NULL
seeing	NULL
me	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
me	NULL
rather	NULL
roughly	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
there	NULL

A	NULL
conversation	NULL
ensued	NULL
which	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
high	NULL

almost	NULL
to	NULL

for	NULL
my	NULL
father	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL

a	NULL
very	NULL
violent	NULL
temper	NULL

Seeing	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL

becoming	NULL
ungovernable	NULL

I	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL

returned	NULL

had	NULL
not	NULL
gone	NULL
more	NULL

150	NULL

however	NULL

when	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
hideous	NULL
outcry	NULL
behind	NULL
me	NULL

which	NULL
caused	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL

I	NULL
found	NULL
my	NULL
father	NULL
expiring	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL

with	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
terribly	NULL
injured	NULL

I	NULL
dropped	NULL
my	NULL

and	NULL
held	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
arms	NULL

he	NULL
almost	NULL
instantly	NULL
expired	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL
walked	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL

then	NULL
wandered	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
town	NULL

finally	NULL
returning	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL

where	NULL
I	NULL
lay	NULL

the	NULL
sofa	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
interest	NULL
myself	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
yellow-backed	NULL
novel	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
puny	NULL
plot	NULL

the	NULL
story	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
thin	NULL

however	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
compared	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
deep	NULL
mystery	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
groping	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
my	NULL
attention	NULL
wander	NULL
so	NULL
continually	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
action	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
flung	NULL
it	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
myself	NULL
up	NULL
entirely	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
consideration	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
events	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Supposing	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
unhappy	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
story	NULL
were	NULL
absolutely	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
what	NULL
hellish	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
absolutely	NULL
unforeseen	NULL
and	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
calamity	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
occurred	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
parted	NULL

his	NULL
father	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
drawn	NULL
back	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
screams	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
rushed	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
glade	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
terrible	NULL
and	NULL
deadly	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
could	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
?	NULL

Might	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
injuries	NULL
reveal	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
medical	NULL
instincts	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
rang	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
weekly	NULL
county	NULL
paper	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
contained	NULL
a	NULL
verbatim	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
inquest	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
surgeon	NULL
's	NULL
deposition	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
stated	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
posterior	NULL
third	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
parietal	NULL
bone	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
occipital	NULL
bone	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
shattered	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
blow	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
blunt	NULL
weapon	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
marked	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
upon	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

Clearly	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
blow	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
struck	NULL
from	NULL
behind	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
extent	NULL
in	NULL
favour	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
accused	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
when	NULL
seen	NULL
quarrelling	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
face	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
for	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
older	NULL
man	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
turned	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
blow	NULL
fell	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
worth	NULL
while	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
Holmes	NULL
'	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
peculiar	NULL
dying	NULL
reference	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
rat	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
could	NULL
that	NULL
mean	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
delirium	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
man	NULL
dying	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
blow	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
commonly	NULL
become	NULL
delirious	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
an	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
his	NULL
fate	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
what	NULL
could	NULL
it	NULL
indicate	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
cudgelled	NULL
my	NULL
brains	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
some	NULL
possible	NULL
explanation	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
incident	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
grey	NULL
cloth	NULL
seen	NULL
by	NULL
young	NULL
McCarthy	NULL

If	NULL
that	NULL

true	NULL
the	NULL
murderer	NULL

have	NULL
dropped	NULL
some	NULL
part	NULL

his	NULL
dress	NULL

presumably	NULL
his	NULL
overcoat	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
flight	NULL

and	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
hardihood	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL

carry	NULL
it	NULL
away	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
instant	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
son	NULL

Ah	NULL

thereby	NULL
hangs	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
painful	NULL

This	NULL

madly	NULL

insanely	NULL

in	NULL

with	NULL

some	NULL
two	NULL

when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL

before	NULL
he	NULL
really	NULL
knew	NULL
her	NULL

away	NULL
five	NULL

what	NULL

No	NULL

you	NULL
can	NULL
imagine	NULL
how	NULL
maddening	NULL
it	NULL

him	NULL

eyes	NULL

what	NULL
he	NULL

absolutely	NULL
impossible	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
sheer	NULL
frenzy	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL

which	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
throw	NULL

him	NULL

It	NULL

come	NULL
out	NULL

however	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL

finding	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL

in	NULL
serious	NULL
trouble	NULL
and	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
hanged	NULL

has	NULL
thrown	NULL
him	NULL
over	NULL
utterly	NULL

that	NULL
there	NULL

no	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
bit	NULL

news	NULL
has	NULL
consoled	NULL
young	NULL

for	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL

suffered	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
innocent	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Ah	NULL
!	NULL

who	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
would	NULL
call	NULL
your	NULL
attention	NULL
very	NULL
particularly	NULL
to	NULL
two	NULL
points	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
murdered	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
appointment	NULL
with	NULL
someone	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
pool	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
someone	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
was	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
return	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
second	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
murdered	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
heard	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
'	NULL
Cooee	NULL
!	NULL
'	NULL

before	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
had	NULL
returned	NULL
.	NULL

Those	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
crucial	NULL
points	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
depends	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
let	NULL
us	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
George	NULL
Meredith	NULL

if	NULL
you	NULL
please	NULL

and	NULL
we	NULL

all	NULL

Sherlock	NULL
Holmes	NULL
was	NULL
transformed	NULL
when	NULL

was	NULL
hot	NULL
upon	NULL
such	NULL

scent	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
known	NULL
the	NULL
quiet	NULL
thinker	NULL
and	NULL
logician	NULL
of	NULL
Baker	NULL
Street	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
failed	NULL
to	NULL
recognise	NULL
him	NULL

His	NULL
face	NULL
flushed	NULL
and	NULL
darkened	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
brows	NULL
were	NULL
drawn	NULL
into	NULL
two	NULL
hard	NULL
black	NULL
lines	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
shone	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
beneath	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
steely	NULL
glitter	NULL

His	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
bent	NULL
downward	NULL

his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
bowed	NULL

his	NULL
lips	NULL
compressed	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
veins	NULL
stood	NULL
out	NULL
like	NULL
whipcord	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
long	NULL

sinewy	NULL
neck	NULL

His	NULL

seemed	NULL
to	NULL
dilate	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
purely	NULL
animal	NULL
lust	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
chase	NULL

and	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
absolutely	NULL
concentrated	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL

him	NULL

a	NULL

fell	NULL
unheeded	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL

only	NULL
provoked	NULL

Swiftly	NULL
and	NULL
silently	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
track	NULL
which	NULL
ran	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
meadows	NULL

and	NULL
so	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
woods	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Boscombe	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
damp	NULL

there	NULL
were	NULL
marks	NULL

many	NULL
feet	NULL

both	NULL

would	NULL
hurry	NULL
on	NULL

stop	NULL
dead	NULL

I	NULL

about	NULL

ran	NULL
up	NULL

down	NULL

traced	NULL

lay	NULL
down	NULL
once	NULL

satisfaction	NULL

For	NULL

he	NULL
remained	NULL
there	NULL

turning	NULL
over	NULL

struck	NULL
us	NULL

although	NULL
they	NULL
impressed	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
favour	NULL

you	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL

One	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL

before	NULL

him	NULL

The	NULL
other	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
singular	NULL
dying	NULL
reference	NULL

mumbled	NULL
several	NULL

that	NULL

all	NULL
that	NULL
caught	NULL
the	NULL

Now	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
double	NULL
point	NULL
our	NULL
research	NULL
must	NULL
commence	NULL

and	NULL
we	NULL
will	NULL
begin	NULL
it	NULL
by	NULL
presuming	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL

and	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
Ballarat	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
wonderful	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
obvious	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
narrowed	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
down	NULL
considerably	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
grey	NULL
garment	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
third	NULL
point	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
granting	NULL
the	NULL
son	NULL
's	NULL
statement	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
correct	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
certainty	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
now	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
mere	NULL
vagueness	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
definite	NULL
conception	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
Australian	NULL
from	NULL
Ballarat	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
grey	NULL
cloak	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Certainly	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
district	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL
pool	NULL
can	NULL
only	NULL
be	NULL
approached	NULL
by	NULL

the	NULL
estate	NULL

where	NULL
strangers	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
wander	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Quite	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
comes	NULL
our	NULL
expedition	NULL
of	NULL
to-day	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
an	NULL
examination	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
I	NULL
gained	NULL
the	NULL
trifling	NULL
details	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
gave	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
imbecile	NULL
Lestrade	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
personality	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
criminal	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
how	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL
gain	NULL
them	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
know	NULL
my	NULL
method	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
founded	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
observation	NULL
of	NULL
trifles	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
His	NULL
height	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
might	NULL
roughly	NULL
judge	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
length	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
stride	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
boots	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
told	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
traces	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
peculiar	NULL
boots	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
his	NULL
lameness	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
impression	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
right	NULL
foot	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
less	NULL
distinct	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
left	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
less	NULL
weight	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
?	NULL

Because	NULL
he	NULL
limped	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
lame	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
his	NULL
left-handedness	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
were	NULL
yourself	NULL
struck	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
injury	NULL
as	NULL
recorded	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
surgeon	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
inquest	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
blow	NULL
was	NULL
struck	NULL
from	NULL
immediately	NULL
behind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
was	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
can	NULL
that	NULL
be	NULL
unless	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
left-handed	NULL
man	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
stood	NULL
behind	NULL
that	NULL
tree	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
interview	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
son	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
even	NULL
smoked	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
ash	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cigar	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
my	NULL
special	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
tobacco	NULL
ashes	NULL
enables	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
pronounce	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
Indian	NULL
cigar	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
devoted	NULL
some	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
written	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
monograph	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ashes	NULL
of	NULL
140	NULL
different	NULL
varieties	NULL
of	NULL
pipe	NULL
,	NULL
cigar	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cigarette	NULL
tobacco	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
ash	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
then	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
and	NULL
discovered	NULL
the	NULL
stump	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
moss	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
tossed	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
Indian	NULL
cigar	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
variety	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
rolled	NULL
in	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
the	NULL
cigar-holder	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL

Therefore	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
a	NULL

The	NULL
tip	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL

bitten	NULL
off	NULL

but	NULL
the	NULL
cut	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
clean	NULL
one	NULL

so	NULL
I	NULL
deduced	NULL
a	NULL
blunt	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
there	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
talking	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL

so	NULL
I	NULL
smoked	NULL
a	NULL
cigar	NULL

waited	NULL
behind	NULL

until	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
alone	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
talk	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
black	NULL
and	NULL
bitter	NULL
in	NULL
me	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
uppermost	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
urging	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
my	NULL
daughter	NULL
with	NULL
as	NULL
little	NULL
regard	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
think	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
slut	NULL
from	NULL
off	NULL

It	NULL
drove	NULL
me	NULL
mad	NULL

think	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL

all	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
held	NULL
most	NULL
dear	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL

Could	NULL
I	NULL

snap	NULL
the	NULL
bond	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
a	NULL

man	NULL

Though	NULL
clear	NULL

mind	NULL

fairly	NULL
strong	NULL
of	NULL
limb	NULL

I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL

sealed	NULL

But	NULL
my	NULL
memory	NULL

my	NULL

!	NULL

Both	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
saved	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
but	NULL
silence	NULL
that	NULL
foul	NULL
tongue	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL

Mr.	NULL

I	NULL
would	NULL

again	NULL

Deeply	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL

entangled	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

which	NULL
held	NULL
me	NULL

more	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL

if	NULL
he	NULL

been	NULL
some	NULL

His	NULL
cry	NULL
brought	NULL
back	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
gained	NULL

a	NULL

fortune	NULL

his	NULL

The	NULL

I	NULL
signed	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
as	NULL
directed	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
lawyer	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL

The	NULL
singular	NULL
incident	NULL
made	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
may	NULL
think	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
deepest	NULL
impression	NULL
upon	NULL
me	NULL

I	NULL
pondered	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL

turned	NULL
it	NULL
every	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
without	NULL
being	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
anything	NULL

Yet	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
shake	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
vague	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
dread	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
left	NULL
behind	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
sensation	NULL
grew	NULL
less	NULL
keen	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
weeks	NULL
passed	NULL
and	NULL
nothing	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
disturb	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
routine	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
lives	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
uncle	NULL

however	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
drank	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
inclined	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
.	NULL

Most	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
spend	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
locked	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
inside	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
emerge	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
drunken	NULL
frenzy	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
burst	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
tear	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
revolver	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
screaming	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
cooped	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
sheep	NULL

When	NULL
these	NULL
hot	NULL
fits	NULL
were	NULL
over	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
rush	NULL
tumultuously	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL

bar	NULL
it	NULL

against	NULL
the	NULL

At	NULL
such	NULL

who	NULL

my	NULL

you	NULL

Now	NULL
let	NULL
us	NULL
consider	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
deduced	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
may	NULL
start	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
presumption	NULL
that	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Openshaw	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
very	NULL
strong	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
leaving	NULL
America	NULL
.	NULL

Men	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
change	NULL
all	NULL
their	NULL
habits	NULL
and	NULL
exchange	NULL
willingly	NULL
the	NULL
charming	NULL
climate	NULL
of	NULL
Florida	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
lonely	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
English	NULL
provincial	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
extreme	NULL
love	NULL
of	NULL
solitude	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
suggests	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
someone	NULL
or	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
we	NULL
may	NULL
assume	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
working	NULL
hypothesis	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
someone	NULL
or	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
drove	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
America	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
feared	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
can	NULL
only	NULL
deduce	NULL
that	NULL
by	NULL
considering	NULL
the	NULL
formidable	NULL
letters	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
received	NULL
by	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
successors	NULL
.	NULL

Did	NULL
you	NULL
remark	NULL
the	NULL
postmarks	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
letters	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
first	NULL
was	NULL
from	NULL
Pondicherry	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
from	NULL

,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
from	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
From	NULL
East	NULL
London	NULL

What	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
deduce	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
are	NULL
all	NULL
seaports	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
the	NULL
writer	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
board	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
ship	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Excellent	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
have	NULL
already	NULL
a	NULL
clue	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
probability	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
strong	NULL
probability	NULL
--	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
writer	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
board	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
ship	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
let	NULL
us	NULL
consider	NULL
another	NULL
point	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
Pondicherry	NULL
,	NULL
seven	NULL
weeks	NULL
elapsed	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
threat	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
fulfilment	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Dundee	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
some	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

Does	NULL
that	NULL
suggest	NULL
anything	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
A	NULL
greater	NULL
distance	NULL
to	NULL
travel	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
had	NULL
also	NULL
a	NULL
greater	NULL
distance	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
is	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
a	NULL
presumption	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
vessel	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
or	NULL
men	NULL
are	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
sailing-ship	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
looks	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
always	NULL
send	NULL
their	NULL
singular	NULL
warning	NULL
or	NULL
token	NULL
before	NULL
them	NULL
when	NULL
starting	NULL
upon	NULL
their	NULL
mission	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
quickly	NULL
the	NULL
deed	NULL
followed	NULL
the	NULL
sign	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
Dundee	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
Pondicherry	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
steamer	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
arrived	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
their	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
seven	NULL
weeks	NULL
elapsed	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
those	NULL
seven	NULL
weeks	NULL
represented	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
mail-boat	NULL
which	NULL
brought	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sailing	NULL
vessel	NULL
which	NULL
brought	NULL
the	NULL
writer	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
More	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
probable	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
you	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
deadly	NULL
urgency	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
new	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
why	NULL
I	NULL
urged	NULL
young	NULL
Openshaw	NULL
to	NULL
caution	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
blow	NULL
has	NULL
always	NULL
fallen	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
senders	NULL
to	NULL
travel	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
one	NULL
comes	NULL
from	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
therefore	NULL
we	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
count	NULL
upon	NULL
delay	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Good	NULL
God	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
cried	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
can	NULL
it	NULL
mean	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
relentless	NULL
persecution	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
papers	NULL
which	NULL
Openshaw	NULL
carried	NULL
are	NULL
obviously	NULL
of	NULL
vital	NULL
importance	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
person	NULL
or	NULL
persons	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sailing-ship	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
quite	NULL
clear	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
single	NULL
man	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
carried	NULL
out	NULL
two	NULL

in	NULL
such	NULL

way	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
deceive	NULL
a	NULL

There	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
several	NULL

the	NULL
fanciful	NULL
resemblance	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
produced	NULL
by	NULL
cocking	NULL
a	NULL
rifle	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
terrible	NULL
secret	NULL
society	NULL
was	NULL
formed	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
ex-Confederate	NULL
soldiers	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Southern	NULL
states	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
Civil	NULL
War	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
rapidly	NULL
formed	NULL
local	NULL
branches	NULL
in	NULL
different	NULL
parts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL

notably	NULL
in	NULL
Tennessee	NULL
,	NULL
Louisiana	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Carolinas	NULL
,	NULL
Georgia	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Florida	NULL
.	NULL

Its	NULL
power	NULL
was	NULL
used	NULL
for	NULL
political	NULL
purposes	NULL
,	NULL
principally	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
terrorising	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
negro	NULL
voters	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
murdering	NULL
and	NULL
driving	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
opposed	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
views	NULL
.	NULL

Its	NULL
outrages	NULL
were	NULL
usually	NULL
preceded	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
warning	NULL
sent	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
marked	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
fantastic	NULL

generally	NULL
recognised	NULL

some	NULL
parts	NULL

melon	NULL

On	NULL
receiving	NULL
this	NULL
the	NULL
victim	NULL
might	NULL
either	NULL
openly	NULL
abjure	NULL
his	NULL
former	NULL
ways	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
might	NULL
fly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
braved	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
death	NULL
would	NULL
unfailingly	NULL
come	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
usually	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
strange	NULL
and	NULL
unforeseen	NULL
manner	NULL

So	NULL
perfect	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
organisation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
systematic	NULL
its	NULL
methods	NULL

that	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
hardly	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL

where	NULL
any	NULL
man	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
braving	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
impunity	NULL

or	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
outrages	NULL
were	NULL
traced	NULL
home	NULL

the	NULL
perpetrators	NULL

For	NULL
some	NULL

the	NULL

flourished	NULL
in	NULL

Eventually	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

THE	NULL

College	NULL

St.	NULL
George	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
addicted	NULL
to	NULL
opium	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
habit	NULL
grew	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
foolish	NULL
freak	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
college	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
having	NULL
read	NULL
De	NULL
Quincey	NULL
's	NULL
description	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
dreams	NULL
and	NULL
sensations	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
drenched	NULL
his	NULL
tobacco	NULL
with	NULL
laudanum	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
produce	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
effects	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
more	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
practice	NULL
is	NULL
easier	NULL
to	NULL
attain	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
he	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
slave	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
drug	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
mingled	NULL
horror	NULL
and	NULL
pity	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
and	NULL
relatives	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
can	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
yellow	NULL
,	NULL
pasty	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
drooping	NULL
lids	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pin-point	NULL
pupils	NULL

all	NULL
huddled	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
wreck	NULL
and	NULL
ruin	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
noble	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
night	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
June	NULL
,	NULL
'	NULL
89	NULL
--	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
ring	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
bell	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
gives	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
yawn	NULL
and	NULL
glances	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
clock	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
sat	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
my	NULL
wife	NULL
laid	NULL
her	NULL
needle-work	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
lap	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
disappointment	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
A	NULL
patient	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
'll	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL

"	NULL

I	NULL
groaned	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
newly	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
weary	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
hurried	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
quick	NULL
steps	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
linoleum	NULL
.	NULL

Our	NULL
own	NULL
door	NULL
flew	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
lady	NULL
,	NULL
clad	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
dark-coloured	NULL
stuff	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
veil	NULL
,	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
will	NULL
excuse	NULL
my	NULL
calling	NULL
so	NULL
late	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
losing	NULL
her	NULL
self-control	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
ran	NULL
forward	NULL
,	NULL
threw	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
about	NULL
my	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
neck	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sobbed	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
shoulder	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
trouble	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
cried	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
want	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
help	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
my	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
pulling	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
veil	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
Kate	NULL
Whitney	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
you	NULL
startled	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
Kate	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
who	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
came	NULL
straight	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

Folk	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
grief	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
wife	NULL
like	NULL
birds	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
light-house	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
sweet	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
some	NULL
wine	NULL
and	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sit	NULL
here	NULL
comfortably	NULL
and	NULL
tell	NULL
us	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
should	NULL
you	NULL
rather	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
sent	NULL
James	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
want	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
's	NULL
advice	NULL
and	NULL
help	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
about	NULL
Isa	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
has	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
home	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
so	NULL
frightened	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
trouble	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
doctor	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
wife	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
friend	NULL
and	NULL
school	NULL
companion	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
soothed	NULL
and	NULL
comforted	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
such	NULL
words	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
.	NULL

Did	NULL
she	NULL
know	NULL
where	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
was	NULL
?	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
bring	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
seems	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
surest	NULL
information	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
fit	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
opium	NULL
den	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
farthest	NULL
east	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
City	NULL
.	NULL

Hitherto	NULL
his	NULL
orgies	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
confined	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
twitching	NULL
and	NULL
shattered	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL
spell	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
eight-and-forty	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
lay	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
doubtless	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
dregs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
docks	NULL
,	NULL
breathing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
poison	NULL
or	NULL
sleeping	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
effects	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Bar	NULL
of	NULL
Gold	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Upper	NULL
Swandam	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
and	NULL
timid	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
into	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
and	NULL
pluck	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
ruffians	NULL
who	NULL
surrounded	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
way	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Might	NULL
I	NULL
not	NULL
escort	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
place	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
should	NULL
she	NULL
come	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
Isa	NULL
Whitney	NULL
's	NULL
medical	NULL
adviser	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
such	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
influence	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
manage	NULL
it	NULL
better	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
were	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
promised	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
word	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
send	NULL
him	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cab	NULL
within	NULL
two	NULL
hours	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
indeed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
address	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
so	NULL
in	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
my	NULL
armchair	NULL
and	NULL
cheery	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
behind	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
speeding	NULL
eastward	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
hansom	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
errand	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
only	NULL
could	NULL
show	NULL
how	NULL
strange	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
great	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
stage	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
adventure	NULL
.	NULL

Upper	NULL
Swandam	NULL
Lane	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
vile	NULL
alley	NULL
lurking	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
wharves	NULL
which	NULL
line	NULL
the	NULL
north	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
east	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
Bridge	NULL
.	NULL

Between	NULL
a	NULL
slop-shop	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
gin-shop	NULL
,	NULL
approached	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
steep	NULL
flight	NULL
of	NULL
steps	NULL
leading	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
gap	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
mouth	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cave	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
den	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
search	NULL
.	NULL

Ordering	NULL
my	NULL
cab	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
passed	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
steps	NULL
,	NULL
worn	NULL
hollow	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
ceaseless	NULL
tread	NULL
of	NULL
drunken	NULL
feet	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
flickering	NULL
oil-lamp	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
latch	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
my	NULL
way	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
low	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
thick	NULL
and	NULL
heavy	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
brown	NULL
opium	NULL
smoke	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
terraced	NULL
with	NULL
wooden	NULL
berths	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
forecastle	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
emigrant	NULL
ship	NULL
.	NULL

Through	NULL
the	NULL
gloom	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
dimly	NULL
catch	NULL
a	NULL
glimpse	NULL
of	NULL
bodies	NULL
lying	NULL
in	NULL
strange	NULL
fantastic	NULL
poses	NULL
,	NULL
bowed	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
bent	NULL
knees	NULL
,	NULL
heads	NULL
thrown	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
chins	NULL
pointing	NULL
upward	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
lack-lustre	NULL
eye	NULL
turned	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
newcomer	NULL
.	NULL

Out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
shadows	NULL
there	NULL
glimmered	NULL
little	NULL
red	NULL
circles	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
bright	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
faint	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
burning	NULL
poison	NULL
waxed	NULL
or	NULL
waned	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bowls	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
metal	NULL
pipes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
most	NULL
lay	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
some	NULL
muttered	NULL
to	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
others	NULL
talked	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
,	NULL
low	NULL
,	NULL
monotonous	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
conversation	NULL
coming	NULL
in	NULL
gushes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
suddenly	NULL
tailing	NULL
off	NULL
into	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
mumbling	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
thoughts	NULL
and	NULL
paying	NULL
little	NULL
heed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
neighbour	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
farther	NULL
end	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
brazier	NULL
of	NULL
burning	NULL
charcoal	NULL
,	NULL
beside	NULL
which	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
three-legged	NULL
wooden	NULL
stool	NULL
there	NULL
sat	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
thin	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
jaw	NULL
resting	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
two	NULL
fists	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
elbows	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
,	NULL
staring	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
entered	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sallow	NULL
Malay	NULL
attendant	NULL
had	NULL
hurried	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pipe	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
supply	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
drug	NULL
,	NULL
beckoning	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
empty	NULL
berth	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Thank	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL

said	NULL
I.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
movement	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
exclamation	NULL
from	NULL
my	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
peering	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
gloom	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
Whitney	NULL
,	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
haggard	NULL

unkempt	NULL

staring	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL

He	NULL
sank	NULL
his	NULL

onto	NULL
his	NULL

began	NULL
to	NULL
sob	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL

walked	NULL
down	NULL

I	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL

a	NULL

glanced	NULL
down	NULL

he	NULL
sat	NULL
now	NULL

I	NULL
took	NULL
two	NULL
steps	NULL
forward	NULL

looked	NULL
back	NULL

It	NULL
took	NULL
all	NULL
my	NULL

prevent	NULL
me	NULL

breaking	NULL
out	NULL

It	NULL

that	NULL

Whitney	NULL

I	NULL

out	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL

walking	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL

For	NULL

he	NULL
shuffled	NULL
along	NULL

Then	NULL

he	NULL
straightened	NULL

Last	NULL
Monday	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Neville	NULL
St.	NULL
Clair	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
town	NULL
rather	NULL
earlier	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
remarking	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
started	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
two	NULL
important	NULL
commissions	NULL

perform	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
bring	NULL
his	NULL
little	NULL

home	NULL
a	NULL
box	NULL
of	NULL
bricks	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
merest	NULL
chance	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
received	NULL
a	NULL
telegram	NULL
upon	NULL
this	NULL
same	NULL
Monday	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
shortly	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
departure	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
parcel	NULL
of	NULL
considerable	NULL
value	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
expecting	NULL
was	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
offices	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Aberdeen	NULL
Shipping	NULL
Company	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
well	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
your	NULL
London	NULL

you	NULL
will	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL

in	NULL
Fresno	NULL

out	NULL

Upper	NULL
Swandam	NULL

where	NULL
you	NULL
found	NULL
me	NULL
to-night	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
St.	NULL
Clair	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
lunch	NULL
,	NULL
started	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
City	NULL

did	NULL
some	NULL
shopping	NULL

proceeded	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL

got	NULL
her	NULL
packet	NULL

found	NULL
herself	NULL
at	NULL
exactly	NULL
4:35	NULL
walking	NULL
through	NULL
Swandam	NULL
Lane	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL

Have	NULL
you	NULL
followed	NULL
me	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL

It	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
remember	NULL
,	NULL
Monday	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
hot	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
St.	NULL
Clair	NULL
walked	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
glancing	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
a	NULL
cab	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
walking	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
down	NULL
Swandam	NULL
Lane	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
suddenly	NULL
heard	NULL
an	NULL
ejaculation	NULL
or	NULL
cry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
struck	NULL
cold	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
looking	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
beckoning	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
second-floor	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
window	NULL
was	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
distinctly	NULL
saw	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
describes	NULL
as	NULL
being	NULL
terribly	NULL
agitated	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
waved	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
frantically	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
vanished	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
so	NULL
suddenly	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
plucked	NULL
back	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
irresistible	NULL
force	NULL
from	NULL
behind	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
singular	NULL
point	NULL
which	NULL
struck	NULL
her	NULL
quick	NULL
feminine	NULL
eye	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
although	NULL
he	NULL
wore	NULL
some	NULL
dark	NULL
coat	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
on	NULL
neither	NULL
collar	NULL
nor	NULL
necktie	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Convinced	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
was	NULL
amiss	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
rushed	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
steps	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
was	NULL
none	NULL
other	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
opium	NULL
den	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
you	NULL
found	NULL
me	NULL
to-night	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
running	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
room	NULL
she	NULL
attempted	NULL
to	NULL
ascend	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
which	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
floor	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
met	NULL
this	NULL
Lascar	NULL
scoundrel	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
spoken	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
thrust	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
aided	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
Dane	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
acts	NULL
as	NULL
assistant	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
pushed	NULL
her	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

Filled	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
maddening	NULL
doubts	NULL
and	NULL
fears	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
rushed	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
rare	NULL
good-fortune	NULL
,	NULL
met	NULL
in	NULL
Fresno	NULL
Street	NULL
a	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
constables	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
inspector	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
beat	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
inspector	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
men	NULL
accompanied	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
continued	NULL
resistance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
proprietor	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
made	NULL
their	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Mr.	NULL
St.	NULL
Clair	NULL
had	NULL
last	NULL
been	NULL
seen	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
floor	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
save	NULL
a	NULL
crippled	NULL
wretch	NULL
of	NULL
hideous	NULL
aspect	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seems	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
home	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

Both	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Lascar	NULL
stoutly	NULL
swore	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
room	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
determined	NULL
was	NULL
their	NULL
denial	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
inspector	NULL
was	NULL
staggered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
almost	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
St.	NULL
Clair	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
deluded	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
cry	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
sprang	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
deal	NULL
box	NULL
which	NULL
lay	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
and	NULL
tore	NULL
the	NULL
lid	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Out	NULL
there	NULL
fell	NULL
a	NULL
cascade	NULL
of	NULL
children	NULL
's	NULL
bricks	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
toy	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
This	NULL
discovery	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
evident	NULL
confusion	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
cripple	NULL
showed	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
inspector	NULL
realise	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
was	NULL
serious	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rooms	NULL
were	NULL
carefully	NULL
examined	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
results	NULL
all	NULL
pointed	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
abominable	NULL
crime	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
front	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
plainly	NULL
furnished	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
and	NULL
led	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
bedroom	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
looked	NULL
out	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wharves	NULL
.	NULL

Between	NULL
the	NULL
wharf	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
bedroom	NULL
window	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
narrow	NULL
strip	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
dry	NULL
at	NULL
low	NULL
tide	NULL
but	NULL
is	NULL
covered	NULL
at	NULL
high	NULL
tide	NULL
with	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
four	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
feet	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bedroom	NULL
window	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
broad	NULL
one	NULL
and	NULL
opened	NULL
from	NULL
below	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
examination	NULL
traces	NULL
of	NULL
blood	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
windowsill	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
several	NULL
scattered	NULL
drops	NULL
were	NULL
visible	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
wooden	NULL
floor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bedroom	NULL
.	NULL

Thrust	NULL
away	NULL
behind	NULL
a	NULL
curtain	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
room	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
clothes	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Neville	NULL
St.	NULL
Clair	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
exception	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
coat	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
boots	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
socks	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
watch	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
were	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
signs	NULL
of	NULL
violence	NULL
upon	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
garments	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
traces	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Neville	NULL
St.	NULL
Clair	NULL
.	NULL

Out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
apparently	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
exit	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
discovered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
ominous	NULL
bloodstains	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
sill	NULL
gave	NULL
little	NULL
promise	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
save	NULL
himself	NULL
by	NULL
swimming	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
tide	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
very	NULL
highest	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tragedy	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
now	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
villains	NULL
who	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
immediately	NULL
implicated	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Lascar	NULL
was	NULL
known	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vilest	NULL
antecedents	NULL

as	NULL

was	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL
very	NULL
few	NULL
seconds	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL

appearance	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
an	NULL
accessory	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
crime	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
defence	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
absolute	NULL
ignorance	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
protested	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
knowledge	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
doings	NULL
of	NULL
Hugh	NULL
Boone	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
lodger	NULL

that	NULL

much	NULL

the	NULL
last	NULL

rested	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

Inspector	NULL

a	NULL
very	NULL

without	NULL

anything	NULL

One	NULL
mistake	NULL

made	NULL

arresting	NULL
Boone	NULL
instantly	NULL

as	NULL
he	NULL

allowed	NULL
some	NULL

this	NULL

searched	NULL

without	NULL
anything	NULL

found	NULL

incriminate	NULL
him	NULL

There	NULL

true	NULL

some	NULL
blood-stains	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
right	NULL

his	NULL
ring-finger	NULL

which	NULL
had	NULL

cut	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
nail	NULL

explained	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

came	NULL
from	NULL

adding	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL

been	NULL

that	NULL
the	NULL
stains	NULL
which	NULL

there	NULL
came	NULL
doubtless	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

He	NULL
denied	NULL
strenuously	NULL
having	NULL
ever	NULL
seen	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Neville	NULL
St.	NULL

and	NULL
swore	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL

the	NULL

upon	NULL

the	NULL
hope	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL

found	NULL

feared	NULL

Neville	NULL
St.	NULL
Clair	NULL

which	NULL
lay	NULL
uncovered	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
tide	NULL
receded	NULL

And	NULL
what	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
think	NULL

found	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

Sherlock	NULL

sprang	NULL
out	NULL

galvanised	NULL

She	NULL
stood	NULL
smiling	NULL

holding	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
slip	NULL
of	NULL
paper	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
May	NULL
I	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
snatched	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eagerness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
smoothing	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
he	NULL
drew	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
lamp	NULL
and	NULL
examined	NULL
it	NULL
intently	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
my	NULL
chair	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
gazing	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL

The	NULL
envelope	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

was	NULL
stamped	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
perceive	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
whoever	NULL

to	NULL
go	NULL

inquire	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

How	NULL

you	NULL
tell	NULL

either	NULL

convinced	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL

to	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
preparing	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
all-night	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL

a	NULL
box	NULL

the	NULL

him	NULL

there	NULL

an	NULL

his	NULL

he	NULL

It	NULL

no	NULL

was	NULL
twenty-five	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
hardly	NULL
finished	NULL

Holmes	NULL
returned	NULL

the	NULL

he	NULL

pulling	NULL

where	NULL

asked	NULL

He	NULL
led	NULL

down	NULL

opened	NULL

down	NULL

us	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL

as	NULL

extremely	NULL

the	NULL

right	NULL
across	NULL
it	NULL

by	NULL

turned	NULL
up	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL
three	NULL

were	NULL
exposed	NULL

A	NULL
shock	NULL
of	NULL
very	NULL
bright	NULL

low	NULL
over	NULL

opened	NULL
the	NULL

spoke	NULL

took	NULL
out	NULL

man	NULL

face	NULL
peeled	NULL
off	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
sponge	NULL
like	NULL

bark	NULL
from	NULL

Gone	NULL

the	NULL
twisted	NULL

which	NULL

given	NULL
the	NULL

A	NULL

there	NULL

Then	NULL
suddenly	NULL

my	NULL
story	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
father	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
schoolmaster	NULL
in	NULL
Chesterfield	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
I	NULL
received	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
education	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
travelled	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
youth	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
stage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finally	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
reporter	NULL
on	NULL
an	NULL
evening	NULL
paper	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
my	NULL
editor	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
series	NULL
of	NULL
articles	NULL
upon	NULL
begging	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
metropolis	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
volunteered	NULL
to	NULL
supply	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
all	NULL
my	NULL
adventures	NULL
started	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
trying	NULL
begging	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
amateur	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
base	NULL
my	NULL
articles	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
an	NULL
actor	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
learned	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
secrets	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
famous	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
green-room	NULL
for	NULL
my	NULL
skill	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
took	NULL
advantage	NULL
now	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
attainments	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
painted	NULL
my	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
myself	NULL
as	NULL
pitiable	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
I	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
scar	NULL
and	NULL
fixed	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
lip	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
twist	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
aid	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
slip	NULL
of	NULL
flesh-coloured	NULL
plaster	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
red	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
appropriate	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
took	NULL
my	NULL
station	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
business	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
,	NULL
ostensibly	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
match-seller	NULL
but	NULL
really	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
beggar	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
seven	NULL
hours	NULL
I	NULL
plied	NULL
my	NULL
trade	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
returned	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
surprise	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
received	NULL
no	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wrote	NULL
my	NULL
articles	NULL

thought	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
until	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
later	NULL

I	NULL
backed	NULL
a	NULL
bill	NULL
for	NULL

had	NULL
a	NULL
writ	NULL

to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
idea	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
begged	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
's	NULL
grace	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
creditor	NULL
,	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
holiday	NULL
from	NULL
my	NULL

and	NULL
spent	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
begging	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
City	NULL
under	NULL
my	NULL
disguise	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
ten	NULL
days	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
paid	NULL
the	NULL
debt	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
imagine	NULL
how	NULL
hard	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
settle	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
arduous	NULL
work	NULL
at	NULL
2	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
earn	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
by	NULL
smearing	NULL
my	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
paint	NULL
,	NULL
laying	NULL
my	NULL
cap	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sitting	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
fight	NULL
between	NULL
my	NULL
pride	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
dollars	NULL
won	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
threw	NULL
up	NULL
reporting	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
first	NULL
chosen	NULL
,	NULL
inspiring	NULL
pity	NULL
by	NULL
my	NULL
ghastly	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
filling	NULL
my	NULL
pockets	NULL
with	NULL
coppers	NULL
.	NULL

Only	NULL
one	NULL
man	NULL
knew	NULL
my	NULL
secret	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
keeper	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
den	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
lodge	NULL
in	NULL
Swandam	NULL
Lane	NULL

where	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
every	NULL
morning	NULL
emerge	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
squalid	NULL
beggar	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evenings	NULL
transform	NULL
myself	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
well-dressed	NULL
man	NULL
about	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
Lascar	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
paid	NULL
by	NULL
me	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
rooms	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL

safe	NULL

his	NULL
possession	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
soon	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
saving	NULL
considerable	NULL
sums	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
beggar	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
could	NULL
earn	NULL
700	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
my	NULL
average	NULL
takings	NULL

but	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
exceptional	NULL
advantages	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
also	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
facility	NULL
of	NULL
repartee	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
improved	NULL
by	NULL
practice	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
me	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
recognised	NULL
character	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
City	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
day	NULL
a	NULL
stream	NULL
of	NULL
pennies	NULL
,	NULL
varied	NULL
by	NULL
silver	NULL
,	NULL
poured	NULL
in	NULL
upon	NULL
me	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
bad	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
failed	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
2	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
As	NULL
I	NULL
grew	NULL
richer	NULL
I	NULL
grew	NULL
more	NULL
ambitious	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
eventually	NULL
married	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
anyone	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
suspicion	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
real	NULL
occupation	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
dear	NULL
wife	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
business	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
City	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
little	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Last	NULL
Monday	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
dressing	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
room	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
opium	NULL
den	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
looked	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
window	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
horror	NULL
and	NULL
astonishment	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
wife	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
fixed	NULL
full	NULL
upon	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
cry	NULL
of	NULL
surprise	NULL
,	NULL
threw	NULL
up	NULL
my	NULL
arms	NULL
to	NULL
cover	NULL
my	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
rushing	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
confidant	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Lascar	NULL
,	NULL
entreated	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
anyone	NULL
from	NULL
coming	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
downstairs	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
ascend	NULL
.	NULL

Swiftly	NULL
I	NULL
threw	NULL
off	NULL
my	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
pulled	NULL
on	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
beggar	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
pigments	NULL
and	NULL
wig	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
pierce	NULL
so	NULL
complete	NULL
a	NULL
disguise	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
search	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
clothes	NULL
might	NULL
betray	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
threw	NULL
open	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
reopening	NULL
by	NULL
my	NULL
violence	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
cut	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
inflicted	NULL
upon	NULL
myself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bedroom	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
seized	NULL
my	NULL
coat	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
weighted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
coppers	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
transferred	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
leather	NULL
bag	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
carried	NULL
my	NULL
takings	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
hurled	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
disappeared	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
Thames	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
other	NULL
clothes	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
followed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
rush	NULL
of	NULL
constables	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
stair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
after	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
confess	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
relief	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
identified	NULL
as	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Neville	NULL
St.	NULL
Clair	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
arrested	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
murderer	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
preserve	NULL
my	NULL
disguise	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hence	NULL
my	NULL
preference	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
dirty	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

Knowing	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
wife	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
terribly	NULL
anxious	NULL

I	NULL
slipped	NULL
off	NULL
my	NULL

confided	NULL
it	NULL

THE	NULL
ADVENTURE	NULL
OF	NULL
THE	NULL
BLUE	NULL
CARBUNCLE	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
called	NULL
upon	NULL
my	NULL
friend	NULL
Sherlock	NULL
Holmes	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
morning	NULL
after	NULL
Christmas	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
wishing	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
compliments	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
lounging	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
purple	NULL
dressing-gown	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
pipe-rack	NULL
within	NULL
his	NULL
reach	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
pile	NULL
of	NULL
crumpled	NULL
morning	NULL
papers	NULL
,	NULL
evidently	NULL
newly	NULL
studied	NULL
,	NULL
near	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

Beside	NULL
the	NULL
couch	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
wooden	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
angle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
hung	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
seedy	NULL
and	NULL
disreputable	NULL
hard-felt	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
worse	NULL
for	NULL
wear	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cracked	NULL
in	NULL
several	NULL
places	NULL

A	NULL
lens	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
forceps	NULL
lying	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
seat	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chair	NULL
suggested	NULL

was	NULL
returning	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
small	NULL
jollification	NULL

was	NULL
making	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
homeward	NULL
down	NULL
Tottenham	NULL
Court	NULL

In	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
gaslight	NULL

a	NULL
tallish	NULL

walking	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

carrying	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL

smashed	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

an	NULL

him	NULL

dropped	NULL
his	NULL

he	NULL

have	NULL
bitterly	NULL
regretted	NULL

me	NULL
and	NULL
my	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
place	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
safe	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
on	NULL
some	NULL
commission	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
made	NULL
for	NULL
my	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
named	NULL
Oakshott	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
Brixton	NULL
Road	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
fattened	NULL
fowls	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
market	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
there	NULL
every	NULL
man	NULL
I	NULL
met	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
policeman	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
detective	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sweat	NULL
was	NULL
pouring	NULL
down	NULL
my	NULL
face	NULL
before	NULL
I	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Brixton	NULL
Road	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
sister	NULL
asked	NULL
me	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
why	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
pale	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
upset	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
jewel	NULL
robbery	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
yard	NULL
and	NULL
smoked	NULL
a	NULL
pipe	NULL
and	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL
once	NULL
called	NULL
Maudsley	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bad	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
has	NULL
just	NULL
been	NULL
serving	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
Pentonville	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
ways	NULL
of	NULL
thieves	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
stole	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
true	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
things	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
right	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
Kilburn	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
lived	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
take	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
confidence	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
show	NULL
me	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
the	NULL
stone	NULL
into	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
safety	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
agonies	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
through	NULL
in	NULL
coming	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
might	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
moment	NULL
be	NULL
seized	NULL
and	NULL
searched	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
stone	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
waistcoat	NULL
pocket	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
leaning	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
geese	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
waddling	NULL
about	NULL
round	NULL
my	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
suddenly	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
head	NULL
which	NULL
showed	NULL
me	NULL
how	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
beat	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
detective	NULL
that	NULL
ever	NULL
lived	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
sister	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
some	NULL
weeks	NULL
before	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
pick	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
geese	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
Christmas	NULL
present	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
as	NULL
good	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
my	NULL
goose	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
carry	NULL
my	NULL
stone	NULL
to	NULL
Kilburn	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
shed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
yard	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
behind	NULL
this	NULL
I	NULL
drove	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
birds	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
big	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
barred	NULL
tail	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
caught	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
prying	NULL
its	NULL
bill	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
thrust	NULL
the	NULL
stone	NULL
down	NULL
its	NULL
throat	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
my	NULL
finger	NULL
could	NULL
reach	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bird	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
gulp	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
stone	NULL
pass	NULL
along	NULL
its	NULL
gullet	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
its	NULL
crop	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
creature	NULL
flapped	NULL
and	NULL
struggled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
came	NULL
my	NULL
sister	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL

broke	NULL

fluttered	NULL

Shortly	NULL
after	NULL

my	NULL
mother	NULL
died	NULL

was	NULL
killed	NULL
eight	NULL
years	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
railway	NULL
accident	NULL
near	NULL
Crewe	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Roylott	NULL

abandoned	NULL
his	NULL
attempts	NULL

establish	NULL
himself	NULL

London	NULL

took	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
ancestral	NULL
house	NULL
at	NULL
Stoke	NULL
Moran	NULL

The	NULL

which	NULL
my	NULL

left	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL

there	NULL
seemed	NULL

be	NULL
no	NULL

happiness	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
a	NULL
terrible	NULL
change	NULL
came	NULL
over	NULL
our	NULL
stepfather	NULL
about	NULL
this	NULL

Instead	NULL

visits	NULL

shut	NULL
himself	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL

seldom	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL

indulge	NULL

ferocious	NULL

Violence	NULL

been	NULL
hereditary	NULL

A	NULL
series	NULL
of	NULL
disgraceful	NULL

two	NULL
of	NULL

ended	NULL
in	NULL

absolutely	NULL

anger	NULL

"	NULL
Last	NULL
week	NULL
he	NULL
hurled	NULL
the	NULL
local	NULL
blacksmith	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
parapet	NULL

a	NULL
stream	NULL

it	NULL

gather	NULL
together	NULL

I	NULL

able	NULL
to	NULL
avert	NULL
another	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
friends	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
save	NULL
the	NULL
wandering	NULL

he	NULL

bramble-covered	NULL

a	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
unable	NULL

find	NULL
any	NULL

death	NULL

My	NULL
evidence	NULL
showed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
fastened	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
inner	NULL
side	NULL

the	NULL

shutters	NULL

Two	NULL

some	NULL

started	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
west	NULL
wing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

my	NULL
bedroom	NULL

pierced	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL

had	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL

in	NULL

my	NULL

and	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

Imagine	NULL

then	NULL

my	NULL
thrill	NULL

terror	NULL
when	NULL
last	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
lay	NULL
awake	NULL

thinking	NULL
over	NULL

I	NULL
suddenly	NULL
heard	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL

the	NULL
night	NULL
the	NULL
low	NULL

which	NULL
had	NULL

I	NULL

nothing	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL
slipped	NULL
down	NULL

got	NULL
a	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL
Crown	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL

Holmes	NULL
pushed	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
frill	NULL

black	NULL

fringed	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
that	NULL
lay	NULL
upon	NULL

Five	NULL

There	NULL

a	NULL
long	NULL

Holmes	NULL
leaned	NULL

"	NULL

At	NULL
Waterloo	NULL
we	NULL

fortunate	NULL

catching	NULL
a	NULL
train	NULL
for	NULL
Leatherhead	NULL

where	NULL

hired	NULL
a	NULL

drove	NULL
for	NULL
four	NULL

five	NULL
miles	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

To	NULL
me	NULL
at	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
contrast	NULL
between	NULL

this	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

Holmes	NULL

after	NULL
a	NULL

with	NULL

A	NULL

led	NULL

Holmes	NULL
refused	NULL

so	NULL
we	NULL
passed	NULL

after	NULL
the	NULL

A	NULL
brown	NULL
chest	NULL

stood	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
corner	NULL

a	NULL
narrow	NULL
white-counterpaned	NULL
bed	NULL

a	NULL
dressing-table	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
left-hand	NULL

the	NULL
window	NULL

These	NULL
articles	NULL

with	NULL
two	NULL

made	NULL
up	NULL

a	NULL
square	NULL

The	NULL

brown	NULL

that	NULL
it	NULL

Holmes	NULL
drew	NULL
one	NULL

the	NULL

a	NULL
corner	NULL

sat	NULL
silent	NULL

while	NULL
his	NULL

round	NULL

up	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
at	NULL

pointing	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL

hung	NULL
down	NULL
beside	NULL
the	NULL

it	NULL

You	NULL
will	NULL
excuse	NULL
me	NULL

threw	NULL
himself	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
lens	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL

crawled	NULL
swiftly	NULL

some	NULL

running	NULL

Finally	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL

gave	NULL
it	NULL

Sherlock	NULL
Holmes	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
engaging	NULL
a	NULL
bedroom	NULL

sitting-room	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Crown	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
upper	NULL

from	NULL
our	NULL

command	NULL
a	NULL

the	NULL
inhabited	NULL

At	NULL
dusk	NULL
we	NULL
saw	NULL
Dr.	NULL

Roylott	NULL
drive	NULL
past	NULL

his	NULL

up	NULL

the	NULL

him	NULL

The	NULL

had	NULL
some	NULL
slight	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
undoing	NULL
the	NULL

and	NULL
we	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
doctor	NULL

saw	NULL
the	NULL
fury	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
shook	NULL
his	NULL

at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
trap	NULL
drove	NULL
on	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
later	NULL
we	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL

light	NULL
spring	NULL
up	NULL

the	NULL

just	NULL
at	NULL

As	NULL
we	NULL
passed	NULL
out	NULL
he	NULL
exchanged	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
words	NULL
with	NULL

that	NULL

out	NULL

threw	NULL
itself	NULL

across	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
broke	NULL

his	NULL

to	NULL

slipping	NULL
off	NULL

My	NULL

closed	NULL

moved	NULL

cast	NULL

creeping	NULL
up	NULL

the	NULL
box	NULL
of	NULL
matches	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
stump	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
candle	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
lamp	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
left	NULL
in	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
shall	NULL
I	NULL
ever	NULL
forget	NULL
that	NULL
dreadful	NULL
vigil	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
hear	NULL
a	NULL
sound	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
drawing	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
breath	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
companion	NULL
sat	NULL
open-eyed	NULL
,	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
feet	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
nervous	NULL
tension	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
shutters	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
ray	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
waited	NULL
in	NULL
absolute	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
outside	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
occasional	NULL
cry	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
night-bird	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
once	NULL
at	NULL
our	NULL
very	NULL
window	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
drawn	NULL
catlike	NULL
whine	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
told	NULL
us	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
cheetah	NULL
was	NULL
indeed	NULL
at	NULL
liberty	NULL
.	NULL

Far	NULL
away	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
deep	NULL
tones	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
parish	NULL
clock	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
boomed	NULL
out	NULL
every	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
long	NULL
they	NULL
seemed	NULL
,	NULL
those	NULL
quarters	NULL
!	NULL

Twelve	NULL
struck	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
and	NULL
three	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
we	NULL
sat	NULL
waiting	NULL
silently	NULL
for	NULL
whatever	NULL
might	NULL
befall	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
momentary	NULL
gleam	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ventilator	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
vanished	NULL
immediately	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
was	NULL
succeeded	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
smell	NULL
of	NULL
burning	NULL
oil	NULL
and	NULL
heated	NULL
metal	NULL
.	NULL

Someone	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
room	NULL
had	NULL
lit	NULL
a	NULL
dark-lantern	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
gentle	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
movement	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
smell	NULL
grew	NULL
stronger	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
I	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
straining	NULL
ears	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
suddenly	NULL
another	NULL
sound	NULL
became	NULL
audible	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
gentle	NULL
,	NULL
soothing	NULL
sound	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
jet	NULL
of	NULL
steam	NULL
escaping	NULL
continually	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
kettle	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
instant	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
heard	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
Holmes	NULL
sprang	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
struck	NULL
a	NULL
match	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lashed	NULL
furiously	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
cane	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bell-pull	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
Watson	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
yelled	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
when	NULL
Holmes	NULL
struck	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
,	NULL
clear	NULL
whistle	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
sudden	NULL
glare	NULL
flashing	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
weary	NULL
eyes	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
my	NULL
friend	NULL
lashed	NULL
so	NULL
savagely	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
deadly	NULL
pale	NULL
and	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
horror	NULL
and	NULL
loathing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
strike	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
gazing	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
ventilator	NULL
when	NULL
suddenly	NULL
there	NULL
broke	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
horrible	NULL
cry	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
ever	NULL
listened	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
swelled	NULL
up	NULL
louder	NULL
and	NULL
louder	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
hoarse	NULL
yell	NULL
of	NULL
pain	NULL
and	NULL
fear	NULL
and	NULL
anger	NULL
all	NULL
mingled	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
dreadful	NULL
shriek	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
away	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
distant	NULL
parsonage	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
cry	NULL
raised	NULL
the	NULL
sleepers	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
beds	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
struck	NULL
cold	NULL
to	NULL
our	NULL
hearts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
stood	NULL
gazing	NULL
at	NULL
Holmes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
echoes	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
away	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
rose	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
can	NULL
it	NULL
mean	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
gasped	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
means	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Holmes	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
.	NULL

Take	NULL
your	NULL
pistol	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
will	NULL
enter	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Roylott	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
grave	NULL
face	NULL
he	NULL
lit	NULL
the	NULL
lamp	NULL
and	NULL
led	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
corridor	NULL
.	NULL

Twice	NULL
he	NULL
struck	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
chamber	NULL
door	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
reply	NULL
from	NULL
within	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
the	NULL
handle	NULL
and	NULL
entered	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
heels	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
cocked	NULL
pistol	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
singular	NULL
sight	NULL
which	NULL
met	NULL
our	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
stood	NULL
a	NULL
dark-lantern	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
shutter	NULL
half	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
throwing	NULL
a	NULL
brilliant	NULL
beam	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
iron	NULL
safe	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
ajar	NULL
.	NULL

Beside	NULL
this	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
wooden	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
sat	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Grimesby	NULL
Roylott	NULL
clad	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
grey	NULL
dressing-gown	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
bare	NULL
ankles	NULL
protruding	NULL
beneath	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
thrust	NULL
into	NULL
red	NULL
heelless	NULL
Turkish	NULL
slippers	NULL
.	NULL

Across	NULL
his	NULL
lap	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
short	NULL
stock	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
lash	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
noticed	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
chin	NULL
was	NULL
cocked	NULL
upward	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
fixed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dreadful	NULL
,	NULL
rigid	NULL
stare	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ceiling	NULL
.	NULL

Round	NULL
his	NULL
brow	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
yellow	NULL
band	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
brownish	NULL
speckles	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
bound	NULL
tightly	NULL
round	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
we	NULL
entered	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
neither	NULL
sound	NULL
nor	NULL
motion	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
band	NULL
!	NULL

the	NULL
speckled	NULL
band	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
whispered	NULL
Holmes	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
forward	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
his	NULL
strange	NULL
headgear	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
reared	NULL
itself	NULL
from	NULL
among	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
the	NULL
squat	NULL
diamond-shaped	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
puffed	NULL
neck	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
loathsome	NULL
serpent	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
swamp	NULL
adder	NULL

"	NULL
cried	NULL
Holmes	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
deadliest	NULL
snake	NULL
in	NULL
India	NULL

He	NULL
has	NULL
died	NULL
within	NULL
ten	NULL
seconds	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
bitten	NULL
.	NULL

Violence	NULL
does	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
recoil	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
violent	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL

into	NULL
the	NULL
pit	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
digs	NULL
for	NULL
another	NULL

Let	NULL
us	NULL
thrust	NULL
this	NULL
creature	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
its	NULL
den	NULL

and	NULL
we	NULL
can	NULL
then	NULL
remove	NULL
Miss	NULL
Stoner	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
shelter	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL
police	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
has	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
he	NULL
drew	NULL
the	NULL
dog-whip	NULL
swiftly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
lap	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
throwing	NULL
the	NULL
noose	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL

drew	NULL
it	NULL

its	NULL

,	NULL
carrying	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
arm	NULL
's	NULL

threw	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
iron	NULL

which	NULL
he	NULL
closed	NULL

Such	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Grimesby	NULL
Roylott	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
necessary	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
prolong	NULL
a	NULL
narrative	NULL
which	NULL
has	NULL
already	NULL
run	NULL
to	NULL
too	NULL
great	NULL
a	NULL
length	NULL
by	NULL
telling	NULL
how	NULL
we	NULL
broke	NULL
the	NULL
sad	NULL
news	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
terrified	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
we	NULL
conveyed	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
train	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
care	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
good	NULL
aunt	NULL
at	NULL
Harrow	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
slow	NULL
process	NULL
of	NULL
official	NULL
inquiry	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
met	NULL
his	NULL
fate	NULL
while	NULL
indiscreetly	NULL
playing	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
dangerous	NULL
pet	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
little	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
yet	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
was	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
by	NULL
Sherlock	NULL
Holmes	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
travelled	NULL
back	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
entirely	NULL
erroneous	NULL
conclusion	NULL
which	NULL
shows	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
Watson	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
dangerous	NULL
it	NULL
always	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
reason	NULL
from	NULL
insufficient	NULL
data	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
gipsies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
'	NULL
band	NULL
,	NULL
'	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
used	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
the	NULL
appearance	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
caught	NULL
a	NULL
hurried	NULL
glimpse	NULL
of	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
match	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
sufficient	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
me	NULL
upon	NULL
an	NULL
entirely	NULL
wrong	NULL
scent	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
can	NULL
only	NULL
claim	NULL
the	NULL
merit	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
instantly	NULL
reconsidered	NULL
my	NULL
position	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
became	NULL
clear	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
whatever	NULL
danger	NULL
threatened	NULL
an	NULL
occupant	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
either	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
attention	NULL
was	NULL
speedily	NULL
drawn	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
already	NULL
remarked	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
ventilator	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bell-rope	NULL
which	NULL
hung	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
discovery	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dummy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
was	NULL
clamped	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
instantly	NULL
gave	NULL
rise	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
suspicion	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
rope	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
bridge	NULL
for	NULL
something	NULL
passing	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
hole	NULL
and	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
snake	NULL
instantly	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
coupled	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
knowledge	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
was	NULL
furnished	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
supply	NULL
of	NULL
creatures	NULL
from	NULL
India	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
probably	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
track	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
using	NULL
a	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
poison	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
possibly	NULL
be	NULL
discovered	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
chemical	NULL
test	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
one	NULL
as	NULL
would	NULL
occur	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
clever	NULL
and	NULL
ruthless	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
Eastern	NULL
training	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rapidity	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
poison	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
effect	NULL
would	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
,	NULL
be	NULL
an	NULL
advantage	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
sharp-eyed	NULL
coroner	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
distinguish	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
little	NULL
dark	NULL
punctures	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
show	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
poison	NULL
fangs	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
their	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
whistle	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
recall	NULL
the	NULL
snake	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
light	NULL
revealed	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
victim	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
trained	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
probably	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
milk	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
saw	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
summoned	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
through	NULL
this	NULL
ventilator	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
best	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
certainty	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
crawl	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
rope	NULL
and	NULL
land	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
might	NULL
or	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
bite	NULL
the	NULL
occupant	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
escape	NULL
every	NULL
night	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
sooner	NULL
or	NULL
later	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
fall	NULL
a	NULL
victim	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
these	NULL
conclusions	NULL
before	NULL
ever	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
entered	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
inspection	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
showed	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
standing	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
necessary	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
reach	NULL
the	NULL
ventilator	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
safe	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
saucer	NULL
of	NULL
milk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
loop	NULL
of	NULL
whipcord	NULL
were	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
finally	NULL
dispel	NULL
any	NULL
doubts	NULL
which	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
remained	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
metallic	NULL
clang	NULL
heard	NULL
by	NULL
Miss	NULL
Stoner	NULL
was	NULL
obviously	NULL
caused	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
stepfather	NULL
hastily	NULL
closing	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
safe	NULL
upon	NULL
its	NULL
terrible	NULL
occupant	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
once	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL

THE	NULL

ENGINEER	NULL

Of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
problems	NULL
which	NULL
have	NULL

my	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Sherlock	NULL

for	NULL
solution	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL

our	NULL

only	NULL
two	NULL

Of	NULL
these	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL
finer	NULL
field	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL

observer	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
strange	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
inception	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
dramatic	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
details	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
worthy	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
placed	NULL
upon	NULL

even	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
my	NULL

fewer	NULL
openings	NULL

those	NULL
deductive	NULL
methods	NULL
of	NULL
reasoning	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL

achieved	NULL
such	NULL
remarkable	NULL
results	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
story	NULL
has	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
,	NULL
been	NULL
told	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
newspapers	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
all	NULL
such	NULL
narratives	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
effect	NULL
is	NULL
much	NULL
less	NULL
striking	NULL
when	NULL
set	NULL
forth	NULL
en	NULL
bloc	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
half-column	NULL
of	NULL
print	NULL
than	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
slowly	NULL
evolve	NULL
before	NULL
your	NULL
own	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
mystery	NULL
clears	NULL
gradually	NULL
away	NULL
as	NULL
each	NULL
new	NULL
discovery	NULL
furnishes	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
which	NULL
leads	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
complete	NULL
truth	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
impression	NULL
upon	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
lapse	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
has	NULL
hardly	NULL
served	NULL
to	NULL
weaken	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
of	NULL
'	NULL
89	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
long	NULL
after	NULL
my	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
events	NULL
occurred	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
now	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
summarise	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
civil	NULL
practice	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
finally	NULL
abandoned	NULL
Holmes	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
Baker	NULL
Street	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
I	NULL
continually	NULL
visited	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
occasionally	NULL
even	NULL
persuaded	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
forgo	NULL
his	NULL
Bohemian	NULL
habits	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
visit	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
practice	NULL
had	NULL
steadily	NULL
increased	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
at	NULL
no	NULL
very	NULL
great	NULL
distance	NULL
from	NULL
Paddington	NULL
Station	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
patients	NULL
from	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
officials	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
cured	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
painful	NULL
and	NULL
lingering	NULL
disease	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
weary	NULL
of	NULL
advertising	NULL
my	NULL
virtues	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
endeavouring	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
me	NULL
on	NULL
every	NULL
sufferer	NULL
over	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
any	NULL
influence	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
before	NULL
seven	NULL
o'clock	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
awakened	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
tapping	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
to	NULL
announce	NULL
that	NULL
two	NULL
men	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
Paddington	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
waiting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
consulting-room	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
dressed	NULL
hurriedly	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
by	NULL
experience	NULL
that	NULL
railway	NULL
cases	NULL
were	NULL
seldom	NULL
trivial	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hastened	NULL
downstairs	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
descended	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
old	NULL
ally	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
guard	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
tightly	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
him	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
whispered	NULL
,	NULL
jerking	NULL
his	NULL
thumb	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
shoulder	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
asked	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
manner	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
some	NULL
strange	NULL
creature	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
caged	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
patient	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
whispered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
bring	NULL
him	NULL
round	NULL
myself	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
slip	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
safe	NULL
and	NULL
sound	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
Doctor	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
my	NULL
dooties	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
off	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
trusty	NULL
tout	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
even	NULL
giving	NULL
me	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
thank	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
entered	NULL
my	NULL
consulting-room	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
seated	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
quietly	NULL
dressed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
suit	NULL
of	NULL
heather	NULL
tweed	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
soft	NULL
cloth	NULL
cap	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
laid	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
my	NULL
books	NULL
.	NULL

Round	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
wrapped	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
mottled	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
with	NULL
bloodstains	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
five-and-twenty	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
,	NULL
masculine	NULL
face	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
pale	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
me	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
suffering	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
strong	NULL
agitation	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
strength	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
control	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
sorry	NULL
to	NULL
knock	NULL
you	NULL
up	NULL
so	NULL
early	NULL
,	NULL
Doctor	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
serious	NULL
accident	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
by	NULL
train	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
inquiring	NULL
at	NULL
Paddington	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
where	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
doctor	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
worthy	NULL
fellow	NULL
very	NULL
kindly	NULL
escorted	NULL
me	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
a	NULL
card	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
has	NULL
left	NULL
it	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
side-table	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Victor	NULL

engineer	NULL
,	NULL
16A	NULL

Victoria	NULL

)	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
style	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
abode	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
morning	NULL
visitor	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
regret	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
kept	NULL
you	NULL
waiting	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
library-chair	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
are	NULL
fresh	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
night	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

my	NULL
night	NULL
could	NULL

said	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
laughed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
laughed	NULL
very	NULL
heartily	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
high	NULL
,	NULL
ringing	NULL
note	NULL
,	NULL
leaning	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
and	NULL
shaking	NULL
his	NULL
sides	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
my	NULL
medical	NULL
instincts	NULL
rose	NULL
up	NULL
against	NULL
that	NULL
laugh	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Stop	NULL
it	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
cried	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
pull	NULL
yourself	NULL
together	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
some	NULL
water	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
caraffe	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
useless	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
off	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
hysterical	NULL
outbursts	NULL
which	NULL
come	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
nature	NULL
when	NULL
some	NULL
great	NULL
crisis	NULL
is	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
weary	NULL
and	NULL
pale-looking	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
of	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
gasped	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Drink	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
dashed	NULL
some	NULL
brandy	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
colour	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
bloodless	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
's	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
Doctor	NULL

perhaps	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
kindly	NULL
attend	NULL
to	NULL

or	NULL
rather	NULL

the	NULL
place	NULL
where	NULL
my	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
unwound	NULL
the	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
and	NULL
held	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
gave	NULL
even	NULL
my	NULL
hardened	NULL
nerves	NULL
a	NULL
shudder	NULL

look	NULL

it	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
four	NULL

a	NULL
horrid	NULL
red	NULL

spongy	NULL
surface	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL

torn	NULL
right	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
roots	NULL

I	NULL
cried	NULL

"	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
terrible	NULL
injury	NULL

must	NULL

bled	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

fainted	NULL

finally	NULL

By	NULL

dreary	NULL
experience	NULL

To	NULL
me	NULL
it	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
exceptionally	NULL
so	NULL

During	NULL
two	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
three	NULL

one	NULL

that	NULL

all	NULL

from	NULL
nine	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

four	NULL

I	NULL
waited	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
little	NULL
den	NULL

until	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
my	NULL
heart	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
sink	NULL

I	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL

never	NULL

any	NULL

at	NULL
all	NULL

"	NULL
Yesterday	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
leaving	NULL

office	NULL

my	NULL
clerk	NULL
entered	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
waiting	NULL
who	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
me	NULL
upon	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
brought	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
card	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
'	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Lysander	NULL
Stark	NULL
'	NULL
engraved	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Close	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
heels	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
colonel	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
rather	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
size	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
exceeding	NULL
thinness	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
ever	NULL
seen	NULL
so	NULL
thin	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
whole	NULL
face	NULL
sharpened	NULL
away	NULL
into	NULL
nose	NULL

chin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
skin	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
cheeks	NULL
was	NULL
drawn	NULL
quite	NULL
tense	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
outstanding	NULL
bones	NULL

Yet	NULL
this	NULL
emaciation	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
natural	NULL
habit	NULL

and	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
no	NULL
disease	NULL

for	NULL
his	NULL
eye	NULL
was	NULL
bright	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
step	NULL
brisk	NULL

and	NULL
his	NULL
bearing	NULL
assured	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
plainly	NULL
but	NULL
neatly	NULL
dressed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
judge	NULL

would	NULL
be	NULL
nearer	NULL
forty	NULL

thirty	NULL

That	NULL

We	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
recompense	NULL
you	NULL

you	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL
'	NULL
"	NULL

'	NULL
Some	NULL
little	NULL
time	NULL
ago	NULL
I	NULL
bought	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
place	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
small	NULL
place	NULL
--	NULL
within	NULL
ten	NULL
miles	NULL
of	NULL
Reading	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
fortunate	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
discover	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
deposit	NULL
of	NULL
fuller	NULL
's	NULL
-	NULL
earth	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
fields	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
examining	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
deposit	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
comparatively	NULL
small	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
formed	NULL
a	NULL
link	NULL
between	NULL
two	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
larger	NULL
ones	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
--	NULL
both	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
grounds	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
neighbours	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
good	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
absolutely	NULL
ignorant	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
land	NULL
contained	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
as	NULL
valuable	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
gold-mine	NULL
.	NULL

Naturally	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
interest	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
their	NULL
land	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
discovered	NULL
its	NULL
true	NULL
value	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
unfortunately	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
capital	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
friends	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
secret	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
quietly	NULL
and	NULL
secretly	NULL
work	NULL
our	NULL
own	NULL
little	NULL
deposit	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
earn	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
enable	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
the	NULL
neighbouring	NULL
fields	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
now	NULL
been	NULL
doing	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
us	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
operations	NULL
we	NULL
erected	NULL
a	NULL
hydraulic	NULL
press	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
press	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
already	NULL
explained	NULL
,	NULL
has	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
order	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
wish	NULL
your	NULL
advice	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
guard	NULL
our	NULL
secret	NULL
very	NULL
jealously	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
once	NULL
became	NULL
known	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
hydraulic	NULL
engineers	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
our	NULL
little	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
soon	NULL
rouse	NULL
inquiry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
good-bye	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
these	NULL

out	NULL

Colonel	NULL

was	NULL
only	NULL
seven	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL

from	NULL
the	NULL

that	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
at	NULL
my	NULL
side	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL

more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
glanced	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
direction	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
intensity	NULL

The	NULL
country	NULL

seem	NULL

be	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
part	NULL

we	NULL
lurched	NULL

jolted	NULL
terribly	NULL

I	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
out	NULL

the	NULL
windows	NULL

see	NULL
something	NULL

where	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL

they	NULL
were	NULL
made	NULL

frosted	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
nothing	NULL

the	NULL

Now	NULL

then	NULL
I	NULL
hazarded	NULL
some	NULL
remark	NULL
to	NULL
break	NULL
the	NULL
monotony	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
journey	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
colonel	NULL
answered	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
monosyllables	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
soon	NULL
flagged	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
bumping	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
was	NULL
exchanged	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
crisp	NULL
smoothness	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
gravel-drive	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
stand	NULL

Colonel	NULL
Lysander	NULL
Stark	NULL
sprang	NULL
out	NULL

,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
followed	NULL
after	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
pulled	NULL
me	NULL
swiftly	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
porch	NULL
which	NULL
gaped	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
stepped	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
right	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
and	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
failed	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL

glance	NULL

the	NULL

house	NULL

The	NULL
instant	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
crossed	NULL
the	NULL
threshold	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
slammed	NULL
heavily	NULL
behind	NULL
us	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
faintly	NULL
the	NULL
rattle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wheels	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
drove	NULL
away	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
pitch	NULL
dark	NULL
inside	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
colonel	NULL
fumbled	NULL
about	NULL
looking	NULL

muttering	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
breath	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
a	NULL
door	NULL
opened	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
golden	NULL
bar	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
shot	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
direction	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
grew	NULL
broader	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
appeared	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
lamp	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
held	NULL
above	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL

pushing	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
forward	NULL

peering	NULL
at	NULL
us	NULL

She	NULL
spoke	NULL
a	NULL

words	NULL
in	NULL

a	NULL

when	NULL
my	NULL

a	NULL
gruff	NULL
monosyllable	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
start	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
lamp	NULL
nearly	NULL
fell	NULL
from	NULL

went	NULL
up	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL

he	NULL
walked	NULL

again	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL

table	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

on	NULL
which	NULL
several	NULL

books	NULL
were	NULL
scattered	NULL

laid	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL

said	NULL
he	NULL

and	NULL
vanished	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
books	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
ignorance	NULL
of	NULL
German	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
treatises	NULL
on	NULL
science	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
being	NULL
volumes	NULL
of	NULL
poetry	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
walked	NULL
across	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
hoping	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
catch	NULL
some	NULL
glimpse	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
country-side	NULL

but	NULL
an	NULL
oak	NULL
shutter	NULL
,	NULL
heavily	NULL
barred	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
folded	NULL
across	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
wonderfully	NULL
silent	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
clock	NULL
ticking	NULL
loudly	NULL
somewhere	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
otherwise	NULL
everything	NULL
was	NULL
deadly	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
vague	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
uneasiness	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
steal	NULL
over	NULL
me	NULL

Who	NULL
were	NULL
these	NULL
German	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
were	NULL
they	NULL
doing	NULL
living	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
strange	NULL
,	NULL
out-of-the-way	NULL
place	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
where	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
ten	NULL
miles	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
from	NULL
Eyford	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
whether	NULL
north	NULL
,	NULL
south	NULL
,	NULL
east	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
west	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
that	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
Reading	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
possibly	NULL
other	NULL
large	NULL
towns	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
within	NULL
that	NULL
radius	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
secluded	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
certain	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
absolute	NULL
stillness	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL

I	NULL
paced	NULL
up	NULL

down	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
humming	NULL
a	NULL
tune	NULL
under	NULL
my	NULL
breath	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
up	NULL
my	NULL
spirits	NULL
and	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
earning	NULL
my	NULL
fifty-guinea	NULL

"	NULL
Suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
preliminary	NULL
sound	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
utter	NULL
stillness	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
room	NULL
swung	NULL
slowly	NULL
open	NULL

The	NULL
woman	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
aperture	NULL

the	NULL
darkness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
yellow	NULL
light	NULL
from	NULL
my	NULL
lamp	NULL
beating	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
eager	NULL

beautiful	NULL
face	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sick	NULL
with	NULL
fear	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
sent	NULL
a	NULL
chill	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
heart	NULL

She	NULL
held	NULL
up	NULL
one	NULL
shaking	NULL
finger	NULL
to	NULL
warn	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
silent	NULL

she	NULL
shot	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL

words	NULL

broken	NULL
English	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL

her	NULL
eyes	NULL

behind	NULL
her	NULL

said	NULL
she	NULL

trying	NULL
hard	NULL

as	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL

me	NULL

speak	NULL
calmly	NULL

I	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL

'	NULL
But	NULL

I	NULL

then	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
smiled	NULL
and	NULL
shook	NULL
my	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
suddenly	NULL
threw	NULL
aside	NULL
her	NULL
constraint	NULL

made	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
forward	NULL

with	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
wrung	NULL
together	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
somewhat	NULL

the	NULL

when	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
some	NULL
obstacle	NULL
in	NULL

thought	NULL

my	NULL
fifty-guinea	NULL

of	NULL
my	NULL
wearisome	NULL
journey	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL

night	NULL

seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
before	NULL
me	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL

nothing	NULL

I	NULL
slink	NULL
away	NULL

out	NULL
my	NULL

her	NULL
manner	NULL
had	NULL
shaken	NULL
me	NULL
more	NULL

I	NULL
cared	NULL

confess	NULL

I	NULL
still	NULL
shook	NULL
my	NULL
head	NULL

declared	NULL
my	NULL
intention	NULL

remaining	NULL
where	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
renew	NULL
her	NULL

a	NULL
door	NULL
slammed	NULL
overhead	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
several	NULL
footsteps	NULL

heard	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL

She	NULL
listened	NULL

an	NULL

threw	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
despairing	NULL

the	NULL

An	NULL

I	NULL
returned	NULL

the	NULL

took	NULL
a	NULL

the	NULL

inadequate	NULL

The	NULL
walls	NULL
were	NULL

wood	NULL

the	NULL

consisted	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL

when	NULL
I	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL

it	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
crust	NULL

all	NULL
over	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
stooped	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
scraping	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL

exactly	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL

saw	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

at	NULL
me	NULL

"	NULL

asked	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
angry	NULL
at	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
tricked	NULL
by	NULL
so	NULL
elaborate	NULL
a	NULL
story	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL

your	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL

that	NULL
I	NULL
uttered	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
I	NULL
regretted	NULL
the	NULL

my	NULL
speech	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
face	NULL
set	NULL
hard	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
baleful	NULL
light	NULL
sprang	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
grey	NULL
eyes	NULL

"	NULL

'	NULL
Very	NULL
well	NULL

'	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
'	NULL
you	NULL

know	NULL
all	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
backward	NULL

slammed	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
the	NULL
key	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lock	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
rushed	NULL
towards	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
pulled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
handle	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
secure	NULL

and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
give	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
kicks	NULL

'	NULL
Hullo	NULL

I	NULL
yelled	NULL

Hullo	NULL

me	NULL
out	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
then	NULL
suddenly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
sound	NULL
which	NULL
sent	NULL
my	NULL
heart	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
mouth	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
clank	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
levers	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
swish	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
leaking	NULL
cylinder	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
set	NULL
the	NULL
engine	NULL
at	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lamp	NULL
still	NULL
stood	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
where	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
placed	NULL
it	NULL
when	NULL
examining	NULL
the	NULL
trough	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
its	NULL
light	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
ceiling	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
jerkily	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
none	NULL
knew	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
force	NULL
which	NULL
must	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
grind	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
shapeless	NULL
pulp	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
threw	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
screaming	NULL
,	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dragged	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
nails	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
lock	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
implored	NULL
the	NULL
colonel	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
remorseless	NULL
clanking	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
levers	NULL
drowned	NULL
my	NULL
cries	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
ceiling	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
foot	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
above	NULL
my	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
hand	NULL
upraised	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
feel	NULL
its	NULL
hard	NULL
,	NULL
rough	NULL
surface	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
it	NULL
flashed	NULL
through	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
death	NULL
would	NULL
depend	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
met	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
I	NULL
lay	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
face	NULL
the	NULL
weight	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
upon	NULL
my	NULL
spine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
shuddered	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
dreadful	NULL
snap	NULL
.	NULL

Easier	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
I	NULL
the	NULL
nerve	NULL
to	NULL
lie	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
deadly	NULL
black	NULL
shadow	NULL
wavering	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
me	NULL
?	NULL

Already	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
erect	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
my	NULL
eye	NULL
caught	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
brought	NULL
a	NULL
gush	NULL
of	NULL
hope	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
and	NULL
ceiling	NULL
were	NULL
of	NULL
iron	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL
were	NULL
of	NULL
wood	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
last	NULL
hurried	NULL
glance	NULL
around	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
thin	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
yellow	NULL
light	NULL
between	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boards	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
broadened	NULL
and	NULL
broadened	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
panel	NULL
was	NULL
pushed	NULL
backward	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
indeed	NULL
a	NULL
door	NULL
which	NULL
led	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
next	NULL
instant	NULL
I	NULL
threw	NULL
myself	NULL
through	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lay	NULL
half-fainting	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
panel	NULL
had	NULL
closed	NULL
again	NULL
behind	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
crash	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lamp	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
moments	NULL
afterwards	NULL
the	NULL
clang	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
slabs	NULL
of	NULL
metal	NULL
,	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
how	NULL
narrow	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
my	NULL
escape	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
recalled	NULL
to	NULL
myself	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
frantic	NULL
plucking	NULL
at	NULL
my	NULL
wrist	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
myself	NULL
lying	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
stone	NULL
floor	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
narrow	NULL
corridor	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
bent	NULL
over	NULL
me	NULL

tugged	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
left	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
held	NULL
a	NULL
candle	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
good	NULL
friend	NULL
whose	NULL
warning	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
foolishly	NULL
rejected	NULL

"	NULL

'	NULL
Come	NULL

she	NULL
cried	NULL
breathlessly	NULL

"	NULL
This	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
scorn	NULL
her	NULL
advice	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
staggered	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
feet	NULL
and	NULL
ran	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
corridor	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
winding	NULL
stair	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
latter	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
another	NULL
broad	NULL
passage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
reached	NULL
it	NULL
we	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL

running	NULL

the	NULL
shouting	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
voices	NULL

from	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL

from	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
beneath	NULL

My	NULL
guide	NULL
stopped	NULL

about	NULL
her	NULL
like	NULL
one	NULL

at	NULL
her	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
threw	NULL
open	NULL
a	NULL
door	NULL
which	NULL
led	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
bedroom	NULL

through	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL

sprang	NULL
into	NULL
view	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
further	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

I	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL

forward	NULL

a	NULL

a	NULL

I	NULL
rushed	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
bedroom	NULL

flung	NULL
open	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL

looked	NULL
out	NULL

How	NULL
quiet	NULL

it	NULL

I	NULL
clambered	NULL
out	NULL

I	NULL

Half	NULL

I	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL

asked	NULL
about	NULL

There	NULL

him	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL

I	NULL
determined	NULL

I	NULL
got	NULL
back	NULL

telling	NULL
my	NULL

the	NULL
police	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
past	NULL

I	NULL
went	NULL
first	NULL

my	NULL

then	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
was	NULL
kind	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
me	NULL
along	NULL
here	NULL

I	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL

your	NULL

shall	NULL
do	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL

We	NULL
both	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
little	NULL

after	NULL
listening	NULL

Then	NULL
Sherlock	NULL

down	NULL
from	NULL

her	NULL

dead	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
sick	NULL
for	NULL
months	NULL
after	NULL
.	NULL

Pa	NULL
thought	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
decline	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
doctors	NULL
in	NULL
'	NULL
Frisco	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
of	NULL
news	NULL
came	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
doubted	NULL
that	NULL
Frank	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Lord	NULL
St.	NULL
Simon	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
'	NULL
Frisco	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
marriage	NULL
was	NULL
arranged	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pa	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
pleased	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
man	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
earth	NULL
would	NULL
ever	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
heart	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
poor	NULL
Frank	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Still	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
Lord	NULL
St.	NULL
Simon	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
my	NULL
duty	NULL
by	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
command	NULL
our	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
we	NULL
can	NULL
our	NULL
actions	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
altar	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
intention	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
good	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
you	NULL
may	NULL
imagine	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
altar	NULL
rails	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
glanced	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
Frank	NULL
standing	NULL
and	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
pew	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
ghost	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
looked	NULL
again	NULL
there	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
question	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
me	NULL
whether	NULL
I	NULL
were	NULL
glad	NULL
or	NULL
sorry	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wonder	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
drop	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
everything	NULL
was	NULL
turning	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
clergyman	NULL
were	NULL
just	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
buzz	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bee	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
ear	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

Should	NULL
I	NULL
stop	NULL
the	NULL
service	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
scene	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
raised	NULL
his	NULL
finger	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
scribble	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
paper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
writing	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
note	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
passed	NULL
his	NULL
pew	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
out	NULL
I	NULL
dropped	NULL
my	NULL
bouquet	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
slipped	NULL
the	NULL
note	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
hand	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
returned	NULL
me	NULL
the	NULL
flowers	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
line	NULL
asking	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
join	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
sign	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
doubted	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
first	NULL
duty	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
just	NULL
whatever	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
direct	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
When	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
back	NULL
I	NULL
told	NULL
my	NULL
maid	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
California	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
friend	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
ordered	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
things	NULL
packed	NULL
and	NULL
my	NULL
ulster	NULL
ready	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
I	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
Lord	NULL
St.	NULL
Simon	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
dreadful	NULL
hard	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
great	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
just	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
explain	NULL
afterwards	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
before	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
Frank	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
beckoned	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
began	NULL
walking	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
Park	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
slipped	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
followed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
woman	NULL
came	NULL
talking	NULL
something	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
about	NULL
Lord	NULL
St.	NULL
Simon	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
--	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
secret	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
before	NULL
marriage	NULL
also	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
overtook	NULL
Frank	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
cab	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
away	NULL
we	NULL
drove	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
lodgings	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
in	NULL
Gordon	NULL
Square	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
my	NULL
true	NULL
wedding	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
waiting	NULL
.	NULL

Frank	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
prisoner	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
Apaches	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
escaped	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
'	NULL
Frisco	NULL
,	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
dead	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
England	NULL
,	NULL
followed	NULL
me	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
upon	NULL
me	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
morning	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
second	NULL
wedding	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
paper	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
explained	NULL
the	NULL
American	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
lived	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
talk	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Frank	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
for	NULL
openness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
vanish	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
see	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
again	NULL
--	NULL
just	NULL
sending	NULL
a	NULL
line	NULL
to	NULL
pa	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
alive	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
awful	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
lords	NULL
and	NULL
ladies	NULL
sitting	NULL
round	NULL
that	NULL
breakfast-table	NULL
and	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
Frank	NULL
took	NULL
my	NULL
wedding-clothes	NULL
and	NULL
things	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
bundle	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
traced	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dropped	NULL
them	NULL
away	NULL
somewhere	NULL
where	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
likely	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
good	NULL
gentleman	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Holmes	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
round	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
this	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
us	NULL
is	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
think	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
showed	NULL
us	NULL
very	NULL
clearly	NULL
and	NULL
kindly	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
wrong	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
Frank	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
putting	NULL
ourselves	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
secret	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
offered	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
us	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
Lord	NULL
St.	NULL
Simon	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
we	NULL
came	NULL
right	NULL
away	NULL
round	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
rooms	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
Robert	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
very	NULL
sorry	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
you	NULL
pain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
very	NULL
meanly	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Lord	NULL
St.	NULL
Simon	NULL
had	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL
means	NULL
relaxed	NULL
his	NULL
rigid	NULL
attitude	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
listened	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
frowning	NULL
brow	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
compressed	NULL
lip	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
long	NULL
narrative	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Excuse	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
my	NULL
custom	NULL
to	NULL
discuss	NULL
my	NULL
most	NULL
intimate	NULL
personal	NULL
affairs	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
public	NULL
manner	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
you	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
forgive	NULL
me	NULL

You	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
shake	NULL
hands	NULL
before	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
certainly	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
you	NULL
any	NULL
pleasure	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
coldly	NULL
grasped	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
extended	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
hoped	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
suggested	NULL
Holmes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
joined	NULL
us	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
friendly	NULL
supper	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
you	NULL
ask	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
responded	NULL
his	NULL
Lordship	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
acquiesce	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
recent	NULL

I	NULL
can	NULL
hardly	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL

make	NULL
merry	NULL
over	NULL
them	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL

your	NULL
permission	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
now	NULL
wish	NULL
you	NULL
all	NULL

very	NULL
good-night	NULL

He	NULL
included	NULL
us	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sweeping	NULL
bow	NULL
and	NULL
stalked	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL

I	NULL
trust	NULL

honour	NULL

Holmes	NULL
when	NULL

Nothing	NULL

the	NULL

result	NULL
when	NULL
viewed	NULL

for	NULL
instance	NULL

by	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Lestrade	NULL
of	NULL
Scotland	NULL
Yard	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
yourself	NULL
at	NULL
fault	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
From	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
facts	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
obvious	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
quite	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
undergo	NULL
the	NULL
wedding	NULL
ceremony	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
repented	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
of	NULL
returning	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

Obviously	NULL
something	NULL
had	NULL
occurred	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
cause	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
could	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
be	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
anyone	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bridegroom	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
she	NULL
seen	NULL
someone	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
?	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
someone	NULL
from	NULL
America	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
so	NULL
short	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
country	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
have	NULL
allowed	NULL
anyone	NULL
to	NULL
acquire	NULL
so	NULL
deep	NULL
an	NULL
influence	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
mere	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
would	NULL
induce	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
her	NULL
plans	NULL
so	NULL
completely	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
already	NULL
arrived	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
process	NULL
of	NULL
exclusion	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
an	NULL
American	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
this	NULL
American	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
why	NULL
should	NULL
he	NULL
possess	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
influence	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
lover	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
husband	NULL

Her	NULL
young	NULL
womanhood	NULL

I	NULL

rough	NULL
scenes	NULL

conditions	NULL

So	NULL
far	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL

St.	NULL

fortunate	NULL

I	NULL
ventured	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
them	NULL
some	NULL

them	NULL

I	NULL

stood	NULL
one	NULL
morning	NULL
in	NULL

bow-window	NULL
looking	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
here	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
madman	NULL
coming	NULL
along	NULL

It	NULL
seems	NULL
rather	NULL
sad	NULL
that	NULL

allow	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

My	NULL
friend	NULL
rose	NULL
lazily	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
armchair	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pockets	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
dressing-gown	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
over	NULL
my	NULL
shoulder	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bright	NULL
,	NULL
crisp	NULL
February	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
still	NULL
lay	NULL
deep	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
,	NULL
shimmering	NULL
brightly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wintry	NULL
sun	NULL
.	NULL

Down	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
Baker	NULL
Street	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
ploughed	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
brown	NULL
crumbly	NULL
band	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
traffic	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
either	NULL
side	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
heaped-up	NULL
edges	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
foot-paths	NULL
it	NULL
still	NULL
lay	NULL
as	NULL
white	NULL
as	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
fell	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
grey	NULL
pavement	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
cleaned	NULL
and	NULL
scraped	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
dangerously	NULL
slippery	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
fewer	NULL
passengers	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Metropolitan	NULL
Station	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
save	NULL
the	NULL
single	NULL
gentleman	NULL
whose	NULL
eccentric	NULL
conduct	NULL
had	NULL
drawn	NULL
my	NULL
attention	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
about	NULL
fifty	NULL
,	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
portly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
imposing	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
massive	NULL
,	NULL
strongly	NULL
marked	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
commanding	NULL
figure	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
dressed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sombre	NULL
yet	NULL
rich	NULL
style	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
black	NULL
frock-coat	NULL
,	NULL
shining	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
neat	NULL
brown	NULL
gaiters	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
well-cut	NULL
pearl-grey	NULL
trousers	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
his	NULL
actions	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
absurd	NULL
contrast	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dignity	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
dress	NULL
and	NULL
features	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
running	NULL
hard	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
occasional	NULL
little	NULL
springs	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
weary	NULL
man	NULL
gives	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
little	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
any	NULL
tax	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
legs	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
ran	NULL
he	NULL
jerked	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
waggled	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
writhed	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
contortions	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
on	NULL
earth	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
is	NULL
looking	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
numbers	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
houses	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
coming	NULL
here	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Holmes	NULL
,	NULL
rubbing	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Here	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
rather	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
consult	NULL
me	NULL
professionally	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
recognise	NULL
the	NULL
symptoms	NULL
.	NULL

Ha	NULL
!	NULL

did	NULL
I	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
puffing	NULL
and	NULL
blowing	NULL
,	NULL
rushed	NULL
at	NULL
our	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
pulled	NULL
at	NULL
our	NULL
bell	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
house	NULL
resounded	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
clanging	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
moments	NULL
later	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
puffing	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
gesticulating	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
so	NULL
fixed	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
grief	NULL
and	NULL
despair	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
that	NULL
our	NULL
smiles	NULL
were	NULL
turned	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
to	NULL
horror	NULL
and	NULL
pity	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
swayed	NULL
his	NULL
body	NULL
and	NULL
plucked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
like	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
driven	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
extreme	NULL
limits	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
reason	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
springing	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
beat	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
force	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
both	NULL
rushed	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
tore	NULL
him	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Sherlock	NULL
Holmes	NULL
pushed	NULL
him	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
easy-chair	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
patted	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
chatted	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
easy	NULL
,	NULL
soothing	NULL
tones	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
employ	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

sat	NULL
for	NULL

minute	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
heaving	NULL
chest	NULL

why	NULL

how	NULL
terrible	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL

which	NULL
I	NULL

I	NULL
determined	NULL

therefore	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
always	NULL
carry	NULL

that	NULL
it	NULL

out	NULL

this	NULL
intention	NULL

called	NULL

freely	NULL

taken	NULL
it	NULL
upstairs	NULL

moment	NULL
from	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
denied	NULL
him	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
better	NULL

I	NULL
been	NULL
sterner	NULL

I	NULL
meant	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
naturally	NULL
my	NULL
intention	NULL
that	NULL

should	NULL
succeed	NULL

business	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

was	NULL
wild	NULL

to	NULL
speak	NULL

could	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL

aristocratic	NULL
club	NULL

and	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
charming	NULL
manners	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
soon	NULL
the	NULL
intimate	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
number	NULL

men	NULL

long	NULL
purses	NULL

learned	NULL

heavily	NULL

squander	NULL
money	NULL

the	NULL
turf	NULL

again	NULL

again	NULL

more	NULL

break	NULL

A	NULL

us	NULL

double	NULL

with	NULL

stretched	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL

to	NULL
two	NULL

iron	NULL
gates	NULL
which	NULL
closed	NULL

entrance	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
side	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
wooden	NULL
thicket	NULL

which	NULL
led	NULL
into	NULL

stretching	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

Holmes	NULL
left	NULL

walked	NULL
slowly	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL

across	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL

down	NULL
the	NULL
tradesmen	NULL

path	NULL

and	NULL
so	NULL
round	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
behind	NULL

door	NULL
opened	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
above	NULL

slim	NULL

with	NULL
dark	NULL
hair	NULL

which	NULL
seemed	NULL
the	NULL
darker	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL

pallor	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
skin	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL

the	NULL
banker	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL

her	NULL

him	NULL

a	NULL

an	NULL

Your	NULL

nothing	NULL

he	NULL
breathed	NULL
his	NULL

I	NULL

tell	NULL
you	NULL

then	NULL

what	NULL
occurred	NULL
in	NULL
your	NULL
house	NULL
last	NULL
night	NULL

Your	NULL
niece	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL

as	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
your	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
slipped	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
lover	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
which	NULL
leads	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
stable	NULL
lane	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
footmarks	NULL
had	NULL
pressed	NULL
right	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
coronet	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
wicked	NULL
lust	NULL
for	NULL
gold	NULL
kindled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
bent	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
will	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
women	NULL
in	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
love	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
lover	NULL
extinguishes	NULL
all	NULL
other	NULL
loves	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
hardly	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
instructions	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
you	NULL
coming	NULL
downstairs	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
rapidly	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
you	NULL
about	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
servants	NULL

escapade	NULL

her	NULL
wooden-legged	NULL

"	NULL
Your	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
Arthur	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
interview	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
slept	NULL
badly	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
uneasiness	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
club	NULL
debts	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
soft	NULL
tread	NULL
pass	NULL
his	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
rose	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
cousin	NULL
walking	NULL
very	NULL
stealthily	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
until	NULL
she	NULL
disappeared	NULL
into	NULL
your	NULL
dressing-room	NULL
.	NULL

Petrified	NULL
with	NULL
astonishment	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
lad	NULL
slipped	NULL
on	NULL
some	NULL
clothes	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
strange	NULL
affair	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
she	NULL
emerged	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
passage-lamp	NULL
your	NULL
son	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
carried	NULL
the	NULL
precious	NULL
coronet	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
passed	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
thrilling	NULL
with	NULL
horror	NULL
,	NULL
ran	NULL
along	NULL
and	NULL
slipped	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
curtain	NULL
near	NULL
your	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
whence	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
passed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
beneath	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
stealthily	NULL
open	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
hand	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
coronet	NULL
to	NULL
someone	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
gloom	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
closing	NULL
it	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
hurry	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
passing	NULL
quite	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
hid	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
curtain	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
As	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
any	NULL
action	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
horrible	NULL
exposure	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
loved	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
instant	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
he	NULL
realised	NULL
how	NULL
crushing	NULL
a	NULL
misfortune	NULL
this	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
all-important	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
it	NULL
right	NULL

He	NULL
rushed	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
bare	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL

sprang	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL

and	NULL
ran	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
figure	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
moonlight	NULL
.	NULL

Sir	NULL
George	NULL
Burnwell	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Arthur	NULL
caught	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
struggle	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL

your	NULL
lad	NULL
tugging	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL

the	NULL
coronet	NULL

his	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
scuffle	NULL
,	NULL
your	NULL
son	NULL
struck	NULL
Sir	NULL
George	NULL

cut	NULL
him	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL

Then	NULL
something	NULL
suddenly	NULL
snapped	NULL

your	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL
finding	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
coronet	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL

rushed	NULL
back	NULL

closed	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL

ascended	NULL
to	NULL
your	NULL
room	NULL

and	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
observed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
coronet	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
twisted	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
struggle	NULL

was	NULL
endeavouring	NULL

straighten	NULL
it	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
appeared	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL

"	NULL
gasped	NULL
the	NULL
banker	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
then	NULL
roused	NULL
his	NULL
anger	NULL
by	NULL
calling	NULL
him	NULL
names	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL

deserved	NULL
your	NULL

He	NULL

not	NULL
explain	NULL
the	NULL

affairs	NULL
without	NULL
betraying	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
certainly	NULL
deserved	NULL
little	NULL
enough	NULL
consideration	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
chivalrous	NULL
view	NULL

however	NULL

and	NULL
preserved	NULL
her	NULL
secret	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
that	NULL

why	NULL
she	NULL
shrieked	NULL

fainted	NULL
when	NULL

his	NULL

out	NULL

five	NULL

the	NULL

How	NULL
cruelly	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
misjudged	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL
When	NULL
I	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
continued	NULL
Holmes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
went	NULL
very	NULL
carefully	NULL
round	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
observe	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
any	NULL
traces	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
help	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
none	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
frost	NULL
to	NULL
preserve	NULL
impressions	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
passed	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
tradesmen	NULL
's	NULL
path	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
trampled	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
indistinguishable	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
beyond	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
far	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
had	NULL
stood	NULL
and	NULL
talked	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
round	NULL
impressions	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
showed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
wooden	NULL
leg	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
even	NULL
tell	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
disturbed	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
had	NULL
run	NULL
back	NULL
swiftly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
shown	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
deep	NULL
toe	NULL
and	NULL
light	NULL
heel	NULL
marks	NULL

while	NULL
Wooden-leg	NULL
had	NULL
waited	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
thought	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
sweetheart	NULL

of	NULL
whom	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
inquiry	NULL
showed	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
passed	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
without	NULL
seeing	NULL
anything	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
random	NULL
tracks	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
took	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
police	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
stable	NULL
lane	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
complex	NULL
story	NULL
was	NULL
written	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
double	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
tracks	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
booted	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
double	NULL
line	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
with	NULL
delight	NULL
belonged	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
naked	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
convinced	NULL
from	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL
was	NULL
your	NULL
son	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
had	NULL
walked	NULL
both	NULL
ways	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
had	NULL
run	NULL
swiftly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
tread	NULL
was	NULL
marked	NULL
in	NULL
places	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
depression	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boot	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
obvious	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
followed	NULL
them	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
they	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
Boots	NULL
had	NULL
worn	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
away	NULL
while	NULL
waiting	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
walked	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
saw	NULL
where	NULL
Boots	NULL
had	NULL
faced	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
was	NULL
cut	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
struggle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
finally	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
drops	NULL
of	NULL
blood	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
mistaken	NULL
.	NULL

Boots	NULL
had	NULL
then	NULL
run	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
another	NULL
little	NULL
smudge	NULL
of	NULL
blood	NULL
showed	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
hurt	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
highroad	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
pavement	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
cleared	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
clue	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
On	NULL
entering	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
examined	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
remember	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sill	NULL
and	NULL
framework	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
window	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
lens	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
someone	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
distinguish	NULL
the	NULL
outline	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
instep	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
wet	NULL
foot	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
placed	NULL
in	NULL
coming	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
form	NULL
an	NULL
opinion	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
occurred	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
waited	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
;	NULL
someone	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
the	NULL
gems	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
deed	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
overseen	NULL
by	NULL
your	NULL
son	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
pursued	NULL
the	NULL
thief	NULL
;	NULL
had	NULL
struggled	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
each	NULL
tugged	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
coronet	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
united	NULL
strength	NULL
causing	NULL
injuries	NULL
which	NULL
neither	NULL
alone	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
effected	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
returned	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
prize	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
a	NULL
fragment	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
grasp	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
opponent	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
far	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
question	NULL
now	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
coronet	NULL
?	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
maxim	NULL
of	NULL
mine	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
excluded	NULL
the	NULL
impossible	NULL
,	NULL
whatever	NULL
remains	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
improbable	NULL
,	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
you	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
it	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
there	NULL
only	NULL
remained	NULL
your	NULL
niece	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
maids	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
maids	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
should	NULL
your	NULL
son	NULL
allow	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
accused	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
place	NULL

--	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL

the	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL

out	NULL

that	NULL
your	NULL

among	NULL

Even	NULL

he	NULL
might	NULL

up	NULL

made	NULL
all	NULL

buying	NULL
a	NULL

With	NULL
these	NULL
I	NULL
journeyed	NULL

I	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL

avert	NULL

I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL

would	NULL
see	NULL

I	NULL
went	NULL

him	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL

he	NULL
denied	NULL

when	NULL
I	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
every	NULL

he	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
bluster	NULL

took	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
life-preserver	NULL

I	NULL
knew	NULL
my	NULL
man	NULL

I	NULL
clapped	NULL
a	NULL
pistol	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
strike	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
reasonable	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
price	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
stones	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
--	NULL
1000	NULL

brought	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL

them	NULL

him	NULL

after	NULL

It	NULL
may	NULL
turn	NULL
out	NULL

more	NULL
interest	NULL

You	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL

the	NULL
blue	NULL
carbuncle	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
whim	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
developed	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
serious	NULL
investigation	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
also	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

let	NULL
us	NULL
hope	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
our	NULL
doubts	NULL
will	NULL
very	NULL

be	NULL
solved	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
opened	NULL

a	NULL
young	NULL
lady	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
plainly	NULL

neatly	NULL
dressed	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
bright	NULL

freckled	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL

that	NULL
Holmes	NULL
was	NULL
favourably	NULL
impressed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
manner	NULL

speech	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
her	NULL
over	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
searching	NULL
fashion	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
composed	NULL
himself	NULL

with	NULL
his	NULL
lids	NULL
drooping	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
finger-tips	NULL
together	NULL

to	NULL
listen	NULL

her	NULL
story	NULL

took	NULL
his	NULL

By	NULL
eleven	NULL
o'clock	NULL
the	NULL

we	NULL
were	NULL
well	NULL
upon	NULL
our	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

Holmes	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
buried	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
papers	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
after	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
Hampshire	NULL
border	NULL
he	NULL
threw	NULL
them	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
admire	NULL
the	NULL
scenery	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
ideal	NULL
spring	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
blue	NULL
sky	NULL
,	NULL
flecked	NULL
with	NULL
little	NULL
fleecy	NULL
white	NULL
clouds	NULL
drifting	NULL
across	NULL
from	NULL
west	NULL
to	NULL
east	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
shining	NULL
very	NULL
brightly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
exhilarating	NULL
nip	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
set	NULL
an	NULL
edge	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
energy	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
countryside	NULL
,	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rolling	NULL
hills	NULL
around	NULL
Aldershot	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
red	NULL
and	NULL
grey	NULL
roofs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
farm-steadings	NULL
peeped	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
green	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
foliage	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
they	NULL
not	NULL
fresh	NULL
and	NULL
beautiful	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
cried	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
fresh	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
fogs	NULL
of	NULL
Baker	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Holmes	NULL
shook	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
gravely	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
Watson	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
curses	NULL

a	NULL

like	NULL
mine	NULL

I	NULL
must	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
everything	NULL
with	NULL

my	NULL
own	NULL

impressed	NULL
by	NULL

I	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
thought	NULL
which	NULL
comes	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL

there	NULL

Good	NULL

I	NULL
cried	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
always	NULL
fill	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
horror	NULL

founded	NULL

experience	NULL

that	NULL
the	NULL
lowest	NULL

vilest	NULL
alleys	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
present	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL

does	NULL
the	NULL
smiling	NULL

countryside	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
horrify	NULL
me	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
the	NULL
reason	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
obvious	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pressure	NULL
of	NULL
public	NULL
opinion	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
law	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
accomplish	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
lane	NULL
so	NULL
vile	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
scream	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
tortured	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
thud	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
drunkard	NULL
's	NULL
blow	NULL
,	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
beget	NULL
sympathy	NULL
and	NULL
indignation	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
neighbours	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
machinery	NULL
of	NULL
justice	NULL
is	NULL
ever	NULL
so	NULL
close	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
of	NULL
complaint	NULL
can	NULL
set	NULL
it	NULL
going	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
crime	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
dock	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
these	NULL
lonely	NULL
houses	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
fields	NULL
,	NULL
filled	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
part	NULL
with	NULL
poor	NULL
ignorant	NULL
folk	NULL
who	NULL
know	NULL
little	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
law	NULL

Think	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
deeds	NULL
of	NULL
hellish	NULL
cruelty	NULL

the	NULL

you	NULL

found	NULL

a	NULL
silent	NULL

pale-faced	NULL
woman	NULL

much	NULL
younger	NULL
than	NULL

not	NULL
more	NULL

thirty	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL
think	NULL

while	NULL
he	NULL
can	NULL
hardly	NULL
be	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
forty-five	NULL

From	NULL
their	NULL
conversation	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
gathered	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
married	NULL
about	NULL
seven	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
widower	NULL

that	NULL
his	NULL
only	NULL
child	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL

was	NULL
the	NULL
daughter	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
Philadelphia	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Rucastle	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
private	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
them	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
unreasoning	NULL
aversion	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
stepmother	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
daughter	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
twenty	NULL

I	NULL
can	NULL
quite	NULL
imagine	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
position	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
young	NULL
wife	NULL

"	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Rucastle	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
colourless	NULL
in	NULL
mind	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
feature	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
impressed	NULL
me	NULL
neither	NULL
favourably	NULL
nor	NULL
the	NULL
reverse	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
nonentity	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
passionately	NULL
devoted	NULL
both	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
son	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
light	NULL
grey	NULL
eyes	NULL
wandered	NULL
continually	NULL
from	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
noting	NULL
every	NULL
little	NULL
want	NULL
and	NULL
forestalling	NULL
it	NULL
if	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
also	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
bluff	NULL

boisterous	NULL
fashion	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL

seemed	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
secret	NULL
sorrow	NULL

this	NULL
woman	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
often	NULL
be	NULL
lost	NULL
in	NULL
deep	NULL
thought	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
saddest	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL

More	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
surprised	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
tears	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL
sometimes	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
disposition	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
child	NULL
which	NULL
weighed	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
met	NULL
so	NULL
utterly	NULL
spoiled	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
ill-natured	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
creature	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
small	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
age	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
head	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
quite	NULL
disproportionately	NULL
large	NULL

His	NULL
whole	NULL
life	NULL
appears	NULL

be	NULL
spent	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
alternation	NULL
between	NULL
savage	NULL
fits	NULL
of	NULL
passion	NULL
and	NULL
gloomy	NULL
intervals	NULL
of	NULL
sulking	NULL

Giving	NULL
pain	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
creature	NULL
weaker	NULL

himself	NULL
seems	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL

one	NULL

The	NULL

unpleasant	NULL

about	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL
dress	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
shade	NULL
of	NULL
blue	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
excellent	NULL
material	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
beige	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
bore	NULL
unmistakable	NULL
signs	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
worn	NULL
before	NULL

It	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
fit	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
measured	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL

Both	NULL
Mr.	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Rucastle	NULL
expressed	NULL
a	NULL
delight	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
quite	NULL
exaggerated	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
vehemence	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
large	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
stretching	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
entire	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
three	NULL
long	NULL
windows	NULL
reaching	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL

A	NULL
chair	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
placed	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
central	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
back	NULL
turned	NULL
towards	NULL
it	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL

then	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Rucastle	NULL

walking	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
series	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
funniest	NULL
stories	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
ever	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
imagine	NULL
how	NULL
comical	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
laughed	NULL
until	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
weary	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Rucastle	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
evidently	NULL
no	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
humour	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
smiled	NULL

but	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
lap	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
sad	NULL

anxious	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL

After	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Rucastle	NULL
suddenly	NULL
remarked	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
commence	NULL
the	NULL
duties	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
change	NULL
my	NULL
dress	NULL

go	NULL
to	NULL
little	NULL
Edward	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
nursery	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Two	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL
this	NULL
same	NULL
performance	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
through	NULL
under	NULL
exactly	NULL
similar	NULL
circumstances	NULL
.	NULL

Again	NULL
I	NULL
changed	NULL
my	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
again	NULL
I	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
I	NULL
laughed	NULL
very	NULL
heartily	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
funny	NULL
stories	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
my	NULL
employer	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
immense	NULL
répertoire	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
inimitably	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
handed	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
yellow-backed	NULL
novel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
moving	NULL
my	NULL
chair	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
sideways	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
shadow	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
fall	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
page	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
begged	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
aloud	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
read	NULL
for	NULL
about	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
,	NULL
beginning	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
chapter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sentence	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
ordered	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
cease	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
my	NULL
dress	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
can	NULL
easily	NULL
imagine	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Holmes	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
curious	NULL
I	NULL
became	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
meaning	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
performance	NULL
could	NULL
possibly	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
always	NULL
very	NULL
careful	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
observed	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
my	NULL
face	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
became	NULL
consumed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
behind	NULL
my	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
impossible	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
soon	NULL
devised	NULL
a	NULL
means	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
hand-mirror	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
broken	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
a	NULL
happy	NULL
thought	NULL
seized	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
concealed	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
glass	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
occasion	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
laughter	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
put	NULL
my	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
management	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
behind	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
confess	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
disappointed	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
least	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
my	NULL
first	NULL
impression	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
glance	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
perceived	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Southampton	NULL
Road	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
bearded	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
grey	NULL
suit	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
looking	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
direction	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
road	NULL
is	NULL
an	NULL
important	NULL
highway	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
usually	NULL
people	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
leaning	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
railings	NULL
which	NULL
bordered	NULL
our	NULL
field	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
earnestly	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
lowered	NULL
my	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
and	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Rucastle	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
fixed	NULL
upon	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
searching	NULL
gaze	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
divined	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
mirror	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
behind	NULL
me	NULL

out	NULL

the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
dreadful	NULL
sentinel	NULL
sent	NULL
a	NULL
chill	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
heart	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
burglar	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
now	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
strange	NULL
experience	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL
my	NULL
hair	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
placed	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
coil	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
trunk	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
amuse	NULL
myself	NULL
by	NULL
examining	NULL
the	NULL
furniture	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
rearranging	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
little	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
chest	NULL
of	NULL
drawers	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
upper	NULL
ones	NULL
empty	NULL
and	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
one	NULL
locked	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
filled	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
two	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
linen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
still	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
pack	NULL
away	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
naturally	NULL
annoyed	NULL
at	NULL
not	NULL
having	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
drawer	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
struck	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
fastened	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
oversight	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
took	NULL
out	NULL
my	NULL
bunch	NULL
of	NULL
keys	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
open	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
very	NULL
first	NULL
key	NULL
fitted	NULL
to	NULL
perfection	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
drew	NULL
the	NULL
drawer	NULL
open	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
guess	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
my	NULL
coil	NULL
of	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
examined	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
peculiar	NULL
tint	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
thickness	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
impossibility	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
obtruded	NULL
itself	NULL
upon	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
my	NULL
hair	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
locked	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
drawer	NULL
?	NULL

With	NULL
trembling	NULL
hands	NULL
I	NULL
undid	NULL
my	NULL
trunk	NULL
,	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
contents	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
drew	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
laid	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
tresses	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
assure	NULL
you	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
identical	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
?	NULL

Puzzle	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
nothing	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
meant	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
returned	NULL
the	NULL
strange	NULL
hair	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
drawer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Rucastles	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
myself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
by	NULL
opening	NULL
a	NULL
drawer	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
locked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
naturally	NULL
observant	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
remarked	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Holmes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
soon	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
good	NULL
plan	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
wing	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
appeared	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
inhabited	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
door	NULL
which	NULL
faced	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
led	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
quarters	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Tollers	NULL
opened	NULL
into	NULL
this	NULL
suite	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
invariably	NULL
locked	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
ascended	NULL
the	NULL
stair	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
met	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Rucastle	NULL
coming	NULL
out	NULL
through	NULL
this	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
keys	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
different	NULL
person	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
jovial	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
accustomed	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
cheeks	NULL
were	NULL
red	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
brow	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
crinkled	NULL
with	NULL
anger	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
veins	NULL
stood	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
temples	NULL
with	NULL
passion	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
locked	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
hurried	NULL
past	NULL
me	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
This	NULL
aroused	NULL
my	NULL
curiosity	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
walk	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
grounds	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
charge	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
strolled	NULL
round	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
four	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
row	NULL
,	NULL
three	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
simply	NULL
dirty	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
fourth	NULL
was	NULL
shuttered	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
evidently	NULL
all	NULL
deserted	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
strolled	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
glancing	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
occasionally	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Rucastle	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
as	NULL
merry	NULL
and	NULL
jovial	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

'	NULL
Ah	NULL

said	NULL
he	NULL

'	NULL

I	NULL
assured	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
surprised	NULL

as	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
jesting	NULL
tone	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
jest	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL

looked	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Holmes	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
understood	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
about	NULL
that	NULL
suite	NULL
of	NULL
rooms	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
on	NULL
fire	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
over	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
mere	NULL
curiosity	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
my	NULL
share	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
duty	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
good	NULL
might	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
my	NULL
penetrating	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
instinct	NULL
;	NULL
perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
instinct	NULL
which	NULL
gave	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
feeling	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
keenly	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
lookout	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
chance	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
the	NULL
forbidden	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
yesterday	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
chance	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
may	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
besides	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Rucastle	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
Toller	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
find	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
deserted	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
once	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
carrying	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
black	NULL
linen	NULL
bag	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

Recently	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
drinking	NULL
hard	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yesterday	NULL
evening	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
drunk	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
came	NULL
upstairs	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
key	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
it	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Rucastle	NULL
were	NULL
both	NULL
downstairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
admirable	NULL
opportunity	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
turned	NULL
the	NULL
key	NULL
gently	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lock	NULL
,	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
slipped	NULL
through	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
passage	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
unpapered	NULL
and	NULL
uncarpeted	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
turned	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
angle	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
farther	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

Round	NULL
this	NULL
corner	NULL
were	NULL
three	NULL
doors	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
line	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
and	NULL
third	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
open	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
each	NULL
led	NULL
into	NULL
an	NULL
empty	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
dusty	NULL
and	NULL
cheerless	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
windows	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
thick	NULL
with	NULL
dirt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
light	NULL
glimmered	NULL
dimly	NULL
through	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
centre	NULL
door	NULL
was	NULL
closed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
outside	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
fastened	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
broad	NULL
bars	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
iron	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
padlocked	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
ring	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fastened	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
with	NULL
stout	NULL
cord	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
door	NULL
itself	NULL
was	NULL
locked	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
key	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
barricaded	NULL
door	NULL
corresponded	NULL
clearly	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
shuttered	NULL
window	NULL
outside	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
glimmer	NULL
from	NULL
beneath	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

Evidently	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
skylight	NULL
which	NULL
let	NULL
in	NULL
light	NULL
from	NULL
above	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
gazing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sinister	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
wondering	NULL
what	NULL
secret	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
veil	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suddenly	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
steps	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
shadow	NULL
pass	NULL
backward	NULL
and	NULL
forward	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
slit	NULL
of	NULL
dim	NULL
light	NULL
which	NULL
shone	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
mad	NULL
,	NULL
unreasoning	NULL
terror	NULL
rose	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
me	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Holmes	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
overstrung	NULL
nerves	NULL
failed	NULL
me	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
turned	NULL
and	NULL
ran	NULL
--	NULL
ran	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
some	NULL
dreadful	NULL
hand	NULL
were	NULL
behind	NULL
me	NULL
clutching	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
skirt	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
dress	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
rushed	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
,	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL

and	NULL
straight	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
arms	NULL

outside	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
terrified	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
rushed	NULL
past	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
nothing	NULL
until	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
myself	NULL
lying	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
bed	NULL
trembling	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Holmes	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
live	NULL
there	NULL
longer	NULL
without	NULL
some	NULL
advice	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
frightened	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
servants	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
horrible	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
bring	NULL
you	NULL
down	NULL
all	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
fled	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
my	NULL
curiosity	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
strong	NULL
as	NULL
my	NULL
fears	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
soon	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
would	NULL
send	NULL
you	NULL
a	NULL
wire	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
cloak	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
about	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
returned	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
easier	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
horrible	NULL
doubt	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
approached	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
lest	NULL
the	NULL
dog	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
loose	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
Toller	NULL
had	NULL
drunk	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
insensibility	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
household	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
influence	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
savage	NULL
creature	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
venture	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
him	NULL
free	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
slipped	NULL
in	NULL
in	NULL
safety	NULL
and	NULL
lay	NULL
awake	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
joy	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
getting	NULL
leave	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
Winchester	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
back	NULL
before	NULL
three	NULL
o'clock	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Mr.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Rucastle	NULL

will	NULL
be	NULL
away	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
told	NULL
you	NULL
all	NULL
my	NULL
adventures	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Holmes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL

Holmes	NULL

had	NULL
listened	NULL

this	NULL
extraordinary	NULL

My	NULL

now	NULL

up	NULL

down	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL

his	NULL

Is	NULL
Toller	NULL
still	NULL
drunk	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL

Yes	NULL

I	NULL
heard	NULL

do	NULL
nothing	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL

"	NULL
Excellent	NULL
!	NULL

We	NULL
shall	NULL
then	NULL
look	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
feasible	NULL
explanation	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
brought	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
personate	NULL
someone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
person	NULL
is	NULL
imprisoned	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
chamber	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
is	NULL
obvious	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
to	NULL
who	NULL
this	NULL
prisoner	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
daughter	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Alice	NULL
Rucastle	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
America	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
were	NULL
chosen	NULL
,	NULL
doubtless	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
resembling	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
height	NULL
,	NULL
figure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
colour	NULL
of	NULL
your	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

Hers	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
possibly	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
illness	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
has	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
yours	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sacrificed	NULL
also	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
chance	NULL
you	NULL
came	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
tresses	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
was	NULL
undoubtedly	NULL
some	NULL
friend	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
--	NULL
possibly	NULL
her	NULL
fiancé	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
wore	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
dress	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
like	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
convinced	NULL
from	NULL
your	NULL
laughter	NULL
,	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
afterwards	NULL
from	NULL
your	NULL
gesture	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Rucastle	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
desired	NULL
his	NULL
attentions	NULL

The	NULL
dog	NULL
is	NULL

loose	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
endeavouring	NULL

her	NULL

So	NULL
much	NULL
is	NULL
fairly	NULL
clear	NULL

The	NULL
most	NULL
serious	NULL
point	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL

the	NULL
disposition	NULL

out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL

a	NULL

appeared	NULL
at	NULL

a	NULL
very	NULL

burly	NULL
man	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
stick	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL

Miss	NULL
Hunter	NULL
screamed	NULL
and	NULL
shrunk	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Sherlock	NULL
Holmes	NULL
sprang	NULL
forward	NULL
and	NULL
confronted	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
villain	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
where	NULL
's	NULL
your	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
fat	NULL
man	NULL
cast	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
skylight	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
shrieked	NULL

"	NULL
you	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
and	NULL
clattered	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
as	NULL
hard	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL

cried	NULL
Miss	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
I.	NULL
"	NULL
Better	NULL
close	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL

"	NULL
cried	NULL
Holmes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
all	NULL
rushed	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
hardly	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
baying	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hound	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
a	NULL
scream	NULL
of	NULL
agony	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
horrible	NULL
worrying	NULL
sound	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
dreadful	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
elderly	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
red	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
shaking	NULL
limbs	NULL
came	NULL
staggering	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
side	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
God	NULL

he	NULL
cried	NULL

"	NULL
Someone	NULL

loosed	NULL
the	NULL
dog	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
not	NULL

Quick	NULL

or	NULL
it	NULL
'll	NULL
be	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL

"	NULL

Holmes	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
rushed	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
angle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
Toller	NULL
hurrying	NULL
behind	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
huge	NULL
famished	NULL
brute	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
black	NULL
muzzle	NULL
buried	NULL
in	NULL
Rucastle	NULL
's	NULL
throat	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
writhed	NULL
and	NULL
screamed	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
.	NULL

Running	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
blew	NULL
its	NULL
brains	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
fell	NULL
over	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
keen	NULL
white	NULL
teeth	NULL
still	NULL
meeting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
creases	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
much	NULL
labour	NULL
we	NULL
separated	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
carried	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
living	NULL
but	NULL
horribly	NULL
mangled	NULL
,	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
laid	NULL
him	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
sofa	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
dispatched	NULL
the	NULL
sobered	NULL
Toller	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
to	NULL
relieve	NULL
his	NULL
pain	NULL

We	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
assembled	NULL
round	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
opened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL

gaunt	NULL
woman	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL

"	NULL
Mrs.	NULL

Mr.	NULL

Ah	NULL

miss	NULL

it	NULL

you	NULL

"	NULL
Ha	NULL

said	NULL
Holmes	NULL

looking	NULL
keenly	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

Then	NULL

pray	NULL

sit	NULL
down	NULL

there	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
soon	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL

said	NULL
she	NULL

I	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
happy	NULL
at	NULL

Miss	NULL

was	NULL
n't	NULL

from	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL

again	NULL

She	NULL

slighted	NULL

had	NULL
no	NULL

anything	NULL

it	NULL
never	NULL

until	NULL
after	NULL
she	NULL
met	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Fowler	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL

As	NULL
well	NULL

I	NULL

Miss	NULL
Alice	NULL
had	NULL
rights	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL

quiet	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL

about	NULL

just	NULL
left	NULL
everything	NULL
in	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Rucastle	NULL
's	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
safe	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
husband	NULL
coming	NULL
forward	NULL

who	NULL
would	NULL
ask	NULL

all	NULL
that	NULL

him	NULL

then	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
time	NULL

put	NULL
a	NULL

it	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
her	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL
whether	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL
use	NULL
her	NULL
money	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL

it	NULL

he	NULL
kept	NULL
on	NULL

her	NULL
until	NULL
she	NULL

brain-fever	NULL

and	NULL
for	NULL
six	NULL
weeks	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
death	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
better	NULL

all	NULL
worn	NULL

a	NULL
shadow	NULL

with	NULL

that	NULL

n't	NULL
make	NULL

her	NULL

he	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Ah	NULL

Mr.	NULL

then	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
presume	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
brought	NULL
Miss	NULL

down	NULL

Mr.	NULL

being	NULL
a	NULL

"	NULL
Mr.	NULL

was	NULL

said	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Toller	NULL
serenely	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
he	NULL
managed	NULL
that	NULL

no	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL

should	NULL
be	NULL
ready	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
when	NULL
your	NULL
master	NULL

gone	NULL
out	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL

just	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
sure	NULL
we	NULL
owe	NULL
you	NULL
an	NULL
apology	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Toller	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Holmes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
certainly	NULL
cleared	NULL
up	NULL
everything	NULL

And	NULL
here	NULL
comes	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL

so	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL

that	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
best	NULL
escort	NULL

back	NULL

thus	NULL
was	NULL
solved	NULL
the	NULL
mystery	NULL

the	NULL
sinister	NULL

much	NULL
