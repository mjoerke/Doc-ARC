I	O
THIS	O
is	O
the	O
saddest	O
story	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
heard	O

We	O
had	O
known	O
the	B-PER
Ashburnhams	I-PER
for	O
nine	O
seasons	O
of	O
the	B-GPE
town	I-GPE
of	I-GPE
Nauheim	I-GPE
with	O
an	O
extreme	O
intimacy	O
--	O
or	O

rather	O
with	O
an	O

My	B-PER

I	O
knew	O
Captain	B-PER

Mrs	B-PER
Ashburnham	I-PER
as	O
well	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
to	O

anybody	B-PER

and	O
yet	O
,	O
in	O
another	O
sense	O
,	O
we	O
knew	O
nothing	O
at	O
all	O
about	O
them	O

This	O
is	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
things	O
only	O
possible	O
with	O
English	B-PER
people	I-PER
of	O
whom	O
,	O
till	O
today	O

when	O
I	O
sit	O
down	O
to	O

out	O
what	O
I	O
know	O
of	O
this	O
sad	O
affair	O

I	O
knew	O
nothing	O
whatever	O

Six	O
months	O

I	O
had	O
never	O
been	O
to	O
England	B-GPE

,	O
certainly	O

I	O

I	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
mean	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
acquainted	O
with	O
many	O
English	B-PER
people	I-PER

Living	O

which	O
is	O

to	O

that	O
we	O

You	O
will	O
gather	O
from	O
this	O
statement	O
that	O
one	O
of	O

as	O
the	O
saying	O
is	O

a	O

from	O
the	O
statement	O
that	O
my	B-PER

that	O
she	O
was	O
the	B-PER

Captain	B-PER
Ashburnham	I-PER
also	O

a	O

But	O
,	O
whereas	O
a	O
yearly	O

at	O
Nauheim	B-GPE
tuned	O
him	O

the	O

the	O
twelvemonth	O

the	O
two	O

so	O
were	O
only	O
just	O
enough	O
to	O
keep	O
poor	O
Florence	B-PER
alive	O
from	O
year	O

The	O
reason	O
for	O
his	O
heart	O
was	O

approximately	O
,	O
polo	O
,	O
or	O
too	O
much	O
hard	O

in	O
his	O

The	O
reason	O
for	O
poor	O
Florence	B-PER
's	O
broken	O
years	O
was	O
a	O
storm	O
at	O
sea	B-LOC
upon	O
our	O
first	O
crossing	O
to	O
Europe	B-GPE
,	O
and	O
the	O
immediate	O
reasons	O
for	O
our	O
imprisonment	O
in	O
that	B-GPE
continent	I-GPE
were	O
doctor	B-PER
's	O
orders	O
.	O

They	O
said	O
that	O
even	O
the	O
short	O
Channel	B-LOC
crossing	O
might	O
well	O
kill	O
the	B-PER
poor	I-PER
thing	I-PER

When	O
we	O
all	O
first	O
met	O
,	O
Captain	B-PER
Ashburnham	I-PER
,	O
home	O
on	O
sick	O
leave	O
from	O
an	B-GPE
India	I-GPE
to	I-GPE
which	I-GPE
he	I-GPE
was	I-GPE
never	I-GPE

was	O
thirty-three	O

Mrs	B-PER

I	O
was	O
thirty-six	O
and	O
poor	O
Florence	B-PER

Thus	O
today	O
Florence	B-PER
would	O

thirty-nine	O

forty-two	O

whereas	O
I	O

You	O

therefore	O

that	O
our	O

solemnly	NULL
avow	NULL
that	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
have	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
hinted	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
impropriety	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
conversation	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
days	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
vouch	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
cleanness	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
thoughts	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
absolute	NULL
chastity	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
what	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
does	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
work	NULL
out	NULL
?	NULL

Is	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
thing	NULL
a	NULL
folly	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
mockery	NULL
?	NULL

Am	NULL
I	NULL
no	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
eunuch	NULL
or	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
proper	NULL
man	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
existence	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
raging	NULL
stallion	NULL
forever	NULL
neighing	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
neighbour	NULL
's	NULL
womankind	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
guide	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
if	NULL
everything	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
nebulous	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
so	NULL
elementary	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
morals	NULL
of	NULL
sex	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
guide	NULL
us	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
subtle	NULL
morality	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
other	NULL
personal	NULL
contacts	NULL
,	NULL
associations	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
activities	NULL
?	NULL

Or	NULL
are	NULL
we	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
act	NULL
on	NULL
impulse	NULL
alone	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
all	NULL
a	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

II	NULL
I	NULL
DO	NULL
N'T	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
this	NULL
thing	NULL
down	NULL
--	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
and	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
story	NULL
;	NULL
or	NULL
whether	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
distance	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
reached	NULL
me	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
lips	NULL
of	NULL
Leonora	NULL
or	NULL
from	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
just	NULL
imagine	NULL
myself	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fireplace	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
country	NULL
cottage	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sympathetic	NULL
soul	NULL
opposite	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
talking	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
voice	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
sounds	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
and	NULL
overhead	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
black	NULL
flood	NULL
of	NULL
wind	NULL
polishes	NULL
the	NULL
bright	NULL
stars	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
time	NULL
we	NULL
shall	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
moon	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Why	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
nearly	NULL
as	NULL
bright	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
Provence	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
we	NULL
shall	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fireside	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
because	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
Provence	NULL
where	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
saddest	NULL
stories	NULL
are	NULL
gay	NULL
.	NULL

Consider	NULL
the	NULL
lamentable	NULL
history	NULL
of	NULL
Peire	NULL
Vidal	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
Florence	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
motored	NULL
from	NULL
Biarritz	NULL
to	NULL
Las	NULL
Tours	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Black	NULL
Mountains	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
tortuous	NULL
valley	NULL
there	NULL
rises	NULL
up	NULL
an	NULL
immense	NULL
pinnacle	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
pinnacle	NULL
are	NULL
four	NULL
castles	NULL
--	NULL
Las	NULL
Tours	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Towers	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
immense	NULL
mistral	NULL
blew	NULL
down	NULL
that	NULL
valley	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
from	NULL
France	NULL
into	NULL
Provence	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
silver	NULL
grey	NULL
olive	NULL
leaves	NULL
appeared	NULL
like	NULL
hair	NULL
flying	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tufts	NULL
of	NULL
rosemary	NULL
crept	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
iron	NULL
rocks	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
torn	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
roots	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
Florence	NULL
who	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Las	NULL
Tours	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
are	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
much	NULL
her	NULL
bright	NULL
personality	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
Stamford	NULL
,	NULL
Connecticut	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
yet	NULL
a	NULL
graduate	NULL
of	NULL
Poughkeepsie	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
could	NULL
imagine	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
queer	NULL
,	NULL
chattery	NULL
person	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
the	NULL
far-away	NULL
look	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
romantic	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
look	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
seeing	NULL
poetic	NULL
dreams	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
looking	NULL
through	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
hardly	NULL
ever	NULL
did	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
you	NULL
!	NULL

--	NULL
holding	NULL
up	NULL
one	NULL
hand	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
silence	NULL
any	NULL
objection	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
any	NULL
comment	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
talk	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
William	NULL
the	NULL
Silent	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
Gustave	NULL
the	NULL
Loquacious	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
Paris	NULL
frocks	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
dressed	NULL
in	NULL
1337	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
Fantin-Latour	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
Paris-Lyons-Mediterranée	NULL
train-deluxe	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
worth	NULL
while	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
off	NULL
at	NULL
Tarascon	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
windswept	NULL
suspension-bridge	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
Rhone	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
another	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
Beaucaire	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
never	NULL
did	NULL
take	NULL
another	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
Beaucaire	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
--	NULL
beautiful	NULL
Beaucaire	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
,	NULL
triangular	NULL
white	NULL
tower	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
thin	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
needle	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
tall	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
Flatiron	NULL
,	NULL
between	NULL
Fifth	NULL
and	NULL
Broadway	NULL
--	NULL
Beaucaire	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
grey	NULL
walls	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pinnacle	NULL
surrounding	NULL
an	NULL
acre	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
blue	NULL
irises	NULL
,	NULL
beneath	NULL
the	NULL
tallness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stone	NULL
pines	NULL
,	NULL
What	NULL
a	NULL
beautiful	NULL
thing	NULL
the	NULL
stone	NULL
pine	NULL
is	NULL
!	NULL

...	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
never	NULL
did	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
anywhere	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
to	NULL
Heidelberg	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
Hamelin	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
Verona	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
Mont	NULL
Majour	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
Carcassonne	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
guess	NULL
Florence	NULL
got	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
seeing	NULL
eye	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
unfortunately	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
is	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
places	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
--	NULL
towns	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
blinding	NULL
white	NULL
sun	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
stone	NULL
pines	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
;	NULL
corners	NULL
of	NULL
gables	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
carved	NULL
and	NULL
painted	NULL
with	NULL
stags	NULL
and	NULL
scarlet	NULL
flowers	NULL
and	NULL
crowstepped	NULL
gables	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
saint	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
grey	NULL
and	NULL
pink	NULL
palazzi	NULL
and	NULL
walled	NULL
towns	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Mediterranean	NULL
,	NULL
between	NULL
Leghorn	NULL
and	NULL
Naples	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
did	NULL
we	NULL
see	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
world	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
is	NULL
like	NULL
spots	NULL
of	NULL
colour	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
immense	NULL
canvas	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
n't	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

Is	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
digression	NULL
or	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL
digression	NULL
?	NULL

Again	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
listener	NULL
,	NULL
sit	NULL
opposite	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
so	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
anything	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
I	NULL
led	NULL
with	NULL
Florence	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
Florence	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
bright	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
danced	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
dance	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
floors	NULL
of	NULL
castles	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
seas	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
salons	NULL
of	NULL
modistes	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
plages	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Riviera	NULL
--	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
gay	NULL
tremulous	NULL
beam	NULL
,	NULL
reflected	NULL
from	NULL
water	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
ceiling	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
my	NULL
function	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
that	NULL
bright	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
existence	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
difficult	NULL
as	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
with	NULL
your	NULL
hand	NULL
that	NULL
dancing	NULL
reflection	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
task	NULL
lasted	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

Florence	NULL
's	NULL
aunts	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
laziest	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
Philadelphia	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
Philadelphia	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
New	NULL
England	NULL
conscience	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
thing	NULL
they	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
called	NULL
in	NULL
on	NULL
Florence	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
ancient	NULL
,	NULL
colonial	NULL
,	NULL
wooden	NULL
house	NULL
beneath	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
,	NULL
thin-leaved	NULL
elms	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
question	NULL
they	NULL
asked	NULL
me	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
how	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
but	NULL
what	NULL
did	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
I	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
see	NULL
any	NULL
call	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
does	NULL
one	NULL
do	NULL
things	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
just	NULL
drifted	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
wanted	NULL
Florence	NULL
.	NULL

First	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
drifted	NULL
in	NULL
on	NULL
Florence	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
Browning	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
in	NULL
Fourteenth	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
still	NULL
residential	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tea	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
see	NULL
why	NULL
Florence	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
spelling	NULL
bee	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
Poughkeepsie	NULL
graduate	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
guess	NULL
Florence	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
raise	NULL
the	NULL
culture	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Stuyvesant	NULL
crowd	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
in	NULL
slumming	NULL
.	NULL

Intellectual	NULL
slumming	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
always	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
elevated	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Poor	NULL
dear	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
lecture	NULL
Teddy	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL
a	NULL
Franz	NULL
Hals	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
Wouvermans	NULL
and	NULL
why	NULL
the	NULL
Pre-Mycenaean	NULL
statues	NULL
were	NULL
cubical	NULL
with	NULL
knobs	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wonder	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thankful	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
understand	NULL
my	NULL
whole	NULL
attentions	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
whole	NULL
endeavours	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
Florence	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
topics	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
finds	NULL
at	NULL
Cnossos	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
mental	NULL
spirituality	NULL
of	NULL
Walter	NULL
Pater	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
die	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
solemnly	NULL
informed	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
became	NULL
excited	NULL
over	NULL
anything	NULL
or	NULL
if	NULL
her	NULL
emotions	NULL
were	NULL
really	NULL
stirred	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
heart	NULL
might	NULL
cease	NULL
to	NULL
beat	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
twelve	NULL
years	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
watch	NULL
every	NULL
word	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
person	NULL
uttered	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
conversation	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
head	NULL
it	NULL
off	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
call	NULL
"	NULL
things	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
off	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
poverty	NULL
,	NULL
crime	NULL
,	NULL
religion	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
doctor	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
carried	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
ship	NULL
at	NULL
Havre	NULL
assured	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

Good	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
are	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
fellows	NULL
monstrous	NULL
idiots	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
is	NULL
there	NULL
a	NULL
freemasonry	NULL
between	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
?	NULL

...	NULL
That	NULL
is	NULL
what	NULL
makes	NULL
me	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
fellow	NULL
Peire	NULL
Vidal	NULL
.	NULL

Because	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
story	NULL
is	NULL
culture	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
head	NULL
her	NULL
towards	NULL
culture	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
so	NULL
funny	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
laugh	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
so	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

Do	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
?	NULL

Las	NULL
Tours	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Four	NULL
Castles	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
chatelaine	NULL
Blanche	NULL
Somebody-or-other	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
term	NULL
of	NULL
commendation	NULL
,	NULL
La	NULL
Louve	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
She-Wolf	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Peire	NULL
Vidal	NULL
the	NULL
Troubadour	NULL
paid	NULL
his	NULL
court	NULL
to	NULL
La	NULL
Louve	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
,	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
compliment	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
people	NULL
do	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
're	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
!	NULL

--	NULL
he	NULL
dressed	NULL
himself	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
wolfskins	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
Black	NULL
Mountains	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
shepherds	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Montagne	NULL
Noire	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
dogs	NULL
mistook	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
wolf	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
torn	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
fangs	NULL
and	NULL
beaten	NULL
with	NULL
clubs	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
they	NULL
carried	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Las	NULL
Tours	NULL
and	NULL
La	NULL
Louve	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
impressed	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
polished	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
remonstrated	NULL
seriously	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Vidal	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
poet	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
proper	NULL
to	NULL
treat	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
poet	NULL
with	NULL
indifference	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
Peire	NULL
Vidal	NULL
declared	NULL
himself	NULL
Emperor	NULL
of	NULL
Jerusalem	NULL
or	NULL
somewhere	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
husband	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
kneel	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
kiss	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
though	NULL
La	NULL
Louve	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Peire	NULL
set	NULL
sail	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
rowing	NULL
boat	NULL
with	NULL
four	NULL
companions	NULL
to	NULL
redeem	NULL
the	NULL
Holy	NULL
Sepulchre	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
they	NULL
struck	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
rock	NULL
somewhere	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
great	NULL
expense	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
husband	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
fit	NULL
out	NULL
an	NULL
expedition	NULL
to	NULL
fetch	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Peire	NULL
Vidal	NULL
fell	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
Lady	NULL
's	NULL
bed	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
ferocious	NULL
warrior	NULL
,	NULL
remonstrated	NULL
some	NULL
more	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
courtesy	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
great	NULL
poets	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
La	NULL
Louve	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
ferocious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
came	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Is	NULL
n't	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
story	NULL
?	NULL

You	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
queer	NULL
old-fashionedness	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
aunts	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
Misses	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
yet	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
uncle	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
extraordinarily	NULL
lovable	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Uncle	NULL
John	NULL
.	NULL

Thin	NULL
,	NULL
gentle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
heart	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
what	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
afterwards	NULL
became	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
reside	NULL
at	NULL
Stamford	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
home	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
Waterbury	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
watches	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
factory	NULL
there	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
queer	NULL
American	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
change	NULL
its	NULL
functions	NULL
almost	NULL
from	NULL
year	NULL
to	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
nine	NULL
months	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
manufacture	NULL
buttons	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
bone	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
suddenly	NULL
produce	NULL
brass	NULL
buttons	NULL
for	NULL
coachmen	NULL
's	NULL
liveries	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
turn	NULL
at	NULL
embossed	NULL
tin	NULL
lids	NULL
for	NULL
candy	NULL
boxes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fact	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
weak	NULL
and	NULL
fluttering	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
his	NULL
factory	NULL
to	NULL
manufacture	NULL
anything	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
retire	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
retire	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
seventy	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
worried	NULL
at	NULL
having	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
boys	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
point	NULL
after	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
exclaim	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
There	NULL
goes	NULL
the	NULL
laziest	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
Waterbury	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
tour	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Florence	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
called	NULL
Jimmy	NULL
went	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
appears	NULL
from	NULL
what	NULL
Florence	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
Jimmy	NULL
's	NULL
function	NULL
with	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
exciting	NULL
topics	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
instance	NULL
,	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
political	NULL
discussions	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
violent	NULL
Democrat	NULL
in	NULL
days	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
might	NULL
travel	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
over	NULL
without	NULL
finding	NULL
anything	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
Republican	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
an	NULL
anecdote	NULL
is	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
you	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
perhaps	NULL
important	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
should	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
was	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
influence	NULL
in	NULL
forming	NULL
the	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
set	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
San	NULL
Francisco	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
South	NULL
Seas	NULL
old	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
take	NULL
something	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
little	NULL
presents	NULL
to	NULL
people	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
voyage	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
purpose	NULL
were	NULL
oranges	NULL
--	NULL
because	NULL
California	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
orange	NULL
country	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
comfortable	NULL
folding	NULL
chairs	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
bought	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
many	NULL
cases	NULL
of	NULL
oranges	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
cool	NULL
California	NULL
oranges	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
half-a-dozen	NULL
folding	NULL
chairs	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
special	NULL
case	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
kept	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
cabin	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
cargo	NULL
of	NULL
fruit	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
every	NULL
person	NULL
on	NULL
board	NULL
the	NULL
several	NULL
steamers	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
employed	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
every	NULL
person	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
nodding	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
an	NULL
orange	NULL
every	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
they	NULL
lasted	NULL
him	NULL
right	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
girdle	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
mighty	NULL
globe	NULL
of	NULL
ours	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
North	NULL
Cape	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
horizon	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
thin	NULL
man	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
lighthouse	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Hello	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
says	NULL
he	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
these	NULL
fellows	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
lonely	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
's	NULL
take	NULL
them	NULL
some	NULL
oranges	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
boatload	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fruit	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
himself	NULL
rowed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
lighthouse	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
horizon	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
folding	NULL
chairs	NULL
he	NULL
lent	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
lady	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
across	NULL
and	NULL
liked	NULL
or	NULL
who	NULL
seemed	NULL
tired	NULL
and	NULL
invalidish	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ship	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
guarded	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
his	NULL
niece	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
obtrusive	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
only	NULL
left	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
physical	NULL
laboratory	NULL
at	NULL
Waterbury	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
benefit	NULL
of	NULL
science	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
considered	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
quite	NULL
an	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
joke	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
age	NULL
of	NULL
eighty-four	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
five	NULL
days	NULL
before	NULL
poor	NULL
Florence	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
died	NULL
of	NULL
bronchitis	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
found	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
absolutely	NULL
nothing	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
organ	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
certainly	NULL
jumped	NULL
or	NULL
squeaked	NULL
or	NULL
something	NULL
just	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
doctors	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
appears	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
odd	NULL
formation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lungs	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
much	NULL
understand	NULL
about	NULL
these	NULL
matters	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
inherited	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
because	NULL
Florence	NULL
died	NULL
five	NULL
days	NULL
after	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wish	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
worry	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
Waterbury	NULL
just	NULL
after	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
old	NULL
fellow	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
many	NULL
charitable	NULL
bequests	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
appoint	NULL
trustees	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
not	NULL
being	NULL
properly	NULL
handled	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
worry	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
things	NULL
roughly	NULL
settled	NULL
I	NULL
received	NULL
the	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
cable	NULL
from	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
begging	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
talk	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
immediately	NULL
afterwards	NULL
came	NULL
one	NULL
from	NULL
Leonora	NULL
saying	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
please	NULL
do	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
helpful	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
the	NULL
cable	NULL
without	NULL
consulting	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
afterwards	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
pretty	NULL
much	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
told	NULL
the	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
arrived	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
good	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
my	NULL
first	NULL
taste	NULL
of	NULL
English	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
amazing	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
overwhelming	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
shall	NULL
forget	NULL
the	NULL
polished	NULL
cob	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
beside	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
drove	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
animal	NULL
's	NULL
action	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
high-stepping	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
skin	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
satin	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
peace	NULL
!	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
red	NULL
cheeks	NULL
!	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
,	NULL
beautiful	NULL
old	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
near	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
Teleragh	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
descended	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
,	NULL
clear	NULL
,	NULL
windswept	NULL
waste	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
New	NULL
Forest	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
amazing	NULL
to	NULL
arrive	NULL
there	NULL
from	NULL
Waterbury	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
head	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
Teddy	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
remember	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
cabled	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
"	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
talk	NULL
"	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
unbelievable	NULL
that	NULL
anything	NULL
essentially	NULL
calamitous	NULL
could	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
place	NULL
and	NULL
those	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
spirit	NULL
of	NULL
peace	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
beautiful	NULL
and	NULL
smiling	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
coils	NULL
of	NULL
yellow	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
doorstep	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
butler	NULL
and	NULL
footman	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
maid	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
just	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
So	NULL
glad	NULL
you	NULL
've	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
run	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
lunch	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
town	NULL
ten	NULL
miles	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
come	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
over	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
call	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
urgent	NULL
telegrams	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
hounds	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
poor	NULL
devil	NULL
beside	NULL
me	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
agony	NULL
.	NULL

Absolute	NULL
,	NULL
hopeless	NULL
,	NULL
dumb	NULL
agony	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
passes	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
of	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
.	NULL

III	NULL
IT	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
hot	NULL
summer	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
August	NULL
,	NULL
1904	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
been	NULL
taking	NULL
the	NULL
baths	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
feels	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
patient	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
places	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
patient	NULL
anywhere	NULL

I	NULL
daresay	NULL
the	NULL
patients	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
home	NULL
feeling	NULL

some	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
anchorage	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
bath	NULL
attendants	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
cheerful	NULL
faces	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
authority	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
white	NULL
linen	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
at	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
gave	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
--	NULL
what	NULL
shall	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
almost	NULL
of	NULL
nakedness	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
nakedness	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
feels	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sea-shore	NULL
or	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
great	NULL
open	NULL
space	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
attachments	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
accumulations	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
own	NULL
home	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
innate	NULL
sympathies	NULL
draw	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
particular	NULL
chairs	NULL
that	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
enfold	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
embrace	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
take	NULL
one	NULL
along	NULL
particular	NULL
streets	NULL
that	NULL
seem	NULL
friendly	NULL
when	NULL
others	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
hostile	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
believe	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
feeling	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
important	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
it	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
a	NULL
wanderer	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
public	NULL
resorts	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
one	NULL
is	NULL
too	NULL
polished	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

Heaven	NULL
knows	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
an	NULL
untidy	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
whilst	NULL
poor	NULL
Florence	NULL
was	NULL
taking	NULL
her	NULL
morning	NULL
bath	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
stood	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
carefully	NULL
swept	NULL
steps	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Englischer	NULL
Hof	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
carefully	NULL
arranged	NULL
trees	NULL
in	NULL
tubs	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
carefully	NULL
arranged	NULL
gravel	NULL
whilst	NULL
carefully	NULL
arranged	NULL
people	NULL
walked	NULL
past	NULL
in	NULL
carefully	NULL
calculated	NULL
gaiety	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
carefully	NULL
calculated	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
tall	NULL
trees	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
gardens	NULL
,	NULL
going	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
reddish	NULL
stone	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
baths	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
were	NULL
they	NULL
white	NULL
half-timber	NULL
châlets	NULL
?	NULL

Upon	NULL
my	NULL
word	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
forgotten	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
will	NULL
give	NULL
you	NULL
the	NULL
measure	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
landscape	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
my	NULL
way	NULL
blindfolded	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hot	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
douche	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fountain	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
quadrangle	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
rusty	NULL
water	NULL
gushes	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
my	NULL
way	NULL
blindfolded	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
exact	NULL
distances	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
Hotel	NULL
Regina	NULL
you	NULL
took	NULL
one	NULL
hundred	NULL
and	NULL
eighty-seven	NULL
paces	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
sharp	NULL
,	NULL
left-handed	NULL
,	NULL
four	NULL
hundred	NULL
and	NULL
twenty	NULL
took	NULL
you	NULL
straight	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fountain	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
Englischer	NULL
Hof	NULL
,	NULL
starting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sidewalk	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
ninety-seven	NULL
paces	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
four	NULL
hundred	NULL
and	NULL
twenty	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
turning	NULL
lefthanded	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
you	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
nothing	NULL
whatever	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
counting	NULL
my	NULL
footsteps	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
would	NULL
walk	NULL
with	NULL
Florence	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
baths	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
entertained	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
conversation	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
wonderful	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
conversation	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
walked	NULL
very	NULL
lightly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
nicely	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
dressed	NULL
beautifully	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
expensively	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
money	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
minded	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
remember	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
dresses	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
remember	NULL
just	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
simple	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
blue	NULL
figured	NULL
silk	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
Chinese	NULL
pattern	NULL
--	NULL
very	NULL
full	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
skirts	NULL
and	NULL
broadening	NULL
out	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
shoulders	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
copper-coloured	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
heels	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
shoes	NULL
were	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
high	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
tripped	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
points	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
toes	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bathing	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
opened	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
look	NULL
back	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
coquettish	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
cheek	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
caressing	NULL
her	NULL
shoulder	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
wore	NULL
an	NULL
immensely	NULL
broad	NULL
Leghorn	NULL
hat	NULL
--	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
Chapeau	NULL
de	NULL
Paille	NULL
of	NULL
Rubens	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
very	NULL
white	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hat	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
tied	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
lightly	NULL
knotted	NULL
scarf	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
stuff	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
dress	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
value	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
neck	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
some	NULL
simple	NULL
pink	NULL
,	NULL
coral	NULL
beads	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
her	NULL
complexion	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL
clearness	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL
smoothness	NULL
...	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
how	NULL
I	NULL
most	NULL
exactly	NULL
remember	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
shoulder	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
flashed	NULL
very	NULL
blue	NULL
--	NULL
dark	NULL
pebble	NULL
blue	NULL
...	NULL
And	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
devil	NULL
!	NULL

For	NULL
whose	NULL
benefit	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

For	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bath	NULL
attendant	NULL
?	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
passers-by	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
never	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
on	NULL
any	NULL
possible	NULL
occasion	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
place	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
so	NULL
smile	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
mockingly	NULL
,	NULL
invitingly	NULL
.	NULL

Ah	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
riddle	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
other	NULL
women	NULL
are	NULL
riddles	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
occurs	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
way	NULL
back	NULL
I	NULL
began	NULL
a	NULL
sentence	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
finished	NULL
...	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
steps	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
hotel	NULL
every	NULL
morning	NULL
before	NULL
starting	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
fetch	NULL
Florence	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
bath	NULL
.	NULL

Natty	NULL
,	NULL
precise	NULL
,	NULL
well-brushed	NULL
,	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
rather	NULL
small	NULL
amongst	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
English	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
lank	NULL
Americans	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
rotund	NULL
Germans	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
obese	NULL
Russian	NULL
Jewesses	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
stand	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
tapping	NULL
a	NULL
cigarette	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
outside	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
surveying	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sunlight	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
again	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
can	NULL
imagine	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
coming	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
forgotten	NULL
the	NULL
aspect	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
never	NULL
forget	NULL
the	NULL
aspect	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Hotel	NULL
Excelsior	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
other	NULL
evenings	NULL
.	NULL

Whole	NULL
castles	NULL
have	NULL
vanished	NULL
from	NULL
my	NULL
memory	NULL
,	NULL
whole	NULL
cities	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
visited	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
white	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
festooned	NULL
with	NULL
papier-maché	NULL
fruits	NULL
and	NULL
flowers	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
tall	NULL
windows	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
many	NULL
tables	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
screen	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
with	NULL
three	NULL
golden	NULL
cranes	NULL
flying	NULL
upward	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
panel	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
palm-tree	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
swish	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
waiter	NULL
's	NULL
feet	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
cold	NULL
expensive	NULL
elegance	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
mien	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
diners	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
evening	NULL
--	NULL
their	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
earnestness	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
meal	NULL
prescribed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Kur	NULL
authorities	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
sobriety	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
seek	NULL
not	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
means	NULL
to	NULL
enjoy	NULL
their	NULL
meals	NULL
--	NULL
those	NULL
things	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
not	NULL
easily	NULL
forget	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
twilight	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
lounge	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
screen	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
head	NULL
waiter	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
face	NULL
all	NULL
grey	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
subterranean	NULL
nooks	NULL
or	NULL
corners	NULL
do	NULL
people	NULL
cultivate	NULL
those	NULL
absolutely	NULL
grey	NULL
complexions	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
went	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
timorous	NULL
patronage	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
creatures	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
held	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
grey	NULL
ear	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
whispered	NULL
into	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
generally	NULL
a	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
ordeal	NULL
for	NULL
newcomers	NULL
but	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
bore	NULL
it	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
Englishman	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
form	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
syllables	NULL
--	NULL
remember	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
notice	NULL
these	NULL
niceties	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
immediately	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
,	NULL
Captain	NULL
,	NULL
Fourteenth	NULL
Hussars	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
House	NULL
,	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
Teleragh	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
because	NULL
every	NULL
evening	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
whilst	NULL
I	NULL
waited	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
used	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
courtesy	NULL
of	NULL
Monsieur	NULL
Schontz	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
proprietor	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
inspect	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
police	NULL
reports	NULL
that	NULL
each	NULL
guest	NULL
was	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
sign	NULL
upon	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
head	NULL
waiter	NULL
piloted	NULL
him	NULL
immediately	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
vacant	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
three	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Grenfalls	NULL
of	NULL
Falls	NULL
River	NULL
,	NULL
N.J.	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
vacated	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
struck	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL
table	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
newcomers	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
sunlight	NULL
,	NULL
low	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
shone	NULL
straight	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
idea	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
moment	NULL
into	NULL
Captain	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
's	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
face	NULL
hitherto	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wonderful	NULL
English	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
expressed	NULL
nothing	NULL
whatever	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
neither	NULL
joy	NULL
nor	NULL
despair	NULL
;	NULL
neither	NULL
hope	NULL
nor	NULL
fear	NULL
;	NULL
neither	NULL
boredom	NULL
nor	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
perceive	NULL
no	NULL
soul	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
crowded	NULL
room	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
walking	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
jungle	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
came	NULL
across	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL
expression	NULL
before	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
shall	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
insolence	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
insolence	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
modesty	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
modesty	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
fair	NULL
,	NULL
extraordinarily	NULL
ordered	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
wave	NULL
,	NULL
running	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
temple	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
brick-red	NULL
,	NULL
perfectly	NULL
uniform	NULL
in	NULL
tint	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
roots	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hair	NULL
itself	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
yellow	NULL
moustache	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
stiff	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
toothbrush	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
verily	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
black	NULL
smoking	NULL
jacket	NULL
thickened	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
shoulder-blades	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
himself	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
possible	NULL
stoop	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
like	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

four	NULL
powder	NULL
...	NULL
by	NULL
heavens	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
hardly	NULL
ever	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
years	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
him	NULL
did	NULL
I	NULL
hear	NULL
him	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
but	NULL
these	NULL
subjects	NULL
.	NULL

Oh	NULL
,	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
once	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
buy	NULL
my	NULL
special	NULL
shade	NULL
of	NULL
blue	NULL
ties	NULL
cheaper	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
firm	NULL
in	NULL
Burlington	NULL
Arcade	NULL
than	NULL
from	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
bought	NULL
my	NULL
ties	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
firm	NULL
ever	NULL
since	NULL
.	NULL

Otherwise	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
remember	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Burlington	NULL
Arcade	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wonder	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
looks	NULL
like	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
imagine	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
two	NULL
immense	NULL
rows	NULL
of	NULL
pillars	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Forum	NULL
at	NULL
Rome	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
striding	NULL
down	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
probably	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
also	NULL
he	NULL
advised	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
Caledonian	NULL
Deferred	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
rise	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
buy	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
rise	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
knowledge	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL
the	NULL
faintest	NULL
idea	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
drop	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
sky	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
absolutely	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
until	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
ago	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
profusion	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
cases	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
pigskin	NULL
and	NULL
stamped	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
initials	NULL
,	NULL
E.	NULL
F.	NULL
A	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
gun	NULL
cases	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
collar	NULL
cases	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shirt	NULL
cases	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
letter	NULL
cases	NULL
and	NULL
cases	NULL
each	NULL
containing	NULL
four	NULL
bottles	NULL
of	NULL
medicine	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
hat	NULL
cases	NULL
and	NULL
helmet	NULL
cases	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
needed	NULL
a	NULL
whole	NULL
herd	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Gadarene	NULL
swine	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
outfit	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
ever	NULL
penetrated	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
private	NULL
room	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
standing	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
coat	NULL
and	NULL
waistcoat	NULL
off	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
immensely	NULL
long	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
perfectly	NULL
elegant	NULL
trousers	NULL
from	NULL
waist	NULL
to	NULL
boot	NULL
heel	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
slightly	NULL
reflective	NULL
air	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
just	NULL
opening	NULL
one	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
case	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
closing	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

Good	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
did	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
see	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

for	NULL
I	NULL
swear	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
inside	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
soldier	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
adored	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
agony	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hated	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
agony	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
bitter	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
arouse	NULL
anything	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
sentiment	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
anybody	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
even	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
about	NULL
--	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
under	NULL
four	NULL
eyes	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
Ah	NULL
,	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
flash	NULL
of	NULL
inspiration	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
all	NULL
good	NULL
soldiers	NULL
are	NULL
sentimentalists	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
good	NULL
soldiers	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
type	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
profession	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
courage	NULL
,	NULL
loyalty	NULL
,	NULL
honour	NULL
,	NULL
constancy	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
a	NULL
wrong	NULL
impression	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
you	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
literally	NULL
never	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
nine	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
intimacy	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
discuss	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
called	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
graver	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Even	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
final	NULL
outburst	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
late	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
blurted	NULL
out	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
gave	NULL
an	NULL
insight	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
sentimental	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cosmos	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
society	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
woman	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
towards	NULL
redeeming	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
constancy	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
finest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
virtues	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
stiffly	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
statement	NULL
admitted	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
.	NULL

Constancy	NULL
!	NULL

Is	NULL
n't	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
queer	NULL
thought	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
add	NULL
that	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
reader	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
pass	NULL
hours	NULL
lost	NULL
in	NULL
novels	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sentimental	NULL
type	NULL
--	NULL
novels	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
typewriter	NULL
girls	NULL
married	NULL
Marquises	NULL
and	NULL
governesses	NULL
Earls	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
rule	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
true	NULL
love	NULL
ran	NULL
as	NULL
smooth	NULL
as	NULL
buttered	NULL
honey	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
poetry	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
type	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
even	NULL
read	NULL
a	NULL
perfectly	NULL
sad	NULL
love	NULL
story	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
tears	NULL
at	NULL
reading	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hopeless	NULL
parting	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
loved	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sentimental	NULL
yearning	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
puppies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
feeble	NULL
generally	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
plenty	NULL
to	NULL
gurgle	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
sound	NULL
common	NULL
sense	NULL
about	NULL
martingales	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
--	NULL
still	NULL
sentimental	NULL
--	NULL
experiences	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
county	NULL
magistrate	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
intense	NULL
,	NULL
optimistic	NULL
belief	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
love	NULL
to	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
destined	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
eternally	NULL
constant	NULL
to	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
fancy	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
talk	NULL
when	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
man	NULL
around	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
shy	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
astonished	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
final	NULL
burst	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
fatal	NULL
Brindisi	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
persuade	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
really	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
astonished	NULL
to	NULL
observe	NULL
how	NULL
literary	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
just	NULL
his	NULL
expressions	NULL
were	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
like	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
book	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
cheaply	NULL
sentimental	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
he	NULL
regarded	NULL
me	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
regarded	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
solicitor	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
burst	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
horrible	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
me	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Assizes	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
how	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
perfectly	NULL
calm	NULL
and	NULL
business-like	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
secure	NULL
a	NULL
verdict	NULL
of	NULL
not	NULL
guilty	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
daughter	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
tenants	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
accused	NULL
of	NULL
murdering	NULL
her	NULL
baby	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spent	NULL
two	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
defence	NULL
...	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
blue	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
sides	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
type	NULL
of	NULL
box	NULL
of	NULL
matches	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
you	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
carefully	NULL
you	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
perfectly	NULL
honest	NULL
,	NULL
perfectly	NULL
straightforward	NULL
,	NULL
perfectly	NULL
,	NULL
perfectly	NULL
stupid	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
brick	NULL
pink	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
complexion	NULL
,	NULL
running	NULL
perfectly	NULL
level	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
brick	NULL
pink	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
inner	NULL
eyelids	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
,	NULL
sinister	NULL
expression	NULL
--	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
mosaic	NULL
of	NULL
blue	NULL
porcelain	NULL
set	NULL
in	NULL
pink	NULL
china	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
chap	NULL
,	NULL
coming	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
snapped	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
gaze	NULL
of	NULL
every	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
dexterously	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
conjurer	NULL
pockets	NULL
billiard	NULL
balls	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
most	NULL
amazing	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stage	NULL
who	NULL
throws	NULL
up	NULL
sixteen	NULL
balls	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
drop	NULL
into	NULL
pockets	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
person	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
heels	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
inner	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
sleeves	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
stands	NULL
perfectly	NULL
still	NULL
and	NULL
does	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
rough	NULL
,	NULL
hoarse	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
standing	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
screen	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
two	NULL
distinct	NULL
expressions	NULL
flicker	NULL
across	NULL
his	NULL
immobile	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
the	NULL
deuce	NULL
did	NULL
they	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
those	NULL
unflinching	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
direct	NULL
gaze	NULL
?	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
themselves	NULL
never	NULL
moved	NULL
,	NULL
gazing	NULL
over	NULL
my	NULL
shoulder	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
screen	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
gaze	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
level	NULL
and	NULL
perfectly	NULL
direct	NULL
and	NULL
perfectly	NULL
unchanging	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
lids	NULL
really	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
rounded	NULL
themselves	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
lips	NULL
moved	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
saying	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
There	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
expression	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
pride	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
possessor	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
once	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
gaze	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
sunny	NULL
fields	NULL
of	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
All	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
my	NULL
land	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
gaze	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
more	NULL
direct	NULL
,	NULL
harder	NULL
if	NULL
possible	NULL
--	NULL
hardy	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
measuring	NULL
look	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
challenging	NULL
look	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
Wiesbaden	NULL
watching	NULL
him	NULL
play	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
polo	NULL
match	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
Bonner	NULL
Hussaren	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
look	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
balancing	NULL
the	NULL
possibilities	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
German	NULL
Captain	NULL
,	NULL
Count	NULL
Baron	NULL
Idigon	NULL
von	NULL
Lelöffel	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
goal	NULL
posts	NULL
,	NULL
coming	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
ball	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
easy	NULL
canter	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
tricky	NULL
German	NULL
fashion	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
were	NULL
just	NULL
anywhere	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
scratch	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
affair	NULL
.	NULL

Ashburnham	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rails	NULL
not	NULL
five	NULL
yards	NULL
from	NULL
us	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
saying	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Might	NULL
just	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Goodness	NULL
!	NULL

he	NULL
swung	NULL
that	NULL
pony	NULL
round	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
its	NULL
four	NULL
legs	NULL
spread	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
cat	NULL
dropping	NULL
off	NULL
a	NULL
roof	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
that	NULL
look	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
noticed	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
It	NULL
might	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
seem	NULL
even	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
him	NULL
muttering	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
just	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
over	NULL
my	NULL
shoulder	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
,	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
smiling	NULL
brilliantly	NULL
and	NULL
buoyant	NULL
--	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
little	NULL
and	NULL
fair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
radiant	NULL
as	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
exhibited	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
more	NULL
gaiety	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
ever	NULL
since	NULL
known	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
certain	NULL
classes	NULL
of	NULL
English	NULL
people	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
nicer	NULL
ones	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
many	NULL
spas	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
becoming	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
usually	NULL
animated	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
introduced	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
compatriots	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
noticed	NULL
this	NULL
often	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
first	NULL
have	NULL
accepted	NULL
the	NULL
Americans	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
once	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
themselves	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Hallo	NULL
,	NULL
these	NULL
women	NULL
are	NULL
so	NULL
bright	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
are	NULL
n't	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
outdone	NULL
in	NULL
brightness	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
being	NULL
they	NULL
certainly	NULL
are	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
wears	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
Leonora	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
until	NULL
she	NULL
noticed	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
began	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
did	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
gave	NULL
me	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
insolence	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
afterwards	NULL
did	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
single	NULL
thing	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
by	NULL
saying	NULL
in	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
loud	NULL
voice	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
distance	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
stop	NULL
over	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
stuffy	NULL
old	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
Teddy	NULL
.	NULL

Come	NULL
and	NULL
sit	NULL
by	NULL
these	NULL
nice	NULL
people	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

Quite	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
refer	NULL
to	NULL
total	NULL
strangers	NULL
as	NULL
nice	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
too	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
list	NULL
of	NULL
guests	NULL
--	NULL
counted	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
clean	NULL
,	NULL
bull	NULL
terriers	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
rather	NULL
brilliantly	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
vacant	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
beside	NULL
ours	NULL
--	NULL
one	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
reserved	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Guggenheimers	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
just	NULL
sat	NULL
absolutely	NULL
deaf	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
remonstrances	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
waiter	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
grey	NULL
ram	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
poor	NULL
chap	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
his	NULL
steadfast	NULL
duty	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Guggenheimers	NULL
of	NULL
Chicago	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
stayed	NULL
there	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
worried	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
life	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
two	NULL
dollars	NULL
fifty	NULL
and	NULL
grumble	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
tipping	NULL
system	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Teddy	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
trouble	NULL
whatever	NULL
except	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
smiles	NULL
of	NULL
Leonora	NULL
might	NULL
cause	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
apparently	NULL
unimpressionable	NULL
bosom	NULL
--	NULL
though	NULL
you	NULL
never	NULL
can	NULL
tell	NULL
what	NULL
may	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
behind	NULL
even	NULL
a	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
spotless	NULL
plastron	NULL
!	NULL

--	NULL
And	NULL
every	NULL
week	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
solid	NULL
,	NULL
sound	NULL
,	NULL
golden	NULL
English	NULL
sovereign	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
this	NULL
stout	NULL
fellow	NULL
was	NULL
intent	NULL
on	NULL
saving	NULL
that	NULL
table	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Guggenheimers	NULL
of	NULL
Chicago	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
ended	NULL
in	NULL
Florence	NULL
saying	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Why	NULL
should	NULL
n't	NULL
we	NULL
all	NULL
eat	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
trough	NULL

--	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
nasty	NULL
New	NULL

saying	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
sure	NULL
we	NULL
're	NULL
all	NULL
nice	NULL
quiet	NULL
people	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
four	NULL
seats	NULL
at	NULL
our	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
appreciative	NULL
gurgle	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Captain	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
hesitation	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
sharp	NULL
motion	NULL
in	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
her	NULL
horse	NULL
had	NULL
checked	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
fence	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
rising	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
seat	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
and	NULL
sitting	NULL
down	NULL
opposite	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
motion	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
looked	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
in	NULL
evening	NULL
dress	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
it	NULL
too	NULL
clearly	NULL
cut	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
ruffling	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
always	NULL
affected	NULL
black	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
classical	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
corsage	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
marble	NULL
bust	NULL
might	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
Wedgwood	NULL
vase	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
loved	NULL
Leonora	NULL
always	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
today	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
very	NULL
cheerfully	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL
my	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
left	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
service	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
sure	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
beginnings	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
trace	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
sex	NULL
instinct	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
--	NULL
no	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
towards	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
concerned	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
those	NULL
white	NULL
shoulders	NULL
that	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
ever	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
press	NULL
my	NULL
lips	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
slightly	NULL
cold	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
icily	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
heat	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
say	NULL
of	NULL
baths	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
chill	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
chilled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
lips	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
...	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
always	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
blue	NULL
tailor-made	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
her	NULL
glorious	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
deadened	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
white	NULL
shoulders	NULL
.	NULL

Certain	NULL
women	NULL
's	NULL
lines	NULL
guide	NULL
your	NULL
eyes	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
necks	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
eyelashes	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
breasts	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
conduct	NULL
your	NULL
gaze	NULL
always	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
wrist	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
wrist	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
best	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
dog-skin	NULL
glove	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
a	NULL
gold	NULL
circlet	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
chain	NULL
supporting	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
small	NULL
golden	NULL
key	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
dispatch	NULL
box	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
locked	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
feelings	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
opposite	NULL
me	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
paid	NULL
any	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
existence	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
deliberately	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
long	NULL
stare	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
eyes	NULL
too	NULL
were	NULL
blue	NULL
and	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
eyelids	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
arched	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
gave	NULL
you	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
round	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
irises	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
remarkable	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
moving	NULL
glance	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
a	NULL
lighthouse	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
perceive	NULL
the	NULL
swift	NULL
questions	NULL
chasing	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
brain	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
behind	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
brain	NULL
ask	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
answer	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
simpleness	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
hand	NULL
at	NULL
taking	NULL
in	NULL
qualities	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
horse	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
indeed	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Stands	NULL
well	NULL
;	NULL
has	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
room	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
oats	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
girth	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
so	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
asked	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Is	NULL
this	NULL
man	NULL
trustworthy	NULL
in	NULL
money	NULL
matters	NULL
;	NULL
is	NULL
he	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL

play	NULL

is	NULL
he	NULL
likely	NULL

let	NULL
his	NULL
women	NULL
be	NULL
troublesome	NULL

Is	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
above	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
babble	NULL
about	NULL
my	NULL
affairs	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
into	NULL
those	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
slightly	NULL
defiant	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
defensive	NULL
china	NULL
blue	NULL
orbs	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
warmth	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
tenderness	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
friendly	NULL
recognition	NULL
...	NULL
oh	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
charming	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
touching	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
quite	NULL
mortifying	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mother	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sister	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
implied	NULL
trust	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
implied	NULL
the	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
necessity	NULL
for	NULL
barriers	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
were	NULL
an	NULL
invalid	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
kind	NULL
woman	NULL
may	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
chap	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
bath	NULL
chair	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
forward	NULL
she	NULL
always	NULL
treated	NULL
me	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
Florence	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
invalid	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
run	NULL
after	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
rug	NULL
upon	NULL
chilly	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
favourable	NULL
answer	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
a	NULL
favourable	NULL
answer	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Florence	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
And	NULL
so	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
round	NULL
table	NULL
is	NULL
begun	NULL

"	NULL

Again	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
gurgled	NULL
slightly	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
throat	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Leonora	NULL
shivered	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
goose	NULL
had	NULL
walked	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
grave	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
passing	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
nickel-silver	NULL
basket	NULL
of	NULL
rolls	NULL
.	NULL

Avanti	NULL
!	NULL

...	NULL
IV	NULL
So	NULL
began	NULL
those	NULL
nine	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
uninterrupted	NULL
tranquillity	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
characterized	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
communicativeness	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
our	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
replied	NULL
by	NULL
leaving	NULL
out	NULL
quite	NULL
as	NULL
extraordinarily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
nearly	NULL
as	NULL
completely	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
personal	NULL
note	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
may	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
characterized	NULL
our	NULL
relationship	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
of	NULL
taking	NULL
everything	NULL
for	NULL
granted	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
given	NULL
proposition	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
"	NULL
good	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

We	NULL
took	NULL
for	NULL
granted	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
all	NULL
liked	NULL
beef	NULL
underdone	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
too	NULL
underdone	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
both	NULL
men	NULL
preferred	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
liqueur	NULL
brandy	NULL
after	NULL
lunch	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
both	NULL
women	NULL
drank	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
light	NULL
Rhine	NULL
wine	NULL
qualified	NULL
with	NULL
Fachingen	NULL
water	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
taken	NULL
for	NULL
granted	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
both	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
well	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
afford	NULL
anything	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
reasonably	NULL
want	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
amusements	NULL
fitting	NULL
to	NULL
our	NULL
station	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
take	NULL
motor	NULL
cars	NULL
and	NULL
carriages	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
give	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
dinners	NULL
and	NULL
dine	NULL
our	NULL
friends	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
indulge	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
liked	NULL
in	NULL
economy	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
,	NULL
Florence	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
the	NULL
Daily	NULL
Telegraph	NULL
sent	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
from	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
an	NULL
Anglo-maniac	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
Florence	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
Paris	NULL
edition	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
Herald	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
good	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
'	NULL
copy	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
London	NULL
paper	NULL
followed	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
England	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
and	NULL
Florence	NULL
decided	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
suppress	NULL
one	NULL
subscription	NULL
one	NULL
year	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
.	NULL

Similarly	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Grand	NULL
Duke	NULL
of	NULL
Nassau	NULL
Schwerin	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
came	NULL
yearly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
baths	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
dine	NULL
once	NULL
with	NULL
about	NULL
eighteen	NULL
families	NULL
of	NULL
regular	NULL
Kur	NULL
guests	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
return	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
dinner	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
eighteen	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
these	NULL
dinners	NULL
were	NULL
rather	NULL
expensive	NULL
(	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
Grand	NULL
Duke	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
suite	NULL
and	NULL
any	NULL
members	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
diplomatic	NULL
bodies	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
there	NULL
)	NULL
--	NULL
Florence	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
putting	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
see	NULL
why	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
n't	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
Grand	NULL
Duke	NULL
his	NULL
dinner	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
so	NULL
we	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
suppose	NULL
the	NULL
Serenity	NULL
minded	NULL
that	NULL
economy	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
noticed	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
our	NULL
joint	NULL
dinner	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Royal	NULL
Personage	NULL
gradually	NULL
assumed	NULL
the	NULL
aspect	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
yearly	NULL
function	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
grew	NULL
larger	NULL
and	NULL
larger	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
it	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
closing	NULL
function	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
concerned	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
persons	NULL
who	NULL
aspired	NULL
to	NULL
mix	NULL
"	NULL
with	NULL
royalty	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

We	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
;	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
any	NULL
claims	NULL
;	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
just	NULL
"	NULL
good	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
Grand	NULL
Duke	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
,	NULL
affable	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
royalty	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
late	NULL
King	NULL
Edward	NULL
VII	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
him	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
races	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
occasionally	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
bonne	NULL
bouche	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
nephew	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Emperor	NULL
;	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
him	NULL
pause	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
walk	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
progress	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
cures	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
benignantly	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
Lelöffel	NULL
's	NULL
hunter	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Frankfurt	NULL
Welter	NULL
Stakes	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
upon	NULL
my	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
we	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
does	NULL
one	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
time	NULL
?	NULL

How	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
achieved	NULL
nine	NULL
years	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
nothing	NULL
whatever	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

Nothing	NULL
whatever	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
understand	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
bone	NULL
penholder	NULL
,	NULL
carved	NULL
to	NULL
resemble	NULL
a	NULL
chessman	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
hole	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
four	NULL
views	NULL
of	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
experience	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
fellow	NULL
beings	NULL
--	NULL
nothing	NULL
either	NULL
.	NULL

Upon	NULL
my	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
offhand	NULL
whether	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
who	NULL
sold	NULL
the	NULL
so	NULL
expensive	NULL
violets	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
that	NULL
leads	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
cheating	NULL
me	NULL
or	NULL
no	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
say	NULL
whether	NULL
the	NULL
porter	NULL
who	NULL
carried	NULL
our	NULL
traps	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
at	NULL
Leghorn	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
thief	NULL
or	NULL
no	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
regular	NULL
tariff	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lira	NULL
a	NULL
parcel	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
instances	NULL
of	NULL
honesty	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
comes	NULL
across	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
are	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
amazing	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
instances	NULL
of	NULL
dishonesty	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
forty-five	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
mixing	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
acquired	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
something	NULL
about	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
fellow	NULL
beings	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
one	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
the	NULL
modern	NULL
civilized	NULL
habit	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
modern	NULL
English	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
taking	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
for	NULL
granted	NULL
--	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
to	NULL
blame	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
observed	NULL
this	NULL
matter	NULL
long	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
queer	NULL
,	NULL
subtle	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
;	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
faculty	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
worth	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
lets	NULL
you	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

Mind	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
desirable	NULL
type	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
an	NULL
almost	NULL
unreasonably	NULL
high	NULL
standard	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
really	NULL
nauseating	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
detest	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
several	NULL
slices	NULL
of	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
tepid	NULL
,	NULL
pink	NULL
india	NULL
rubber	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
drink	NULL
brandy	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
prefer	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
cheered	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
warm	NULL
,	NULL
sweet	NULL
Kümmel	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
nasty	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
bath	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
when	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL
want	NULL
is	NULL
really	NULL
a	NULL
hot	NULL
one	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
stirs	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
faith	NULL
of	NULL
your	NULL
fathers	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
deep	NULL
down	NULL
within	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL
taken	NULL
for	NULL
granted	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
an	NULL
Episcopalian	NULL
when	NULL
really	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
an	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
Philadelphia	NULL
Quaker	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
cock	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
society	NULL
owes	NULL
to	NULL
Æsculapius	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
odd	NULL
,	NULL
queer	NULL
thing	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
collection	NULL
of	NULL
rules	NULL
applies	NULL
to	NULL
anybody	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
anybodies	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
meet	NULL
in	NULL
hotels	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
railway	NULL
trains	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
less	NULL
degree	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
steamers	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
even	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
steamers	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
meet	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
tiny	NULL
and	NULL
intimate	NULL
sounds	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
of	NULL
movements	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
whether	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
concerned	NULL
with	NULL
good	NULL
people	NULL
or	NULL
with	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
whether	NULL
they	NULL
will	NULL
go	NULL
rigidly	NULL
through	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
programme	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
underdone	NULL
beef	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Anglicanism	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
matter	NULL
whether	NULL
they	NULL
be	NULL
short	NULL
or	NULL
tall	NULL
;	NULL
whether	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
squeak	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
marionette	NULL
or	NULL
rumble	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
town	NULL
bull	NULL
's	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
matter	NULL
whether	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
Germans	NULL
,	NULL
Austrians	NULL
,	NULL
French	NULL
,	NULL
Spanish	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
Brazilians	NULL
--	NULL
they	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
Germans	NULL
or	NULL
Brazilians	NULL
who	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
bath	NULL
every	NULL
morning	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
move	NULL
,	NULL
roughly	NULL
speaking	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
diplomatic	NULL
circles	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
inconvenient	NULL
--	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
hang	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
damnable	NULL
nuisance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
thing	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
taking	NULL
for	NULL
granted	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
never	NULL
really	NULL
get	NULL
an	NULL
inch	NULL
deeper	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
catalogued	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
can	NULL
give	NULL
you	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
instance	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
remember	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
first	NULL
year	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
year	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
four	NULL
at	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
fourth	NULL
year	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
and	NULL
myself	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
or	NULL
second	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
gives	NULL
the	NULL
measure	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
extraordinariness	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
discussion	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swiftness	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
intimacy	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
up	NULL
between	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
hand	NULL
we	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
start	NULL
out	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
expedition	NULL
so	NULL
naturally	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
preparation	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
many	NULL
such	NULL
excursions	NULL
before	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
our	NULL
intimacy	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
deep	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
was	NULL
obviously	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
Florence	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
us	NULL
quite	NULL
early	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
almost	NULL
think	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
there	NULL
together	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
intimacy	NULL
.	NULL

Florence	NULL
was	NULL
singularly	NULL
expert	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
guide	NULL
to	NULL
archaeological	NULL
expeditions	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
taking	NULL
people	NULL
round	NULL
ruins	NULL
and	NULL
showing	NULL
you	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
murder	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
only	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
once	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
quite	NULL
magnificently	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sole	NULL
help	NULL
of	NULL
Baedeker	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
easily	NULL
about	NULL
any	NULL
old	NULL
monument	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
about	NULL
any	NULL
American	NULL
city	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
blocks	NULL
are	NULL
all	NULL
square	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
all	NULL
numbered	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
go	NULL
perfectly	NULL
easily	NULL
from	NULL
Twenty-fourth	NULL
to	NULL
Thirtieth	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
it	NULL
happens	NULL
that	NULL
fifty	NULL
minutes	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
train	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
ancient	NULL
city	NULL
of	NULL
M	NULL
----	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
pinnacle	NULL
of	NULL
basalt	NULL
,	NULL
girt	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
triple	NULL
road	NULL
running	NULL
sideways	NULL
up	NULL
its	NULL
shoulder	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
scarf	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
castle	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
square	NULL
castle	NULL
like	NULL
Windsor	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
castle	NULL
all	NULL
slate	NULL
gables	NULL
and	NULL
high	NULL
peaks	NULL
with	NULL
gilt	NULL
weathercocks	NULL
flashing	NULL
bravely	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
castle	NULL
of	NULL
St	NULL
Elizabeth	NULL
of	NULL
Hungary	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
has	NULL
the	NULL
disadvantage	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
in	NULL
Prussia	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
always	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
that	NULL
country	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
old	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
many	NULL
double-spired	NULL
churches	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
stands	NULL
up	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
pyramid	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
valley	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Lahn	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
suppose	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
wanted	NULL
especially	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
there	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
especially	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
there	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
objection	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cure	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
an	NULL
excursion	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
times	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
quite	NULL
unanimous	NULL
in	NULL
being	NULL
grateful	NULL
to	NULL
Florence	NULL
for	NULL
providing	NULL
the	NULL
motive	NULL
power	NULL
.	NULL

Florence	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
motive	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
engaged	NULL
in	NULL
educating	NULL
Captain	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
--	NULL
oh	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
pour	NULL
le	NULL
bon	NULL
motif	NULL
!	NULL

She	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
simply	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
understand	NULL
how	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
let	NULL

Leonora	NULL
herself	NULL
always	NULL
struck	NULL
me	NULL
as	NULL
being	NULL
remarkably	NULL
well	NULL
educated	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
beforehand	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
Baedeker	NULL
before	NULL
Florence	NULL
was	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
ever	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
knew	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
Florence	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
us	NULL
how	NULL
Ludwig	NULL
the	NULL
Courageous	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
three	NULL
wives	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
differed	NULL
from	NULL
Henry	NULL
VIII	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
wanted	NULL
them	NULL
one	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
caused	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
trouble	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
Florence	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
us	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
would	NULL
just	NULL
nod	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
that	NULL
quite	NULL
pleasantly	NULL
rattled	NULL
my	NULL
poor	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
exclaim	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
told	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
already	NULL
to	NULL
Captain	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL
sure	NULL
he	NULL
finds	NULL
it	NULL
interesting	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
would	NULL
look	NULL
reflectively	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
injure	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL

the	NULL
hand	NULL

you	NULL

with	NULL
horses	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
poor	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
would	NULL
blush	NULL
and	NULL
mutter	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
That	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL

Do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
bother	NULL
about	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
fancy	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
irony	NULL
did	NULL
quite	NULL
alarm	NULL
poor	NULL
Teddy	NULL
;	NULL
because	NULL
one	NULL
evening	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
me	NULL
seriously	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
smoking-room	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
having	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
head	NULL
would	NULL
really	NULL
interfere	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
quickness	NULL
in	NULL
polo	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
brainy	NULL
Johnnies	NULL
generally	NULL
were	NULL
rather	NULL
muffs	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
four	NULL
legs	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
reassured	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
best	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
in	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
upset	NULL
his	NULL
balance	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
Captain	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
evidently	NULL
enjoying	NULL
being	NULL
educated	NULL
by	NULL
Florence	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
about	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
times	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
approving	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
Leonora	NULL
and	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
systematic	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
bursts	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Florence	NULL
clearing	NULL
up	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
places	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
lighter	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
Hamlet	NULL
;	NULL
explain	NULL
the	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
symphony	NULL
,	NULL
humming	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
and	NULL
second	NULL
subjects	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
on	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
explain	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL
Arminians	NULL
and	NULL
Erastians	NULL
;	NULL
or	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
lecture	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
history	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
United	NULL
States	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
well	NULL
calculated	NULL
to	NULL
arrest	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
attention	NULL
.	NULL

Did	NULL
you	NULL
ever	NULL
read	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Markham	NULL
?	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
our	NULL
excursion	NULL
to	NULL
M	NULL
----	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
larger	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
full	NULL
dress	NULL
affair	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
archives	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Schloss	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
city	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
document	NULL
which	NULL
Florence	NULL
thought	NULL
would	NULL
finally	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
chance	NULL
to	NULL
educate	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
really	NULL
worried	NULL
poor	NULL
Florence	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
matters	NULL
of	NULL
culture	NULL
,	NULL
ever	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
of	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
Leonora	NULL
knew	NULL
or	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
certainly	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
there	NULL
whenever	NULL
Florence	NULL
brought	NULL
out	NULL
any	NULL
information	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
,	NULL
somehow	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
of	NULL
really	NULL
knowing	NULL
what	NULL
poor	NULL
Florence	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
only	NULL
picked	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
exactly	NULL
define	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
something	NULL
physical	NULL
.	NULL

Have	NULL
you	NULL
ever	NULL
seen	NULL
a	NULL
retriever	NULL
dashing	NULL
in	NULL
play	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
greyhound	NULL
?	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
running	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
green	NULL
field	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
side	NULL
by	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
suddenly	NULL
the	NULL
retriever	NULL
makes	NULL
a	NULL
friendly	NULL
snap	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
greyhound	NULL
simply	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL
observed	NULL
it	NULL
quicken	NULL
its	NULL
speed	NULL
or	NULL
strain	NULL
a	NULL
limb	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
two	NULL
yards	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
retriever	NULL
's	NULL
outstretched	NULL
muzzle	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
Florence	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
in	NULL
matters	NULL
of	NULL
culture	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
occasion	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
was	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
found	NULL
Florence	NULL
some	NULL
days	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
reading	NULL
books	NULL
like	NULL
Ranke	NULL
's	NULL
History	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Popes	NULL
,	NULL
Symonds	NULL
'	NULL
Renaissance	NULL
,	NULL
Motley	NULL
's	NULL
Rise	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Dutch	NULL
Republic	NULL
and	NULL
Luther	NULL
's	NULL
Table	NULL
Talk	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
must	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
astonishment	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
pleasure	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
expedition	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
like	NULL
catching	NULL
the	NULL
two-forty	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
slow	NULL
,	NULL
smooth	NULL
roll	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
big	NULL
trains	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
trains	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
like	NULL
being	NULL
drawn	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
country	NULL
and	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
clear	NULL
glass	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
windows	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
really	NULL
green	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
shines	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
is	NULL
blood	NULL
red	NULL
and	NULL
purple	NULL
and	NULL
red	NULL
and	NULL
green	NULL
and	NULL
red	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
oxen	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ploughlands	NULL
are	NULL
bright	NULL
varnished	NULL
brown	NULL
and	NULL
black	NULL
and	NULL
blackish	NULL
purple	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
peasants	NULL
are	NULL
dressed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
of	NULL
magpies	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
great	NULL
Rocks	NULL
of	NULL
magpies	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
the	NULL
peasants	NULL
'	NULL
dresses	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
field	NULL
where	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
little	NULL
mounds	NULL
of	NULL
hay	NULL
that	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
grey-green	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sunny	NULL
side	NULL
and	NULL
purple	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shadows	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
peasants	NULL
'	NULL
dresses	NULL
are	NULL
vermilion	NULL
with	NULL
emerald	NULL
green	NULL
ribbons	NULL
and	NULL
purple	NULL
skirts	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
shirts	NULL
and	NULL
black	NULL
velvet	NULL
stomachers	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
drawn	NULL
through	NULL
brilliant	NULL
green	NULL
meadows	NULL
that	NULL
run	NULL
away	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
side	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
purple	NULL
fir-woods	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
basalt	NULL
pinnacles	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
immense	NULL
forests	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
meadowsweet	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
streams	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cattle	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
brown	NULL
cow	NULL
hitch	NULL
its	NULL
horns	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
stomach	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
animal	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
thrown	NULL
right	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
narrow	NULL
stream	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
burst	NULL
out	NULL
laughing	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Florence	NULL
was	NULL
imparting	NULL
information	NULL
so	NULL
hard	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
listening	NULL
so	NULL
intently	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
noticed	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
pleased	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
off	NULL
duty	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
pleased	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
was	NULL
indubitably	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
mischief	NULL
--	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
about	NULL
Ludwig	NULL
the	NULL
Courageous	NULL
(	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Ludwig	NULL
the	NULL
Courageous	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
an	NULL
historian	NULL
)	NULL
about	NULL
Ludwig	NULL
the	NULL
Courageous	NULL
of	NULL
Hessen	NULL
who	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
three	NULL
wives	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
and	NULL
patronized	NULL
Luther	NULL
--	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
!	NULL

--	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
relieved	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
off	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
possibly	NULL
be	NULL
doing	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
excite	NULL
herself	NULL
or	NULL
set	NULL
her	NULL
poor	NULL
heart	NULL
a-fluttering	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
incident	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cow	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
joy	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
chuckled	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Because	NULL
it	NULL
does	NULL
look	NULL
very	NULL
funny	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
cow	NULL
land	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
stream	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
just	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
one	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL
expect	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cow	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
I	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
pitied	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
animal	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
just	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
just	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
drawn	NULL
along	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
spectacular	NULL
towns	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
peaked	NULL
castles	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
many	NULL
double	NULL
spires	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
sunlight	NULL
gleams	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
--	NULL
gleams	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
glass	NULL
of	NULL
windows	NULL
;	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
gilt	NULL
signs	NULL
of	NULL
apothecaries	NULL
;	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
ensigns	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
student	NULL
corps	NULL
high	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mountains	NULL
;	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
helmets	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
funny	NULL
little	NULL
soldiers	NULL
moving	NULL
their	NULL
stiff	NULL
little	NULL
legs	NULL
in	NULL
white	NULL
linen	NULL
trousers	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
big	NULL
spectacular	NULL
Prussian	NULL
station	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
hammered	NULL
bronze	NULL
ornaments	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
paintings	NULL
of	NULL
peasants	NULL
and	NULL
flowers	NULL
and	NULL
cows	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
Florence	NULL
bargain	NULL
energetically	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
driver	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
ancient	NULL
droschka	NULL
drawn	NULL
by	NULL
two	NULL
lean	NULL
horses	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
spoke	NULL
German	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
correctly	NULL
than	NULL
Florence	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
could	NULL
rid	NULL
myself	NULL
quite	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
accent	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Pennsylvania	NULL
Duitsch	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
childhood	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
drawn	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
triumph	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
five	NULL
marks	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
trinkgeld	NULL
,	NULL
right	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
castle	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
taken	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
museum	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
fire-backs	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
glass	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
swords	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
antique	NULL
contraptions	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
winding	NULL
corkscrew	NULL
staircases	NULL
and	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
Rittersaal	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
painted	NULL
hall	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
Reformer	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
met	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
protection	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
gentleman	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
three	NULL
wives	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
and	NULL
formed	NULL
an	NULL
alliance	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
gentleman	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
six	NULL
wives	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
(	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
really	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
facts	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
bearing	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
story	NULL
)	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
through	NULL
chapels	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
music	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
right	NULL
up	NULL
immensely	NULL
high	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
old	NULL
chamber	NULL
,	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
presses	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
heavily-shuttered	NULL
windows	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Florence	NULL
became	NULL
positively	NULL
electric	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
the	NULL
tired	NULL
,	NULL
bored	NULL
custodian	NULL
what	NULL
shutters	NULL
to	NULL
open	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
bright	NULL
sunlight	NULL
streamed	NULL
in	NULL
palpable	NULL
shafts	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
dim	NULL
old	NULL
chamber	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
explained	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL

As	NULL
a	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL

that	NULL
Luther	NULL
only	NULL
stopped	NULL

no	NULL

it	NULL

then	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL

she	NULL
threw	NULL
open	NULL
another	NULL

tripping	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
there	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
exclaimed	NULL

an	NULL
accent	NULL

gaiety	NULL

audacity	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
pointing	NULL

I	NULL

Captain	NULL

then	NULL

as	NULL
we	NULL

stage-managed	NULL
our	NULL
bewilderment	NULL

she	NULL
continued	NULL

one	NULL

it	NULL

I	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
awake	NULL
whole	NULL
nights	NULL
cursing	NULL
that	NULL

My	NULL
wife	NULL
used	NULL

she	NULL
never	NULL

in	NULL
whatever	NULL

she	NULL
may	NULL

the	NULL

not	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
once	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
German	NULL
Express	NULL

she	NULL
would	NULL
lean	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
closed	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL

In	NULL
hell	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL

For	NULL
in	NULL
Florence	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL

a	NULL

an	NULL

that	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

this	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
my	NULL
occupation	NULL

my	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
often	NULL
that	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
are	NULL
united	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
body	NULL

Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
actress	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
Jove	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
good	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
listen	NULL

me	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
evolving	NULL
my	NULL
plans	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
shock-proof	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
notice	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
inattention	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
listening	NULL

a	NULL

at	NULL
her	NULL

or	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
,	NULL
precisely	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
were	NULL
myself	NULL
the	NULL
patient	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thrown	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
commission	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
India	NULL
and	NULL
come	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
over	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
really	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
heart	NULL
"	NULL
to	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
sentimental	NULL
ass	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
really	NULL
needed	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
in	NULL
India	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
economize	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
at	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
Teleragh	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
date	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Kilsyte	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

Ashburnham	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
kissed	NULL
a	NULL
servant	NULL
girl	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
railway	NULL
train	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
grace	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
prompt	NULL
functioning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
communication	NULL
cord	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
ready	NULL
sympathy	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
you	NULL
call	NULL
the	NULL
Hampshire	NULL
Bench	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
kept	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
devil	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
Winchester	NULL
Gaol	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
and	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
case	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
final	NULL
stages	NULL
of	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
revelations	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
just	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
poor	NULL
wretch	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
surely	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
beg	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
poor	NULL
wretch	NULL
.	NULL

Is	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
luckless	NULL
devil	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
tormented	NULL
by	NULL
blind	NULL
and	NULL
inscrutable	NULL
destiny	NULL
?	NULL

For	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

None	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
my	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
lover	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
killed	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
broke	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
pleasantnesses	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
priest	NULL
that	NULL
has	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
not	NULL
ask	NULL
pity	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
silent	NULL
listener	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
hearth-stone	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
God	NULL
who	NULL
created	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
those	NULL
desires	NULL
,	NULL
those	NULL
madnesses	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
hear	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Kilsyte	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
knew	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
friends	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
just	NULL
good	NULL
people	NULL
--	NULL
fortunate	NULL
people	NULL
with	NULL
broad	NULL
and	NULL
sunny	NULL
acres	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
southern	NULL
county	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
good	NULL
people	NULL
!	NULL

By	NULL
heavens	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
sometimes	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
better	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
one	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
needs	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
one	NULL
as	NULL
maids	NULL
and	NULL
couriers	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
Kur	NULL
guests	NULL
whisper	NULL
about	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
after	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
gradually	NULL
it	NULL
dies	NULL
away	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pity	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
knocking	NULL
about	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

Supposing	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
his	NULL
seven	NULL
years	NULL
in	NULL
Winchester	NULL
Gaol	NULL
or	NULL
whatever	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
inscrutable	NULL
and	NULL
blind	NULL
justice	NULL
allots	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
for	NULL
following	NULL
your	NULL
natural	NULL
but	NULL
ill-timed	NULL
inclinations	NULL
--	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
arrived	NULL
a	NULL
stage	NULL
when	NULL
nodding	NULL
gossips	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Kursaal	NULL
terrace	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Poor	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
ruined	NULL
career	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
fine	NULL
soldier	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
now	NULL
bent	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Better	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
devil	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
prematurely	NULL
bent	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
thousand	NULL
times	NULL
better	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Kilsyte	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
came	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
finding	NULL
Leonora	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
unsympathetic	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
nasty	NULL
jar	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
left	NULL
servants	NULL
alone	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
turned	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
naturally	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
loose	NULL
amongst	NULL
women	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
class	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
he	NULL
followed	NULL
from	NULL
Burma	NULL
to	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
--	NULL
assured	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
awakened	NULL
her	NULL
attention	NULL
by	NULL
swearing	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
the	NULL
servant	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
driven	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
daresay	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
driven	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
mad	NULL
passion	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
an	NULL
ultimately	NULL
satisfying	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
daresay	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sincere	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

Heaven	NULL
help	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
daresay	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sincere	NULL
enough	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
nice	NULL
little	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
dear	NULL
little	NULL
dark	NULL
woman	NULL
with	NULL
long	NULL
lashes	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
Florence	NULL
grew	NULL
quite	NULL
fond	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
lisp	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
happy	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
saw	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
month	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
died	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
quietly	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
heart	NULL
trouble	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
little	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
gentle	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
young	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
twenty-three	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
husband	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
Chitral	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
twenty-four	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
young	NULL
things	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
left	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
leave	NULL
her	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
distance	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
am	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
memory	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
help	NULL
smiling	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
suddenly	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
might	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
wrapped	NULL
carefully	NULL
away	NULL
in	NULL
lavender	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
drawer	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
old	NULL
house	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
long	NULL
left	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
submissive	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
submissive	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
youngest	NULL
child	NULL
will	NULL
ever	NULL
pay	NULL
heed	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
saddest	NULL
story	NULL
...	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
wishing	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
alone	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
playing	NULL
with	NULL
adultery	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
has	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
hardly	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
spell	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
submissiveness	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
importunities	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tempestuous	NULL
forces	NULL
that	NULL
pushed	NULL
that	NULL
miserable	NULL
fellow	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
ruin	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
really	NULL
made	NULL
much	NULL
difference	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
left	NULL
his	NULL
allegiance	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
young	NULL
thing	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
died	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
,	NULL
anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
soon	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
died	NULL
without	NULL
having	NULL
to	NULL
soak	NULL
her	NULL
noonday	NULL
pillow	NULL
with	NULL
tears	NULL
whilst	NULL
Florence	NULL
,	NULL
below	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
Captain	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
Constitution	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
United	NULL
States	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
left	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
taste	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mouth	NULL
if	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
die	NULL
in	NULL
peace	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
behaved	NULL
better	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
just	NULL
boxed	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
's	NULL
ears	NULL
--	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
hit	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
uncontrollable	NULL
access	NULL
of	NULL
rage	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
blow	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cheek	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corridor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL
,	NULL
outside	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
rooms	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
accounted	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sudden	NULL
,	NULL
odd	NULL
intimacy	NULL
that	NULL
sprang	NULL
up	NULL
between	NULL
Florence	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
.	NULL

Because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
odd	NULL
intimacy	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
you	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
outside	NULL
nothing	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
unlikely	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
proudest	NULL
creature	NULL
on	NULL
God	NULL
's	NULL
earth	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
struck	NULL
up	NULL
an	NULL
acquaintanceship	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
casual	NULL
Yankees	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
really	NULL
have	NULL
regarded	NULL
as	NULL
being	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
carpet	NULL
beneath	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
may	NULL
ask	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Powys	NULL
married	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
despise	NULL
casual	NULL
Americans	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
unostentatiously	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
anyone	NULL
has	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
pride	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
patience	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
keeping	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bankruptcy	NULL
court	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
Florence	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
came	NULL
round	NULL
a	NULL
screen	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL
corridor	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
Leonora	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
gold	NULL
key	NULL
that	NULL
hung	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
wrist	NULL
caught	NULL
in	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
's	NULL
hair	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
word	NULL
spoken	NULL
.	NULL

Little	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
red	NULL
mark	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
left	NULL
cheek	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
key	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
black	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Florence	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
disentangle	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
brought	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
touch	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
without	NULL
growing	NULL
sick	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
spoken	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
those	NULL
four	NULL
eyes	NULL
--	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
's	NULL
--	NULL
Leonora	NULL
could	NULL
just	NULL
let	NULL
herself	NULL
go	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
box	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
's	NULL
ears	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
a	NULL
stranger	NULL
came	NULL
along	NULL
she	NULL
pulled	NULL
herself	NULL
wonderfully	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
silent	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
key	NULL
was	NULL
disengaged	NULL
by	NULL
Florence	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
So	NULL
awkward	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
...	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
comb	NULL
straight	NULL
in	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
's	NULL
hair	NULL
....	NULL
"	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
Powys	NULL
married	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
little	NULL
O'Flaherty	NULL
whose	NULL
husband	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
of	NULL
country	NULL
parsonage	NULL
origin	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
mistaking	NULL
the	NULL
sob	NULL
she	NULL
let	NULL
go	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
desolately	NULL
away	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
corridor	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
quite	NULL
ostentatiously	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
should	NULL
hear	NULL
her	NULL
address	NULL
Edward	NULL
in	NULL
terms	NULL
of	NULL
intimacy	NULL
and	NULL
liking	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
called	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
Edward	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
Edward	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
career	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
really	NULL
compromised	NULL
herself	NULL
--	NULL
She	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
....	NULL
"	NULL
How	NULL
frightful	NULL
!	NULL

...	NULL
Poor	NULL
little	NULL
Maisie	NULL
!	NULL

...	NULL
"	NULL
She	NULL
caught	NULL
herself	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
affair	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
Leonora	NULL
every	NULL
justice	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
love	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
dearly	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
the	NULL
ruin	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
small	NULL
household	NULL
cockle-shell	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
certainly	NULL
tripped	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
herself	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
poor	NULL
little	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
was	NULL
ever	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
mistress	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
so	NULL
bad	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
succumbed	NULL
to	NULL
anything	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
impassioned	NULL
embrace	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
plain	NULL
English	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
plain	NULL
English	NULL
is	NULL
best	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
reasons	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
pretended	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

Queer	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

Like	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
sinister	NULL
jokes	NULL
that	NULL
Providence	NULL
plays	NULL
upon	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

Add	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
would	NULL
much	NULL
have	NULL
minded	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
mistress	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
relief	NULL
from	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
sentimental	NULL
gurglings	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
's	NULL
submissive	NULL
acceptance	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
sounds	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
minded	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
boxing	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
's	NULL
ears	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
striking	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
intolerable	NULL
universe	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
frightfully	NULL
painful	NULL
scene	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
letters	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
claimed	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
open	NULL
them	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
chose	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
arrogated	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
because	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
affairs	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
frightful	NULL
state	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
lied	NULL
so	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
claimed	NULL
the	NULL
privilege	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
his	NULL
secrets	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
disposal	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
fool	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
lapses	NULL
ever	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
clean	NULL
breast	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
drag	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
elevating	NULL
job	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
being	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
prescribed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Kur	NULL
authorities	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
opened	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Hervey	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
Linlithgowshire	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
month	NULL
of	NULL
September	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
the	NULL
date	NULL
fixed	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
eleventh	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
eighteenth	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
address	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
letter	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
handwriting	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
like	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Hervey	NULL
's	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
blade	NULL
of	NULL
corn	NULL
is	NULL
like	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
spying	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
certainly	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
she	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
was	NULL
paying	NULL
a	NULL
blackmailer	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
heard	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
...	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
devil	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
blow	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
death	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
really	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
liabilities	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
pretty	NULL
heavy	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
had	NULL
really	NULL
smashed	NULL
them	NULL
up	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
perfectly	NULL
common-place	NULL
affair	NULL
at	NULL
Monte	NULL
Carlo	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
affair	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
cosmopolitan	NULL
harpy	NULL
who	NULL
passed	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
mistress	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Russian	NULL
Grand	NULL
Duke	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
exacted	NULL
a	NULL
twenty	NULL
thousand	NULL
pound	NULL
pearl	NULL
tiara	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
price	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
favours	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
pipped	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
found	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ordinary	NULL
way	NULL
a	NULL
gambler	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
might	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
have	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
twenty	NULL
thousand	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
not	NULL
slight	NULL
charges	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
hotel	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
fair	NULL
creature	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
worth	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
date	NULL
five	NULL
hundred	NULL
thousand	NULL
dollars	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
needs	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tables	NULL
and	NULL
lose	NULL
forty	NULL
thousand	NULL
pounds	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Forty	NULL
thousand	NULL
solid	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
borrowed	NULL
from	NULL
sharks	NULL
!	NULL

And	NULL
even	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
imperative	NULL
passion	NULL
--	NULL
enjoy	NULL
the	NULL
favours	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
solid	NULL
bargaining	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
far	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
twenty	NULL
thousand	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
daresay	NULL
ten	NULL
thousand	NULL
dollars	NULL
covered	NULL
the	NULL
bill	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
solid	NULL
hole	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fortune	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
thousand	NULL
pounds	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
fix	NULL
things	NULL
up	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
run	NULL
from	NULL
money-lender	NULL
to	NULL
money-lender	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
discovery	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
infidelities	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
them	NULL
infidelities	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
from	NULL
public	NULL
sources	NULL
.	NULL

God	NULL
knows	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
happened	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
discovered	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
public	NULL
sources	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
concealed	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
until	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
penniless	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
grace	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
actual	NULL
lenders	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
the	NULL
exact	NULL
sums	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
needed	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
England	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
right	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
England	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
attorney	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
arms	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
Circe	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
Antibes	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
place	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
retired	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
sick	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
quite	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
before	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
lessons	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
art	NULL
of	NULL
business	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
attorney	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
plan	NULL
as	NULL
clearly	NULL
drawn	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
ever	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
General	NULL
Trochu	NULL
for	NULL
keeping	NULL
the	NULL
Prussians	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
Paris	NULL
in	NULL
1870	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
as	NULL
effectual	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
1895	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
nine	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
date	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
talking	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
date	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
getting	NULL
her	NULL
hold	NULL
over	NULL
Leonora	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
amounted	NULL
to	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
had	NULL
simply	NULL
forced	NULL
Edward	NULL
to	NULL
settle	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
property	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
force	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
clumsy	NULL
,	NULL
good-natured	NULL
,	NULL
inarticulate	NULL
way	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
frightened	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
devil	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
admired	NULL
her	NULL
enormously	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
man	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
treat	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
whose	NULL
estates	NULL
are	NULL
being	NULL
managed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Court	NULL
of	NULL
Bankruptcy	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
thing	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
job	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

Unexpected	NULL
liabilities	NULL
kept	NULL
on	NULL
cropping	NULL
up	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
afflicted	NULL
fool	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
any	NULL
easier	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
passion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chase	NULL
went	NULL
a	NULL
frame	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
be	NULL
extraordinarily	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
may	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
really	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
respect	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
chastity	NULL
of	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
imagination	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
positively	NULL
revolted	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
existed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
stick	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
agitated	NULL
way	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
accusation	NULL
of	NULL
ever	NULL
having	NULL
done	NULL
anything	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
preserve	NULL
the	NULL
virginity	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
thoughts	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
himself	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
walks	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
--	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
Brindisi	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
those	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
many	NULL
agitations	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
really	NULL
quarrelled	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
quarrelled	NULL
bitterly	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
seems	NULL
rather	NULL
extravagant	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
just	NULL
calmly	NULL
loathing	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
lachrymosely	NULL
contrite	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
...	NULL
Along	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
passions	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
shame	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
went	NULL
the	NULL
violent	NULL
conviction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
duties	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
station	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
unreasonably	NULL
expensive	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
trust	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
talking	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
liabilities	NULL
,	NULL
given	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
poor	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
promiscuous	NULL
libertine	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sentimentalist	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
servant	NULL
girl	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Kilsyte	NULL
case	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
pretty	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
mournful	NULL
of	NULL
appearance	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
desired	NULL
rather	NULL
to	NULL
comfort	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
succumbed	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
blandishments	NULL
I	NULL
daresay	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
set	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
Portsmouth	NULL
or	NULL
Winchester	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
faithful	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
four	NULL
or	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
affairs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
that	NULL
cost	NULL
him	NULL
money	NULL
were	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Grand	NULL
Duke	NULL
's	NULL
mistress	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
blackmailing	NULL
letter	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
opened	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
quite	NULL
passionate	NULL
affair	NULL
with	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
nice	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
succeeded	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Grand	NULL
Ducal	NULL
lady	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lady	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
wife	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
brother	NULL
officer	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
passion	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
lasted	NULL
for	NULL
several	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
passions	NULL
were	NULL
quite	NULL
logical	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
progression	NULL
upwards	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
began	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
servant	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
courtesan	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
quite	NULL
nice	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
unsuitably	NULL
mated	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
quite	NULL
nasty	NULL
husband	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
letters	NULL
and	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
blackmailing	NULL
poor	NULL
Edward	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tune	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
threats	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Divorce	NULL
Court	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
after	NULL
this	NULL
lady	NULL
came	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
poor	NULL
Maisie	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
more	NULL
affair	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
passion	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
marriage	NULL
with	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
arranged	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
parents	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
admired	NULL
her	NULL
immensely	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
hardly	NULL
ever	NULL
pretended	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
tender	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
desperately	NULL
needed	NULL
her	NULL
moral	NULL
support	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
really	NULL
trying	NULL
liabilities	NULL
were	NULL
mostly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
generosities	NULL
proper	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
station	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
always	NULL
remitting	NULL
his	NULL
tenants	NULL
'	NULL
rents	NULL
and	NULL
giving	NULL
the	NULL
tenants	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
reduction	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
permanent	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
redeeming	NULL
drunkards	NULL
who	NULL
came	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
magisterial	NULL
bench	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
prostitutes	NULL
into	NULL
respectable	NULL
places	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL
maniac	NULL
about	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
many	NULL
ill-used	NULL
people	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
pick	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
provide	NULL
with	NULL
careers	NULL
--	NULL
Leonora	NULL
has	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
daresay	NULL
she	NULL
exaggerated	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
figure	NULL
seems	NULL
so	NULL
preposterous	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
continuance	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
--	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
impossible	NULL
subscriptions	NULL
to	NULL
hospitals	NULL
and	NULL
Boy	NULL
Scouts	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
provide	NULL
prizes	NULL
at	NULL
cattle	NULL
shows	NULL
and	NULL
antivivisection	NULL
societies	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
saw	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
continued	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
possibly	NULL
keep	NULL
up	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
Manor	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
rate	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Grand	NULL
Duke	NULL
's	NULL
mistress	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
rents	NULL
back	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
old	NULL
figures	NULL
;	NULL
discharged	NULL
the	NULL
drunkards	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
homes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sent	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
societies	NULL
notice	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
expect	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
subscriptions	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
tender	NULL
;	NULL
nearly	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
she	NULL
supported	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
age	NULL
of	NULL
apprenticeship	NULL
or	NULL
domestic	NULL
service	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
childless	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
childless	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
considered	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
blame	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
penniless	NULL
branch	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Powys	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
forced	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
Edward	NULL
without	NULL
making	NULL
the	NULL
stipulation	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
brought	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
Catholics	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
spiritual	NULL
death	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
you	NULL
a	NULL
wrong	NULL
impression	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
not	NULL
made	NULL
you	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
,	NULL
cold	NULL
conscience	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
all	NULL
English	NULL
Catholics	NULL
.	NULL

(	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
help	NULL
disliking	NULL
this	NULL
religion	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
always	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
shuddering	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Scarlet	NULL
Woman	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
filtered	NULL
in	NULL
upon	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tranquility	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
old	NULL
Friends	NULL
'	NULL
Meeting	NULL
House	NULL
in	NULL
Arch	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
Philadelphia	NULL
.	NULL
)	NULL

So	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
set	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
mismanagement	NULL
of	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
case	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
peculiarly	NULL
English	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
religion	NULL
.	NULL

Because	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
for	NULL
Edward	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
sink	NULL
down	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
tramp	NULL
of	NULL
gentlemanly	NULL
address	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
,	NULL
maybe	NULL
,	NULL
chance	NULL
love	NULL
affairs	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
highways	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
less	NULL
harm	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
much	NULL
less	NULL
agonized	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
fewer	NULL
chances	NULL
of	NULL
ruining	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
remorse	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
great	NULL
at	NULL
remorse	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
English	NULL
Catholic	NULL
conscience	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
rigid	NULL
principles	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
coldness	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
patience	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
wrong	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
special	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
quite	NULL
seriously	NULL
and	NULL
naïvely	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
Rome	NULL
disapproves	NULL
of	NULL
divorce	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
quite	NULL
seriously	NULL
and	NULL
naïvely	NULL
believed	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
church	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
monstrous	NULL
and	NULL
imbecile	NULL
institution	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
expect	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
impossible	NULL
job	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
a	NULL
faithful	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Nonconformist	NULL
temperament	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
United	NULL
States	NULL
of	NULL
North	NULL
America	NULL
we	NULL
call	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
New	NULL
England	NULL
conscience	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
frame	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
driven	NULL
in	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
Catholics	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
centuries	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
through	NULL
--	NULL
centuries	NULL
of	NULL
blind	NULL
and	NULL
malignant	NULL
oppression	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
ostracism	NULL
from	NULL
public	NULL
employment	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
beleagured	NULL
garrison	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
hostile	NULL
country	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
therefore	NULL
having	NULL
to	NULL
act	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
formality	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
have	NULL
combined	NULL
to	NULL
perform	NULL
that	NULL
conjuring	NULL
trick	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
Papists	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
are	NULL
even	NULL
technically	NULL
Nonconformists	NULL
.	NULL

Continental	NULL
Papists	NULL
are	NULL
a	NULL
dirty	NULL
,	NULL
jovial	NULL
and	NULL
unscrupulous	NULL
crew	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
lets	NULL
them	NULL
be	NULL
opportunists	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
fixed	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
Edward	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

(	NULL
Forgive	NULL
my	NULL
writing	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
monstrous	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
frivolous	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
break	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
cry	NULL
.	NULL
)	NULL

In	NULL
Milan	NULL
,	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
dissolved	NULL
in	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
hundred	NULL
dollars	NULL
paid	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
quarter	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Edward	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
drifted	NULL
about	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
tramp	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
suggested	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
married	NULL
a	NULL
barmaid	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
such	NULL
frightful	NULL
scenes	NULL
in	NULL
public	NULL
places	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
so	NULL
have	NULL
torn	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
moustache	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
visible	NULL
signs	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
faithful	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
redeem	NULL
him	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
passions	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
shames	NULL
there	NULL
went	NULL
the	NULL
dread	NULL
of	NULL
scenes	NULL
in	NULL
public	NULL
places	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
outcry	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
excited	NULL
physical	NULL
violence	NULL
;	NULL
of	NULL
publicity	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
short	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
barmaid	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
cured	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
drank	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
kept	NULL
busy	NULL
looking	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
it	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Kilsyte	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
servant	NULL
girl	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
then	NULL
kissed	NULL
was	NULL
nurse	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Nonconformist	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL
--	NULL
whatever	NULL
that	NULL
post	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
called	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
gentleman	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
ruin	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
chairman	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Tory	NULL
caucus	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
whatever	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
sufferer	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
devil	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
asked	NULL
questions	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
House	NULL
of	NULL
Commons	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
Hampshire	NULL
magistrates	NULL
degraded	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
suggested	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
War	NULL
Ministry	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
proper	NULL
person	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
the	NULL
King	NULL
's	NULL
commission	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
it	NULL
hot	NULL
and	NULL
strong	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
result	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
completely	NULL
cured	NULL
of	NULL
philandering	NULL
amongst	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
classes	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
blessing	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
revolt	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
connected	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
connection	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
people	NULL
like	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
kitchenmaid	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
dim	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
contented	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
things	NULL
nearly	NULL
straight	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
scraping	NULL
in	NULL
little	NULL
stations	NULL
in	NULL
Chitral	NULL
and	NULL
Burma	NULL
--	NULL
stations	NULL
where	NULL
living	NULL
is	NULL
cheap	NULL
in	NULL
comparison	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
county	NULL
magnate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
where	NULL
,	NULL
moreover	NULL
,	NULL
liaisons	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
sort	NULL
or	NULL
another	NULL
are	NULL
normal	NULL
and	NULL
inexpensive	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
came	NULL
along	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Maidan	NULL
affair	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
caused	NULL
trouble	NULL
out	NULL
there	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
youth	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
husband	NULL
--	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
resigned	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
coming	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
pushing	NULL
and	NULL
scraping	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
letting	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
Teleragh	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
selling	NULL
a	NULL
picture	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
relic	NULL
of	NULL
Charles	NULL
I	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
really	NULL
decent	NULL
dress	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
years	NULL
and	NULL
years	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
imagined	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
husband	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
financial	NULL
position	NULL
as	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
mistress	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Grand	NULL
Duke	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
along	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
himself	NULL
had	NULL
helped	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
financial	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fellow	NULL
that	NULL
many	NULL
men	NULL
liked	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
presentable	NULL
and	NULL
quite	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
lend	NULL
you	NULL
his	NULL
cigar	NULL
puncher	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
,	NULL
every	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
some	NULL
financier	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
about	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
sound	NULL
,	NULL
profitable	NULL
tip	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
gamble	NULL
--	NULL
English	NULL
Papists	NULL
seldom	NULL
are	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
nearly	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
investment	NULL
turned	NULL
up	NULL
trumps	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
in	NULL
fit	NULL
case	NULL
to	NULL
reopen	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
Manor	NULL
and	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
assume	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
accepted	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
almost	NULL
with	NULL
resignation	NULL
--	NULL
almost	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
of	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
really	NULL
liked	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
child	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
like	NULL
somebody	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
trust	NULL
Maisie	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
trust	NULL
her	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
rook	NULL
Edward	NULL
for	NULL
several	NULL
thousands	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Maisie	NULL
had	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
trinket	NULL
ring	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
gurgled	NULL
and	NULL
raved	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
yet	NULL
experienced	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
a	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
really	NULL
have	NULL
welcomed	NULL
it	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
love	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
rest	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
anyone	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
poor	NULL
little	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
ill	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
on	NULL
expensive	NULL
jaunts	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Leonora	NULL
herself	NULL
who	NULL
paid	NULL
Maisie	NULL
's	NULL
expenses	NULL
to	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
handed	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Maisie	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
allowed	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
husband	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
agonies	NULL
of	NULL
fear	NULL
.	NULL

Poor	NULL
devil	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
fancy	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
voyage	NULL
from	NULL
India	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
happy	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
was	NULL
wrapped	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
completely	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
girl	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
father	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
trotting	NULL
about	NULL
with	NULL
rugs	NULL
and	NULL
physic	NULL
and	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
deck	NULL
to	NULL
deck	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
behaved	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
circumspection	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
leaked	NULL
through	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
passengers	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
almost	NULL
attained	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
attitude	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mother	NULL
towards	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
benevolent	NULL
,	NULL
wealthy	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
acting	NULL
as	NULL
saviours	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
dark-eyed	NULL
,	NULL
dying	NULL
young	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
attitude	NULL
of	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
towards	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
partly	NULL
accounted	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
smack	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
hitting	NULL
a	NULL
naughty	NULL
child	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
stealing	NULL
chocolates	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
inopportune	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
an	NULL
inopportune	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
opening	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
blackmailing	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
injured	NULL
brother	NULL
officer	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
terrors	NULL
had	NULL
redescended	NULL
upon	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
road	NULL
had	NULL
again	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
stretch	NULL
out	NULL
endless	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
hundreds	NULL
and	NULL
hundreds	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
concealing	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
necessitate	NULL
more	NULL
mortgagings	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
pawnings	NULL
of	NULL
bracelets	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
always	NULL
more	NULL
horrors	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
an	NULL
excruciating	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
matter	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
divorce	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
publicity	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
Edward	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
necessity	NULL
of	NULL
continuing	NULL
the	NULL
payments	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
horror	NULL
of	NULL
there	NULL
being	NULL
more	NULL
such	NULL
obligations	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
--	NULL
none	NULL
that	NULL
went	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
mere	NULL
arrangements	NULL
for	NULL
taking	NULL
trains	NULL
or	NULL
engaging	NULL
servants	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
opening	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
decade	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
motives	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
wished	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
sully	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
brother	NULL
officer	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
blackmailer	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
protect	NULL
the	NULL
credit	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
lady	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
not	NULL
concerned	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
swore	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
swore	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
swore	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
else	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
once	NULL
too	NULL
often	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
wrong	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
acted	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
creditable	NULL
part	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
right	NULL
straight	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
post-office	NULL
and	NULL
spent	NULL
several	NULL
hours	NULL
in	NULL
coding	NULL
a	NULL
telegram	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
solicitor	NULL
,	NULL
bidding	NULL
that	NULL
hard-headed	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
threaten	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
warrant	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
fellow	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
track	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
afterwards	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
too	NULL
thick	NULL
on	NULL
poor	NULL
old	NULL
Leonora	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
ballyragged	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
outstanding	NULL
accounts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
his	NULL
personal	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Divorce	NULL
Court	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
blackmailer	NULL
turned	NULL
nasty	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
face	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
publicity	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
papers	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
bally	NULL
show	NULL
.	NULL

Those	NULL
were	NULL
his	NULL
simple	NULL
words	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
mistake	NULL
of	NULL
not	NULL
telling	NULL
Leonora	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
to	NULL
fetch	NULL
the	NULL
code	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
telegram	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seeing	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
hours	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
hours	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
in	NULL
silent	NULL
agony	NULL
Edward	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
with	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
Maisie	NULL
's	NULL
being	NULL
in	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
,	NULL
partly	NULL
of	NULL
poverty	NULL
,	NULL
partly	NULL
of	NULL
pride	NULL
,	NULL
partly	NULL
of	NULL
sheer	NULL
innocence	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
afford	NULL
a	NULL
maid	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
refrained	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
from	NULL
sending	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL
servants	NULL
on	NULL
errands	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
every	NULL
penny	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
importance	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
feared	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
high	NULL
tips	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
stay	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
had	NULL
lent	NULL
her	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fascinating	NULL
cases	NULL
containing	NULL
fifteen	NULL
different	NULL
sizes	NULL
of	NULL
scissors	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
seen	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
departure	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
post-office	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
of	NULL
returning	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
remorse	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
kissed	NULL
the	NULL
pillows	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Leonora	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
incident	NULL
gave	NULL
Florence	NULL
a	NULL
hold	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
let	NULL
Florence	NULL
into	NULL
things	NULL
and	NULL
Florence	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
created	NULL
being	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
just	NULL
good	NULL
people	NULL
with	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
tails	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
determined	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
Florence	NULL
the	NULL
privilege	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
intimacy	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
payment	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
blackmail	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
Florence	NULL
under	NULL
observation	NULL
until	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
demonstrated	NULL
to	NULL
Florence	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
jealous	NULL
of	NULL
poor	NULL
Maisie	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
arm	NULL
in	NULL
arm	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
markedly	NULL
planted	NULL
herself	NULL
at	NULL
our	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
never	NULL
left	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
just	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
to	NULL
beg	NULL
her	NULL
pardon	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
beg	NULL
her	NULL
also	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
Edward	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
markedly	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
gardens	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
came	NULL
rather	NULL
wistfully	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
lounge	NULL
where	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
sitting	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Now	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
take	NULL
Maisie	NULL

that	NULL
had	NULL
actually	NULL
owned	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
Teleragh	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
centuries	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
came	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
long	NULL
after	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
witness	NULL
her	NULL
gay	NULL
reception	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
pair	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
play	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
enables	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
fix	NULL
exactly	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
of	NULL
M	NULL
----	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
day	NULL
poor	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
died	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
dead	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
got	NULL
back	NULL
--	NULL
pretty	NULL
awful	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
figure	NULL
out	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
means	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
the	NULL
measure	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
relief	NULL
when	NULL
Leonora	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
Irish	NULL
Catholic	NULL
gives	NULL
you	NULL
the	NULL
measure	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
affection	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
couple	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
affection	NULL
so	NULL
intense	NULL
that	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
day	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
without	NULL
sighing	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
on	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
too	NULL
tired	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
verily	NULL
believe	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
my	NULL
suspicion	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
jealous	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
reason	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
outburst	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
turned	NULL
upon	NULL
Florence	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
maddest	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
rage	NULL
.	NULL

Jealousy	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
incurable	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
mere	NULL
silly	NULL
jibes	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Irish	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Catholics	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
apologized	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
existence	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
fix	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL
minutes	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
rather	NULL
fixedly	NULL
and	NULL
queerly	NULL
while	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
I	NULL
worked	NULL
myself	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
saying	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Do	NULL
accept	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL

I	NULL
confess	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
your	NULL
religion	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
like	NULL
you	NULL
so	NULL
intensely	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
anyone	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
really	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
anyone	NULL
has	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
you	NULL
really	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
fond	NULL
enough	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

Fond	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
every	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
you	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
others	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
considered	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
poor	NULL
Maisie	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
picked	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
pellitory	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
breast-high	NULL
wall	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
chafed	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
minute	NULL
between	NULL
her	NULL
finger	NULL
and	NULL
thumb	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
threw	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
coping	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
accept	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

VI	NULL
I	NULL
REMEMBER	NULL
laughing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
phrase	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
accept	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
"	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
repeat	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
gravity	NULL
too	NULL
intense	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
hardly	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
mean	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
claim	NULL
the	NULL
liberty	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
free	NULL
American	NULL
citizen	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
please	NULL
about	NULL
your	NULL
co-religionists	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
liberty	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
pleases	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
what	NULL
politeness	NULL
allows	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Leonora	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
one	NULL
single	NULL
word	NULL
against	NULL
my	NULL
people	NULL
or	NULL
my	NULL
faith	NULL

"	NULL

It	NULL
struck	NULL
me	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
unusual	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
almost	NULL
threatening	NULL
,	NULL
hardness	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
convey	NULL
to	NULL
Florence	NULL
,	NULL
through	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
seriously	NULL
harm	NULL
my	NULL
wife	NULL
if	NULL
Florence	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
extreme	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
thinking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
Leonora	NULL
were	NULL
saying	NULL
,	NULL
through	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
Florence	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
may	NULL
outrage	NULL
me	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
;	NULL
you	NULL
may	NULL
take	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
personally	NULL
possess	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
you	NULL
care	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
one	NULL
single	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
will	NULL
set	NULL
up	NULL

against	NULL
the	NULL
faith	NULL
that	NULL
makes	NULL
me	NULL
become	NULL
the	NULL
doormat	NULL
for	NULL
your	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
obviously	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
her	NULL
meaning	NULL
.	NULL

Good	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
be	NULL
they	NULL
ever	NULL
so	NULL
diverse	NULL
in	NULL
creed	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
threaten	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
read	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
words	NULL
to	NULL
mean	NULL
just	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
if	NULL
Florence	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
against	NULL
my	NULL
co-religionists	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
point	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
touchy	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
hint	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
accordingly	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
conveyed	NULL
to	NULL
Florence	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
shortly	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
came	NULL
down	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
tower	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
until	NULL
after	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
and	NULL
Florence	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
dead	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
the	NULL
remotest	NULL
glimpse	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
suspicion	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
anything	NULL
wrong	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
saying	NULL
is	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
entertained	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
jealous	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
another	NULL
flicker	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
flame-like	NULL
personality	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
should	NULL
I	NULL
get	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
male	NULL
sick	NULL
nurse	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
what	NULL
chance	NULL
had	NULL
I	NULL
against	NULL
those	NULL
three	NULL
hardened	NULL
gamblers	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
league	NULL
to	NULL
conceal	NULL
their	NULL
hands	NULL
from	NULL
me	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
earthly	NULL
chance	NULL
?	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
three	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
made	NULL
me	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

Oh	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
made	NULL
me	NULL
so	NULL
happy	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
doubt	NULL
if	NULL
even	NULL
paradise	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
shall	NULL
smooth	NULL
out	NULL
all	NULL
temporal	NULL
wrongs	NULL
,	NULL
shall	NULL
ever	NULL
give	NULL
me	NULL
the	NULL
like	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
what	NULL
could	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
what	NULL
could	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
worse	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
deceived	NULL
husband	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
pimping	NULL
for	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
cross	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
up	NULL
during	NULL
her	NULL
long	NULL
Calvary	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
life	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
ask	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
feels	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
deceived	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
Heavens	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
feels	NULL
just	NULL
nothing	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
Hell	NULL
,	NULL
certainly	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
necessarily	NULL
Heaven	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
intermediate	NULL
stage	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
do	NULL
they	NULL
call	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

Limbo	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
feel	NULL
nothing	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
are	NULL
dead	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
before	NULL
their	NULL
Judge	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
hope	NULL
,	NULL
will	NULL
open	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
the	NULL
springs	NULL
of	NULL
His	NULL
compassion	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
my	NULL
business	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
simply	NULL
my	NULL
business	NULL

what	NULL

The	NULL

God	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

only	NULL
poor	NULL
wretches	NULL

creeping	NULL
over	NULL
this	NULL

the	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
eternal	NULL
wrath	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
terrible	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
almost	NULL
too	NULL
terrible	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
picture	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
judgement	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
appears	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
sometimes	NULL

at	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
probably	NULL
the	NULL
suggestion	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
picture	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
somewhere	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
upon	NULL
an	NULL
immense	NULL
plain	NULL
,	NULL
suspended	NULL
in	NULL
mid-air	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
three	NULL
figures	NULL

two	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
clasped	NULL
close	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
intense	NULL
embrace	NULL

one	NULL
intolerably	NULL
solitary	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
black	NULL

white	NULL

my	NULL
picture	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
judgement	NULL

only	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
an	NULL
etching	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL

reproduction	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
immense	NULL
plain	NULL

the	NULL
hand	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL

stretching	NULL
out	NULL

miles	NULL

with	NULL
great	NULL

do	NULL
you	NULL

You	NULL

Do	NULL
you	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
whilst	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
mistress	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
perpetually	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
reunite	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
gabble	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
about	NULL
forgiveness	NULL
--	NULL
treating	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
bright	NULL
,	NULL
American	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
would	NULL
treat	NULL
her	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
whore	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
Florence	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
morning	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
straight	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
my	NULL
proper	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
thank	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
even	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
stop	NULL
Florence	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
ambition	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
brighter	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
brief	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
thankfully	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
leave	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
frame	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
Leonora	NULL
would	NULL
only	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
needed	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
tenderness	NULL
beyond	NULL
anything	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
would	NULL
answer	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
outrage	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
--	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
answer	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
writing	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
in	NULL
secret	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
committing	NULL
adultery	NULL
in	NULL
hired	NULL
rooms	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL

you	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
prefer	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Half	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
Florence	NULL
would	NULL
ignore	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
remarks	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
think	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
ladylike	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
other	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
persuade	NULL
Leonora	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
spiritual	NULL
--	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL

"	NULL

Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
doing	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mirror	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
bedroom	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
at	NULL
Florence	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
usually	NULL
vouchsafe	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
,	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
coolly	NULL
and	NULL
calmly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Never	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL

You	NULL

You	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL

be	NULL
reminded	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL

Florence	NULL
went	NULL
off	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
babble	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
have	NULL
hurt	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
hardly	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
whom	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
intentions	NULL

in	NULL
pursuance	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
efforts	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
brighter	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
from	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
figured	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
really	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
Leonora	NULL
said	NULL
patiently	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Very	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
killed	NULL
her	NULL

that	NULL
it	NULL

a	NULL

One	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL

that	NULL
one	NULL

killed	NULL
someone	NULL

Naturally	NULL
not	NULL

I	NULL
ought	NULL
never	NULL

her	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
exactly	NULL
how	NULL
Leonora	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL

It	NULL

stated	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
baldly	NULL

Leonora	NULL

gone	NULL
straight	NULL

Mrs	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
wanted	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL

perceived	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL

ran	NULL
something	NULL

Bunny	NULL
was	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL

husband	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
reading	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
looking	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL

a	NULL
sense	NULL

that	NULL

as	NULL
if	NULL

something	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
that	NULL
drank	NULL
up	NULL
such	NULL
sounds	NULL

there	NULL
were	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
fight	NULL
against	NULL
that	NULL
feeling	NULL
,	NULL
whilst	NULL
she	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
postscript	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

not	NULL

you	NULL

the	NULL
postscript	NULL

The	NULL

hardly	NULL
literate	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
surely	NULL
not	NULL
right	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
wanted	NULL

be	NULL
one	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
Edward	NULL
call	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
little	NULL
rat	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
American	NULL
lady	NULL

He	NULL
always	NULL
called	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
rat	NULL
in	NULL
private	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mind	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
me	NULL
it	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL

and	NULL
we	NULL
out	NULL

the	NULL

convent	NULL
....	NULL
"	NULL
Leonora	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
screamed	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
read	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
Maisie	NULL
's	NULL
boxes	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
packed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
a	NULL
search	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
herself	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
manager	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
had	NULL
paid	NULL
her	NULL
bill	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
the	NULL
Reiseverkehrsbureau	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
plan	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
immediate	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
Chitral	NULL

He	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
certain	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
hotel	NULL
had	NULL
bothered	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
wandering	NULL
solitarily	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
beside	NULL
a	NULL
screen	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
Florence	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
heard	NULL
then	NULL
or	NULL
after	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
between	NULL
that	NULL
precious	NULL
couple	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
fancy	NULL
Florence	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
about	NULL
beginning	NULL
her	NULL
cutting	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
Edward	NULL
by	NULL
addressing	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
some	NULL
words	NULL

friendly	NULL
warning	NULL

the	NULL

he	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
making	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL

heart	NULL

That	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
way	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
begin	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Edward	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
sentimentally	NULL
assured	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
Maisie	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
little	NULL
rat	NULL
whose	NULL
passage	NULL
to	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
had	NULL
paid	NULL
out	NULL

own	NULL
pocket	NULL

That	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
the	NULL
trick	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
trick	NULL
was	NULL
pretty	NULL
efficiently	NULL
done	NULL

Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
panic	NULL
growing	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
contrition	NULL
very	NULL
large	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL

visited	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL

the	NULL
hotel	NULL

the	NULL
dining-room	NULL

God	NULL
knows	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
wanted	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
winter	NULL
garden	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
hotel	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
open	NULL
from	NULL
May	NULL
till	NULL
October	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Leonora	NULL
ran	NULL
--	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
ran	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
if	NULL
Maisie	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
rooms	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
that	NULL
child	NULL
right	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
hideous	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
all	NULL
unspeakable	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
cool	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
cold	NULL
justice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
demanded	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
play	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
mother	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
child	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
convent	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
figured	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
amount	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
leave	NULL
Edward	NULL
to	NULL
Florence	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
devote	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
providing	NULL
that	NULL
child	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
until	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
poor	NULL
young	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
naturally	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
cared	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
round	NULL
Maisie	NULL
's	NULL
rooms	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
perceived	NULL
,	NULL
sticking	NULL
out	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
feet	NULL
in	NULL
high-heeled	NULL
shoes	NULL
.	NULL

Maisie	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
effort	NULL
to	NULL
strap	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
portmanteau	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
so	NULL
grotesquely	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
body	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
forward	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
trunk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
closed	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
jaws	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
gigantic	NULL
alligator	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
key	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
dark	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
hair	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Japanese	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
covered	NULL
her	NULL
body	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
lifted	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
merest	NULL
featherweight	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
laid	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
smiling	NULL

as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
scored	NULL
a	NULL
goal	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
hockey	NULL

You	NULL
understand	NULL

not	NULL
committed	NULL
suicide	NULL

heart	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
stopped	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
lashes	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
cheeks	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
smile	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
flowers	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
stem	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
lily	NULL
rested	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
spike	NULL
of	NULL
flowers	NULL
was	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
shoulder	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
bride	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sunlight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mortuary	NULL
candles	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
coifs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
nuns	NULL
that	NULL
knelt	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
faces	NULL
hidden	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
two	NULL
swans	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
her	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
kissing-kindness	NULL
land	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
wherever	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
showed	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
either	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
spare	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
feelings	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
could	NULL
bear	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
corpse	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
Maisie	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
natural	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
soon	NULL
got	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
affair	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
about	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
felt	NULL
much	NULL
remorse	NULL
.	NULL

PART	NULL
II	NULL
I	NULL
THE	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
occurred	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
4th	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
,	NULL
1904	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
nothing	NULL
happened	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
4th	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
,	NULL
1913	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
curious	NULL
coincidence	NULL
of	NULL
dates	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
sinister	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
half	NULL
jocular	NULL
and	NULL
altogether	NULL
merciless	NULL
proceedings	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cruel	NULL
Providence	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
call	NULL
a	NULL
coincidence	NULL
.	NULL

Because	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
superstitious	NULL
mind	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
that	NULL
forced	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
certain	NULL
acts	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
hypnotized	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
4th	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
always	NULL
proved	NULL
a	NULL
significant	NULL
date	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
begin	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
born	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
4th	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
date	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
1899	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
set	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
uncle	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
tour	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
in	NULL
company	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
called	NULL
Jimmy	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
merely	NULL
a	NULL
coincidence	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
kindly	NULL
old	NULL
uncle	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
supposedly	NULL
damaged	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
delicate	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
offering	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
trip	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
birthday	NULL
present	NULL
to	NULL
celebrate	NULL
her	NULL
coming	NULL
of	NULL
age	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
4th	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
,	NULL
1900	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
yielded	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
action	NULL
that	NULL
certainly	NULL
coloured	NULL
her	NULL
whole	NULL
life	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
mine	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
luck	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
probably	NULL
offering	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL
birthday	NULL
present	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
4th	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
,	NULL
1901	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
married	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
set	NULL
sail	NULL
for	NULL
Europe	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
gale	NULL
of	NULL
wind	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
gale	NULL
that	NULL
affected	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
offering	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL
birthday	NULL
gift	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
birthday	NULL
gift	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
miserable	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
occurs	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
told	NULL
you	NULL
anything	NULL
about	NULL
my	NULL
marriage	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
this	NULL
:	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
told	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
first	NULL
met	NULL
Florence	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Stuyvesants	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Fourteenth	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
determined	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
obstinacy	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
possibly	NULL
weak	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
mine	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
occupation	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
business	NULL
affairs	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
simply	NULL
camped	NULL
down	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
Stamford	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
vile	NULL
hotel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
passed	NULL
my	NULL
days	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
verandah	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Misses	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Misses	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
odd	NULL
,	NULL
obstinate	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
my	NULL
presence	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
hampered	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
national	NULL
manners	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
occasions	NULL
.	NULL

Florence	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
ask	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
simply	NULL
walked	NULL
into	NULL
that	NULL
apartment	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
timid	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
matter	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
chicken	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
automobile	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
would	NULL
walk	NULL
into	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
pretty	NULL
,	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
take	NULL
off	NULL
my	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sit	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

Florence	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
several	NULL
other	NULL
fellows	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
--	NULL
strapping	NULL
young	NULL
New	NULL
Englanders	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
worked	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
and	NULL
spent	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
evenings	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
birth	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evenings	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
march	NULL
in	NULL
on	NULL
Florence	NULL
with	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
determination	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
myself	NULL
showed	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
received	NULL
with	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
disfavour	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
my	NULL
portion	NULL
--	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Misses	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
curious	NULL
old	NULL
creatures	NULL
,	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
members	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
ancient	NULL
family	NULL
under	NULL
some	NULL
curse	NULL
--	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
gentlewomanly	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
proper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
sighed	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
tears	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
courtship	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
made	NULL
much	NULL
progress	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
place	NULL
almost	NULL
entirely	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
daytime	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
hot	NULL
afternoons	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
clouds	NULL
of	NULL
dust	NULL
hung	NULL
like	NULL
fog	NULL
,	NULL
right	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
high	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
tops	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
thin-leaved	NULL
elms	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
proper	NULL
season	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
gentle	NULL
feats	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
Connecticut	NULL
July	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
any	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
proximity	NULL
is	NULL
an	NULL
almost	NULL
appalling	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
kissed	NULL
Florence	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
discover	NULL
very	NULL
easily	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
simple	NULL
wants	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
supply	NULL
those	NULL
wants	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
of	NULL
leisure	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
a	NULL
European	NULL
establishment	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
English	NULL
accent	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
income	NULL
of	NULL
fifty	NULL
thousand	NULL
dollars	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
from	NULL
real	NULL
estate	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
ambitions	NULL
to	NULL
increase	NULL
that	NULL
income	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
faintly	NULL
hinted	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
much	NULL
physical	NULL
passion	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
.	NULL

Americans	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
can	NULL
envisage	NULL
such	NULL
unions	NULL
without	NULL
blinking	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
out	NULL
this	NULL
information	NULL
in	NULL
floods	NULL
of	NULL
bright	NULL
talk	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
pop	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
comments	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Rialto	NULL
,	NULL
Venice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
whilst	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
brightly	NULL
describing	NULL
Balmoral	NULL
Castle	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
ideal	NULL
husband	NULL
would	NULL
he	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
her	NULL
received	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
British	NULL
Court	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
months	NULL
in	NULL
Great	NULL
Britain	NULL
--	NULL
seven	NULL
weeks	NULL
in	NULL
touring	NULL
from	NULL
Stratford	NULL
to	NULL
Strathpeffer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
as	NULL
paying	NULL
guest	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
English	NULL
family	NULL
near	NULL
Ledbury	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
impoverished	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
stately	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
called	NULL
Bagshawe	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
spent	NULL
two	NULL
months	NULL
more	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
tranquil	NULL
bosom	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
inopportune	NULL
events	NULL
,	NULL
apparently	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
caused	NULL
their	NULL
rather	NULL
hurried	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
Stamford	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
called	NULL
Jimmy	NULL
had	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
Europe	NULL
to	NULL
perfect	NULL
his	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
continent	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
certainly	NULL
did	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
most	NULL
useful	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
afterwards	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
that	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
mistaking	NULL
--	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
was	NULL
coldly	NULL
and	NULL
calmly	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
no	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
European	NULL
settlement	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
glimpse	NULL
of	NULL
English	NULL
home	NULL
life	NULL
had	NULL
effected	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
meant	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
buy	NULL
some	NULL
real	NULL
estate	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
of	NULL
Fordingbridge	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
place	NULL
the	NULL
Hurlbirds	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
1688	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
strength	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ranks	NULL
of	NULL
English	NULL
county	NULL
society	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
fixed	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
mightily	NULL
elevated	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
considered	NULL
these	NULL
details	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
figure	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
amongst	NULL
her	NULL
acquaintances	NULL
in	NULL
Stamford	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
any	NULL
fellow	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
fill	NULL
the	NULL
bill	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
wealthy	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
those	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
type	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
fascinations	NULL
of	NULL
Wall	NULL
Street	NULL
even	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
protracted	NULL
companionship	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
nothing	NULL
really	NULL
happened	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
month	NULL
of	NULL
July	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
1st	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
Florence	NULL
apparently	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
aunts	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
intended	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
aunts	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Florence	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
,	NULL
Senior	NULL
,	NULL
stopped	NULL
me	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
agitatedly	NULL
,	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
parlour	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
singular	NULL
interview	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
colonial	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
spindle-legged	NULL
furniture	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
silhouettes	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
miniatures	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
portrait	NULL
of	NULL
General	NULL
Braddock	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
smell	NULL
of	NULL
lavender	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
poor	NULL
maiden	NULL
ladies	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
agonies	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
one	NULL
single	NULL
thing	NULL
direct	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
almost	NULL
wring	NULL
their	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
ask	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
considered	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
as	NULL
different	NULL
temperaments	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
assure	NULL
you	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
almost	NULL
affectionate	NULL
,	NULL
concerned	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
even	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
Florence	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
bright	NULL
for	NULL
my	NULL
solid	NULL
and	NULL
serious	NULL
virtues	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
discovered	NULL
in	NULL
me	NULL
solid	NULL
and	NULL
serious	NULL
virtues	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
because	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
dropped	NULL
the	NULL
remark	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
preferred	NULL
General	NULL
Braddock	NULL
to	NULL
General	NULL
Washington	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
Hurlbirds	NULL
had	NULL
backed	NULL
the	NULL
losing	NULL
side	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
War	NULL
of	NULL
Independence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
seriously	NULL
impoverished	NULL
and	NULL
quite	NULL
efficiently	NULL
oppressed	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
reason	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Misses	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
forget	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
they	NULL
shuddered	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
European	NULL
career	NULL
for	NULL
myself	NULL
and	NULL
Florence	NULL
.	NULL

Each	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
really	NULL
wailed	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
hoped	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
their	NULL
niece	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
partly	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
regarded	NULL
Europe	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
sink	NULL
of	NULL
iniquity	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
strange	NULL
laxities	NULL
prevailed	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
Mother	NULL
Country	NULL
as	NULL
Erastian	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
they	NULL
carried	NULL
their	NULL
protests	NULL
to	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
lengths	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
even	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
marriage	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sacrament	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
neither	NULL
Miss	NULL
Florence	NULL
nor	NULL
Miss	NULL
Emily	NULL
could	NULL
quite	NULL
bring	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
utter	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
they	NULL
almost	NULL
brought	NULL
themselves	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
early	NULL
life	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
characterized	NULL
by	NULL
flirtations	NULL
--	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
I	NULL
ended	NULL
the	NULL
interview	NULL
by	NULL
saying	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
care	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Florence	NULL
has	NULL
robbed	NULL
a	NULL
bank	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
Europe	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Emily	NULL
wailed	NULL
and	NULL
fainted	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Miss	NULL
Florence	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
threw	NULL
herself	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
neck	NULL
and	NULL
cried	NULL
out	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
John	NULL
.	NULL

Do	NULL
n't	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
're	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
added	NULL
,	NULL
whilst	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
Florence	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL
's	NULL
rescue	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
We	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
's	NULL
our	NULL
dear	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Florence	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
,	NULL
received	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
chalk-pale	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
exclamation	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Have	NULL
those	NULL
old	NULL
cats	NULL
been	NULL
saying	NULL
anything	NULL
against	NULL
me	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
assured	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
and	NULL
hurried	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
strangely	NULL
afflicted	NULL
relatives	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
really	NULL
forgotten	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
that	NULL
exclamation	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
until	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
treated	NULL
me	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
tact	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
ever	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
afterwards	NULL
I	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
deep	NULL
affection	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
fetch	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
buggy-ride	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
disappeared	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
lose	NULL
any	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
and	NULL
engaged	NULL
berths	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Pocahontas	NULL
"	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
sail	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fourth	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
month	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
returning	NULL
to	NULL
Stamford	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
tracked	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
driven	NULL
to	NULL
Rye	NULL
Station	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
cars	NULL
to	NULL
Waterbury	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
received	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
stony	NULL
,	NULL
husky	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Florence	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
ill	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
keeping	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
let	NULL
drop	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
odd	NULL
Biblical	NULL
phrase	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
forgotten	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
gathered	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
family	NULL
simply	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
intend	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
ever	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
procured	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
nearest	NULL
minister	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
rope	NULL
ladder	NULL
--	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL
how	NULL
primitively	NULL
these	NULL
matters	NULL
were	NULL
arranged	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
days	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
United	NULL
States	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
daresay	NULL
that	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
o'clock	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
4th	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
bedroom	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
one-minded	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
purpose	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
never	NULL
struck	NULL
me	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
anything	NULL
improper	NULL
in	NULL
being	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
o'clock	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
bedroom	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
just	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
wake	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
asleep	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
expected	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
relatives	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
just	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
received	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
embrace	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
warmth	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
embraced	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
embrace	NULL
has	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
any	NULL
warmth	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
fault	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
followed	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
hurry	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
wedding	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
relatives	NULL
finding	NULL
me	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
received	NULL
her	NULL
advances	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
absence	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
ladder	NULL
in	NULL
under	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
kept	NULL
me	NULL
waiting	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
an	NULL
unconscionable	NULL
time	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
three	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
before	NULL
we	NULL
knocked	NULL
up	NULL
that	NULL
minister	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
wait	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
sign	NULL
Florence	NULL
ever	NULL
showed	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
conscience	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
,	NULL
unless	NULL
her	NULL
lying	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
moments	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
arms	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
a	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
conscience	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
fancy	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
shown	NULL
warmth	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
acted	NULL
the	NULL
proper	NULL
wife	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
put	NULL
me	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
I	NULL
acted	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
Philadelphia	NULL
gentleman	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
,	NULL
go	NULL
through	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
male	NULL
nurse	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
gather	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
remorse	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
plans	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
ladder	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
called	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
grotesque	NULL
implement	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
tranquil	NULL
jumping-jack	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
collected	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
fierceness	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
determined	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
sail	NULL
at	NULL
four	NULL
this	NULL
afternoon	NULL
?	NULL

You	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
lying	NULL
about	NULL
having	NULL
taken	NULL
berths	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
understood	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
naturally	NULL
be	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
apparently	NULL
insane	NULL
relatives	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
readily	NULL
excused	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
lying	NULL
about	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
plain	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
my	NULL
fixed	NULL
determination	NULL
to	NULL
sail	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Pocahontas	NULL
"	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
then	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
moonlit	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
whispering	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
ear	NULL
whilst	NULL
I	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ladder	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hills	NULL
that	NULL
surround	NULL
Waterbury	NULL
showed	NULL
,	NULL
extraordinarily	NULL
tranquil	NULL
,	NULL
around	NULL
the	NULL
villa	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
coldly	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
pack	NULL
my	NULL
trunks	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
added	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
ill	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
guess	NULL
my	NULL
heart	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
like	NULL
Uncle	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
runs	NULL
in	NULL
families	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
whispered	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Pocahontas	NULL
"	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
extraordinarily	NULL
steady	NULL
boat	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
I	NULL
wonder	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
hours	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
kept	NULL
me	NULL
waiting	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ladder	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

Till	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
fancy	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
settled	NULL
plan	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
certainly	NULL
never	NULL
mentioned	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
till	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
renewed	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
Uncle	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
.	NULL

Certainly	NULL
her	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Emily	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
over	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
Waterbury	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
rubbed	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
hours	NULL
and	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
accentuated	NULL
discussions	NULL
would	NULL
kill	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
would	NULL
recall	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
safeguards	NULL
against	NULL
excitement	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
silly	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
hedged	NULL
in	NULL
during	NULL
their	NULL
trip	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
some	NULL
remorse	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
account	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
said	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
Leonora	NULL
knew	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
once	NULL
went	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
her	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
so	NULL
infamous	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
excused	NULL
herself	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
score	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
overmastering	NULL
passion	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
always	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
an	NULL
overmastering	NULL
passion	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
excuse	NULL
for	NULL
feelings	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
excuse	NULL
for	NULL
straight	NULL
actions	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
bolted	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
or	NULL
after	NULL
she	NULL
married	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
enough	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
cut	NULL
their	NULL
throats	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
sponged	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
Florence	NULL
wanted	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
suited	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
badly	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
husband	NULL
a	NULL
clerk	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dry-goods	NULL
store	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
old	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
fellow	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hated	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
much	NULL
excuse	NULL
for	NULL
Florence	NULL
.	NULL

God	NULL
knows	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
frightened	NULL
fool	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
fantastic	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
really	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
imbecile	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
certainly	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Poor	NULL
thing	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
assured	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Pocahontas	NULL
"	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
steady	NULL
ship	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
just	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
'll	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
certain	NULL
ways	NULL

like	NULL
Uncle	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
is	NULL
looked	NULL
after	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
stepped	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
sill	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
stepping	NULL
on	NULL
board	NULL
a	NULL
boat	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
burnt	NULL
hers	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
eye-openers	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
we	NULL
re-entered	NULL
the	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
mansion	NULL
at	NULL
eight	NULL
o'clock	NULL
the	NULL
Hurlbirds	NULL
were	NULL
just	NULL
exhausted	NULL
.	NULL

Florence	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
,	NULL
triumphant	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
married	NULL
about	NULL
four	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
sat	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
woods	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
till	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
mocking-bird	NULL
imitate	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
tom-cat	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
I	NULL
guess	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
found	NULL
getting	NULL
married	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
stimulating	NULL
process	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
found	NULL
anything	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
inspiring	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
than	NULL
how	NULL
glad	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
variations	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
dazed	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Hurlbirds	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
dazed	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
breakfast	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
Florence	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
pack	NULL
her	NULL
grips	NULL
and	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

Old	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
full-blooded	NULL
lecture	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
style	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
American	NULL
oration	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
perils	NULL
for	NULL
young	NULL
American	NULL
girlhood	NULL
lurking	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
European	NULL
jungle	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
Paris	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
snakes	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
bitter	NULL
experience	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
concluded	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
always	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
dear	NULL
old	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
aspiration	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
American	NULL
women	NULL
should	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
be	NULL
sexless	NULL
--	NULL
though	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
they	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

.	NULL

.	NULL

.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
ship	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
by	NULL
one-thirty	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
tempest	NULL
blowing	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
helped	NULL
Florence	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
Sandy	NULL
Hook	NULL
before	NULL
Florence	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
cabin	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
agitated	NULL
stewardess	NULL
came	NULL
running	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
running	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
got	NULL
my	NULL
directions	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
behave	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

Most	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
ship	NULL
doctor	NULL
who	NULL
discreetly	NULL
suggested	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
refrain	NULL
from	NULL
manifestations	NULL
of	NULL
affection	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
remorse	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Hurlbirds	NULL
'	NULL
mysterious	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
their	NULL
youngest	NULL
and	NULL
dearest	NULL
unmarried	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
too	NULL
refined	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
motive	NULL
into	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
old	NULL
stock	NULL
New	NULL
Englanders	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
suggest	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
husband	NULL
must	NULL
not	NULL
kiss	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
neck	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
suggest	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wonder	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
Florence	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
the	NULL
conspiracy	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
several	NULL
doctors	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
squeaked	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
configuration	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lungs	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
Uncle	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
company	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
heart	NULL
talk	NULL
from	NULL
specialists	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
tied	NULL
me	NULL
pretty	NULL
well	NULL
down	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
Jimmy	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
dreary	NULL
boy	NULL
--	NULL
what	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
see	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
lugubrious	NULL
,	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
morose	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
talent	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
painter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
sallow	NULL
and	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
shaved	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
met	NULL
us	NULL
at	NULL
Havre	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
proceeded	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
himself	NULL
useful	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
flat	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
whether	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
there	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
studied	NULL
painting	NULL
at	NULL
Julien	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
some	NULL
such	NULL
place	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
fellow	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
always	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pockets	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
odious	NULL
,	NULL
square-shouldered	NULL
,	NULL
broad-hipped	NULL
,	NULL
American	NULL
coats	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
dark	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
always	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
ominous	NULL
appearances	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
fat	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
man	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
daresay	NULL
Florence	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
me	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
showed	NULL
signs	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
enigmatic	NULL
smile	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
back	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
shoulder	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bathing	NULL
place	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
invitation	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
mentioned	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
saying	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
going	NULL
in	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
so	NULL
stripped	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
and	NULL
straight	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
....	NULL
"	NULL
Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL
that	NULL
fellow	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
sallow	NULL
putty	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
slim	NULL
and	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
graceful	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
disgrace	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
loafing	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
pocket-money	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
allowance	NULL
that	NULL
old	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
United	NULL
States	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
stomach	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
forty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dyspeptic	NULL
irritation	NULL
on	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

God	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
they	NULL
worked	NULL
me	NULL
!	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
who	NULL
really	NULL
elaborated	NULL
the	NULL
rules	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
told	NULL
you	NULL
something	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
--	NULL
how	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
head	NULL
conversations	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
eleven	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
off	NULL
such	NULL
topics	NULL
as	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
poverty	NULL
,	NULL
crime	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
over	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
written	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
unintentionally	NULL
misled	NULL
you	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
sight	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
really	NULL
had	NULL
until	NULL
just	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
sight	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
fellow	NULL
impressed	NULL
upon	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
Florence	NULL
needed	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
were	NULL
sleep	NULL
and	NULL
privacy	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
must	NULL
never	NULL
enter	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
without	NULL
knocking	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
her	NULL
poor	NULL
little	NULL
heart	NULL
might	NULL
flutter	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
doom	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
lugubrious	NULL
croak	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
black	NULL
eyes	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
crow	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
poor	NULL
Florence	NULL
die	NULL
ten	NULL
times	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
frail	NULL
corpse	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
entering	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
without	NULL
her	NULL
permission	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
burgling	NULL
a	NULL
church	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
would	NULL
sooner	NULL
have	NULL
committed	NULL
that	NULL
crime	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
would	NULL
certainly	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
demanded	NULL
the	NULL
sacrilege	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
at	NULL
ten	NULL
o'clock	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
closed	NULL
upon	NULL
Florence	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
gently	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
reluctantly	NULL
,	NULL
backed	NULL
up	NULL
that	NULL
fellow	NULL
's	NULL
recommendations	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
wish	NULL
me	NULL
good	NULL
night	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
cinquecento	NULL
Italian	NULL
lady	NULL
saying	NULL
good-bye	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
lover	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
at	NULL
ten	NULL
o'clock	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
there	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
as	NULL
fresh	NULL
as	NULL
Venus	NULL
rising	NULL
from	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
couches	NULL
that	NULL
are	NULL
mentioned	NULL
in	NULL
Greek	NULL
legends	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
room	NULL
door	NULL
was	NULL
locked	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
nervous	NULL
about	NULL
thieves	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
an	NULL
electric	NULL
contrivance	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
cord	NULL
was	NULL
understood	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
attached	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
wrist	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
press	NULL
a	NULL
bulb	NULL
to	NULL
raise	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
provided	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
axe	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
axe	NULL
!	NULL

--	NULL
great	NULL
gods	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
break	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
door	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
she	NULL
ever	NULL
failed	NULL
to	NULL
answer	NULL
my	NULL
knock	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
I	NULL
knocked	NULL
really	NULL
loud	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
pretty	NULL
well	NULL
thought	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
see	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
thought	NULL
out	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
ultimate	NULL
consequences	NULL
--	NULL
our	NULL
being	NULL
tied	NULL
to	NULL
Europe	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
that	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
rubbed	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
into	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
would	NULL
die	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
crossed	NULL
the	NULL
Channel	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
impressed	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
fully	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
later	NULL
Florence	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Fordingbridge	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
cut	NULL
the	NULL
proposal	NULL
short	NULL
--	NULL
absolutely	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
curt	NULL
no	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
fixed	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
frightened	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
even	NULL
backed	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
doctors	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
endless	NULL
interviews	NULL
with	NULL
doctor	NULL
after	NULL
doctor	NULL
,	NULL
cool	NULL
,	NULL
quiet	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
ask	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
reasonable	NULL
tones	NULL
,	NULL
whether	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
any	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
our	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
England	NULL
--	NULL
any	NULL
special	NULL
reason	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
since	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
any	NULL
special	NULL
reason	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
verdict	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Better	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
daresay	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
honest	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
things	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
probably	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
mere	NULL
associations	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
steamer	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
effects	NULL
on	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
nerves	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
conscientious	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
our	NULL
money	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Continent	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
rattled	NULL
poor	NULL
Florence	NULL
pretty	NULL
considerably	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
main	NULL
idea	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
main	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
otherwise	NULL
cold	NULL
--	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
to	NULL
Fordingbridge	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
county	NULL
lady	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
home	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
ancestors	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Jimmy	NULL
got	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
shut	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Channel	NULL
;	NULL
even	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
fairest	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
blue	NULL
sky	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
cliffs	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
shining	NULL
like	NULL
mother	NULL
of	NULL
pearl	NULL
in	NULL
full	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
Calais	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
cross	NULL
the	NULL
steamer	NULL
gangway	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
it	NULL
fixed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
fixed	NULL
her	NULL
beautifully	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
announce	NULL
herself	NULL
as	NULL
cured	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
put	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
locked	NULL
bedroom	NULL
arrangements	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sick	NULL
of	NULL
Jimmy	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
happened	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
1903	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
on	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
fix	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
Edward	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
Fordingbridge	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
Manor	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
home	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
ancestors	NULL
being	NULL
settled	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
have	NULL
pretty	NULL
considerably	NULL
queened	NULL
it	NULL
there	NULL
or	NULL
thereabouts	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
with	NULL
our	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
support	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
uncle	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
considered	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
really	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
sent	NULL
him	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
glowing	NULL
accounts	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
virtue	NULL
and	NULL
constancy	NULL
--	NULL
made	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
considerable	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fortune	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
use	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
between	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
fifteen	NULL
thousand	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
in	NULL
English	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
quite	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Jimmy	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
shone	NULL
in	NULL
Fordingbridge	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
quite	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
either	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
got	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
Jimmy	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
fancy	NULL
that	NULL
fat	NULL
and	NULL
disreputable	NULL
raven	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
six	NULL
golden	NULL
front	NULL
teeth	NULL
knocked	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
throat	NULL
by	NULL
Edward	NULL
one	NULL
morning	NULL
whilst	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
some	NULL
flowers	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Rue	NULL
de	NULL
la	NULL
Paix	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
Florence	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
flat	NULL
in	NULL
charge	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
serve	NULL
him	NULL
very	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
blackmailer	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
hope	NULL
Florence	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
his	NULL
company	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
God	NULL
is	NULL
my	NULL
Judge	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
separated	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
really	NULL
and	NULL
passionately	NULL
loved	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
morality	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
comes	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
man	NULL
really	NULL
knows	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
given	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
truly	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
united	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
observing	NULL
ways	NULL
and	NULL
means	NULL
as	NULL
decent	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
them	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
upon	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
consoled	NULL
myself	NULL
somehow	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
date	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
found	NULL
some	NULL
young	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
peace	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
peace	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
with	NULL
Florence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hardly	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
became	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
rare	NULL
and	NULL
fragile	NULL
object	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
burdensome	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
very	NULL
frail	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
given	NULL
a	NULL
thin-shelled	NULL
pullet	NULL
's	NULL
egg	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
palm	NULL
from	NULL
Equatorial	NULL
Africa	NULL
to	NULL
Hoboken	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
became	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bet	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
trophy	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
athlete	NULL
's	NULL
achievement	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
parsley	NULL
crown	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
symbol	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
chastity	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
soberness	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
abstentions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
inflexible	NULL
will	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
intrinsic	NULL
value	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
none	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
fancy	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
she	NULL
dressed	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
her	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
Jimmy	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
mad	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
suggestion	NULL
may	NULL
appear	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
frightened	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
how	NULL
that	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
darky	NULL
servant	NULL
,	NULL
called	NULL
Julius	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
valeted	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
on	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
loved	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
crown	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
left	NULL
Waterbury	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Pocahontas	NULL
"	NULL
,	NULL
Florence	NULL
entrusted	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
one	NULL
very	NULL
special	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
precious	NULL
leather	NULL
grip	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
might	NULL
depend	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
grip	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
contained	NULL
her	NULL
drugs	NULL
against	NULL
heart	NULL
attacks	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hand	NULL
at	NULL
carrying	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
entrusted	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
turn	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
Julius	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
grey-haired	NULL
chap	NULL
of	NULL
sixty	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
picturesque	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
impression	NULL
on	NULL
Florence	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
regarded	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
absolutely	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
take	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
inconvenienced	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
Julius	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
overcome	NULL
with	NULL
grief	NULL
at	NULL
being	NULL
left	NULL
behind	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
needs	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
drop	NULL
the	NULL
precious	NULL
grip	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
saw	NULL
red	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
purple	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
flew	NULL
at	NULL
Julius	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
ferry	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
filled	NULL
up	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
threatened	NULL
to	NULL
strangle	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
an	NULL
unresisting	NULL
negro	NULL
can	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
deplorable	NULL
noise	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
deplorable	NULL
spectacle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
first	NULL
adventure	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
married	NULL
state	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
character	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
affirmed	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
desperate	NULL
resolve	NULL
to	NULL
conceal	NULL
from	NULL
me	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
called	NULL
"	NULL
a	NULL
pure	NULL
woman	NULL
"	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
the	NULL
mainspring	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
fantastic	NULL
actions	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
murder	NULL
her	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
attack	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
earliest	NULL
possible	NULL
opportunity	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
board	NULL
the	NULL
liner	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
blamed	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
must	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
New	NULL
Englander	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
New	NULL
England	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
loathe	NULL
darkies	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
does	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

Whereas	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
even	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
south	NULL
as	NULL
Philadelphia	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
an	NULL
oldish	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
kick	NULL
Julius	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
outrageous	NULL
an	NULL
act	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
cousin	NULL
,	NULL
Reggie	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
English	NULL
butler	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
cents	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
bat	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
pants	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
medicine-grip	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
bulk	NULL
as	NULL
largely	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
in	NULL
mine	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
symbol	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
existence	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
adored	NULL
wife	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
her	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
useful	NULL
lie	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
clear	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
husband	NULL
an	NULL
ignorant	NULL
fool	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
wife	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
sensualist	NULL
with	NULL
imbecile	NULL
fears	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
or	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
blackmailing	NULL
lover	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
lover	NULL
came	NULL
along	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
having	NULL
.	NULL

Have	NULL
I	NULL
conveyed	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
the	NULL
splendid	NULL
fellow	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
fine	NULL
soldier	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
excellent	NULL
landlord	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
extraordinarily	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
careful	NULL
and	NULL
industrious	NULL
magistrate	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
upright	NULL
,	NULL
honest	NULL
,	NULL
fair-dealing	NULL
,	NULL
fair-thinking	NULL
,	NULL
public	NULL
character	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
not	NULL
conveyed	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
truth	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
girl	NULL
came	NULL
along	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
girl	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
straight	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
splendid	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
upright	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
swear	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
I	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
really	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
I	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
infinitely	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

Come	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
remember	NULL
a	NULL
thousand	NULL
little	NULL
acts	NULL
of	NULL
kindliness	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
thoughtfulness	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
inferiors	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Continent	NULL
.	NULL

Look	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
families	NULL
of	NULL
dirty	NULL
,	NULL
unpicturesque	NULL
,	NULL
Hessian	NULL
paupers	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
infinite	NULL
patience	NULL
,	NULL
rooted	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
got	NULL
their	NULL
police	NULL
reports	NULL
,	NULL
set	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
exported	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
patient	NULL
land	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
quite	NULL
inarticulately	NULL
,	NULL
set	NULL
in	NULL
motion	NULL
by	NULL
seeing	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
crying	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
wrestle	NULL
with	NULL
dictionaries	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
unfamiliar	NULL
tongue	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
cry	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
comfort	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
physical	NULL
attractions	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
I	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
intensely	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
for	NULL
granted	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
made	NULL
me	NULL
feel	NULL
comfortable	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
good	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
made	NULL
me	NULL
trust	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
guess	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
English	NULL
gentleman	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
waiter	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Excelsior	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
crying	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
fellow	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
grey	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
grey	NULL
whiskers	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
spent	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
correspondence	NULL
and	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
British	NULL
consul	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
getting	NULL
the	NULL
fellow	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
London	NULL
and	NULL
bring	NULL
back	NULL
his	NULL
girl	NULL
baby	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
bolted	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
Swiss	NULL
scullion	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
inside	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
fetch	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
duty	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
rank	NULL
and	NULL
station	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
pray	NULL
God	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
me	NULL
discharge	NULL
mine	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
daresay	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
over	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
such	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
even	NULL
now	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
the	NULL
technicalities	NULL
of	NULL
English	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
gather	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
last	NULL
stay	NULL
at	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
.	NULL

Nancy	NULL
Rufford	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
name	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
only	NULL
friend	NULL
's	NULL
only	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
guardian	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
correct	NULL
term	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
ever	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
age	NULL
of	NULL
thirteen	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
was	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
committed	NULL
suicide	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
brutalities	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
cheerful	NULL
story	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
always	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
"	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
pretty	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
evident	NULL
affection	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
feet	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
kissed	NULL
--	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
were	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
woman	NULL
on	NULL
earth	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
heaven	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
evil	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
girl	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
chanted	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
praises	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
appeared	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
D.S.O.	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
troop	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
love	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
never	NULL
saw	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
troop	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
Royal	NULL
Humane	NULL
Society	NULL
's	NULL
medal	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
clasp	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
meant	NULL
,	NULL
apparently	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
twice	NULL
jumped	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
deck	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
troopship	NULL
to	NULL
rescue	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
called	NULL
"	NULL
Tommies	NULL
"	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
overboard	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Red	NULL
Sea	NULL
and	NULL
such	NULL
places	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
twice	NULL
recommended	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
V.C.	NULL
,	NULL
whatever	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
mean	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
technicalities	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
received	NULL
that	NULL
apparently	NULL
coveted	NULL
order	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
special	NULL
place	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
sovereign	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
coronation	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
some	NULL
post	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Beefeaters	NULL
'	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
cross	NULL
between	NULL
Lohengrin	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Chevalier	NULL
Bayard	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
silent	NULL
a	NULL
fellow	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
that	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
really	NULL
decorative	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
about	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
asking	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
D.S.O.	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
grunted	NULL
out	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
they	NULL
give	NULL
grocers	NULL
who	NULL
've	NULL
honourably	NULL
supplied	NULL
the	NULL
troops	NULL
with	NULL
adulterated	NULL
coffee	NULL
in	NULL
war-time	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
carry	NULL
conviction	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
directly	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
fully	NULL
and	NULL
squarely	NULL
--	NULL
prefacing	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
remarks	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
those	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
already	NULL
given	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
difficulty	NULL
one	NULL
has	NULL
in	NULL
really	NULL
getting	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
people	NULL
when	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
intimacy	NULL
is	NULL
conducted	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
English	NULL
acquaintanceship	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
whether	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
really	NULL
a	NULL
splendid	NULL
fellow	NULL
--	NULL
along	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
the	NULL
lines	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
public	NULL
functions	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
slightly	NULL
awakened	NULL
air	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
almost	NULL
startled	NULL
if	NULL
Leonora	NULL
could	NULL
ever	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
startled	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Did	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
I	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL

fellow	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
three	NULL
counties	NULL
,	NULL
pick	NULL
them	NULL
where	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
--	NULL
along	NULL
those	NULL
lines	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
added	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
reflectively	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
To	NULL
do	NULL
my	NULL
husband	NULL
justice	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL

better	NULL

the	NULL
earth	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL

for	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
along	NULL
those	NULL
lines	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
really	NULL
be	NULL
Lohengrin	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Cid	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
body	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
lines	NULL
that	NULL
count	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Again	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
your	NULL
opinion	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
no	NULL

"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
slowly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
answered	NULL
gaily	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
accuse	NULL
him	NULL

or	NULL
of	NULL
not	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
guardian	NULL
to	NULL
your	NULL
ward	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
spoke	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sounds	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sea-shell	NULL
held	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
ear	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
you	NULL
believe	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
afterwards	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
speech	NULL
of	NULL
mine	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
vague	NULL
inkling	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tragedy	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
so	NULL
soon	NULL
--	NULL
although	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
for	NULL
eight	NULL
years	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL

the	NULL
best	NULL

,	NULL
or	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
sees	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
than	NULL
even	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
years	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
known	NULL
Edward	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
never	NULL

in	NULL
your	NULL
absence	NULL

paid	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
's	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
woman	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
quivering	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
eyelash	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
noticed	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
talks	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
angels	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
scratch	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
Leonora	NULL
would	NULL
always	NULL
come	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
scratch	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
perfectly	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
speaks	NULL
nicely	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
daresay	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
practice	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
scene	NULL
--	NULL
people	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
always	NULL
complimenting	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
fidelity	NULL
and	NULL
adoration	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
that	NULL
knew	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
believed	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
conviction	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Kilsyte	NULL
affair	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
miscarriage	NULL
of	NULL
justice	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
conspiracy	NULL
of	NULL
false	NULL
evidence	NULL
,	NULL
got	NULL
together	NULL
by	NULL
Nonconformist	NULL
adversaries	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fool	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

II	NULL
LET	NULL
me	NULL
think	NULL
where	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
.	NULL

Oh	NULL
,	NULL
yes	NULL
...	NULL
that	NULL
conversation	NULL
took	NULL
place	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
4th	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
,	NULL
1913	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
saying	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
exactly	NULL
nine	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
their	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
quite	NULL
appropriate	NULL
and	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
birthday	NULL
speech	NULL
to	NULL
utter	NULL
my	NULL
little	NULL
testimonial	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
friend	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
quite	NULL
confidently	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
we	NULL
four	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
about	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
places	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
length	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
my	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
single	NULL
complaint	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
of	NULL
either	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
added	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
unusual	NULL
record	NULL
for	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
at	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
met	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
suited	NULL
Florence	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
find	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
my	NULL
diaries	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
4th	NULL
of	NULL
September	NULL
,	NULL
1904	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
accompanied	NULL
Florence	NULL
and	NULL
myself	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
we	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
twenty-first	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
month	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
another	NULL
short	NULL
visit	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
in	NULL
December	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
year	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
year	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
during	NULL
this	NULL
visit	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
knocked	NULL
Mr	NULL
Jimmy	NULL
's	NULL
teeth	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
throat	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
daresay	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
over	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
purpose	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
1905	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
--	NULL
once	NULL
with	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
wanted	NULL
some	NULL
frocks	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
1906	NULL
we	NULL
spent	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
six	NULL
weeks	NULL
together	NULL
at	NULL
Mentone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
stayed	NULL
with	NULL
us	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
went	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fact	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
Florence	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
wretch	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Tartar	NULL
,	NULL
compared	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sucking	NULL
kid	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
hell	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
--	NULL
what	NULL
shall	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
that	NULL
Catholic	NULL
women	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
lose	NULL
their	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
it	NULL
go	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
write	NULL
more	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
motives	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Florence	NULL
was	NULL
sticking	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
proprietor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
home	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
ancestors	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
doubt	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
passionate	NULL
lover	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sick	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
within	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
even	NULL
interrupted	NULL
companionship	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
led	NULL
him	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
ever	NULL
Leonora	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
mentioned	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
staying	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
mentioned	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
name	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
--	NULL
off	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
a	NULL
desperate	NULL
cable	NULL
in	NULL
cipher	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
poor	NULL
wretch	NULL
at	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
,	NULL
commanding	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
pain	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
and	NULL
horrible	NULL
disclosure	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
assure	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fidelity	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
daresay	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
faced	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
daresay	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
thrown	NULL
over	NULL
Florence	NULL
and	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
risk	NULL
of	NULL
exposure	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
Leonora	NULL
to	NULL
deal	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
assured	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
minutest	NULL
fragment	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
situation	NULL
ever	NULL
got	NULL
through	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
senses	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
wreak	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
terrible	NULL
vengeance	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
easy	NULL
job	NULL
.	NULL

Florence	NULL
called	NULL
for	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
attentions	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
kiss	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
making	NULL
it	NULL
plain	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
divorced	NULL
lady	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
assume	NULL
a	NULL
position	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL
of	NULL
Hampshire	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
prevent	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
bolt	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
train	NULL
.	NULL

Oh	NULL
,	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
difficult	NULL
job	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
Florence	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
please	NULL
,	NULL
gaining	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
composed	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
overcome	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
habits	NULL
of	NULL
garrulity	NULL
,	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
frame	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
almost	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
nothing	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
situation	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
unbearable	NULL
with	NULL
regard	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
proposed	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
secure	NULL
a	NULL
divorce	NULL
from	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
settle	NULL
in	NULL
California	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
serious	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
meant	NULL
the	NULL
extinction	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
hopes	NULL
of	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
Manor	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
sound	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
roach	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
consumptive	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
begging	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
doctor	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
none	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
Edward	NULL
seems	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
determination	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
him	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
meant	NULL
my	NULL
getting	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
incurring	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
vengeance	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
pretty	NULL
hot	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
ten	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
different	NULL
ways	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
assured	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
used	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
spare	NULL
my	NULL
feelings	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
date	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
hottest	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
refuse	NULL
,	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
ever	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
pretty	NULL
clear	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
me	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
4th	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
,	NULL
1913	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
absolute	NULL
ignorance	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
assure	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
perfect	NULL
happiness	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
coming	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
dear	NULL
girl	NULL
only	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
that	NULL
4th	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lounge	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
odious	NULL
Englishman	NULL
called	NULL
Bagshawe	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
arrived	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL
for	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
Florence	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
concert	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Casino	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
gone	NULL
there	NULL
all	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

Florence	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
remain	NULL
with	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
off	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
Florence	NULL
with	NULL
perfect	NULL
calmness	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
appearance	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
chaperoned	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
places	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
has	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

So	NULL
Florence	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
light	NULL
step	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
slipped	NULL
out	NULL
after	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
black	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
cousin	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

Americans	NULL
are	NULL
particular	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
matters	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
on	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lounge	NULL
till	NULL
towards	NULL
ten	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
hot	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
cool	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
man	NULL
called	NULL
Bagshawe	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
reading	NULL
The	NULL
Times	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
moved	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
trifling	NULL
question	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
prelude	NULL
to	NULL
suggesting	NULL
an	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
fancy	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
me	NULL
something	NULL
About	NULL
the	NULL
poll-tax	NULL
on	NULL
Kur-guests	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
sneaked	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
person	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
unmistakable	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
military	NULL
figure	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
exaggerated	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
bulbous	NULL
eyes	NULL
that	NULL
avoided	NULL
your	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
pallid	NULL
complexion	NULL
that	NULL
suggested	NULL
vices	NULL
practised	NULL
in	NULL
secret	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
uneasy	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
making	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
at	NULL
whatever	NULL
cost	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
filthy	NULL
toad	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
by	NULL
telling	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
Ludlow	NULL
Manor	NULL
,	NULL
near	NULL
Ledbury	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
name	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
slightly	NULL
familiar	NULL
sound	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
fix	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
duty	NULL
on	NULL
hops	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
Californian	NULL
hops	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
Los	NULL
Angeles	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
fencing	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
topic	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
gain	NULL
my	NULL
affection	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bright	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
Florence	NULL
running	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
Florence	NULL
running	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
face	NULL
whiter	NULL
than	NULL
paper	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
stuff	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
heart	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
move	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
rushed	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
swing	NULL
doors	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
that	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
rush	NULL
chairs	NULL
,	NULL
cane	NULL
tables	NULL
and	NULL
newspapers	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
me	NULL
and	NULL
opened	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stuck	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
push	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
there	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
move	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
stir	NULL
a	NULL
finger	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
man	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
By	NULL
Jove	NULL
:	NULL
Florry	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
upon	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
oily	NULL
and	NULL
uneasy	NULL
sound	NULL
meant	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
laugh	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
ingratiate	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
who	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
last	NULL
time	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
girl	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bedroom	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
called	NULL
Jimmy	NULL
at	NULL
five	NULL
o'clock	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
my	NULL
house	NULL
at	NULL
Ledbury	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
recognize	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
gurgle	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
stuttered	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
....	NULL
"	NULL
Those	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
words	NULL
I	NULL
ever	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Bagshawe	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
afterwards	NULL
I	NULL
pulled	NULL
myself	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lounge	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
locked	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
married	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
respectably	NULL
arranged	NULL
,	NULL
unlike	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
phial	NULL
that	NULL
rightly	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
contained	NULL
nitrate	NULL
of	NULL
amyl	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
right	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
4th	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
,	NULL
1913	NULL
.	NULL

PART	NULL
III	NULL
I	NULL
THE	NULL
odd	NULL
thing	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
sticks	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
recollection	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
was	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
saying	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Of	NULL
course	NULL
you	NULL
might	NULL
marry	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
asked	NULL
whom	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Now	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
amazing	NULL
thing	NULL
--	NULL
amazing	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
possibilities	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
casts	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
human	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
conscious	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
marrying	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
idea	NULL
even	NULL
of	NULL
caring	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
talked	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
odd	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
people	NULL
do	NULL
who	NULL
are	NULL
recovering	NULL
from	NULL
an	NULL
anaesthetic	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
dual	NULL
personality	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
I	NULL
being	NULL
entirely	NULL
unconscious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
nothing	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
analysis	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
psychology	NULL
matters	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
story	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
enough	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
odd	NULL
remark	NULL
of	NULL
mine	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
influence	NULL
upon	NULL
what	NULL
came	NULL
after	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
mean	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
relations	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
hours	NULL
after	NULL
my	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Now	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
marry	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
taken	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
granted	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
suffering	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
suffering	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
permitted	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
permitted	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
funeral	NULL
of	NULL
poor	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
natural	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
talking	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
duration	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
stay	NULL
at	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
clear	NULL
,	NULL
reflective	NULL
intonation	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
stop	NULL
here	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
and	NULL
ever	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
added	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
brother	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
counsellor	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
support	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
are	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
consolation	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL
odd	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
your	NULL
wife	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
been	NULL
my	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
mistress	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
here	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
--	NULL
full	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
say	NULL
anything	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
suppose	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
unless	NULL
maybe	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
mysterious	NULL
and	NULL
unconscious	NULL
self	NULL
that	NULL
underlies	NULL
most	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
unconscious	NULL
or	NULL
walking	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
sleep	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
spit	NULL
upon	NULL
poor	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
grave	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seems	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
unlikely	NULL
thing	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
no	NULL
emotion	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
sort	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
clear	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
has	NULL
from	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
one	NULL
hears	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
Mrs	NULL
So-and-So	NULL
is	NULL
au	NULL
mieux	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
gentleman	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
made	NULL
things	NULL
plainer	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
curiosity	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
windy	NULL
November	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
unexplained	NULL
things	NULL
would	NULL
fit	NULL
themselves	NULL
into	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
thinking	NULL
things	NULL
over	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
distinctly	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
sitting	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
stiffly	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
arm-chair	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
is	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
twilight	NULL
.	NULL

Branshaw	NULL
Manor	NULL
lies	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
hollow	NULL
with	NULL
lawns	NULL
across	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
pine-woods	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
fringe	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dip	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
immense	NULL
wind	NULL
,	NULL
coming	NULL
from	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
forest	NULL
,	NULL
roared	NULL
overhead	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
view	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
quiet	NULL
and	NULL
grey	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
stirred	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
rabbits	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
extreme	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lawn	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
own	NULL
little	NULL
study	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
tea	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
brought	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
deep	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
twirling	NULL
the	NULL
wooden	NULL
acorn	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window-blind	NULL
cord	NULL
desultorily	NULL
round	NULL
and	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
lawn	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
remember	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Edward	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
dead	NULL
only	NULL
ten	NULL
days	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
rabbits	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
lawn	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
rabbits	NULL
do	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
harm	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
short	NULL
grass	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
adornment	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
her	NULL
exact	NULL
words	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
stupid	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
to	NULL
commit	NULL
suicide	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
the	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
leisure	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
two	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
train	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
meal	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
extreme	NULL
stillness	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
remote	NULL
and	NULL
intermittent	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
grey	NULL
light	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
brown	NULL
,	NULL
small	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
nothing	NULL
else	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
knew	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
full	NULL
confidence	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
no	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
actual	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
--	NULL
Leonora	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
odd	NULL
English	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
decency	NULL
had	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
until	NULL
Edward	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
grave	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
full	NULL
week	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
vague	NULL
motive	NULL
of	NULL
giving	NULL
her	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
extent	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
permit	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
confidences	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
slowly	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
these	NULL
words	NULL
too	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
with	NULL
exactitude	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Did	NULL
Florence	NULL
commit	NULL
suicide	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
wider	NULL
range	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
before	NULL
thought	NULL
necessary	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
knowledge	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
committed	NULL
suicide	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
entered	NULL
my	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
may	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
singularly	NULL
lacking	NULL
in	NULL
suspiciousness	NULL
;	NULL
you	NULL
may	NULL
consider	NULL
me	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
an	NULL
imbecile	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
consider	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
such	NULL
circumstances	NULL
of	NULL
clamour	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
outcry	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
crash	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
people	NULL
running	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
professional	NULL
reticence	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
people	NULL
as	NULL
hotel-keepers	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
traditional	NULL
reticence	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
"	NULL
good	NULL
people	NULL
"	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
circumstances	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
some	NULL
little	NULL
material	NULL
object	NULL
,	NULL
always	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
catches	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
appeals	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
imagination	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
possible	NULL
guide	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
suicide	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
flask	NULL
of	NULL
nitrate	NULL
of	NULL
amyl	NULL
in	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
hand	NULL
suggested	NULL
instantly	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
failure	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

Nitrate	NULL
of	NULL
amyl	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
drug	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
relieve	NULL
sufferers	NULL
from	NULL
angina	NULL
pectoris	NULL
.	NULL

Seeing	NULL
Florence	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
running	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
hand	NULL
held	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seeing	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
immediately	NULL
afterwards	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
lying	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
bed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
so	NULL
familiar	NULL
little	NULL
brown	NULL
flask	NULL
clenched	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
fingers	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
frame	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
happened	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
without	NULL
her	NULL
remedy	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
felt	NULL
an	NULL
attack	NULL
coming	NULL
on	NULL
whilst	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
gardens	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
run	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
nitrate	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
quickly	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
obtain	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
equally	NULL
inevitable	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
should	NULL
frame	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
the	NULL
strain	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
running	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
broken	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
married	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
little	NULL
brown	NULL
flask	NULL
had	NULL
contained	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
nitrate	NULL
of	NULL
amyl	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
prussic	NULL
acid	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
inconceivable	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
more	NULL
intimate	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
inkling	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
just	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
dropped	NULL
dead	NULL
of	NULL
heart	NULL
disease	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
fancy	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
ever	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
committed	NULL
suicide	NULL
were	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Grand	NULL
Duke	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
police	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
hotel-keeper	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
mention	NULL
these	NULL
last	NULL
three	NULL
because	NULL
my	NULL
recollection	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
pinkish	NULL
effulgence	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
electric-lamps	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL
lounge	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
bob	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
consciousness	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
floating	NULL
globes	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
faces	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
three	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
bearded	NULL
,	NULL
monarchical	NULL
,	NULL
benevolent	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Grand	NULL
Duke	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
sharp-featured	NULL
,	NULL
brown	NULL
,	NULL
cavalry-moustached	NULL
feature	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chief	NULL
of	NULL
police	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
globular	NULL
,	NULL
polished	NULL
and	NULL
high-collared	NULL
vacuousness	NULL
that	NULL
represented	NULL
Monsieur	NULL
Schontz	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
proprietor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
times	NULL
one	NULL
head	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
there	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
another	NULL
the	NULL
spiked	NULL
helmet	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
official	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
healthy	NULL
baldness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
prince	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
M.	NULL
Schontz	NULL
's	NULL
oiled	NULL
locks	NULL
would	NULL
push	NULL
in	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sovereign	NULL
's	NULL
soft	NULL
,	NULL
exquisitely	NULL
trained	NULL
voice	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Ja	NULL
,	NULL
ja	NULL
,	NULL
ja	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

each	NULL
word	NULL
dropping	NULL
out	NULL
like	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
soft	NULL
pellets	NULL
of	NULL
suet	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
subdued	NULL
rasp	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
official	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Zum	NULL
Befehl	NULL
Durchlaucht	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
like	NULL
five	NULL
revolver-shots	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
of	NULL
M.	NULL
Schontz	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
under	NULL
its	NULL
breath	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
unclean	NULL
priest	NULL
reciting	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
breviary	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
railway-carriage	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
presented	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
no	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
even	NULL
addressed	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
all	NULL
three	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
stood	NULL
between	NULL
me	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
titular	NULL
possessor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
corpse	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
present	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
conferences	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
alone	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
nothing	NULL
;	NULL
absolutely	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
ideas	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
strength	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
felt	NULL
no	NULL
sorrow	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
action	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
inclination	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
upstairs	NULL
and	NULL
fall	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
just	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
pink	NULL
effulgence	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
cane	NULL
tables	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
palms	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
globular	NULL
match-holders	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
indented	NULL
ash-trays	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Leonora	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
appears	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
addressed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
singular	NULL
remark	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Now	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
marry	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
you	NULL
absolutely	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
recollection	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
recollection	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
succeeding	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
just	NULL
simply	NULL
cataleptic	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
put	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
stayed	NULL
there	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
brought	NULL
me	NULL
my	NULL
clothes	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
dressed	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
led	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
open	NULL
grave	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
stood	NULL
beside	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
river	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
flung	NULL
me	NULL
beneath	NULL
a	NULL
railway	NULL
train	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
drowned	NULL
or	NULL
mangled	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
spirit	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
walking	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
those	NULL
are	NULL
my	NULL
impressions	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
had	NULL
actually	NULL
happened	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
pieced	NULL
it	NULL
together	NULL
afterwards	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
will	NULL
remember	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
concert	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Casino	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
Florence	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
immediately	NULL
after	NULL
their	NULL
departure	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
perform	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
of	NULL
chaperone	NULL
.	NULL

Florence	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
may	NULL
also	NULL
remember	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
black	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
mourning	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
wore	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
deceased	NULL
cousin	NULL
,	NULL
Jean	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
black	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
dressed	NULL
in	NULL
cream-coloured	NULL
muslin	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
glimmered	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
tall	NULL
trees	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
park	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
phosphorescent	NULL
fish	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cupboard	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
beacon	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
appears	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
led	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
not	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
straight	NULL
allée	NULL
that	NULL
leads	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Casino	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
trees	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
park	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
final	NULL
outburst	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
told	NULL
you	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
that	NULL
occasion	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
deucedly	NULL
vocal	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
pump	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
any	NULL
motive	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
connect	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
fellow	NULL
talked	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
cheap	NULL
novelist	NULL
.	NULL

--	NULL
Or	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
novelist	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
business	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
novelist	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
you	NULL
see	NULL
things	NULL
clearly	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
I	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
thing	NULL
as	NULL
clearly	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL
that	NULL
never	NULL
left	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
appears	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Casino	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
public	NULL
bench	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lights	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
entertainment	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
reached	NULL
them	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
tree-trunks	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
quite	NULL
plainly	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
beloved	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
forehead	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
queer	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
tortured	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
direct	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
to	NULL
Florence	NULL
,	NULL
creeping	NULL
up	NULL
behind	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
presented	NULL
the	NULL
appearance	NULL
of	NULL
silhouettes	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
I	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
came	NULL
creeping	NULL
up	NULL
behind	NULL
them	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
short	NULL
grass	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
tree	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
quite	NULL
well	NULL
remember	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
immediately	NULL
behind	NULL
that	NULL
public	NULL
seat	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
difficult	NULL
feat	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
instinct	NULL
with	NULL
jealousy	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Casino	NULL
orchestra	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Edward	NULL
remembered	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
playing	NULL
the	NULL
Rakocsy	NULL
march	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
although	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
loud	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
distance	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
drown	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
audible	NULL
to	NULL
efface	NULL
,	NULL
amongst	NULL
the	NULL
noises	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
slight	NULL
brushings	NULL
and	NULL
rustlings	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
feet	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
or	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
gown	NULL
in	NULL
coming	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
short	NULL
grass	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
miserable	NULL
woman	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
good	NULL
and	NULL
strong	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
horrible	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Horrible	NULL
!	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
she	NULL
deserved	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
picture	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
immensely	NULL
tall	NULL
trees	NULL
,	NULL
elms	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
towering	NULL
and	NULL
feathering	NULL
away	NULL
up	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
mistiness	NULL
that	NULL
trees	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
gather	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
silhouettes	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
seat	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
beams	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
coming	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Casino	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
black	NULL
peeping	NULL
with	NULL
fear	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
tree-trunk	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
melodrama	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
appears	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
assured	NULL
me	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
see	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
disbelieving	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
until	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL
whatever	NULL
of	NULL
caring	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
regarded	NULL
her	NULL
exactly	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
regarded	NULL
a	NULL
daughter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
certainly	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
deep	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
tender	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
tranquil	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
missed	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
convent-school	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
glad	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
returned	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
of	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
totally	NULL
unconscious	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
he	NULL
been	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
assured	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
fled	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
accursed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
realized	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
outrage	NULL
upon	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
point	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
entire	NULL
unconsciousness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
that	NULL
dark	NULL
park	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
quickening	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pulse	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
intimacy	NULL
of	NULL
solitude	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
intending	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
polo-ponies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tennis-racquets	NULL
;	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
temperament	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
reverend	NULL
Mother	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
convent	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
and	NULL
about	NULL
whether	NULL
her	NULL
frock	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
party	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
home	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
white	NULL
or	NULL
blue	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
always	NULL
talked	NULL
about	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
tabu	NULL
which	NULL
extended	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
inviolable	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
--	NULL
He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
careful	NULL
to	NULL
assure	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
physical	NULL
motive	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
declaration	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
appear	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
propinquity	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
simply	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
effect	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
moral	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
appears	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
talked	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
notion	NULL
to	NULL
enfold	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
touch	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
swore	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
touch	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
sat	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bench	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
leaning	NULL
slightly	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
looking	NULL
straight	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Casino	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
illuminated	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
lamps	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
expression	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
describe	NULL
as	NULL
"	NULL
queer	NULL
"	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
another	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
appear	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
happening	NULL
.	NULL

Frankly	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
adored	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
everything	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
model	NULL
of	NULL
humanity	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
hero	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
athlete	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
father	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
country	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
law-giver	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
intimately	NULL
and	NULL
overwhelmingly	NULL
praised	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
for	NULL
mere	NULL
gladness	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
overwhelming	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
god	NULL
had	NULL
approved	NULL
her	NULL
handiwork	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
king	NULL
her	NULL
loyalty	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
just	NULL
sat	NULL
still	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
,	NULL
smiling	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
bitterness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
childhood	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
terrors	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
tempestuous	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
bewailings	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
cruel-tongued	NULL
mother	NULL
were	NULL
suddenly	NULL
atoned	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
recompense	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

Because	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
figure	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
pouring	NULL
forth	NULL
of	NULL
passion	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
whom	NULL
you	NULL
regard	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
cross	NULL
between	NULL
a	NULL
pastor	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
father	NULL
might	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
aspect	NULL
of	NULL
mere	NULL
praise	NULL
for	NULL
good	NULL
conduct	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
,	NULL
appear	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
gain	NULL
possession	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
regarded	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
firmly	NULL
anchored	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
inkling	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
infidelities	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
in	NULL
terms	NULL
of	NULL
reverence	NULL
and	NULL
deep	NULL
affection	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
regarded	NULL
Leonora	NULL
as	NULL
absolutely	NULL
impeccable	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
absolutely	NULL
satisfying	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
union	NULL
had	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
blessed	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
are	NULL
spoken	NULL
of	NULL
and	NULL
contemplated	NULL
with	NULL
reverence	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
church	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
person	NULL
he	NULL
cared	NULL
most	NULL
for	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
naturally	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
except	NULL
Leonora	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
glad	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
father	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
approved	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
marriageable	NULL
daughter	NULL
...	NULL
And	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
realized	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
,	NULL
curbed	NULL
his	NULL
tongue	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
glad	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
being	NULL
just	NULL
glad	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
monstrously	NULL
wicked	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
ever	NULL
did	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
so	NULL
near	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
people	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
wicked	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
impossible	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
as	NULL
anything	NULL
but	NULL
straight	NULL
,	NULL
upright	NULL
and	NULL
honourable	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
everything	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
permanent	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
try	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
by	NULL
dwelling	NULL
on	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
to	NULL
push	NULL
that	NULL
image	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
might	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
push	NULL
aside	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
pendulum	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
always	NULL
comes	NULL
back	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
memory	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
innumerable	NULL
acts	NULL
of	NULL
kindness	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
efficiency	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
unspiteful	NULL
tongue	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
fellow	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
I	NULL
feel	NULL
myself	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
excuse	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
monstrous	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
corrupt	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
girl	NULL
just	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
convent	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
Edward	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
corrupting	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
simply	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
too	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
woman	NULL
he	NULL
ever	NULL
really	NULL
loved	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
prove	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
knew	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cynic	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
matters	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
permanence	NULL
of	NULL
man	NULL

Or	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL

it	NULL
is	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
permanence	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
early	NULL
passion	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
regard	NULL
to	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
love	NULL
affair	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
definite	NULL
woman	NULL
--	NULL
is	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
widening	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
experience	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
each	NULL
new	NULL
woman	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
is	NULL
attracted	NULL
to	NULL
there	NULL
appears	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
a	NULL
broadening	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
outlook	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
like	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
acquiring	NULL
of	NULL
new	NULL
territory	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
turn	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
eyebrow	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
tone	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
characteristic	NULL
gesture	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
cause	NULL
to	NULL
arise	NULL
the	NULL
passion	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
are	NULL
like	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
objects	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
horizon	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
landscape	NULL
that	NULL
tempt	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
horizon	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
explore	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wants	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
behind	NULL
those	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
peculiar	NULL
turn	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
desired	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
overshadow	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wants	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
that	NULL
voice	NULL
applying	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
every	NULL
possible	NULL
proposition	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
every	NULL

;	NULL
he	NULL
wants	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
those	NULL
characteristic	NULL
gestures	NULL
against	NULL
every	NULL
possible	NULL
background	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sex-instinct	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
counts	NULL
for	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
really	NULL
great	NULL
passion	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
aroused	NULL
by	NULL
such	NULL
nothings	NULL
--	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
untied	NULL
shoelace	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
in	NULL
passing	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
left	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
calculation	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
great	NULL
passion	NULL
can	NULL
exist	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
consummation	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
seems	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
commonplace	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
therefore	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
needing	NULL
no	NULL
comment	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
its	NULL
accidents	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
for	NULL
granted	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
novel	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
biography	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
granted	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
characters	NULL
have	NULL
their	NULL
meals	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
regularity	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
fierceness	NULL
of	NULL
desire	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
heat	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
long	NULL
continued	NULL
and	NULL
withering	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
craving	NULL
for	NULL
identity	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
loves	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
desires	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
touch	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
touch	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
ears	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
lose	NULL
his	NULL
identity	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
enveloped	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
supported	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
whatever	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
relation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sexes	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
loves	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
that	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
renewal	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
courage	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
cutting	NULL
asunder	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
difficulties	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
mainspring	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
are	NULL
all	NULL
so	NULL
afraid	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
all	NULL
so	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
all	NULL
so	NULL
need	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
assurance	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
own	NULL
worthiness	NULL
to	NULL
exist	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
fruition	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
will	NULL
get	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wants	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
will	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
moral	NULL
support	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
encouragement	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
relief	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
loneliness	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
assurance	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
worth	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
pass	NULL
away	NULL
;	NULL
inevitably	NULL
they	NULL
pass	NULL
away	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
shadows	NULL
pass	NULL
across	NULL
sundials	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
sad	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pages	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
book	NULL
will	NULL
become	NULL
familiar	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
will	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
turned	NULL
too	NULL
many	NULL
times	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
saddest	NULL
story	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
every	NULL
man	NULL
there	NULL
comes	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
no	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
formulating	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
every	NULL
man	NULL
there	NULL
comes	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
then	NULL
sets	NULL
her	NULL
seal	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
has	NULL
set	NULL
her	NULL
seal	NULL
for	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
will	NULL
travel	NULL
over	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
horizons	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
never	NULL
again	NULL
set	NULL
the	NULL
knapsack	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
retire	NULL
from	NULL
those	NULL
scenes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
will	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
literally	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
literally	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
passions	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
mistress	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Grand	NULL
Duke	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
little	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Florence	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
whom	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
--	NULL
these	NULL
passions	NULL
were	NULL
merely	NULL
preliminary	NULL
canters	NULL
compared	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
final	NULL
race	NULL
with	NULL
death	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
certain	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
American	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
true	NULL
love	NULL
demands	NULL
some	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
love	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
truer	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
permanent	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
self-sacrifice	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
exacted	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
just	NULL
cut	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
cut	NULL
them	NULL
out	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
polo-ball	NULL
from	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
nose	NULL
of	NULL
Count	NULL
Baron	NULL
von	NULL
Lelöffel	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
wear	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
thin	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
lath	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
endeavour	NULL
to	NULL
capture	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
women	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
wore	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
rags	NULL
and	NULL
tatters	NULL
and	NULL
death	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
effort	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
her	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
speaking	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
convinced	NULL
,	NULL
committing	NULL
a	NULL
baseness	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
existed	NULL
;	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
words	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
knowing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
created	NULL
the	NULL
passion	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
along	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
;	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
integral	NULL
fact	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
get	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
story	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
my	NULL
story	NULL
was	NULL
concerning	NULL
itself	NULL
with	NULL
Florence	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
Florence	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
heard	NULL
those	NULL
words	NULL
from	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
tree	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
conjecture	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
the	NULL
conjecture	NULL
is	NULL
pretty	NULL
well	NULL
justified	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
followed	NULL
them	NULL
almost	NULL
immediately	NULL
afterwards	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
running	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
pallid	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
clutching	NULL
her	NULL
dress	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
only	NULL
Bagshawe	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
contorted	NULL
with	NULL
agony	NULL
before	NULL
ever	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
me	NULL
or	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
beside	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
dare	NULL
say	NULL
Bagshawe	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
determining	NULL
influence	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
suicide	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
says	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
that	NULL
flask	NULL
,	NULL
apparently	NULL
of	NULL
nitrate	NULL
of	NULL
amyl	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
actually	NULL
of	NULL
prussic	NULL
acid	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
it	NULL
if	NULL
ever	NULL
I	NULL
discovered	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
relationship	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
fellow	NULL
Jimmy	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
mainspring	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
nature	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
vanity	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
guess	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
vanity	NULL
that	NULL
makes	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
keep	NULL
straight	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
do	NULL
keep	NULL
straight	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
merely	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
relations	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
I	NULL
dare	NULL
say	NULL
Florence	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
faced	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
scenes	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
threatened	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
humour	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
promises	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Mr	NULL
Bagshawe	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
date	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
4th	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
superstitious	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
two	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
lady	NULL
,	NULL
installed	NULL
in	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
Teleragh	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
also	NULL
to	NULL
retain	NULL
my	NULL
respect	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
retain	NULL
my	NULL
respect	NULL
for	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
lived	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
persuaded	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
to	NULL
bolt	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
thing	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
run	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
exact	NULL
from	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
respect	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
greatness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
passion	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
lines	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
for	NULL
love	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
well	NULL
lost	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
just	NULL
like	NULL
Florence	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
all	NULL
matrimonial	NULL
associations	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
constant	NULL
factor	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
deceive	NULL
the	NULL
person	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
one	NULL
lives	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
weak	NULL
spot	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
character	NULL
or	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
career	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
intolerable	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
constantly	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
human	NULL
being	NULL
who	NULL
perceives	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
small	NULL
meannesses	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
really	NULL
death	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
why	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
marriages	NULL
turn	NULL
out	NULL
unhappily	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
instance	NULL
,	NULL
am	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
greedy	NULL
man	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
taste	NULL
for	NULL
good	NULL
cookery	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
watering	NULL
tooth	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
mere	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
names	NULL
of	NULL
certain	NULL
comestibles	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
discovered	NULL
this	NULL
secret	NULL
of	NULL
mine	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
unbearable	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
supported	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
privations	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
régime	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
extracted	NULL
from	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
never	NULL
discovered	NULL
this	NULL
secret	NULL
.	NULL

Certainly	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
alluded	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
dare	NULL
say	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
took	NULL
sufficient	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
secret	NULL
weakness	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
weakness	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
me	NULL
discover	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
that	NULL
early	NULL
escapade	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
fellow	NULL
called	NULL
Jimmy	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
probability	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
time	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
mention	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
dwell	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
psychology	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
minded	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
mistress	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
rather	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
chief	NULL
trouble	NULL
of	NULL
poor	NULL
Leonora	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
days	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
Florence	NULL
from	NULL
making	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
theatrical	NULL
displays	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
line	NULL
or	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL
fact	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
mood	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
rushing	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
cast	NULL
herself	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
knees	NULL
at	NULL
my	NULL
feet	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
declaim	NULL
a	NULL
carefully	NULL
arranged	NULL
,	NULL
frightfully	NULL
emotional	NULL
,	NULL
outpouring	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
passion	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
erotic	NULL
women	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
history	NULL
tells	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
another	NULL
mood	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
disdainfully	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
considerably	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
must	NULL
happen	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
male	NULL
came	NULL
along	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
cool	NULL
,	NULL
balanced	NULL
and	NULL
sarcastic	NULL
sentences	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
appear	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
heroine	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
French	NULL
comedy	NULL
.	NULL

Because	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
play	NULL
acting	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
escapade	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
fellow	NULL
called	NULL
Jimmy	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
figuring	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
low-down	NULL
Bowery	NULL
tough	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
fellow	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

Do	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
shudder	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
later	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
small	NULL
,	NULL
stupid	NULL
action	NULL
--	NULL
usually	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
small	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
genuine	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
emotionalism	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
your	NULL
early	NULL
life	NULL
?	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
shuddering	NULL
that	NULL
came	NULL
over	NULL
Florence	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
surrendered	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
fellow	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
need	NULL
have	NULL
shuddered	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
footling	NULL
old	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
together	NULL
and	NULL
shut	NULL
himself	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
cabin	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Bagshawe	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Bagshawe	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
and	NULL
toadlike	NULL
personality	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Bagshawe	NULL
would	NULL
almost	NULL
certainly	NULL
reveal	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
caught	NULL
her	NULL
coming	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
Jimmy	NULL
's	NULL
bedroom	NULL
at	NULL
five	NULL
o'clock	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
4th	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
,	NULL
1900	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
determining	NULL
influence	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
suicide	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
date	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
superstitious	NULL
personality	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
born	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
4th	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
4th	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
fellow	NULL
's	NULL
mistress	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
4th	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
me	NULL
;	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
4th	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Bagshawe	NULL
had	NULL
appeared	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
sinister	NULL
omen	NULL
--	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
grin	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
Fate	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
straw	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
ran	NULL
upstairs	NULL
,	NULL
arranged	NULL
herself	NULL
decoratively	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
bed	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sweetly	NULL
pretty	NULL
woman	NULL
with	NULL
smooth	NULL
pink	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
cheeks	NULL
,	NULL
long	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
eyelashes	NULL
falling	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
tiny	NULL
curtain	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
drank	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
phial	NULL
of	NULL
prussic	NULL
acid	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
she	NULL
lay	NULL
.	NULL

--	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
extremely	NULL
charming	NULL
and	NULL
clear-cut	NULL
--	NULL
looking	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
puzzled	NULL
expression	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
electric-light	NULL
bulb	NULL
that	NULL
hung	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
ceiling	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
perhaps	NULL
through	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
stars	NULL
above	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
knows	NULL
?	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL
how	NULL
quite	NULL
extraordinarily	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
another	NULL
thought	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
not	NULL
bestowed	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
when	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
purpose	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
writings	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
figure	NULL
her	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
do	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
problem	NULL
in	NULL
algebra	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
has	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
for	NULL
study	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
remembrance	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
just	NULL
went	NULL
completely	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
existence	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
yesterday	NULL
's	NULL
paper	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
deadly	NULL
tired	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
dare	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
week	NULL
or	NULL
ten	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
affaissement	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
practically	NULL
catalepsy	NULL
--	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
repose	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
exhausted	NULL
nature	NULL
claimed	NULL
after	NULL
twelve	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
repression	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
instincts	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
twelve	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
playing	NULL
the	NULL
trained	NULL
poodle	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
shock	NULL
that	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
several	NULL
shocks	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
unwilling	NULL
to	NULL
attribute	NULL
my	NULL
feelings	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
anything	NULL
so	NULL
concrete	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
shock	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
so	NULL
tranquil	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
an	NULL
immensely	NULL
heavy	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
unbearably	NULL
heavy	NULL
knapsack	NULL
,	NULL
supported	NULL
upon	NULL
my	NULL
shoulders	NULL
by	NULL
straps	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
off	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
my	NULL
shoulders	NULL
themselves	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
straps	NULL
had	NULL
cut	NULL
into	NULL
,	NULL
numb	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
sensation	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
regret	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
had	NULL
I	NULL
to	NULL
regret	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
inner	NULL
soul	NULL
--	NULL
my	NULL
dual	NULL
personality	NULL
--	NULL
had	NULL
realized	NULL
long	NULL
before	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
personality	NULL
of	NULL
paper	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
represented	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
human	NULL
being	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
feelings	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
sympathies	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
emotions	NULL
only	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
bank-note	NULL
represents	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
quantity	NULL
of	NULL
gold	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
feeling	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
surface	NULL
in	NULL
me	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
Bagshawe	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
coming	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
fellow	NULL
's	NULL
bedroom	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
thought	NULL
suddenly	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
real	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
talk	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
guidebooks	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
drawings	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
fashion-plates	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
even	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
that	NULL
feeling	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
possessed	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
run	NULL
up	NULL
sooner	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
prevented	NULL
her	NULL
drinking	NULL
the	NULL
prussic	NULL
acid	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
just	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
like	NULL
chasing	NULL
a	NULL
scrap	NULL
of	NULL
paper	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
occupation	NULL
ignoble	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
grown	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
began	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
matter	NULL
has	NULL
remained	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
care	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
bedroom	NULL
or	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
simply	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
interest	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

Florence	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
retort	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
Nancy	NULL
Rufford	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
indifference	NULL
was	NULL
therefore	NULL
discreditable	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
seeking	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
discredit	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
Nancy	NULL
Rufford	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
child	NULL
's	NULL
memory	NULL
,	NULL
quietly	NULL
and	NULL
quite	NULL
tenderly	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
American	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
thought	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
until	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
Leonora	NULL
state	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
now	NULL
marry	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
until	NULL
her	NULL
worse	NULL
than	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
much	NULL
thought	NULL
about	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
sighed	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
or	NULL
groaned	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
just	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
some	NULL
people	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Carcassonne	NULL
.	NULL

Do	NULL
you	NULL
understand	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
get	NULL
certain	NULL
matters	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
smooth	NULL
out	NULL
certain	NULL
fairly	NULL
negligible	NULL
complications	NULL
before	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
that	NULL
has	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
all	NULL
your	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
dream	NULL
city	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
attach	NULL
much	NULL
importance	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
superior	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
forty-five	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
just	NULL
rising	NULL
twenty-two	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
her	NULL
years	NULL
and	NULL
quieter	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
odd	NULL
quality	NULL
of	NULL
sainthood	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
inevitably	NULL
end	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
convent	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
coif	NULL
framing	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
frequently	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
vocation	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
just	NULL
simply	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
there	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
nun	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
guess	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
convent	NULL
myself	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
fairly	NULL
proper	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
vows	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
see	NULL
any	NULL
impediment	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
score	NULL
of	NULL
age	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
dare	NULL
say	NULL
no	NULL
man	NULL
does	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
pretty	NULL
confident	NULL
that	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
preparation	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
girl	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
spoil	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
few	NULL
young	NULL
girls	NULL
have	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
spoiled	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
regard	NULL
myself	NULL
as	NULL
personally	NULL
repulsive	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
man	NULL
can	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
ever	NULL
comes	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
catalepsy	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
perceive	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
problem	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
to	NULL
prepare	NULL
myself	NULL
for	NULL
getting	NULL
into	NULL
contact	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
contact	NULL
with	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
kept	NULL
for	NULL
twelve	NULL
years	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
rarefied	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
;	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
then	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
fighting	NULL
with	NULL
real	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
wrestling	NULL
with	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
travelling	NULL
amongst	NULL
larger	NULL
cities	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
harsh	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
masculine	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
present	NULL
myself	NULL
to	NULL
Nancy	NULL
Rufford	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
maid	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
after	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
suicide	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
set	NULL
off	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
United	NULL
States	NULL
.	NULL

II	NULL
IMMEDIATELY	NULL
after	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
Leonora	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
leash	NULL
upon	NULL
Nancy	NULL
Rufford	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
guessed	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
Casino	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
stayed	NULL
at	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
some	NULL
weeks	NULL
after	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
has	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
deadly	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
existence	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
silent	NULL
duel	NULL
with	NULL
invisible	NULL
weapons	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
rendered	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
difficult	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
entire	NULL
innocence	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
Nancy	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
off	NULL
alone	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
doing	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
whenever	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
home	NULL
for	NULL
holidays	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
just	NULL
wanted	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
nice	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
was	NULL
extremely	NULL
complicated	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
complicated	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
well	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
along	NULL
delicate	NULL
lines	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
complication	NULL
caused	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
never	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
except	NULL
when	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
present	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
demeanours	NULL
were	NULL
quite	NULL
perfect	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
complication	NULL
caused	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
entire	NULL
innocence	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
further	NULL
complication	NULL
that	NULL
both	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
really	NULL
regarded	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
as	NULL
their	NULL
daughter	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
precise	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
regarded	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
being	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
daughter	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Nancy	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
girl	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
describe	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
tall	NULL
and	NULL
strikingly	NULL
thin	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
tortured	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
agonized	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
quite	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
fun	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
grotesque	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
extraordinarily	NULL
beautiful	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
heaviest	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
black	NULL
hair	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
ever	NULL
come	NULL
across	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
wonder	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
bear	NULL
the	NULL
weight	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
over	NULL
twenty-one	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
old	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
hills	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
sixteen	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
one	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
talking	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lives	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
saints	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
tumbling	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
lawn	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
St	NULL
Bernard	NULL
puppy	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
ride	NULL
to	NULL
hounds	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
Maenad	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
sit	NULL
for	NULL
hours	NULL
perfectly	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
steeping	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
after	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
in	NULL
vinegar	NULL
when	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
headaches	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
miracle	NULL
of	NULL
patience	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
almost	NULL
miraculously	NULL
impatient	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
convent	NULL
training	NULL
that	NULL
effected	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
letters	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
sixteen	NULL
,	NULL
ran	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
On	NULL
Corpus	NULL
Christi	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
saint	NULL
's	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
keep	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
head	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
our	NULL
school	NULL
played	NULL
Roehampton	NULL
at	NULL
Hockey	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
that	NULL
our	NULL
side	NULL
was	NULL
losing	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
three	NULL
goals	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
against	NULL
us	NULL
at	NULL
halftime	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
retired	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
chapel	NULL
and	NULL
prayed	NULL
for	NULL
victory	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
won	NULL
by	NULL
five	NULL
goals	NULL
to	NULL
three	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
describe	NULL
afterwards	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
saturnalia	NULL
.	NULL

Apparently	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
victorious	NULL
fifteen	NULL
or	NULL
eleven	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
refectory	NULL
for	NULL
supper	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
school	NULL
jumped	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
tables	NULL
and	NULL
cheered	NULL
and	NULL
broke	NULL
the	NULL
chairs	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
and	NULL
smashed	NULL
the	NULL
crockery	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
given	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
Reverend	NULL
Mother	NULL
rang	NULL
a	NULL
hand-bell	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
is	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
the	NULL
Catholic	NULL
tradition	NULL
--	NULL
saturnalia	NULL
that	NULL
can	NULL
end	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
crack	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
whip	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
tradition	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
Nancy	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
Nancy	NULL
had	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
rectitude	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
surpassed	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
knife	NULL
that	NULL
looked	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
spoke	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
positively	NULL
frightened	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
afraid	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
world	NULL
where	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
fine	NULL
a	NULL
standard	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
fifteen	NULL
or	NULL
sixteen	NULL
on	NULL
going	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
convent	NULL
I	NULL
once	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
English	NULL
sovereigns	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
tip	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thanked	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
peculiarly	NULL
heartfelt	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
extremely	NULL
handy	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
why	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
explained	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
rule	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
pupils	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
chapel	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
refectory	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
this	NULL
rule	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
idiotic	NULL
and	NULL
arbitrary	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
broke	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
purpose	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
asked	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
committed	NULL
any	NULL
faults	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
evening	NULL
Nancy	NULL
confessed	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
broken	NULL
this	NULL
particular	NULL
rule	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
cost	NULL
her	NULL
sixpence	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
fine	NULL
attached	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
offence	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
information	NULL
I	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
always	NULL
confessed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
exact	NULL
words	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Holy	NULL
Child	NULL
have	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
noted	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
truthfulness	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
beastly	NULL
bore	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
dare	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
miserable	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
childhood	NULL
,	NULL
coming	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
mixture	NULL
of	NULL
saturnalia	NULL
and	NULL
discipline	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
convent	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
added	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
queernesses	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
father	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
violent	NULL
madman	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
major	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
are	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
Highland	NULL
regiments	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
drink	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
ungovernable	NULL
temper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
Nancy	NULL
could	NULL
remember	NULL
was	NULL
seeing	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
strike	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
clenched	NULL
fist	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
fell	NULL
over	NULL
sideways	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
breakfast-table	NULL
and	NULL
lay	NULL
motionless	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
mother	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
an	NULL
irritating	NULL
woman	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
privates	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
regiment	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
irritating	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
outcries	NULL
and	NULL
perpetual	NULL
disturbances	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Rufford	NULL
was	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
dearest	NULL
friend	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
cutting	NULL
enough	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
fancy	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Rufford	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Major	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
lunch	NULL
harassed	NULL
and	NULL
already	NULL
spitting	NULL
out	NULL
oaths	NULL
after	NULL
an	NULL
unsatisfactory	NULL
morning	NULL
's	NULL
drilling	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
stubborn	NULL
men	NULL
beneath	NULL
a	NULL
hot	NULL
sun	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Rufford	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
some	NULL
cutting	NULL
remark	NULL
and	NULL
pandemonium	NULL
would	NULL
break	NULL
loose	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
about	NULL
twelve	NULL
,	NULL
Nancy	NULL
had	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
intervene	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
father	NULL
had	NULL
struck	NULL
her	NULL
full	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
forehead	NULL
a	NULL
blow	NULL
so	NULL
terrible	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
lain	NULL
unconscious	NULL
for	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
Nancy	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
prefer	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
remembered	NULL
rough	NULL
kindnesses	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
quite	NULL
small	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
dressed	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
clumsy	NULL
,	NULL
impatient	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
very	NULL
tender	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
always	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
servant	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
days	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
apparently	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Rufford	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
incapable	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
fancy	NULL
she	NULL
drank	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
cutting	NULL
a	NULL
tongue	NULL
that	NULL
even	NULL
Nancy	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
so	NULL
made	NULL
fun	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
tenderness	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
so	NULL
sneered	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
emotional	NULL
displays	NULL
.	NULL

Nancy	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
emotional	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
return	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
ride	NULL
at	NULL
Fort	NULL
William	NULL
,	NULL
Nancy	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sent	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
governess	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
right	NULL
down	NULL
South	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
convent	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
expecting	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL
months	NULL
'	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
mother	NULL
disappeared	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
fortnight	NULL
later	NULL
Leonora	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
convent	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
heard	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
end	NULL
what	NULL
became	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Rufford	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
never	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Major	NULL
Rufford	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
India	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
returned	NULL
very	NULL
seldom	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
for	NULL
very	NULL
short	NULL
visits	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Nancy	NULL
lived	NULL
herself	NULL
gradually	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
at	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
Teleragh	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
onwards	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
led	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
happy	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
dogs	NULL
and	NULL
horses	NULL
and	NULL
old	NULL
servants	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Forest	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
her	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
always	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
'	NULL
at	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
fortnight	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
stay	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
watched	NULL
her	NULL
gradually	NULL
growing	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
cheerful	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
always	NULL
even	NULL
kissed	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
eighteen	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
skip	NULL
about	NULL
and	NULL
fetch	NULL
me	NULL
things	NULL
and	NULL
laugh	NULL
at	NULL
my	NULL
tales	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
Philadelphia	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
beneath	NULL
her	NULL
gaiety	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
fancy	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
lurked	NULL
some	NULL
terrors	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
eighteen	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
rare	NULL
visits	NULL
to	NULL
Europe	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
gardens	NULL
,	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
iron-stained	NULL
fountain	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
headaches	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
Florence	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
baths	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL
how	NULL
beautiful	NULL
Nancy	NULL
looked	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
were	NULL
talking	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
desirability	NULL
of	NULL
taking	NULL
tickets	NULL
in	NULL
lotteries	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
moral	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
tall	NULL
and	NULL
fragile	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
just	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
neck	NULL
had	NULL
that	NULL
charming	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
youth	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
unfamiliarity	NULL
.	NULL

Over	NULL
her	NULL
throat	NULL
there	NULL
played	NULL
the	NULL
reflection	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
pool	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
left	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
thunderstorm	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
features	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
diffused	NULL
and	NULL
luminous	NULL
shade	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
white	NULL
parasol	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
dark	NULL
hair	NULL
just	NULL
showed	NULL
beneath	NULL
her	NULL
broad	NULL
,	NULL
white	NULL
hat	NULL
of	NULL
pierced	NULL
,	NULL
chip	NULL
straw	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
throat	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
leaned	NULL
forward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
,	NULL
arching	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
some	NULL
old-fashionedness	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
phraseology	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
abandoned	NULL
their	NULL
tense	NULL
line	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
colour	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
and	NULL
light	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
deep	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
vivid	NULL
white	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
saintly	NULL
and	NULL
swanlike	NULL
being	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
...	NULL
Why	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
sail	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
ship	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
white	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
definite	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
movements	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
will	NULL
never	NULL
...	NULL
Why	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
will	NULL
never	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
believe	NULL
it	NULL
...	NULL
Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
chattering	NULL
away	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
morality	NULL
of	NULL
lotteries	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
arcades	NULL
behind	NULL
us	NULL
the	NULL
overtones	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
unmistakable	NULL
voice	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
modified	NULL
foghorn	NULL
had	NULL
boomed	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
reed	NULL
inside	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
fair	NULL
,	NULL
stiffly	NULL
upright	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
fifty	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
walking	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
Italian	NULL
baron	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Belgian	NULL
Congo	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
talking	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
proper	NULL
treatment	NULL
of	NULL
natives	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
say	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
hang	NULL
humanity	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
looked	NULL
again	NULL
at	NULL
Nancy	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
closed	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
pallid	NULL
than	NULL
her	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
some	NULL
pinkish	NULL
reflections	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
gravel	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
dreadful	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
closed	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
groping	NULL
,	NULL
settled	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
arm	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Never	NULL
speak	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Promise	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
my	NULL
father	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
brings	NULL
back	NULL
those	NULL
dreadful	NULL
dreams	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
And	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
opened	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
straight	NULL
into	NULL
mine	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
blessed	NULL
saints	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
think	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
spare	NULL
you	NULL
such	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
believe	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
sinning	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
one	NULL
deserve	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
say	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
allowed	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
bedroom	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
young	NULL
girl	NULL
could	NULL
more	NULL
archly	NULL
and	NULL
lovingly	NULL
have	NULL
played	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
adored	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
holding	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
both	NULL
coat	NULL
lapels	NULL
;	NULL
cross-questioning	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
spent	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
;	NULL
kissing	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

Ah	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
well-bred	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
ever	NULL
anyone	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
wretched	NULL
man	NULL
cringed	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
ease	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
lessons	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
convent	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
peculiar	NULL
note	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
used	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
overbearing	NULL
or	NULL
dogmatic	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
unman	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
visible	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
unexpectedly	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
bad	NULL
dreams	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
blessed	NULL
saints	NULL
allowed	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
sins	NULL
always	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
herald	NULL
themselves	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
booming	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
sound	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
preceded	NULL
his	NULL
entrance	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
terrible	NULL
lunches	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
childhood	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
reported	NULL
,	NULL
earlier	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
chapter	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
that	NULL
remainder	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
stay	NULL
at	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
fighting	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
duel	NULL
with	NULL
unseen	NULL
weapons	NULL
against	NULL
silent	NULL
adversaries	NULL
.	NULL

Nancy	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
also	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
off	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
her	NULL
habit	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
stop	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
difficult	NULL
.	NULL

Nancy	NULL
was	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
having	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
going	NULL
off	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
ratting	NULL
,	NULL
rabbiting	NULL
,	NULL
catching	NULL
salmon	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
Fordingbridge	NULL
,	NULL
district-visiting	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
indulged	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
calling	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
tenants	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
at	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
gone	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Casino	NULL
alone	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evenings	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
whenever	NULL
Florence	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
call	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
attendance	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
shows	NULL
the	NULL
obviously	NULL
innocent	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
regard	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
that	NULL
even	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
jealousy	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
cultivated	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
at	NULL
ten	NULL
o'clock	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
managed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
contrived	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
be	NULL
alone	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
in	NULL
broad	NULL
daylight	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
very	NULL
crowded	NULL
places	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
a	NULL
Protestant	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
have	NULL
awakened	NULL
a	NULL
self-consciousness	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Catholics	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
always	NULL
reservations	NULL
and	NULL
queer	NULL
spots	NULL
of	NULL
secrecy	NULL
,	NULL
can	NULL
manage	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
dare	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
two	NULL
things	NULL
made	NULL
this	NULL
easier	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
obviously	NULL
sickening	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
ill	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
bowed	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
pockets	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
moments	NULL
of	NULL
inattention	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
describes	NULL
herself	NULL
as	NULL
watching	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
fierce	NULL
cat	NULL
watches	NULL
an	NULL
unconscious	NULL
pigeon	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
roadway	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
that	NULL
silent	NULL
watching	NULL
,	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Catholic	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
people	NULL
that	NULL
can	NULL
think	NULL
thoughts	NULL
alien	NULL
to	NULL
ours	NULL
and	NULL
keep	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
themselves	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
thoughts	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
;	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
even	NULL
got	NULL
through	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
with	NULL
never	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
spoken	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
remorse	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
grief	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
oppressing	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
watched	NULL
and	NULL
watched	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
uttered	NULL
apparently	NULL
random	NULL
sentences	NULL
about	NULL
Florence	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
perceived	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
grief	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
remorse	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
any	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
committed	NULL
suicide	NULL
without	NULL
writing	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
a	NULL
tirade	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
absence	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
heart	NULL
disease	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
undeceived	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
point	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
seem	NULL
more	NULL
romantic	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
remorse	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
treated	NULL
Florence	NULL
with	NULL
gallant	NULL
attentiveness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
desired	NULL
until	NULL
two	NULL
hours	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
gathered	NULL
that	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
he	NULL
straightened	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
coffin	NULL
--	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
thousand	NULL
other	NULL
little	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
speak	NULL
suddenly	NULL
about	NULL
Florence	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
start	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
pay	NULL
attention	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
would	NULL
sit	NULL
with	NULL
bloodshot	NULL
eyes	NULL
gazing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
tablecloth	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
drank	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
steady	NULL
soaking	NULL
of	NULL
drink	NULL
every	NULL
evening	NULL
till	NULL
long	NULL
after	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
Leonora	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
at	NULL
ten	NULL
,	NULL
unreasonable	NULL
though	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Nancy	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
whilst	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
half	NULL
mourning	NULL
for	NULL
Florence	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
ought	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
at	NULL
public	NULL
places	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
Casino	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
accompany	NULL
her	NULL
uncle	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
evening	NULL
strolls	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
park	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
Leonora	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
excuse	NULL
--	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
fancy	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
nightly	NULL
orison	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
and	NULL
herself	NULL
perform	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
growing	NULL
restive	NULL
at	NULL
even	NULL
devotional	NULL
exercises	NULL
,	NULL
clamoured	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
walk	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
wits	NULL
'	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
gave	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
standing	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
dinner	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
averted	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
his	NULL
heavy	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
bloodshot	NULL
eyes	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
full	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
has	NULL
ordered	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
immediately	NULL
after	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
heart	NULL
's	NULL
much	NULL
worse	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
Leonora	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
minute	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
heavy	NULL
contempt	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
understood	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
speech	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
giving	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
excuse	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
needed	NULL
for	NULL
separating	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
reproaching	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
corrupt	NULL
Nancy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
silently	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
there	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
--	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
--	NULL
reading	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Anglican	NULL
prayer-book	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
about	NULL
half-past	NULL
ten	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
his	NULL
footsteps	NULL
pass	NULL
her	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
going	NULL
outwards	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
hours	NULL
later	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
stumbling	NULL
heavily	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
remained	NULL
,	NULL
reflecting	NULL
upon	NULL
this	NULL
position	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
night	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
stay	NULL
at	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
suddenly	NULL
acted	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
after	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Teddy	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
think	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
night	NULL
off	NULL
from	NULL
your	NULL
doctor	NULL
's	NULL
orders	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
Nancy	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Casino	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
poor	NULL
child	NULL
has	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
visit	NULL
so	NULL
spoiled	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
turn	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
balancing	NULL
minute	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
,	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

Nancy	NULL
jumped	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
chair	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Those	NULL
two	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
relief	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
two	NULL
syllables	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
heard	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
she	NULL
realized	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
breaking	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
possession	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
dogged	NULL
determination	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
relax	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
vigilance	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
half-closed	NULL
jalousies	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
until	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
late	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL
Nancy	NULL
's	NULL
clear	NULL
voice	NULL
coming	NULL
closer	NULL
and	NULL
saying	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
did	NULL
look	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
guy	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
false	NULL
nose	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

There	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
some	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
celebration	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
local	NULL
holiday	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Kursaal	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Edward	NULL
replied	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
sulky	NULL
good	NULL
nature	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
As	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
old	NULL
Mother	NULL
Sideacher	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
came	NULL
swinging	NULL
along	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
silhouette	NULL
beneath	NULL
a	NULL
gas-lamp	NULL
;	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
slouched	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
talking	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
talked	NULL
any	NULL
time	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
seventeen	NULL
;	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
tones	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
joke	NULL
about	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
beggar	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
always	NULL
amused	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
opened	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
door	NULL
whilst	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
kissing	NULL
Edward	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
forehead	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
every	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
've	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
glorious	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
's	NULL
ever	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
raced	NULL
me	NULL
for	NULL
twenty	NULL
yards	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Leonora	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL
Edward	NULL
going	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
chatter	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
again	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
drinking	NULL
again	NULL
something	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
to	NULL
stop	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
opened	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
softly	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
never-opened	NULL
door	NULL
between	NULL
their	NULL
rooms	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
was	NULL
kneeling	NULL
beside	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
hidden	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
counterpane	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
outstretched	NULL
,	NULL
held	NULL
out	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
image	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Blessed	NULL
Virgin	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
tawdry	NULL
,	NULL
scarlet	NULL
and	NULL
Prussian	NULL
blue	NULL
affair	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
return	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
convent	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
shoulders	NULL
heaved	NULL
convulsively	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
heavy	NULL
sobs	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
close	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
Catholic	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
slept	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sleep	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
once	NULL
started	NULL
.	NULL

III	NULL
AND	NULL
then	NULL
Leonora	NULL
completely	NULL
broke	NULL
down	NULL
--	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
Teleragh	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
infliction	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
miserable	NULL
minds	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
scourge	NULL
of	NULL
atrocious	NULL
but	NULL
probably	NULL
just	NULL
destiny	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
grief	NULL
comes	NULL
by	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
,	NULL
any	NULL
great	NULL
grief	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
grief	NULL
itself	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
leaves	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
place	NULL
a	NULL
train	NULL
of	NULL
horrors	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
misery	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
relieved	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
trust	NULL
Edward	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Nancy	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
absolutely	NULL
trusted	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
slackening	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
vigilance	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
slackening	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
entire	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
is	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
miserable	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
entire	NULL
story	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
miserable	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
clean	NULL
intelligence	NULL
waver	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
wavered	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
are	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
loved	NULL
Edward	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
yet	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
agony	NULL
of	NULL
hatred	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
and	NULL
years	NULL
without	NULL
addressing	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
one	NULL
word	NULL
of	NULL
tenderness	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
relationship	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
just	NULL
married	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
seven	NULL
daughters	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
bare	NULL
,	NULL
untidy	NULL
Irish	NULL
manor-house	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
returned	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
convent	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
spoken	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
it	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
nineteen	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
such	NULL
inexperience	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
hers	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
might	NULL
almost	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
except	NULL
a	NULL
priest	NULL
.	NULL

Coming	NULL
straight	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
convent	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
in	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
walls	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
manor-house	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
more	NULL
cloistral	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
convent	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
seven	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
strained	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
worried	NULL
father	NULL
at	NULL
whom	NULL
,	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
tenants	NULL
took	NULL
pot-shots	NULL
from	NULL
behind	NULL
a	NULL
hedge	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
women-folk	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
tenants	NULL
respected	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
seven	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
drive	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
mother	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
basketwork	NULL
chaise	NULL
drawn	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
fat	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
lumbering	NULL
pony	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
paid	NULL
occasionally	NULL
a	NULL
call	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
even	NULL
these	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
rare	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
has	NULL
assured	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
that	NULL
succeeded	NULL
her	NULL
coming	NULL
home	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
convent	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
enter	NULL
another	NULL
person	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
seven	NULL
sisters	NULL
ran	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
neglected	NULL
gardens	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
unpruned	NULL
espaliers	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
they	NULL
played	NULL
lawn-tennis	NULL
or	NULL
fives	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
angle	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
wall	NULL
that	NULL
surrounded	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
angle	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
fruit	NULL
trees	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
died	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
painted	NULL
in	NULL
water-colour	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
embroidered	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
copied	NULL
verses	NULL
into	NULL
albums	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Mass	NULL
;	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
confessional	NULL
,	NULL
accompanied	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
nurse	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
happy	NULL
since	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
singular	NULL
extravagance	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
photographer	NULL
was	NULL
brought	NULL
over	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL
town	NULL
and	NULL
photographed	NULL
them	NULL
standing	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
seven	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
apple	NULL
tree	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
grey	NULL
lichen	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
raddled	NULL
trunk	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
an	NULL
extravagance	NULL
.	NULL

Three	NULL
weeks	NULL
before	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Powys	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
Harry	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
your	NULL
Edward	NULL
marry	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
girls	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
god-send	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
tether	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
once	NULL
one	NULL
girl	NULL
begins	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
will	NULL
follow	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
daughters	NULL
were	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
upstanding	NULL
,	NULL
clean-limbed	NULL
and	NULL
absolutely	NULL
pure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
reminded	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
married	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
in	NULL
different	NULL
churches	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Catholic	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
an	NULL
Anglican	NULL
--	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
sons	NULL
should	NULL
marry	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
daughters	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
Powys	NULL
and	NULL
remained	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Powys	NULL
'	NULL
dearest	NULL
friend	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
drifted	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
as	NULL
English	NULL
soldiers	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
seldom	NULL
meeting	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
their	NULL
women	NULL
always	NULL
in	NULL
correspondence	NULL
one	NULL
with	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
wrote	NULL
about	NULL
minute	NULL
things	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
teething	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
earlier	NULL
daughters	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
repair	NULL
a	NULL
Jacob	NULL
's	NULL
ladder	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
stocking	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
met	NULL
seldom	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
often	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
's	NULL
personalities	NULL
fresh	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
minds	NULL
,	NULL
gradually	NULL
growing	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
stiff	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
joints	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
always	NULL
with	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
store	NULL
of	NULL
reminiscences	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
girls	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
of	NULL
age	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
convent	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
regularly	NULL
interned	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
active	NULL
service	NULL

Colonel	NULL
Powys	NULL
retired	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
army	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
necessity	NULL

a	NULL
home	NULL
for	NULL

girls	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
whenever	NULL
the	NULL
four	NULL
parents	NULL
met	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
party	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
twenty-two	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
pure	NULL
in	NULL
mind	NULL
as	NULL
Leonora	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
odd	NULL
how	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
can	NULL
have	NULL
his	NULL
virgin	NULL
intelligence	NULL
untouched	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
partly	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
careful	NULL
handling	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
partly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
at	NULL
Winchester	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
particularly	NULL
pure	NULL
tone	NULL
and	NULL
partly	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
own	NULL
peculiar	NULL
aversion	NULL
from	NULL
anything	NULL
like	NULL
coarse	NULL
language	NULL
or	NULL
gross	NULL
stories	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
Sandhurst	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
kept	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
keen	NULL
on	NULL
soldiering	NULL
,	NULL
keen	NULL
on	NULL
mathematics	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
land-surveying	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
politics	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
warp	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
literature	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
twenty-two	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
pass	NULL
hours	NULL
reading	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Scott	NULL
's	NULL
novels	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
Chronicles	NULL
of	NULL
Froissart	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
considered	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
congratulated	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
almost	NULL
every	NULL
week	NULL
she	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Powys	NULL
,	NULL
dilating	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
walk	NULL
down	NULL
Bond	NULL
Street	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
Lord	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
noticed	NULL
Edward	NULL
suddenly	NULL
turn	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
round	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
well-dressed	NULL
girl	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wrote	NULL
about	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Powys	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
expressed	NULL
some	NULL
alarm	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
merest	NULL
reflex	NULL
action	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
abstracted	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
pressure	NULL
his	NULL
crammer	NULL
was	NULL
putting	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
certainly	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
known	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
letter	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
's	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Powys	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
caused	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Powys	NULL
to	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
half-humorous	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
longing	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
caused	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
to	NULL
reply	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
jocular	NULL
--	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
that	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Powys	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
them	NULL
some	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
goods	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
marketing	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
cause	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
photograph	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
seven	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
white	NULL
dresses	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
alike	NULL
in	NULL
feature	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
heavy	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
chins	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
stupid	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
dare	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
look	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
heavy	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
stupid	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
photograph	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
shadow	NULL
from	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
branches	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
apple	NULL
tree	NULL
cut	NULL
right	NULL
across	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
all	NULL
but	NULL
invisible	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
followed	NULL
an	NULL
extremely	NULL
harassing	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
Colonel	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Powys	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
sincerely	NULL
,	NULL
nothing	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
greater	NULL
ease	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
maternal	NULL
anxieties	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
her	NULL
son	NULL
marry	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Powys	NULL
'	NULL
daughters	NULL
if	NULL
only	NULL
he	NULL
showed	NULL
some	NULL
inclination	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
added	NULL
,	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
love-match	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
Powys	NULL
couple	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
things	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
fine	NULL
that	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
bringing	NULL
together	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
people	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
desperate	NULL
hazard	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
mere	NULL
expenditure	NULL
upon	NULL
sending	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
over	NULL
from	NULL
Ireland	NULL
to	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
was	NULL
terrifying	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
whichever	NULL
girl	NULL
they	NULL
selected	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
ring	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
bell	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
expenditure	NULL
upon	NULL
mere	NULL
food	NULL
and	NULL
extra	NULL
sheets	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
visit	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
was	NULL
terrifying	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
mean	NULL
,	NULL
mathematically	NULL
,	NULL
going	NULL
short	NULL
in	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
meals	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
afterwards	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
chanced	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
came	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
visit	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
lonely	NULL
manor-house	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
could	NULL
give	NULL
Edward	NULL
some	NULL
rough	NULL
shooting	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
rough	NULL
fishing	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
whirl	NULL
of	NULL
femininity	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
say	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
made	NULL
really	NULL
more	NULL
impression	NULL
upon	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
than	NULL
upon	NULL
Edward	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
clean	NULL
run	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
safe	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
indeed	NULL
so	NULL
clean	NULL
run	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
seems	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
regarded	NULL
them	NULL
rather	NULL
as	NULL
boys	NULL
than	NULL
as	NULL
girls	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
had	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
boy	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
conversations	NULL
that	NULL
English	NULL
mothers	NULL
have	NULL
with	NULL
English	NULL
sons	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seems	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
criminal	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
proceeding	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
took	NULL
place	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
asked	NULL
on	NULL
behalf	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
of	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
caused	NULL
some	NULL
consternation	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Powys	NULL
couple	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
daughter	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
married	NULL
the	NULL
eldest	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Powys	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
rigid	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
proprieties	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
reject	NULL
the	NULL
proposal	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
visit	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
cost	NULL
them	NULL
sixty	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
hire	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
extra	NULL
servant	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
horse	NULL
and	NULL
car	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
purchase	NULL
of	NULL
beds	NULL
and	NULL
bedding	NULL
and	NULL
extra	NULL
tablecloths	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
else	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
marriage	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
that	NULL
way	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
became	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
minute	NULL
study	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
progress	NULL
towards	NULL
complete	NULL
disunion	NULL
is	NULL
necessary	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
well	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
well	NULL
question	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
about	NULL
which	NULL
Edward	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
ever	NULL
any	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
from	NULL
Edward	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
regarded	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
certainly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
desirable	NULL
amongst	NULL
her	NULL
sisters	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
obstinate	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
extent	NULL
of	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
pretty	NULL
speeches	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
books	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
describe	NULL
his	NULL
feelings	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seems	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
calmly	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
quickening	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pulse	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
just	NULL
carried	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
being	NULL
no	NULL
opposition	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
been	NULL
all	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
poor	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
dim	NULL
and	NULL
misty	NULL
affair	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
admiration	NULL
for	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
greatest	NULL
admiration	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
admired	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
truthfulness	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
cleanness	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
clean-run-ness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
limbs	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
efficiency	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
fairness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
skin	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
gold	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
religion	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
duty	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
about	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
magnetism	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
,	NULL
really	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
love	NULL
her	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
mournful	NULL
;	NULL
what	NULL
really	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
good	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
comfort	NULL
somebody	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
darkly	NULL
and	NULL
mysteriously	NULL
mournful	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
for	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
too	NULL
obedient	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
submissive	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
deferred	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
judgements	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
handed	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
some	NULL
patient	NULL
medieval	NULL
virgin	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
taught	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
duty	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
obey	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
admiration	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
qualities	NULL
very	NULL
soon	NULL
became	NULL
love	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
deepest	NULL
description	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
his	NULL
pulses	NULL
never	NULL
quickened	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
told	NULL
,	NULL
became	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
called	NULL
an	NULL
altered	NULL
being	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
approached	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
dancing-floor	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
eyes	NULL
followed	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
trustfulness	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
admiration	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
gratitude	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
sense	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
pastor	NULL
and	NULL
guide	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
guided	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
what	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
straight	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
convent	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
heaven	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
an	NULL
English	NULL
officer	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
existence	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
like	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
feasts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
chatterings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
nice	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
admiration	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
nice	NULL
women	NULL
who	NULL
treated	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
baby	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
her	NULL
confessor	NULL
approved	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
give	NULL
little	NULL
treats	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
convent	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Reverend	NULL
Mother	NULL
approved	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
happier	NULL
girl	NULL
for	NULL
five	NULL
or	NULL
six	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
clouds	NULL
began	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
saying	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
arise	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
about	NULL
twenty-three	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
purposeful	NULL
efficiency	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
perhaps	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
mastery	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
perceive	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
extravagant	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
largesses	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
parents	NULL
died	NULL
just	NULL
about	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
both	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
continue	NULL
his	NULL
soldiering	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
management	NULL
of	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
steward	NULL
.	NULL

Aldershot	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
far	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
spent	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
leaves	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
to	NULL
perceive	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
generosities	NULL
were	NULL
almost	NULL
fantastic	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
subscribed	NULL
much	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
things	NULL
connected	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
mess	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
pensioned	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
servants	NULL
,	NULL
old	NULL
or	NULL
new	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
too	NULL
generously	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
income	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
every	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
find	NULL
themselves	NULL
hard	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
mortgaging	NULL
a	NULL
farm	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
never	NULL
actually	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
tentative	NULL
efforts	NULL
at	NULL
remonstrating	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
too	NULL
generous	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
tenants	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
wives	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
brother	NULL
officers	NULL
remonstrated	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
private	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
large	NULL
subscriptions	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
difficult	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
husbands	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Ironically	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
real	NULL
trouble	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
build	NULL
a	NULL
Roman	NULL
Catholic	NULL
chapel	NULL
at	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
honour	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
proposed	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
expensively	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
perfectly	NULL
well	NULL
drive	NULL
from	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
nearest	NULL
Catholic	NULL
Church	NULL
as	NULL
often	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
Roman	NULL
Catholic	NULL
tenants	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
Roman	NULL
Catholic	NULL
servants	NULL
except	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
nurse	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
always	NULL
drive	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
as	NULL
many	NULL
priests	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
needed	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
priests	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
a	NULL
gorgeous	NULL
chapel	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
place	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
merely	NULL
seemed	NULL
an	NULL
invidious	NULL
instance	NULL
of	NULL
ostentation	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
perfectly	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
celebrate	NULL
Mass	NULL
for	NULL
Leonora	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
nurse	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
stayed	NULL
at	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cleaned-up	NULL
outhouse	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
obstinate	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
hog	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
truly	NULL
grieved	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
sentiment	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
refusal	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
that	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
public	NULL
homage	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
wanting	NULL
in	NULL
imagination	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
hard	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
exactly	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
part	NULL
her	NULL
priests	NULL
played	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tragedy	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
became	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
dare	NULL
say	NULL
they	NULL
behaved	NULL
quite	NULL
creditably	NULL
but	NULL
mistakenly	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
mistaken	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
even	NULL
hurt	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
confessor	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
strenuous	NULL
efforts	NULL
to	NULL
convert	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
period	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
an	NULL
emotional	NULL
Catholic	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
hop	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
queer	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
wisdoms	NULL
,	NULL
those	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
queer	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
tact	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
they	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
too	NULL
early	NULL
conversion	NULL
would	NULL
frighten	NULL
off	NULL
other	NULL
Protestant	NULL
desirables	NULL
from	NULL
marrying	NULL
Catholic	NULL
girls	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
they	NULL
saw	NULL
deeper	NULL
into	NULL
Edward	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
creditable	NULL
convert	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
they	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
--	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
mortified	NULL
him	NULL
very	NULL
considerably	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
has	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
then	NULL
taken	NULL
his	NULL
aspirations	NULL
seriously	NULL
everything	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
different	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
dare	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
nonsense	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chapel	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
their	NULL
first	NULL
and	NULL
really	NULL
disastrous	NULL
quarrel	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
well	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
supposed	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
overworked	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
regimental	NULL
affairs	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
managing	NULL
the	NULL
mess	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
well	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
fear	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
union	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
sterile	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
came	NULL
over	NULL
from	NULL
Glasmoyle	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Those	NULL
were	NULL
troublesome	NULL
times	NULL
in	NULL
Ireland	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
understand	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Powys	NULL
had	NULL
tenants	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
brain	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
tenants	NULL
having	NULL
shot	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
shot-guns	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
land-steward	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
managed	NULL
his	NULL
estates	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
mad	NULL
generosity	NULL
towards	NULL
his	NULL
tenants	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
those	NULL
years	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
nineties	NULL
--	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
bad	NULL
for	NULL
farming	NULL
.	NULL

Wheat	NULL
was	NULL
fetching	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
shillings	NULL
the	NULL
hundred	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
price	NULL
of	NULL
meat	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
low	NULL
that	NULL
cattle	NULL
hardly	NULL
paid	NULL
for	NULL
raising	NULL
;	NULL
whole	NULL
English	NULL
counties	NULL
were	NULL
ruined	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Edward	NULL
allowed	NULL
his	NULL
tenants	NULL
very	NULL
high	NULL
rebates	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
do	NULL
both	NULL
justice	NULL
Leonora	NULL
has	NULL
since	NULL
acknowledged	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
following	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
far-seeing	NULL
policy	NULL
in	NULL
nursing	NULL
his	NULL
really	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
tenants	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
period	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
rails	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
old	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Powys	NULL
had	NULL
that	NULL
bee	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
bonnet	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
directly	NULL
approached	NULL
Edward	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
preached	NULL
unceasingly	NULL
,	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
pet	NULL
idea	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
sack	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
tenants	NULL
and	NULL
import	NULL
a	NULL
set	NULL
of	NULL
farmers	NULL
from	NULL
Scotland	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
doing	NULL
in	NULL
Essex	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
opinion	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
riding	NULL
hotfoot	NULL
to	NULL
ruin	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
worried	NULL
Leonora	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
worried	NULL
her	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
lay	NULL
awake	NULL
nights	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
anxious	NULL
line	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
worried	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
actually	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
tenants	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
probably	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
it	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
steward	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
in	NULL
on	NULL
them	NULL
every	NULL
morning	NULL
about	NULL
breakfast-time	NULL
to	NULL
report	NULL
any	NULL
little	NULL
happenings	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
farmer	NULL
called	NULL
Mumford	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
paid	NULL
half	NULL
his	NULL
rent	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
morning	NULL
the	NULL
land-steward	NULL
reported	NULL
that	NULL
Mumford	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
his	NULL
rent	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
reflected	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
's	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
fellow	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
our	NULL
tenants	NULL
for	NULL
over	NULL
two	NULL
hundred	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
him	NULL
off	NULL
altogether	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Leonora	NULL
--	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
being	NULL
very	NULL
nervous	NULL
and	NULL
unhappy	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
--	NULL
let	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
sound	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
groan	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
startled	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
suspected	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
passing	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
startled	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
anger	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
sharply	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
me	NULL
turn	NULL
out	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
've	NULL
been	NULL
earning	NULL
money	NULL
for	NULL
us	NULL
for	NULL
centuries	NULL
--	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
responsibilities	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
pack	NULL
of	NULL
Scotch	NULL
farmers	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
practically	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
of	NULL
hatred	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
precipitately	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
breakfast-table	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
probably	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
worse	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
betrayed	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
manifestation	NULL
of	NULL
anger	NULL
before	NULL
a	NULL
third	NULL
party	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
and	NULL
last	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
ever	NULL
was	NULL
betrayed	NULL
into	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
manifestation	NULL
of	NULL
anger	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
land-steward	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
moderate	NULL
and	NULL
well-balanced	NULL
man	NULL
whose	NULL
family	NULL
also	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
for	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
century	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
upon	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
considered	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
pursuing	NULL
a	NULL
perfectly	NULL
proper	NULL
course	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
tenants	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
erred	NULL
perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
generosity	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
hard	NULL
times	NULL
were	NULL
hard	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
the	NULL
pinch	NULL
,	NULL
landlord	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
tenants	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
great	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
get	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
cultivation	NULL
.	NULL

Scotch	NULL
farmers	NULL
just	NULL
skinned	NULL
your	NULL
fields	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
them	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Edward	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
set	NULL
of	NULL
tenants	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
their	NULL
best	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
themselves	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
arguments	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
carried	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
conviction	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
concerned	NULL
by	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
outburst	NULL
of	NULL
anger	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fact	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
practising	NULL
economies	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
department	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
under-housemaids	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
replaced	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
much	NULL
less	NULL
that	NULL
year	NULL
upon	NULL
dress	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fare	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
provided	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
dinners	NULL
they	NULL
gave	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
much	NULL
less	NULL
bountiful	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
nearly	NULL
so	NULL
costly	NULL
as	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
in	NULL
preceding	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
perceive	NULL
a	NULL
hardness	NULL
and	NULL
determination	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
character	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
net	NULL
closing	NULL
round	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
net	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
like	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
comparatively	NULL
poor	NULL
county	NULL
families	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mysterious	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
two	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
living	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
get	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
's	NULL
thoughts	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
spoken	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
outbreak	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
worrying	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
managing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
estates	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
intolerable	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
self-contempt	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
betrayed	NULL
into	NULL
speaking	NULL
harshly	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
before	NULL
that	NULL
land-steward	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
nerve	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
deserting	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
can	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
few	NULL
men	NULL
more	NULL
miserable	NULL
than	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
period	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
simple	NULL
soul	NULL
--	NULL
very	NULL
simple	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
man	NULL
can	NULL
satisfactorily	NULL
accomplish	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
without	NULL
loyal	NULL
and	NULL
whole-hearted	NULL
cooperation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
he	NULL
lives	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
perceive	NULL
dimly	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
whereas	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
traditions	NULL
were	NULL
entirely	NULL
collective	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sheer	NULL
individualist	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
own	NULL
theory	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
feudal	NULL
theory	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
over-lord	NULL
doing	NULL
his	NULL
best	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
dependents	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
dependents	NULL
meanwhile	NULL
doing	NULL
their	NULL
best	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
over-lord	NULL
--	NULL
this	NULL
theory	NULL
was	NULL
entirely	NULL
foreign	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
nature	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
came	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
of	NULL
small	NULL
Irish	NULL
landlords	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
hostile	NULL
garrison	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
plundered	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
unceasingly	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
she	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
they	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
children	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
really	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
children	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
any	NULL
difference	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dissimilarity	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
profound	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
will	NULL
give	NULL
you	NULL
some	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
naïveté	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
marriage	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
years	NULL
after	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
really	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
children	NULL
are	NULL
produced	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
did	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
continued	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
dare	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
influence	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
mentalities	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
Will	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
certainly	NULL
presented	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
as	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
Will	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
mysterious	NULL
and	NULL
awful	NULL
chastisement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Almighty	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
discovered	NULL
shortly	NULL
before	NULL
this	NULL
period	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
parents	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
exacted	NULL
from	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
family	NULL
the	NULL
promise	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
children	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
bear	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
brought	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
Catholics	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
herself	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL
either	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
had	NULL
let	NULL
drop	NULL
some	NULL
words	NULL
leading	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
tried	NULL
desperately	NULL
to	NULL
extort	NULL
the	NULL
promise	NULL
from	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
encountered	NULL
an	NULL
unexpected	NULL
obstinacy	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
willing	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
Catholic	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
Anglican	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
understand	NULL
the	NULL
bearing	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
English	NULL
society	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
Englishmen	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
mad	NULL
in	NULL
matters	NULL
of	NULL
politics	NULL
or	NULL
of	NULL
religion	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
Edward	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
particularly	NULL
queer	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
himself	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
Romanist	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
contemplate	NULL
going	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
Rome	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
letting	NULL
his	NULL
boys	NULL
be	NULL
educated	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
religion	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
immediate	NULL
ancestors	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
may	NULL
appear	NULL
illogical	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
dare	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
illogical	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
looks	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
regarded	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
having	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
body	NULL
and	NULL
soul	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
disposal	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
loyalty	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
traditions	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
permit	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
bind	NULL
any	NULL
future	NULL
inheritors	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
or	NULL
beneficiaries	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
ancestors	NULL
.	NULL

About	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
know	NULL
other	NULL
homes	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
circumstances	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
given	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
of	NULL
choosing	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
first	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
Anglican	NULL
teaching	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
unshakable	NULL
about	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
agony	NULL
during	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
will	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
she	NULL
seriously	NULL
believed	NULL
that	NULL
children	NULL
who	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
born	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
danger	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
absolutely	NULL
of	NULL
damnation	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
of	NULL
receiving	NULL
false	NULL
doctrine	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
agony	NULL
more	NULL
terrible	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
describe	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
indeed	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
describe	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
tell	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
negligently	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
lie	NULL
awake	NULL
whole	NULL
nights	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
my	NULL
spiritual	NULL
advisers	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
console	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
knew	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
how	NULL
terrible	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
long	NULL
those	NULL
nights	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
seemed	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
little	NULL
avail	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
consolations	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
spiritual	NULL
advisers	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
spiritual	NULL
advisers	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
calmly	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
certainly	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
not	NULL
consider	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
sinned	NULL
.	NULL

Nay	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
seem	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
extorted	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
threatened	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
view	NULL
to	NULL
getting	NULL
her	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
considered	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
morbid	NULL
frame	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
just	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
influence	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
by	NULL
propaganda	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
by	NULL
personality	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
they	NULL
warned	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
committing	NULL
a	NULL
sin	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
sinned	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
sinned	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
passionately	NULL
and	NULL
whom	NULL
,	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
rule	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
rod	NULL
of	NULL
iron	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
becoming	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
estranged	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
regard	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
being	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
physically	NULL
and	NULL
mentally	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
even	NULL
as	NULL
being	NULL
actually	NULL
wicked	NULL
and	NULL
mean	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
times	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
almost	NULL
shudder	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
consider	NULL
her	NULL
wicked	NULL
or	NULL
mean	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
only	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
madness	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
shoulders	NULL
the	NULL
burden	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
troop	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
regiment	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
estate	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
curb	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
regarded	NULL
as	NULL
megalomania	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
anything	NULL
wicked	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
things	NULL
together	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
little	NULL
by	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
intercourse	NULL
became	NULL
simply	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
agonized	NULL
discussion	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
whether	NULL
Edward	NULL
should	NULL
subscribe	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
or	NULL
that	NULL
institution	NULL
or	NULL
should	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
reclaim	NULL
this	NULL
or	NULL
that	NULL
drunkard	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
simply	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Into	NULL
this	NULL
really	NULL
terrible	NULL
position	NULL
of	NULL
strain	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
issue	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Kilsyte	NULL
case	NULL
came	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
peculiar	NULL
irony	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
would	NULL
certainly	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
kissed	NULL
that	NULL
nurse-maid	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
please	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

Nurse-maids	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
travel	NULL
first-class	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
travelled	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
third-class	NULL
carriage	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
prove	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
economies	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Kilsyte	NULL
case	NULL
came	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
relief	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
strained	NULL
situation	NULL
that	NULL
then	NULL
existed	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
gave	NULL
Leonora	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL
of	NULL
backing	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
whole-hearted	NULL
and	NULL
absolutely	NULL
loyal	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
of	NULL
behaving	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
considered	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
should	NULL
behave	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
railway	NULL
carriage	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
quite	NULL
pretty	NULL
girl	NULL
of	NULL
about	NULL
nineteen	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
quite	NULL
pretty	NULL
girl	NULL
of	NULL
about	NULL
nineteen	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
dark	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
red	NULL
cheeks	NULL
and	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
quietly	NULL
weeping	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
corner	NULL
thinking	NULL
about	NULL
nothing	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
chanced	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
nurse-maid	NULL
;	NULL
two	NULL
large	NULL
,	NULL
pretty	NULL
tears	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
dropped	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
lap	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
immediately	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
comfort	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
job	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
desperately	NULL
unhappy	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
natural	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
pool	NULL
their	NULL
sorrows	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
democratic	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
station	NULL
never	NULL
seems	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
seen	NULL
walking	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
Annie	NULL
of	NULL
Number	NULL
54	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
moved	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
report	NULL
probably	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
true	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
might	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
walk	NULL
with	NULL
Annie	NULL
from	NULL
Number	NULL
54	NULL
without	NULL
its	NULL
denoting	NULL
anything	NULL
very	NULL
serious	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
assured	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
quite	NULL
half-fatherly	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
waist	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
forgotten	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
station	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
other	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
schoolteachers	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
tradition	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
class	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
warned	NULL
against	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
kissed	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
screamed	NULL
,	NULL
tore	NULL
herself	NULL
away	NULL
;	NULL
sprang	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
pulled	NULL
a	NULL
communication	NULL
cord	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
came	NULL
fairly	NULL
well	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
estimation	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
mentally	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
harm	NULL
.	NULL

IV	NULL
IT	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
an	NULL
all-round	NULL
impression	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wonder	NULL
how	NULL
far	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
succeeded	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
dare	NULL
say	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL
succeeded	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
ever	NULL
very	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
such	NULL
things	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
important	NULL
point	NULL
about	NULL
poor	NULL
Edward	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
built	NULL

carried	NULL
himself	NULL

was	NULL
moderate	NULL
at	NULL

things	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
virtues	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
certainly	NULL
was	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
them	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
months	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
set	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
tombstone	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
be	NULL
set	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
tombstone	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
widow	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
have	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
wonder	NULL
,	NULL
given	NULL
the	NULL
due	NULL
impression	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
portioned	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
laid	NULL
out	NULL
?	NULL

Because	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
taken	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
various	NULL
passions	NULL
was	NULL
relatively	NULL
small	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
passions	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
consider	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
you	NULL
consider	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
rose	NULL
every	NULL
morning	NULL
at	NULL
seven	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
bath	NULL
,	NULL
breakfasted	NULL
at	NULL
eight	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
regiment	NULL
from	NULL
nine	NULL
until	NULL
one	NULL
;	NULL
played	NULL
polo	NULL
or	NULL
cricket	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
for	NULL
cricket	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
tea-time	NULL
.	NULL

Afterwards	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
occupy	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
letters	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
land-steward	NULL
or	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
affairs	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mess	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
dinner-time	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
dine	NULL
and	NULL
pass	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
playing	NULL
cards	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
playing	NULL
billiards	NULL
with	NULL
Leonora	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
social	NULL
functions	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
kind	NULL
or	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
--	NULL
by	NULL
far	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
love-affairs	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
sandwiched	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
odd	NULL
moments	NULL
or	NULL
took	NULL
place	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
social	NULL
evenings	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
dances	NULL
and	NULL
dinners	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
guess	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
hard	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
O	NULL
silent	NULL
listener	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
that	NULL
impression	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
hope	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
not	NULL
given	NULL
you	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pathological	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
normal	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sentimentalist	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
dare	NULL
say	NULL
the	NULL
quality	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
youth	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
influence	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
ignorances	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
crammings	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
received	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
army	NULL
coaches	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
dare	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
excellent	NULL
influences	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
adolescence	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
bad	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
we	NULL
all	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
bad	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
outline	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
outline	NULL
perfectly	NULL
normal	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hard-working	NULL
,	NULL
sentimental	NULL
and	NULL
efficient	NULL
professional	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
first	NULL
impressions	NULL
has	NULL
always	NULL
bothered	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
quite	NULL
academically	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
mean	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
time	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
or	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
trust	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
first	NULL
impressions	NULL
in	NULL
dealing	NULL
with	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
anybody	NULL
to	NULL
deal	NULL
with	NULL
except	NULL
waiters	NULL
and	NULL
chambermaids	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
having	NULL
any	NULL
dealings	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
waiters	NULL
and	NULL
chambermaids	NULL
were	NULL
concerned	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
generally	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
first	NULL
impressions	NULL
were	NULL
correct	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
my	NULL
first	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
civil	NULL
,	NULL
obliging	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
attentive	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
generally	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
being	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
our	NULL
Paris	NULL
flat	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
maid	NULL
who	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
charming	NULL
and	NULL
transparently	NULL
honest	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stole	NULL
,	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
diamond	NULL
rings	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
her	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
from	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
prison	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
somebody	NULL
says	NULL
somewhere	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
special	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
short	NULL
incursion	NULL
into	NULL
American	NULL
business	NULL
life	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
incursion	NULL
that	NULL
lasted	NULL
during	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
August	NULL
and	NULL
nearly	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL
September	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
rely	NULL
upon	NULL
first	NULL
impressions	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
thing	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
found	NULL
myself	NULL
automatically	NULL
docketing	NULL
and	NULL
labelling	NULL
each	NULL
man	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
introduced	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
run	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
features	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
words	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
be	NULL
regarded	NULL
as	NULL
really	NULL
doing	NULL
business	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
spent	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
United	NULL
States	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
winding	NULL
things	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
my	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
marrying	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
possibly	NULL
have	NULL
looked	NULL
for	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
my	NULL
experiences	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
vivid	NULL
and	NULL
amusing	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
exactly	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
museum	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
riotous	NULL
fancy-dress	NULL
ball	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
my	NULL
life	NULL
with	NULL
Florence	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
almost	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
forget	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
such	NULL
things	NULL
as	NULL
fashions	NULL
or	NULL
occupations	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
greed	NULL
of	NULL
gain	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
forgotten	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
dollar	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
dollar	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
extremely	NULL
desirable	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
possess	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
as	NULL
gossip	NULL
that	NULL
mattered	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
that	NULL
particular	NULL
,	NULL
Philadelphia	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
amazing	NULL
place	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
city	NULL
for	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
or	NULL
ten	NULL
days	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
there	NULL
transact	NULL
anything	NULL
much	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
business	NULL
;	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
times	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
warned	NULL
by	NULL
everybody	NULL
against	NULL
everybody	NULL
else	NULL
was	NULL
simply	NULL
amazing	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
man	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
up	NULL
behind	NULL
my	NULL
lounge	NULL
chair	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
whispering	NULL
cautiously	NULL
beside	NULL
my	NULL
ear	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
warn	NULL
me	NULL
against	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
man	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
equally	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
but	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
standing	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
bar	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
thought	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
--	NULL
perhaps	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
's	NULL
debt	NULL
or	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
controlling	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
railway	NULL
interest	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
a	NULL
newspaper	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
either	NULL
politicians	NULL
or	NULL
reporters	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
comes	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
property	NULL
in	NULL
Philadelphia	NULL
was	NULL
mostly	NULL
real	NULL
estate	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
I	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
to	NULL
satisfy	NULL
myself	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
houses	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
good	NULL
repair	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
doors	NULL
kept	NULL
properly	NULL
painted	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wanted	NULL
also	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
my	NULL
relations	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
were	NULL
mostly	NULL
professional	NULL
people	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
mostly	NULL
rather	NULL
hard	NULL
up	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
bank	NULL
failure	NULL
in	NULL
1907	NULL
or	NULL
thereabouts	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
nicer	NULL
still	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
what	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
mania	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
called	NULL
influences	NULL
were	NULL
working	NULL
against	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
city	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
English	NULL
than	NULL
American	NULL
in	NULL
type	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
handsome	NULL
but	NULL
careworn	NULL
ladies	NULL
,	NULL
cousins	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
talked	NULL
principally	NULL
about	NULL
mysterious	NULL
movements	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
against	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
;	NULL
perhaps	NULL
they	NULL
thought	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
or	NULL
perhaps	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
n't	NULL
any	NULL
movements	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
secret	NULL
and	NULL
subtle	NULL
and	NULL
subterranean	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
nice	NULL
young	NULL
fellow	NULL
called	NULL
Carter	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
second-nephew	NULL
of	NULL
mine	NULL
,	NULL
twice	NULL
removed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
handsome	NULL
and	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
gentle	NULL
and	NULL
tall	NULL
and	NULL
modest	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
understand	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
cricketer	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
employed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
real-estate	NULL
agents	NULL
who	NULL
collected	NULL
my	NULL
rents	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
took	NULL
me	NULL
over	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
property	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
nice	NULL
girl	NULL
called	NULL
Mary	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
engaged	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
certainly	NULL
should	NULL
n't	NULL
do	NULL
now	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
made	NULL
some	NULL
careful	NULL
inquiries	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
character	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
discovered	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
employers	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
honest	NULL
,	NULL
industrious	NULL
,	NULL
high-spirited	NULL
,	NULL
friendly	NULL
and	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
anyone	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
turn	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
relatives	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
mine	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
--	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
something	NULL
darkly	NULL
mysterious	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
mixed	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
graft	NULL
or	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
betrayed	NULL
several	NULL
innocent	NULL
and	NULL
trusting	NULL
maidens	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
pushed	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
particular	NULL
mystery	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
discovered	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Democrat	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
own	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
mostly	NULL
Republicans	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
worse	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
darkly	NULL
mysterious	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
young	NULL
Carter	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Vermont	NULL
Democrat	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
ticket	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
mistake	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
means	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
money	NULL
will	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
die	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
recollection	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
friendly	NULL
image	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
nice	NULL
girl	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
engaged	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

May	NULL
Fate	NULL
deal	NULL
very	NULL
kindly	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
just	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
present	NULL
frame	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
nothing	NULL
would	NULL
ever	NULL
make	NULL
me	NULL
make	NULL
inquiries	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
man	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
liked	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
sight	NULL
.	NULL

(	NULL
The	NULL
little	NULL
digression	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
Philadelphia	NULL
experiences	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
lead	NULL
around	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL
)	NULL

For	NULL
who	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
can	NULL
give	NULL
anyone	NULL
a	NULL
character	NULL
?	NULL

Who	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
knows	NULL
anything	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
heart	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
form	NULL
an	NULL
average	NULL
estimate	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
will	NULL
behave	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
one	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
certain	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
any	NULL
man	NULL
will	NULL
behave	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
case	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
until	NULL
one	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
character	NULL
"	NULL
is	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
use	NULL
to	NULL
anyone	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
instance	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
with	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
maid	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
trust	NULL
that	NULL
girl	NULL
with	NULL
blank	NULL
cheques	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
payment	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tradesmen	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
trusted	NULL
by	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
stole	NULL
a	NULL
ring	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
believed	NULL
her	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
believed	NULL
herself	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
character	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
rather	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
figure	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Kilsyte	NULL
case	NULL
eased	NULL
the	NULL
immediate	NULL
tension	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
loyalty	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
her	NULL
chance	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
accepted	NULL
without	NULL
question	NULL
his	NULL
statement	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
kissing	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
administer	NULL
fatherly	NULL
comfort	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
weeping	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
world	NULL
--	NULL
including	NULL
the	NULL
magistrates	NULL
--	NULL
took	NULL
that	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

Whatever	NULL
people	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
world	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
perfectly	NULL
charitable	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
...	NULL
But	NULL
,	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
Edward	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
harm	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
assured	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
that	NULL
case	NULL
came	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
wrangled	NULL
about	NULL
by	NULL
counsel	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
dirty-mindedness	NULL
that	NULL
counsel	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
case	NULL
can	NULL
impute	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
unfaithful	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
tumult	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
says	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
suddenly	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
whilst	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
witness-box	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
august	NULL
ceremonies	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
law	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
suddenly	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
the	NULL
recollection	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
softness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
body	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
pressed	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
girl	NULL
appeared	NULL
desirable	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
completely	NULL
unattractive	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
indulge	NULL
in	NULL
day-dreams	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
approached	NULL
the	NULL
nurse-maid	NULL
more	NULL
tactfully	NULL
and	NULL
carried	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
much	NULL
further	NULL
.	NULL

Occasionally	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
women	NULL
in	NULL
terms	NULL
of	NULL
wary	NULL
courtship	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
exact	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
terms	NULL
of	NULL
tactful	NULL
comforting	NULL
,	NULL
ending	NULL
in	NULL
absorption	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
victim	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
law	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
Dreyfus	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
law	NULL
,	NULL
practically	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
stated	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
view	NULL
Captain	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
misled	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
ill-placed	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
comfort	NULL
a	NULL
member	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
opposite	NULL
sex	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
fined	NULL
him	NULL
five	NULL
shilling	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
tact	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
of	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Edward	NULL
maintained	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
ideas	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
believe	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
certainly	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
twenty-seven	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
sympathy	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
some	NULL
crash	NULL
was	NULL
inevitable	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
momentary	NULL
rapprochement	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
probably	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
worse	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
particular	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
Leonara	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
scratch	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
whilst	NULL
Edward	NULL
respected	NULL
her	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
grateful	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
seem	NULL
by	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
cold	NULL
in	NULL
other	NULL
matters	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
near	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
responsibilities	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
career	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
tradition	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
brought	NULL
his	NULL
despair	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
exasperation	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
riveted	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
find	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
moral	NULL
support	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
needed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
Lohengrin	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
says	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
about	NULL
deliberately	NULL
looking	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
several	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
ladies	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
set	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
agreeing	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
handsome	NULL
and	NULL
fine	NULL
fellow	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
duties	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
feudal	NULL
gentleman	NULL
were	NULL
feudal	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
his	NULL
days	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
ladies	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
an	NULL
obstacle	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
were	NULL
married	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
husband	NULL
who	NULL
claimed	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
attention	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
an	NULL
unmarried	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
compromising	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
date	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
seducing	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
ladies	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
only	NULL
moral	NULL
support	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
female	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
men	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
about	NULL
ideals	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
any	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
his	NULL
mistress	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
sounds	NULL
queer	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
quite	NULL
true	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
statement	NULL
of	NULL
character	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
priests	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
--	NULL
who	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
Monte	NULL
Carlo	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
Edward	NULL
needed	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
fit	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
society	NULL
of	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
irresponsibility	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
date	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
aspect	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
prig	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
mean	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
played	NULL
polo	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
dancer	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
keeping	NULL
himself	NULL
fit	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
social	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
dances	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
dance	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
nothing	NULL
for	NULL
fun	NULL
except	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
considered	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
priest	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
must	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
estrange	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
Leonora	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
because	NULL
Leonora	NULL
set	NULL
much	NULL
store	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
joy	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
sympathy	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
did	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
priest	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
Edward	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
like	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
time	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
bond	NULL
of	NULL
sympathy	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
idea	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
worked	NULL
out	NULL
wrongly	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
worked	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mistress	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Grand	NULL
Duke	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
anyone	NULL
less	NULL
sentimental	NULL
than	NULL
Edward	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
mattered	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
Edward	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
fatal	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
honourable	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
enjoy	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
favours	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
bond	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
it	NULL
worked	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
practice	NULL
.	NULL

Psychologically	NULL
it	NULL
meant	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
mistress	NULL
without	NULL
falling	NULL
violently	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
serious	NULL
person	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
particular	NULL
case	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
expensive	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
mistress	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Grand	NULL
Duke	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
Spanish	NULL
dancer	NULL
of	NULL
passionate	NULL
appearance	NULL
--	NULL
singled	NULL
out	NULL
Edward	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
glances	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
ball	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
held	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
common	NULL
hotel	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
was	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
handsome	NULL
,	NULL
blond	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
wealthy	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
understood	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
early	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
public	NULL
dances	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
relieved	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
time	NULL
with	NULL
several	NULL
amiable	NULL
girls	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Spanish	NULL
dancer	NULL
of	NULL
passionate	NULL
appearance	NULL
wanted	NULL
one	NULL
night	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
beaux	NULL
yeux	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
gardens	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
remembering	NULL
suddenly	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Kilsyte	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
passionately	NULL
,	NULL
violently	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
explosion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
passion	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
bridled	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
well	NULL
behaved	NULL
.	NULL

La	NULL
Dolciquita	NULL
liked	NULL
this	NULL
reversion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
palpitating	NULL
creature	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
asleep	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
he	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
madly	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
passionately	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
overwhelmingly	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
arisen	NULL
like	NULL
fire	NULL
in	NULL
dry	NULL
corn	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
else	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
live	NULL
for	NULL
nothing	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
La	NULL
Dolciquita	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
reasonable	NULL
creature	NULL
without	NULL
an	NULL
ounce	NULL
of	NULL
passion	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
appetites	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
had	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
coldly	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
money	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
perfectly	NULL
reasonable	NULL
commercial	NULL
transaction	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
two	NULL
buttons	NULL
for	NULL
Edward	NULL
or	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
asking	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
risk	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
situation	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Grand	NULL

If	NULL
Edward	NULL
could	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
sufficient	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
serve	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
insurance	NULL
against	NULL
accident	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
like	NULL
Edward	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
covered	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
policy	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
fifty	NULL
thousand	NULL
dollars	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
Grand	NULL
Duke	NULL
;	NULL
Edward	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
a	NULL
premium	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
'	NULL
hire	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
society	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
much	NULL
risk	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Grand	NULL
Duke	NULL
's	NULL
finding	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
keys	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
risk	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
twenty	NULL
per	NULL
cent	NULL
risk	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
figured	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
solicitor	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
estate	NULL
to	NULL
sell	NULL
--	NULL
perfectly	NULL
quietly	NULL
and	NULL
perfectly	NULL
coldly	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
inflections	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
unkind	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
being	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
virtuous	NULL
business	NULL
woman	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
mother	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
sisters	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
old	NULL
age	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
provided	NULL
comfortably	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
expect	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
'	NULL
further	NULL
run	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
twenty-four	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
We	NULL
Spanish	NULL
women	NULL
are	NULL
horrors	NULL
at	NULL
thirty	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Edward	NULL
swore	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
provide	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
life	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
leave	NULL
off	NULL
talking	NULL
so	NULL
horribly	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
only	NULL
shrugged	NULL
one	NULL
shoulder	NULL
slowly	NULL
and	NULL
contemptuously	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
convince	NULL
this	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
surrendered	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
her	NULL
virtue	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
regarded	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
case	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
provide	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
cherish	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
return	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
return	NULL
,	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
honourable	NULL
love	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
listen	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
accounts	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
estate	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
figured	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
shrugged	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
shoulder	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
gesture	NULL
and	NULL
held	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
left	NULL
hand	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
elbow	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Enfin	NULL
,	NULL
mon	NULL
ami	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
hand	NULL
the	NULL
price	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
tiara	NULL
at	NULL
Forli	NULL

or	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
And	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
went	NULL
mad	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
world	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL
head	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
palms	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
sea	NULL
danced	NULL
grotesque	NULL
dances	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
virtue	NULL
,	NULL
tenderness	NULL
and	NULL
moral	NULL
support	NULL
of	NULL
women	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
argue	NULL
with	NULL
La	NULL
Dolciquita	NULL
;	NULL
to	NULL
retire	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
island	NULL
and	NULL
point	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
damnation	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
salvation	NULL
can	NULL
only	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
in	NULL
true	NULL
love	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
feudal	NULL
system	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
mistress	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
reflected	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
moral	NULL
laws	NULL
she	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
on	NULL
being	NULL
his	NULL
mistress	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
least	NULL
his	NULL
sympathetic	NULL
confidante	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
her	NULL
rooms	NULL
were	NULL
closed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
appear	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
:	NULL
blank	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
break	NULL
that	NULL
down	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
twenty	NULL
thousand	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
what	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spent	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
of	NULL
madness	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
hungered	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
sank	NULL
in	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
shuddered	NULL
at	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
touch	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
dare	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
nine-tenths	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
La	NULL
Dolciquita	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
discomfort	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
unfaithful	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
uncommonly	NULL
bad	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
--	NULL
oh	NULL
,	NULL
unbearably	NULL
bad	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

Poor	NULL
devil	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
incredibly	NULL
naïve	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
drank	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
fish	NULL
after	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
spread	NULL
himself	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
tables	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
for	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
.	NULL

Heaven	NULL
knows	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
happened	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
thrown	NULL
away	NULL
every	NULL
penny	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
possessed	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
about	NULL
forty	NULL
thousand	NULL
pounds	NULL
and	NULL
whilst	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
hotel	NULL
was	NULL
whispering	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
La	NULL
Dolciquita	NULL
walked	NULL
composedly	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
bedroom	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
drunk	NULL
to	NULL
recognize	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arm-chair	NULL
,	NULL
knitting	NULL
and	NULL
holding	NULL
smelling	NULL
salts	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
nose	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
pretty	NULL
far	NULL
gone	NULL
with	NULL
alcoholic	NULL
poisoning	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Look	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
mon	NULL

do	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

Take	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
sleep	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
me	NULL
this	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
slept	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
lunch-hour	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Whelan	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Whelan	NULL
seems	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
sensible	NULL
person	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
ever	NULL
connected	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
argued	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
harpy	NULL
variety	NULL
connected	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
incredible	NULL
behaviour	NULL
and	NULL
mien	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
advised	NULL
Leonora	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
straight	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
Town	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
bringing	NULL
Edward	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
senses	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
consult	NULL
her	NULL
solicitor	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
spiritual	NULL
adviser	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
go	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL
morning	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
arguing	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
condition	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
awoke	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
straight	NULL
to	NULL
La	NULL
Dolciquita	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
lunch	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
apartments	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
fell	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
neck	NULL
and	NULL
wept	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
good-natured	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
calmed	NULL
him	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
Eau	NULL
de	NULL
Mélisse	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Look	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
friend	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
money	NULL
have	NULL
you	NULL
left	NULL

Five	NULL
thousand	NULL
dollars	NULL
?	NULL

Ten	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
rumour	NULL
went	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
two	NULL
kings	NULL
'	NULL
ransoms	NULL
a	NULL
night	NULL
for	NULL
fourteen	NULL
nights	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
resources	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Eau	NULL
de	NULL
Mélisse	NULL
had	NULL
calmed	NULL
Edward	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
extent	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
really	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
head	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
grunt	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
And	NULL
then	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
ten	NULL
thousand	NULL
dollars	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL

.	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
Antibes	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
sum	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Edward	NULL
grunted	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Five	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
seven	NULL
thousand	NULL
five	NULL
hundred	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
stuck	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
five	NULL
thousand	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL
expenses	NULL
at	NULL
Antibes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sedative	NULL
carried	NULL
him	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
collapsed	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
for	NULL
Antibes	NULL
at	NULL
three	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
without	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
left	NULL
a	NULL
note	NULL
for	NULL
Leonora	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
off	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Clinton	NULL
Morleys	NULL
,	NULL
yachting	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
enjoy	NULL
himself	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
at	NULL
Antibes	NULL
.	NULL

La	NULL
Dolciquita	NULL
could	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
with	NULL
any	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
except	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
tired	NULL
him	NULL
unceasingly	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
every	NULL
waking	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
presents	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
expensive	NULL
description	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
just	NULL
quietly	NULL
kicked	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hung	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
Antibes	NULL
for	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
cured	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
duties	NULL
towards	NULL
La	NULL
Dolciquita	NULL
--	NULL
feudal	NULL
or	NULL
otherwise	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
sentimentalism	NULL
required	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
attitude	NULL
of	NULL
Byronic	NULL
gloom	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
court	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
into	NULL
half-mourning	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
his	NULL
appetite	NULL
suddenly	NULL
returned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
hotel	NULL
at	NULL
Monte	NULL
Carlo	NULL
a	NULL
telegram	NULL
from	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
dispatched	NULL
from	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
Please	NULL
return	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
convenient	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
why	NULL
Leonora	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
abandoned	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
precipitately	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
only	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
yachting	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Clinton	NULL
Morleys	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
the	NULL
note	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
rocky	NULL
journey	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
frightened	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
desirable	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

Major	NULL

I	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL

a	NULL

Edward	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
;	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
seeing	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
five	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
English	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL

--	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
regimental	NULL
subscriptions	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
keeping	NULL
his	NULL
men	NULL

Leonora	NULL
hated	NULL
that	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
preferred	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
dresses	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
devoted	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
paying	NULL
off	NULL
a	NULL
mortgage	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
justice	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
managing	NULL
a	NULL
property	NULL
bringing	NULL
in	NULL
three	NULL
thousand	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
view	NULL
to	NULL
re-establishing	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
property	NULL
of	NULL
five	NULL
thousand	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
and	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
property	NULL
really	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
legally	NULL
,	NULL
belonged	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
reasonable	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
should	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
slice	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
devil	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
job	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
financial	NULL
details	NULL
exactly	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
good	NULL
head	NULL
at	NULL
figures	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
sometimes	NULL
mixes	NULL
up	NULL
pounds	NULL
with	NULL
dollars	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
figure	NULL
wrong	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
proposition	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
this	NULL
:	NULL
Properly	NULL
worked	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
rebates	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tenants	NULL
and	NULL
keeping	NULL
up	NULL
schools	NULL
and	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
estate	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL
about	NULL
five	NULL
thousand	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
when	NULL
Edward	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL
actually	NULL
about	NULL
four	NULL
.	NULL

(	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
talking	NULL
in	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
dollars	NULL
.	NULL
)	NULL

Edward	NULL
's	NULL
excesses	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Spanish	NULL
Lady	NULL
had	NULL
reduced	NULL
its	NULL
value	NULL
to	NULL
about	NULL
three	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
maximum	NULL
figure	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
reductions	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
it	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
five	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
young	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
faced	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
proposition	NULL
--	NULL
twenty-four	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
advanced	NULL
age	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
things	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
youthful	NULL
vigour	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
likely	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
more	NULL
merciful	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
more	NULL
about	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
got	NULL
Edward	NULL
remarkably	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
hop	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
London	NULL
hotel	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
crept	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
Monte	NULL
Carlo	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
poor	NULL
tail	NULL
between	NULL
his	NULL
poor	NULL
legs	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
she	NULL
cut	NULL
short	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
mumblings	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
attempts	NULL
at	NULL
affectionate	NULL
speech	NULL
with	NULL
words	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
We	NULL
're	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
verge	NULL

Do	NULL
you	NULL
intend	NULL

let	NULL
me	NULL
pull	NULL
things	NULL
together	NULL

If	NULL
not	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
retire	NULL
to	NULL
Hendon	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
jointure	NULL

"	NULL

(	NULL
Hendon	NULL
represented	NULL
a	NULL
convent	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
occasionally	NULL
went	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
retreat	NULL
"	NULL
in	NULL
Catholic	NULL
circles	NULL
.	NULL
)	NULL

And	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
Edward	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
--	NULL
absolutely	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
money	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
blued	NULL
"	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
tables	NULL

It	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
million	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
about	NULL
La	NULL
Dolciquita	NULL
or	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
off	NULL
yachting	NULL
or	NULL
had	NULL
stayed	NULL
at	NULL
Monte	NULL
Carlo	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
dumb	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
just	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
hole	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
talk	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
much	NULL
about	NULL
English	NULL
legal	NULL
procedure	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
,	NULL
give	NULL
technical	NULL
details	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
they	NULL
tied	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
her	NULL
having	NULL
said	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
reported	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
attorney	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
the	NULL
trustees	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
called	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
property	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
landlord	NULL
and	NULL
father	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
then	NULL
had	NULL
three	NULL
thousand	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
disposal	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
occupied	NULL
Edward	NULL
with	NULL
getting	NULL
himself	NULL
transferred	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
regiment	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
Burma	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
herself	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
interview	NULL
,	NULL
lasting	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
land-steward	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
estate	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
yield	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
last	NULL
penny	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
they	NULL
left	NULL
for	NULL
India	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
let	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
for	NULL
seven	NULL
years	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
thousand	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sold	NULL
two	NULL
Vandykes	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
silver	NULL
for	NULL
eleven	NULL
thousand	NULL
pounds	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
raised	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
mortgage	NULL
,	NULL
twenty-nine	NULL
thousand	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
money-lending	NULL
friends	NULL
in	NULL
Monte	NULL
Carlo	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
twenty-nine	NULL
thousand	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
regard	NULL
the	NULL
Vandykes	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
silver	NULL
as	NULL
things	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
replace	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
just	NULL
frills	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
vanity	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
cried	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
disappearance	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
ancestors	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
wished	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
teach	NULL
her	NULL
anything	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
lessened	NULL
such	NULL
esteem	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
also	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
affected	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
physical	NULL
soiling	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
bad	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
belonging	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
prostitute	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
affect	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
dare	NULL
say	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
bad	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
Spanish	NULL
dancer	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
eight	NULL
years	NULL
in	NULL
India	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
insisted	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
self-supporting	NULL
--	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
Captain	NULL
's	NULL
pay	NULL
,	NULL
plus	NULL
the	NULL
extra	NULL
allowance	NULL
for	NULL
being	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
five	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
for	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
frills	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
called	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
considered	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
him	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
him	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
buying	NULL
him	NULL
expensive	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
instance	NULL
,	NULL
spoken	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
leather	NULL
cases	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
manifestations	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
clean	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
preferred	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
threadbare	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
never	NULL
understood	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
pigskin	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
reward	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
putting	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
speculation	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
eleven	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
threadbare	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
called	NULL
Simla	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
cool	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
social	NULL
--	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
Simla	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
healths	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
him	NULL
prancing	NULL
around	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
say	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
United	NULL
States	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
thousand-dollar	NULL
horse	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
gladdest	NULL
of	NULL
glad	NULL
rags	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
herself	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
"	NULL
retreat	NULL
"	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
health	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
very	NULL
inexpensive	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
probably	NULL
also	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
health	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
pranced	NULL
about	NULL
mostly	NULL
with	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
nice	NULL
woman	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
mistress	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
heard	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
gather	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
carried	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
high	NULL
romantic	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
proper	NULL
to	NULL
both	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Edward	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
seems	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
tender	NULL
and	NULL
gentle	NULL
soul	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
without	NULL
character	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
job	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
what	NULL
Edward	NULL
wanted	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
I	NULL
figured	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
those	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
wanted	NULL
long	NULL
passages	NULL
of	NULL
deep	NULL
affection	NULL
kept	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
long	NULL
talks	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
every	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
they	NULL
"	NULL
fell	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
Edward	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL
for	NULL
remorse	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
excuse	NULL
to	NULL
lend	NULL
the	NULL
Major	NULL
another	NULL
fifty	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
considered	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
"	NULL
falling	NULL
"	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
just	NULL
pitied	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
something	NULL
during	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
absolutely	NULL
dumb	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
live	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
unless	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
an	NULL
inhabitant	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
North	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
State	NULL
of	NULL
Maine	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
Leonora	NULL
imagined	NULL
the	NULL
cheerful	NULL
device	NULL
of	NULL
letting	NULL
him	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
accounts	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
estate	NULL
and	NULL
discussing	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
discuss	NULL
them	NULL
much	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
behave	NULL
prettily	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
old	NULL
Mr	NULL
Mumford	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
farmer	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
pay	NULL
his	NULL
rent	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
threw	NULL
Edward	NULL
into	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
's	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
came	NULL
upon	NULL
Edward	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dusk	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Burmese	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
flowers	NULL
and	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
cutting	NULL
up	NULL
that	NULL
crop	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
sword	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
walking-stick	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
carrying	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL
cursing	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
ascertained	NULL
that	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
called	NULL
Mumford	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
ejected	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
farm	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
given	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
cottage	NULL
rent-free	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
lived	NULL
on	NULL
ten	NULL
shillings	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
farmers	NULL
'	NULL
benevolent	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
supplemented	NULL
by	NULL
seven	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
allowed	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
trustees	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
fact	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
estate	NULL
accounts	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
dressing-room	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
them	NULL
before	NULL
taking	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
marching-kit	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
sword	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
considered	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
unusually	NULL
generous	NULL
to	NULL
old	NULL
Mr	NULL
Mumford	NULL
in	NULL
allowing	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
inhabit	NULL
a	NULL
cottage	NULL
,	NULL
rent-free	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
giving	NULL
him	NULL
seven	NULL
shillings	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
as	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
passionately	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
longing	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
sympathy	NULL
and	NULL
admiration	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
as	NULL
deep	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Burmese	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
pale	NULL
sky	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
sheaves	NULL
of	NULL
severed	NULL
vegetation	NULL
,	NULL
misty	NULL
and	NULL
odorous	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
around	NULL
their	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
they	NULL
behaved	NULL
themselves	NULL
with	NULL
decorum	NULL
for	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
spent	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
hours	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
accounts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
estate	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
every	NULL
field	NULL
by	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
huge	NULL
map	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
lands	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
harness-room	NULL
and	NULL
Major	NULL
Basil	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
people	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
mind	NULL
much	NULL
in	NULL
lonely	NULL
stations	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
lasted	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
Major	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
brevet-colonel	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
shuffling	NULL
of	NULL
troops	NULL
that	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
South	NULL
African	NULL
War	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
sent	NULL
off	NULL
somewhere	NULL
else	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
stay	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
ought	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Transvaal	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
killed	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Leonora	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
awful	NULL
stories	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
extravagance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hussar	NULL
regiment	NULL
in	NULL
war-time	NULL
--	NULL
how	NULL
they	NULL
left	NULL
hundred-bottle	NULL
cases	NULL
of	NULL
champagne	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
five	NULL
guineas	NULL
a	NULL
bottle	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
veldt	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
preferred	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
spending	NULL
his	NULL
five	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
grievance	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
deeds	NULL
of	NULL
heroism	NULL
sort	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sniped	NULL
at	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hills	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
North	NULL
Western	NULL
frontier	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
shot	NULL
at	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
tophat	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
spruit	NULL
.	NULL

Those	NULL
are	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
he	NULL
quite	NULL
distinguished	NULL
himself	NULL
over	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
D.S.O.	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
brevet-major	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
keen	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
soldiering	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
hated	NULL
also	NULL
his	NULL
deeds	NULL
of	NULL
heroism	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
bitterest	NULL
quarrels	NULL
came	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Red	NULL
Sea	NULL
,	NULL
jumped	NULL
overboard	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
troopship	NULL
and	NULL
rescued	NULL
a	NULL
private	NULL
soldier	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stood	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
complimented	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
Red	NULL
Sea	NULL
was	NULL
awful	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
trip	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
private	NULL
soldiers	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
develop	NULL
a	NULL
suicidal	NULL
craze	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
nerves	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
figured	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
trip	NULL
,	NULL
jumping	NULL
overboard	NULL
every	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
mere	NULL
cry	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
Man	NULL
overboard	NULL
"	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
,	NULL
alarming	NULL
and	NULL
disturbing	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
ship	NULL
gets	NULL
stopped	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
shouts	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Edward	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
promise	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
fortunately	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
struck	NULL
a	NULL
streak	NULL
of	NULL
cooler	NULL
weather	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Persian	NULL
Gulf	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
commit	NULL
suicide	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
guess	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
pretty	NULL
awful	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
promise	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
ought	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
troopship	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
there	NULL
somehow	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
economy	NULL
.	NULL

Major	NULL
Basil	NULL
discovered	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
relation	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sent	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
other	NULL
station	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
blackmailer	NULL
's	NULL
adroitness	NULL
or	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
trick	NULL
of	NULL
destiny	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
or	NULL
he	NULL
may	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
about	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
letters	NULL
and	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
cost	NULL
Edward	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
immediately	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
arranged	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
imagine	NULL
how	NULL
even	NULL
a	NULL
blackmailer	NULL
can	NULL
make	NULL
his	NULL
demands	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
some	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
saving	NULL
your	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
figure	NULL
the	NULL
Major	NULL
as	NULL
disclosing	NULL
the	NULL
letters	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
with	NULL
furious	NULL
oaths	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
accepting	NULL
his	NULL
explanations	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
letters	NULL
were	NULL
perfectly	NULL
innocent	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
construction	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
put	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
Major	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
old	NULL
chap	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
deuced	NULL
hard	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

Could	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
lend	NULL
me	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
fancy	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
year	NULL
by	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Major	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
deuced	NULL
hard	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
Edward	NULL
lend	NULL
him	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
?	NULL

Edward	NULL
was	NULL
pretty	NULL
hard	NULL
hit	NULL
when	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
really	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
remained	NULL
faithful	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
memory	NULL
for	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
had	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
and	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
cherish	NULL
a	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
reunion	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Three	NULL
days	NULL
ago	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
quite	NULL
proper	NULL
but	NULL
very	NULL
lamentable	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
asking	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
given	NULL
particulars	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
advertisement	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
Indian	NULL
paper	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL
woman	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
were	NULL
moved	NULL
somewhere	NULL
up	NULL
towards	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
district	NULL
called	NULL
Chitral	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
at	NULL
geography	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Indian	NULL
Empire	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
model	NULL
couple	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
never	NULL
spoke	NULL
in	NULL
private	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
even	NULL
showing	NULL
the	NULL
accounts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
estate	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
piled	NULL
up	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
on	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
five	NULL
or	NULL
six	NULL
years	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
penetrated	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
painful	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
on	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
accounts	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
estate	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
hand	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
management	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
kindness	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
Chitral	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
little	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
came	NULL
along	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
unsettling	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
affairs	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
suspect	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
inconstant	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
affair	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Dolciquita	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sized	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
attack	NULL
of	NULL
madness	NULL
like	NULL
hydrophobia	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
relations	NULL
with	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
imply	NULL
moral	NULL
turpitude	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
gross	NULL
kind	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
husband	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
complaisant	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
really	NULL
loved	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
cruel	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
soul-mate	NULL
,	NULL
separated	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
unkind	NULL
fate	NULL
--	NULL
something	NULL
sentimental	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
whilst	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
writing	NULL
long	NULL
weekly	NULL
letters	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
furiously	NULL
impatient	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
missed	NULL
seeing	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
discovered	NULL
himself	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
doorways	NULL
with	NULL
impatience	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
disliked	NULL
her	NULL
boy	NULL
husband	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
hours	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
unearthly	NULL
hours	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
later	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
walk	NULL
with	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
discovered	NULL
himself	NULL
using	NULL
little	NULL
slang	NULL
words	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
used	NULL
and	NULL
attaching	NULL
a	NULL
sentimental	NULL
value	NULL
to	NULL
those	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
discoveries	NULL
that	NULL
came	NULL
so	NULL
late	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
drift	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
losing	NULL
weight	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
fall	NULL
in	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
touches	NULL
of	NULL
bad	NULL
fever	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
described	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
pipped	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
ghastly	NULL
hot	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
suddenly	NULL
heard	NULL
himself	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
we	NULL
take	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
with	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
merely	NULL
been	NULL
standing	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
illustrated	NULL
paper	NULL
,	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

Dinner	NULL
was	NULL
twenty	NULL
minutes	NULL
late	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
alone	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
framing	NULL
that	NULL
speech	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
been	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
silent	NULL
agony	NULL
of	NULL
fear	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
longing	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
heat	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
Maisie	NULL

going	NULL

remain	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL

The	NULL

swished	NULL

Leonora	NULL

exhausted	NULL

motionless	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL

neither	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
both	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
very	NULL
ill	NULL
in	NULL
indefinite	NULL
ways	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Leonora	NULL
said	NULL

promised	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL

Edward	NULL
just	NULL
saved	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
saying	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Good	NULL
God	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
Leonora	NULL
knew	NULL
--	NULL
about	NULL
Maisie	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
about	NULL
La	NULL
Dolciquita	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
enigmatic	NULL
situation	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
intending	NULL
to	NULL
manage	NULL
his	NULL
loves	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
managed	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
affairs	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
more	NULL
hateful	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
more	NULL
worthy	NULL
of	NULL
respect	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
managed	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
purpose	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
several	NULL
years	NULL
--	NULL
about	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
twenty-two	NULL
thousand	NULL
pounds	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
land	NULL
and	NULL
seven	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
letting	NULL

Branshaw	NULL
furnished	NULL

By	NULL
fortunate	NULL
investments	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Edward	NULL
had	NULL
helped	NULL
her	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
another	NULL
six	NULL

seven	NULL
thousand	NULL

might	NULL
well	NULL
become	NULL
more	NULL

The	NULL
mortgages	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
paid	NULL
off	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
departure	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
Vandykes	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
silver	NULL

they	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
off	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
Dolciquita	NULL
had	NULL
acted	NULL
the	NULL
locust	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
great	NULL
achievement	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
laid	NULL
the	NULL
figures	NULL
before	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
maintained	NULL
an	NULL
unbroken	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
propose	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL

resign	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Army	NULL

that	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL

Branshaw	NULL

We	NULL
are	NULL
both	NULL
too	NULL
ill	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
here	NULL
any	NULL
longer	NULL

"	NULL

Edward	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
This	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Leonora	NULL
continued	NULL
passionlessly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
life	NULL

"	NULL

Edward	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
have	NULL
managed	NULL
the	NULL
job	NULL
amazingly	NULL

You	NULL
are	NULL
a	NULL
wonderful	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
leave	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
behind	NULL

That	NULL
thought	NULL
occupied	NULL
him	NULL
exclusively	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
must	NULL
,	NULL
undoubtedly	NULL
,	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
ill	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
place	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
management	NULL

the	NULL
whole	NULL

There	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
five	NULL
thousand	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
cared	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
expenditure	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
income	NULL
of	NULL
five	NULL
thousand	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
would	NULL
rouse	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
some	NULL
affection	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
exclusively	NULL
of	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
Maisie	NULL
,	NULL
thousands	NULL
of	NULL
miles	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
seeing	NULL
the	NULL
mountains	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
--	NULL
blue	NULL
mountains	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
and	NULL
sunlit	NULL
plains	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
That	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
generous	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
praise	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
sneer	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
week	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
increasing	NULL
agony	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
those	NULL
mountains	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
sea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
those	NULL
sunlit	NULL
plains	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
between	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
thought	NULL
shook	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
burning	NULL
nights	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
sweat	NULL
poured	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
trembled	NULL
with	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
burning	NULL
noons	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
minute	NULL
's	NULL
rest	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
bowels	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
and	NULL
round	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
his	NULL
tongue	NULL
was	NULL
perpetually	NULL
dry	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
breath	NULL
between	NULL
his	NULL
teeth	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
air	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
pest-house	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
gave	NULL
no	NULL
thought	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
papers	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
that	NULL
place	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
support	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
horrible	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
relationship	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
whatever	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
caused	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
hate	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hated	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
proposed	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
Lord	NULL
of	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
again	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
dummy	NULL
lord	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
swaddling	NULL
clothes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
this	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
separate	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
.	NULL

Hatred	NULL
hung	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
heavy	NULL
nights	NULL
and	NULL
filled	NULL
the	NULL
shadowy	NULL
corners	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
offered	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Maidan	NULL
boy	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
to	NULL
Europe	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
automatically	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
her	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
other	NULL
than	NULL
cruel	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
accident	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
act	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
were	NULL
kind	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
horrible	NULL
situation	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
cool	NULL
breezes	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ocean	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
clear	NULL
up	NULL
that	NULL
hatred	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
curtain	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
admiration	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
respect	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
agreeableness	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
money	NULL
lavishly	NULL
at	NULL
command	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
companionship	NULL
of	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
--	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
starving	NULL
and	NULL
scraping	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
insisted	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
ease	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
even	NULL
radiantly	NULL
happy	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
carried	NULL
cups	NULL
of	NULL
bouillon	NULL
for	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
deck	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
leaning	NULL
beside	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
ship	NULL
's	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
suddenly	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
By	NULL
jove	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
the	NULL
finest	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wish	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
friends	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
just	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
cabin	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
in	NULL
health	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
give	NULL
you	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
difficult	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
preserved	NULL
an	NULL
unchanged	NULL
front	NULL
,	NULL
changed	NULL
very	NULL
frequently	NULL
her	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
drilled	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
tradition	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
upbringing	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
shut	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
near	NULL
yielding	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
temptation	NULL
of	NULL
speaking	NULL
that	NULL
afterwards	NULL
she	NULL
shuddered	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
times	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
must	NULL
postulate	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
desired	NULL
above	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
a	NULL
shut	NULL
mouth	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
;	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
loved	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
despise	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
unfaithfulness	NULL
with	NULL
La	NULL
Dolciquita	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
acted	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
wife	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
intended	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
herself	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
principle	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
spiritual	NULL
advisers	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
,	NULL
forbade	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
stipulated	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
symbolical	NULL
,	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
clear	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
;	NULL
probably	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
moments	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
coming	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
moments	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
hair	NULL
of	NULL
yielding	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
physical	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
moments	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
almost	NULL
yielded	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
temptation	NULL
to	NULL
denounce	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
or	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
to	NULL
hers	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
desired	NULL
then	NULL
to	NULL
cause	NULL
the	NULL
horrors	NULL
and	NULL
pains	NULL
of	NULL
public	NULL
scandals	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
watching	NULL
Edward	NULL
more	NULL
intently	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
straining	NULL
of	NULL
ears	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
cat	NULL
bestows	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
bird	NULL
overhead	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
progress	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
ladies	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
doors	NULL
and	NULL
gateways	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
tranquillities	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
received	NULL
satisfactions	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
times	NULL
she	NULL
imagined	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
was	NULL
warranted	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
carrying	NULL
on	NULL
intrigues	NULL
with	NULL
other	NULL
women	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
;	NULL
with	NULL
three	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
whole	NULL
periods	NULL
she	NULL
imagined	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
monster	NULL
of	NULL
libertinage	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
anything	NULL
against	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
liberty	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
starving	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
build	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
fortunes	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
allowed	NULL
herself	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
joys	NULL
of	NULL
femininity	NULL
--	NULL
no	NULL
dresses	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
jewels	NULL
--	NULL
hardly	NULL
even	NULL
friendships	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
fear	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
cost	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
oddly	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
but	NULL
be	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
both	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
and	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
were	NULL
nice	NULL
women	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
curious	NULL
,	NULL
discounting	NULL
eye	NULL
which	NULL
one	NULL
woman	NULL
can	NULL
turn	NULL
on	NULL
another	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
prevent	NULL
her	NULL
seeing	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
seemed	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
monstrous	NULL
and	NULL
incomprehensible	NULL
working	NULL
of	NULL
Fate	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

Incomprehensible	NULL
!	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
herself	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
deeds	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
ever	NULL
come	NULL
through	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
appear	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
good	NULL
deeds	NULL
?	NULL

By	NULL
what	NULL
trick	NULL
of	NULL
mania	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
he	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
good	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
was	NULL
?	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
extraordinarily	NULL
dissimilar	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
soft	NULL
mournful	NULL
voice	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
kindness	NULL
of	NULL
manner	NULL
for	NULL
every	NULL
created	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
punkah	NULL
men	NULL
to	NULL
flowers	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
read	NULL
as	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
in	NULL
learned	NULL
books	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
stand	NULL
novels	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
differences	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
appear	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
to	NULL
differ	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
from	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
truthful	NULL
,	NULL
honest	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
vague	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
women	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
after	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
of	NULL
close	NULL
intercourse	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
kindness	NULL
should	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
appeal	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
soft	NULL
and	NULL
mournful	NULL
voice	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
thrill	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
tall	NULL
darkness	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
the	NULL
illusion	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
unexplored	NULL
wood	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
how	NULL
Edward	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
maundering	NULL
over	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
continue	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
her	NULL
long	NULL
letters	NULL
after	NULL
their	NULL
separation	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
bad	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
period	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
call	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
monstrous	NULL
"	NULL
theory	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
imagining	NULL
him	NULL
ogling	NULL
at	NULL
every	NULL
woman	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
across	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
"	NULL
retreat	NULL
"	NULL
at	NULL
Simla	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
corrupt	NULL
her	NULL
maid	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
absence	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
imagined	NULL
him	NULL
carrying	NULL
on	NULL
intrigues	NULL
with	NULL
native	NULL
women	NULL
or	NULL
Eurasians	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
dances	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fever	NULL
of	NULL
watchfulness	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
persuaded	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
dread	NULL
of	NULL
scandals	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
might	NULL
get	NULL
himself	NULL
mixed	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
marriageable	NULL
daughter	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
row	NULL
or	NULL
some	NULL
husband	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
really	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
acknowledged	NULL
afterwards	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
hoping	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
being	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
when	NULL
Edward	NULL
should	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
that	NULL
period	NULL
she	NULL
passed	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
agony	NULL
of	NULL
jealousy	NULL
and	NULL
fear	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
fear	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
might	NULL
really	NULL
become	NULL
promiscuous	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
habits	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
odd	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
when	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
came	NULL
along	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
realized	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
been	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
husbands	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
scandals	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
Maisie	NULL
's	NULL
husband	NULL
unsuspicious	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
appear	NULL
so	NULL
trustful	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
that	NULL
Maidan	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
possibly	NULL
have	NULL
any	NULL
suspicions	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
evil	NULL
position	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
ill	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
smile	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
smile	NULL
again	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
agency	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
return	NULL
,	NULL
through	NULL
gratitude	NULL
and	NULL
satisfied	NULL
love	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
and	NULL
fleeting	NULL
passions	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
understand	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
Maisie	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
Maisie	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
women	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
other	NULL
women	NULL
will	NULL
allow	NULL
magnetism	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
pretty	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
young	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
gay	NULL
and	NULL
light	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
Maisie	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
enough	NULL
of	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
manage	NULL
this	NULL
affair	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Maisie	NULL
's	NULL
being	NULL
led	NULL
into	NULL
adultery	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
take	NULL
Maisie	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
to	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
enough	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
pretty	NULL
little	NULL
chatterings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pretty	NULL
little	NULL
motions	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
trust	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
any	NULL
doubt	NULL
of	NULL
Maisie	NULL
's	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
raved	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
as	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
girls	NULL
rave	NULL
about	NULL
drawing	NULL
masters	NULL
in	NULL
schools	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
perpetually	NULL
asking	NULL
her	NULL
boy	NULL
husband	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
ride	NULL
,	NULL
shoot	NULL
,	NULL
play	NULL
polo	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
recite	NULL
sentimental	NULL
poems	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
their	NULL
major	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
young	NULL
Maidan	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
admiration	NULL
for	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
adored	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
bewildered	NULL
by	NULL
and	NULL
entirely	NULL
trusted	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
devoted	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
poor	NULL
Maisie	NULL
was	NULL
cured	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
enough	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
vague	NULL
,	NULL
passionate	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Edward	NULL
had	NULL
exhausted	NULL
a	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
types	NULL
of	NULL
women	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
turn	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
her	NULL
type	NULL
have	NULL
its	NULL
turn	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
understood	NULL
him	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
understood	NULL
better	NULL
his	NULL
vanities	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
making	NULL
him	NULL
happier	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
arouse	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

Florence	NULL
knocked	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
...	NULL

I	NULL
I	NULL
HAVE	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL

told	NULL
this	NULL

way	NULL

that	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL

difficult	NULL

I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
stuck	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
country	NULL
cottage	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
silent	NULL
listener	NULL
,	NULL
hearing	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
gusts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
and	NULL
amidst	NULL
the	NULL
noises	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
distant	NULL
sea	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
comes	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
one	NULL
discusses	NULL
an	NULL
affair	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
sad	NULL
affair	NULL
--	NULL
one	NULL
goes	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
goes	NULL
forward	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
remembers	NULL
points	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
has	NULL
forgotten	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
explains	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
minutely	NULL
since	NULL
one	NULL
recognizes	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
has	NULL
forgotten	NULL
to	NULL
mention	NULL
them	NULL

their	NULL
proper	NULL

that	NULL
one	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
omitting	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
false	NULL
impression	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
console	NULL
myself	NULL
with	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
story	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL

real	NULL
stories	NULL
are	NULL
probably	NULL
told	NULL
best	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
telling	NULL
a	NULL
story	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
will	NULL
then	NULL
seem	NULL
most	NULL
real	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
brought	NULL
my	NULL
story	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
date	NULL
of	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
mean	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
explained	NULL
everything	NULL
that	NULL
went	NULL
before	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
several	NULL
points	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
necessary	NULL
--	NULL
from	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL

from	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
extent	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
trouble	NULL
of	NULL
finding	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
points	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
ascertain	NULL
or	NULL
put	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
me	NULL
imagine	NULL
myself	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
Maisie	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL

or	NULL
rather	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
dissertation	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Protest	NULL
,	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
Castle	NULL

the	NULL
town	NULL
of	NULL
M	NULL
----	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
us	NULL
consider	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
with	NULL
regard	NULL
to	NULL
Florence	NULL
;	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
give	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Edward	NULL
naturally	NULL
never	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
affair	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

(	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
follows	NULL
,	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
hard	NULL
on	NULL
Florence	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
writing	NULL
away	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
story	NULL
now	NULL
for	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
and	NULL
reflecting	NULL
longer	NULL
and	NULL
longer	NULL
upon	NULL
these	NULL
affairs	NULL
.	NULL
)	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
longer	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
certain	NULL
I	NULL
become	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
contaminating	NULL
influence	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
depressed	NULL
and	NULL
deteriorated	NULL
poor	NULL
Edward	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
deteriorated	NULL
,	NULL
hopelessly	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
miserable	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
caused	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
character	NULL
to	NULL
deteriorate	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
point	NULL
about	NULL
Leonora	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
proud	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
pride	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
silence	NULL
broke	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
that	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
outburst	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shadowy	NULL
room	NULL
that	NULL
contained	NULL
the	NULL
Protest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
terrace	NULL
looking	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
a	NULL
wrong	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
doing	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
warn	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
eyes	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
reflected	NULL
longer	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
spoken	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
after	NULL
reflection	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
better	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
acted	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
instance	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
chaperoned	NULL
Florence	NULL
that	NULL
private	NULL
communication	NULL
between	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
became	NULL
impossible	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
eavesdropping	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
watched	NULL
outside	NULL
bedroom	NULL
doors	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
odious	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
the	NULL
job	NULL
is	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
Edward	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
Maisie	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
acted	NULL
wrongly	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
condemn	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
matter	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
?	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
Florence	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
...	NULL
Still	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
woman	NULL
than	NULL
my	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
Florence	NULL
was	NULL
vulgar	NULL
;	NULL
Florence	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
common	NULL
flirt	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
lacher	NULL
prise	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Florence	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
unstoppable	NULL
talker	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
stop	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
nothing	NULL
would	NULL
stop	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
proud	NULL
and	NULL
reserved	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

Pride	NULL
and	NULL
reserve	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
;	NULL
perhaps	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
your	NULL
particular	NULL
virtues	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
go	NULL
all	NULL
to	NULL
pieces	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
let	NULL
them	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
let	NULL
them	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
let	NULL
them	NULL
go	NULL
before	NULL
poor	NULL
Edward	NULL
did	NULL
even	NULL
.	NULL

Consider	NULL
her	NULL
position	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
burst	NULL
out	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
Luther-Protest	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Consider	NULL
her	NULL
agonies	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
are	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
main	NULL
passion	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
Edward	NULL
back	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
despaired	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
may	NULL
seem	NULL
ignoble	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
also	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
getting	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
represented	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
victory	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
victory	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
wives	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
victory	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
Church	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
presented	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
things	NULL
are	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
inscrutable	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
the	NULL
getting	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
represented	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
victory	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
wives	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Society	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
Church	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
,	NULL
maybe	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
glimmering	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
life	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
perpetual	NULL
sex-battle	NULL
between	NULL
husbands	NULL
who	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
unfaithful	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
wives	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wives	NULL
who	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
recapture	NULL
their	NULL
husbands	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
sad	NULL
and	NULL
modest	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
matrimony	NULL
.	NULL

Man	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
brute	NULL
who	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
his	NULL
divagations	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
moments	NULL
of	NULL
excess	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
nights	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
,	NULL
let	NULL
us	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
rutting	NULL
seasons	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
few	NULL
novels	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
pure	NULL
and	NULL
constant	NULL
love	NULL
succeeding	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
wedding	NULL
bells	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
presented	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
numbed	NULL
and	NULL
terrified	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Mother	NULL
Superior	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
childhood	NULL
's	NULL
convent	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
tale	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
infidelities	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Spanish	NULL
dancer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
nun	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
infinitely	NULL
wise	NULL
,	NULL
mystic	NULL
and	NULL
reverend	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
shake	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
sadly	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Men	NULL
are	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL
blessing	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
all	NULL
come	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
put	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
spiritual	NULL
advisers	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
programme	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
their	NULL
teachings	NULL
came	NULL
through	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
lesson	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
taught	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
women	NULL
was	NULL
patience	NULL
and	NULL
patience	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
patience	NULL
--	NULL
ad	NULL
majorem	NULL
Dei	NULL
gloriam	NULL
--	NULL
until	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
appointed	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
God	NULL
saw	NULL
fit	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
her	NULL
reward	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
getting	NULL
Edward	NULL
back	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
kept	NULL
her	NULL
man	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
limits	NULL
that	NULL
are	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
wifehood	NULL
has	NULL
to	NULL
expect	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
even	NULL
taught	NULL
that	NULL
such	NULL
excesses	NULL
in	NULL
men	NULL
are	NULL
natural	NULL
,	NULL
excusable	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
scandal	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
congregation	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
clung	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
Edward	NULL
back	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
fierce	NULL
passion	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
agony	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
way	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
occupied	NULL
herself	NULL
solely	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
idea	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
Edward	NULL
appear	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
get	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
wealthy	NULL
,	NULL
glorious	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
lands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
upright	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
show	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
unfaithful	NULL
world	NULL
one	NULL
Catholic	NULL
woman	NULL
had	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
retaining	NULL
the	NULL
fidelity	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
near	NULL
her	NULL
desires	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
plan	NULL
with	NULL
regard	NULL
to	NULL
Maisie	NULL
had	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
working	NULL
admirably	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
cooling	NULL
off	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
hunger	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
every	NULL
minute	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
at	NULL
Nauheirn	NULL
beside	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
's	NULL
recumbent	NULL
form	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
polo	NULL
matches	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
played	NULL
auction	NULL
bridge	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evenings	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
cheerful	NULL
and	NULL
bright	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
seduce	NULL
that	NULL
poor	NULL
child	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
dropping	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
Maisie	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
attentive	NULL
,	NULL
superior	NULL
officer	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
regiment	NULL
,	NULL
paying	NULL
gallant	NULL
attentions	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
bride	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
open	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
little	NULL
flirtations	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
dayspring	NULL
from	NULL
on	NULL
high	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Maisie	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
fret	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
off	NULL
on	NULL
excursions	NULL
with	NULL
us	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
lie	NULL
down	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
hours	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
bed	NULL
every	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
crave	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
attentions	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
at	NULL
those	NULL
times	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
little	NULL
advances	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
private	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
often	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
before	NULL
people	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
How	NULL
nice	NULL
you	NULL
look	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

or	NULL
"	NULL
What	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
dress	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
with	NULL
Florence	NULL
to	NULL
Frankfurt	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
dress	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL
gown	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
afford	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Florence	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
adviser	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
dress	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
clue	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
riddle	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
clue	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
riddle	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
imagined	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
extent	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
kept	NULL
Edward	NULL
on	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
tight	NULL
rein	NULL
with	NULL
regard	NULL
to	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
tack	NULL
in	NULL
letting	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
only	NULL
with	NULL
fear	NULL
and	NULL
irresolution	NULL
--	NULL
have	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
control	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
income	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
even	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
acknowledged	NULL
,	NULL
spontaneously	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
husbanding	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
resources	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
've	NULL
done	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
old	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
's	NULL
nothing	NULL
I	NULL
like	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
to	NULL
chuck	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
thanks	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
happiest	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
seeming	NULL
to	NULL
realize	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
ventured	NULL
to	NULL
pat	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
shoulder	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
ostensibly	NULL
,	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
borrow	NULL
a	NULL
safety-pin	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
boxing	NULL
Maisie	NULL
's	NULL
ears	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
riveted	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
intrigue	NULL
between	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Maidan	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
henceforward	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
him	NULL
well	NULL
supplied	NULL
with	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
amused	NULL
with	NULL
pretty	NULL
girls	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
that	NULL
month	NULL
she	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
repelled	NULL
his	NULL
timid	NULL
advances	NULL
that	NULL
never	NULL
went	NULL
very	NULL
far	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
he	NULL
certainly	NULL
made	NULL
timid	NULL
advances	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
patted	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
shoulder	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
whispered	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
ear	NULL
little	NULL
jokes	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
odd	NULL
figures	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
saw	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Casino	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
joke	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
whispering	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
precious	NULL
intimacy	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
--	NULL
smash	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
went	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
pieces	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
when	NULL
Florence	NULL
laid	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
upon	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
wrist	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
lay	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
glass	NULL
sheltering	NULL
the	NULL
manuscript	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Protest	NULL
,	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
tower	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
shutters	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
sunlight	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
streamed	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
went	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
noticed	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
in	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
gazed	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
look	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
--	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
meeting	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
all	NULL
sitting	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
together	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
eyes	NULL
at	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
women	NULL
make	NULL
eyes	NULL
at	NULL
Edward	NULL
--	NULL
hundreds	NULL
and	NULL
hundreds	NULL
of	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
railway	NULL
trains	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
hotels	NULL
,	NULL
aboard	NULL
liners	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
street	NULL
corners	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
took	NULL
little	NULL
stock	NULL
in	NULL
women	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
eyes	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
formed	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
fairly	NULL
correct	NULL
estimate	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
methods	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
reasons	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
loves	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
hitherto	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
consisted	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
short	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Dolciquita	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
deemed	NULL
the	NULL
pretty	NULL
courtship	NULL
of	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
she	NULL
despised	NULL
Florence	NULL
so	NULL
haughtily	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
imagine	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
being	NULL
attracted	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
Maisie	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
bulwark	NULL
round	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
,	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
on	NULL
Florence	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
Florence	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
boxed	NULL
Maisie	NULL
's	NULL
ears	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
desperately	NULL
desired	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
union	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
should	NULL
appear	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
flawless	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
went	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
the	NULL
answering	NULL
gaze	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
into	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
blue	NULL
and	NULL
uplifted	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
gaze	NULL
meant	NULL
that	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
conversations	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
intimate	NULL
kind	NULL
--	NULL
about	NULL
their	NULL
likes	NULL
and	NULL
dislikes	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
their	NULL
natures	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
their	NULL
views	NULL
of	NULL
marriage	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
meant	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
all	NULL
four	NULL
walked	NULL
out	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
ten	NULL
yards	NULL
ahead	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
imagine	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
further	NULL
than	NULL
talks	NULL
about	NULL
their	NULL
likes	NULL
and	NULL
dislikes	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
their	NULL
natures	NULL
or	NULL
about	NULL
marriage	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
institution	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
watched	NULL
Edward	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
laying	NULL
on	NULL
of	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
answering	NULL
of	NULL
gaze	NULL
with	NULL
gaze	NULL
,	NULL
meant	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
unavoidable	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
serious	NULL
person	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
attempt	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
part	NULL
to	NULL
separate	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
rivet	NULL
on	NULL
Edward	NULL
an	NULL
irrevocable	NULL
passion	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
before	NULL
told	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
trick	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
nature	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
seducing	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
an	NULL
irrevocable	NULL
hold	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
touching	NULL
of	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
that	NULL
woman	NULL
an	NULL
irrevocable	NULL
claim	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
seduced	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
so	NULL
despised	NULL
Florence	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
preferred	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
parlour-maid	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
very	NULL
decent	NULL
parlour-maids	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
the	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
Edward	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
would	NULL
break	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
responsible	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
mad	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
clutched	NULL
me	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
wrist	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
dragged	NULL
me	NULL
down	NULL
those	NULL
stairs	NULL
and	NULL
across	NULL
that	NULL
whispering	NULL
Rittersaal	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
painted	NULL
pillars	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
painted	NULL
chimney-piece	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
guess	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
mad	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Your	NULL
wife	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
harlot	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
my	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
mistress	NULL
.	NULL

.	NULL

.	NULL
"	NULL

That	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
the	NULL
trick	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
madness	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
Florence	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
bolt	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
lose	NULL
forever	NULL
all	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
acted	NULL
very	NULL
badly	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
tortured	NULL
soul	NULL
who	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
Church	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
interests	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Philadelphia	NULL
Quaker	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
is	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
daresay	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
Rome	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
important	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
week	NULL
after	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
mistress	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
waited	NULL
outside	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
met	NULL
Edward	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
grunted	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
guess	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
mental	NULL
deterioration	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
worked	NULL
in	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
smashed	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
whole	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
chances	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
hopeless	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
could	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
vulgar	NULL
intrigue	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
vulgar	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
affair	NULL
with	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
an	NULL
intrigue	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
love	NULL
affair	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
pure	NULL
enough	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
horror	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
wantonness	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
detestable	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
so	NULL
detested	NULL
Florence	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Florence	NULL
talked	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
terrible	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
Florence	NULL
forced	NULL
Leonora	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
abandon	NULL
her	NULL
high	NULL
reserve	NULL
--	NULL
Florence	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
appears	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL
minds	NULL
whether	NULL
to	NULL
confess	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

Confess	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
pitched	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
on	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
me	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
confess	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
guessed	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
"	NULL
heart	NULL
"	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
about	NULL
Jimmy	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
hinting	NULL
and	NULL
hinting	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
enraged	NULL
Leonora	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
extent	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
Leonora	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
mistress	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
use	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
a	NULL
calamity	NULL
for	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
,	NULL
once	NULL
started	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
stopping	NULL
the	NULL
talking	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
stop	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
Edward	NULL
messages	NULL
through	NULL
Florence	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
instance	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
ever	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
intrigue	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
ruin	NULL
him	NULL
beyond	NULL
repair	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
complicated	NULL
matters	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
about	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
treated	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
badly	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
fine	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
mournful	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
longed	NULL
to	NULL
comfort	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
himself	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
blackguard	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
amends	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Florence	NULL
communicated	NULL
these	NULL
items	NULL
of	NULL
information	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
blame	NULL
Leonora	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
coarseness	NULL
to	NULL
Florence	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
Florence	NULL
a	NULL
world	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
blame	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
giving	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
a	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
communicativeness	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
business	NULL
cut	NULL
her	NULL
off	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
Church	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
confess	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
spiritual	NULL
advisers	NULL
would	NULL
blame	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
deceiving	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
rather	NULL
imagine	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
preferred	NULL
damnation	NULL
to	NULL
breaking	NULL
my	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
is	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
works	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
need	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
troubled	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
no	NULL
priests	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
someone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
Florence	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
talked	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
explosive	NULL
sentences	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
damned	NULL
.	NULL

Precisely	NULL
like	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
damned	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
period	NULL
in	NULL
hell	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
earth	NULL
can	NULL
spare	NULL
her	NULL
any	NULL
period	NULL
of	NULL
pain	NULL
in	NULL
Eternity	NULL
--	NULL
where	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
any	NULL
periods	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
guess	NULL
Leonora	NULL
will	NULL
escape	NULL
hell	NULL
fire	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
conversations	NULL
with	NULL
Florence	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
like	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

Florence	NULL
would	NULL
happen	NULL
in	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
whilst	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
her	NULL
wonderful	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
proposition	NULL
from	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
seems	NULL
about	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
conceived	NULL
the	NULL
naïve	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
polygamist	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
daresay	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Florence	NULL
who	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
responsible	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
oddities	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
human	NULL
psychology	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
certainly	NULL
appears	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
about	NULL
that	NULL
date	NULL
Edward	NULL
cared	NULL
more	NULL
for	NULL
Leonora	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
done	NULL
before	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
cards	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
played	NULL
her	NULL
cards	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
shame	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
then	NULL
have	NULL
shared	NULL
Edward	NULL
with	NULL
Florence	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
came	NULL
for	NULL
jerking	NULL
that	NULL
poor	NULL
cuckoo	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
nest	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
Florence	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
such	NULL
proposition	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
baldly	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stood	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
mistress	NULL
until	NULL
Leonora	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
Edward	NULL
coming	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
advanced	NULL
hour	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
checked	NULL
Florence	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
fell	NULL
back	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
"	NULL
heart	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
stuck	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
merely	NULL
been	NULL
conversing	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
frame	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

Florence	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
stick	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
story	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
even	NULL
Florence	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
to	NULL
implore	NULL
Leonora	NULL
to	NULL
grant	NULL
her	NULL
favours	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
admitted	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
mistress	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
pressing	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
something	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
nothing	NULL
else	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
rapprochement	NULL
between	NULL
that	NULL
estranged	NULL
pair	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
Florence	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
babbling	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
brushing	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Leonora	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
suddenly	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
think	NULL
myself	NULL
defiled	NULL
if	NULL
Edward	NULL
touched	NULL
me	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
touched	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

That	NULL
would	NULL
discourage	NULL
Florence	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
another	NULL
morning	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
another	NULL
try	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL
Leonora	NULL
deteriorated	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
promised	NULL
Edward	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
spending	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
income	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
fully	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
daresay	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
too	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
spied	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
banking	NULL
account	NULL
in	NULL
secret	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
Roman	NULL
Catholic	NULL
for	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
so	NULL
serious	NULL
a	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
unfaithfulness	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
memory	NULL
of	NULL
poor	NULL
little	NULL
Maisie	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
trust	NULL
him	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
she	NULL
started	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
worry	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
minutest	NULL
items	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
expenditure	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
allowed	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
cheques	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
hardly	NULL
a	NULL
cheque	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
scrutinize	NULL
--	NULL
except	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
private	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
about	NULL
five	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
tacitly	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
allowed	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
for	NULL
expenditure	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
mistress	NULL
or	NULL
mistresses	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
his	NULL
jaunts	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
expensive	NULL
cables	NULL
in	NULL
cipher	NULL
to	NULL
Florence	NULL
about	NULL
twice	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
worried	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
expenditure	NULL
on	NULL
wines	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
fruit	NULL
trees	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
harness	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
gates	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
account	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
blacksmith	NULL
's	NULL
for	NULL
work	NULL
done	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
patent	NULL
Army	NULL
stirrup	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
invent	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
bother	NULL
to	NULL
invent	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
Army	NULL
stirrup	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
enraged	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
invention	NULL
was	NULL
mature	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
present	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
War	NULL
Office	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
designs	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
patent	NULL
rights	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
remarkably	NULL
good	NULL
stirrup	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
told	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
spent	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
about	NULL
two	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
for	NULL
law	NULL
fees	NULL
on	NULL
getting	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
daughter	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
gardeners	NULL
,	NULL
acquitted	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
charge	NULL
of	NULL
murdering	NULL
her	NULL
baby	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
positively	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
act	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
came	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
Nancy	NULL
Rufford	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
India	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
horrible	NULL
gloom	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
household	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
Edward	NULL
himself	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
agony	NULL
and	NULL
behaving	NULL
as	NULL
prettily	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
even	NULL
then	NULL
Leonora	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
terrible	NULL
scene	NULL
about	NULL
this	NULL
expenditure	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
trouble	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
vague	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
taught	NULL
Edward	NULL
a	NULL
lesson	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
lesson	NULL
of	NULL
economy	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
threatened	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
his	NULL
banking	NULL
account	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
guess	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
cut	NULL
his	NULL
throat	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
stuck	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
otherwise	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
Nancy	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
addition	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
left	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
dreary	NULL
,	NULL
dreary	NULL
succession	NULL
of	NULL
days	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
public	NULL
service	NULL
...	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
finished	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
during	NULL
those	NULL
years	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
love	NULL
affair	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
fellow	NULL
called	NULL
Bayham	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
decent	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
fellow	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
really	NULL
nice	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
success	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
told	NULL
you	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
already	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

II	NULL
WELL	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
about	NULL
brings	NULL
me	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
date	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
receiving	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Waterbury	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
laconic	NULL
cable	NULL
from	NULL
Edward	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
chat	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
pretty	NULL
busy	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
half	NULL
minded	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
reply	NULL
cable	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
start	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
interview	NULL
with	NULL
old	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
's	NULL
attorneys	NULL
and	NULL
immediately	NULL
afterwards	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
interview	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Misses	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
delayed	NULL
cabling	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
Misses	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
excessively	NULL
old	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
nineties	NULL
or	NULL
thereabouts	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
time	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
so	NULL
slowly	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
thirty	NULL
years	NULL
since	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
United	NULL
States	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
twelve	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

Actually	NULL
Miss	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
sixty-one	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Florence	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
fifty-nine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
both	NULL
,	NULL
mentally	NULL
and	NULL
physically	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
vigorous	NULL
as	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
desired	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
vigorous	NULL
,	NULL
mentally	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
suited	NULL
my	NULL
purpose	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
United	NULL
States	NULL
as	NULL
quickly	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Hurlbirds	NULL
were	NULL
an	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
united	NULL
family	NULL
--	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
united	NULL
except	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
set	NULL
of	NULL
points	NULL
.	NULL

Each	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
separate	NULL
doctor	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
they	NULL
trusted	NULL
implicitly	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
each	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
separate	NULL
attorney	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
distrusted	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
's	NULL
doctor	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
's	NULL
attorney	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
naturally	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
doctors	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
attorneys	NULL
warned	NULL
one	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
--	NULL
against	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
imagine	NULL
how	NULL
complicated	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
became	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
attorney	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
--	NULL
recommended	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
by	NULL
young	NULL
Carter	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
Philadelphia	NULL
nephew	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
any	NULL
unpleasantness	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
grasping	NULL
kind	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
problem	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
another	NULL
one	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
moral	NULL
dilemma	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
old	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
property	NULL
to	NULL
Florence	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
mere	NULL
request	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
erected	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
of	NULL
Waterbury	NULL
,	NULL
Ill.	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
memorial	NULL
that	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
institution	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
relief	NULL
of	NULL
sufferers	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

Florence	NULL
's	NULL
money	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
old	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
just	NULL
five	NULL
days	NULL
before	NULL
Florence	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
a	NULL
round	NULL
million	NULL
dollars	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
relief	NULL
of	NULL
sufferers	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
million	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
;	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
worth	NULL
about	NULL
eight	NULL
hundred	NULL
thousand	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
figured	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
cut	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
million	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
ample	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
naturally	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
consult	NULL
the	NULL
wishes	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
surviving	NULL
relatives	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
trouble	NULL
really	NULL
began	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
whatever	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
lungs	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
affected	NULL
all	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
of	NULL
bronchitis	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
struck	NULL
Miss	NULL
Florence	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
of	NULL
lungs	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
lung	NULL
patients	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
considered	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
wished	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
kink	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
insisted	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
all	NULL
to	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
wish	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
monuments	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
family	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
New	NULL
England	NULL
dislike	NULL
for	NULL
necrological	NULL
ostentation	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
figure	NULL
out	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
certain	NULL
insistent	NULL
and	NULL
continued	NULL
questions	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
another	NULL
idea	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
has	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
Florence	NULL
's	NULL
dressing-table	NULL
,	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
dead	NULL
body	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
lain	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
which	NULL
Leonora	NULL
posted	NULL
without	NULL
telling	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
quite	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
without	NULL
making	NULL
some	NULL
comments	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
I	NULL
guess	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
Miss	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
bit	NULL
about	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
scrawled	NULL
words	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
why	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
wish	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
perpetuated	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
also	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
earned	NULL
the	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
meant	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
tidy	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
discussing	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
doctors	NULL
warning	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
bad	NULL
effects	NULL
of	NULL
discussions	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
health	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
ladies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
warning	NULL
me	NULL
covertly	NULL
against	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
old	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
died	NULL
of	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
diagnosis	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
doctor	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
solicitors	NULL
all	NULL
had	NULL
separate	NULL
methods	NULL
of	NULL
arranging	NULL
about	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
invested	NULL
and	NULL
entrusted	NULL
and	NULL
bound	NULL
.	NULL

Personally	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
invest	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
interest	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
used	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
relief	NULL
of	NULL
sufferers	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
old	NULL
Mr	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
died	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
defects	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
organ	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
considered	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
defective	NULL
.	NULL

Moreover	NULL
,	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
certainly	NULL
died	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
when	NULL
Miss	NULL
Florence	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
stood	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
chest	NULL
sufferers	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
chest	NULL
institution	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
advanced	NULL
the	NULL
sum	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
provide	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
million	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
dollars	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
seven	NULL
hundred	NULL
and	NULL
fifty	NULL
thousand	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
class	NULL
of	NULL
invalid	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
money	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
badly	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
I	NULL
wanted	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
Nancy	NULL
Rufford	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
much	NULL
about	NULL
housekeeping	NULL
expenses	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
where	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
presumed	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
needs	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
were	NULL
limited	NULL
to	NULL
good	NULL
chocolates	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
horse	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
simple	NULL
,	NULL
pretty	NULL
frocks	NULL
.	NULL

Probably	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
want	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
later	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
million	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
dollars	NULL
to	NULL
these	NULL
institutions	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
still	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
equivalent	NULL
of	NULL
about	NULL
twenty	NULL
thousand	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
English	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
considered	NULL
that	NULL
Nancy	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
good	NULL
time	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
stiff	NULL
set	NULL
of	NULL
arguments	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
mansion	NULL
which	NULL
stands	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
bluff	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
may	NULL
strike	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
silent	NULL
listener	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
being	NULL
funny	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
European	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
moral	NULL
problems	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
description	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
giving	NULL
of	NULL
millions	NULL
to	NULL
institutions	NULL
are	NULL
immensely	NULL
serious	NULL
matters	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
staple	NULL
topics	NULL
for	NULL
consideration	NULL
amongst	NULL
the	NULL
wealthy	NULL
classes	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL
got	NULL
peerage	NULL
and	NULL
social	NULL
climbing	NULL
to	NULL
occupy	NULL
us	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
decent	NULL
people	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
politics	NULL
or	NULL
elderly	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
sport	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
real	NULL
tears	NULL
shed	NULL
by	NULL
both	NULL
Miss	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Florence	NULL
before	NULL
I	NULL
left	NULL
that	NULL
city	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
left	NULL
it	NULL
quite	NULL
abruptly	NULL
.	NULL

Four	NULL
hours	NULL
after	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
telegram	NULL
came	NULL
another	NULL
from	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
helpful	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
simply	NULL
told	NULL
my	NULL
attorney	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
million	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
invest	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
purposes	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
decided	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Misses	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
pretty	NULL
well	NULL
worn	NULL
out	NULL
by	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
discussions	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
heard	NULL
yet	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Misses	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
rather	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
,	NULL
either	NULL
by	NULL
revelations	NULL
or	NULL
by	NULL
moral	NULL
force	NULL
,	NULL
has	NULL
persuaded	NULL
Miss	NULL
Florence	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
memorial	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
names	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
erected	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
of	NULL
Waterbury	NULL
,	NULL
Conn	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Hurlbird	NULL
wept	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
any	NULL
comments	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
date	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
niece	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
seduced	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
fellow	NULL
Jimmy	NULL
before	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
contrived	NULL
to	NULL
produce	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
model	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
date	NULL
I	NULL
still	NULL
believed	NULL
that	NULL
Florence	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
perfectly	NULL
virtuous	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
figured	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
played	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
low	NULL
down	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
continue	NULL
her	NULL
intrigue	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
fellow	NULL
under	NULL
my	NULL
roof	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
much	NULL
about	NULL
Florence	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
date	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
happening	NULL
at	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
head	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
telegrams	NULL
had	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
Nancy	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
struck	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
shown	NULL
signs	NULL
of	NULL
forming	NULL
an	NULL
attachment	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
undesirable	NULL
fellow	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
wanted	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
marry	NULL
her	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
harm	NULL
's	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
pretty	NULL
firmly	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
for	NULL
nearly	NULL
ten	NULL
days	NULL
after	NULL
my	NULL
arrival	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
beautiful	NULL
old	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
Edward	NULL
nor	NULL
Leonora	NULL
made	NULL
any	NULL
motion	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
about	NULL
anything	NULL
other	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
crops	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
several	NULL
young	NULL
fellows	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
particular	NULL
was	NULL
distinguished	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
preference	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
certainly	NULL
appeared	NULL
illish	NULL
and	NULL
nervous	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
woke	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
gay	NULL
nonsense	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

Oh	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
pretty	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
happened	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
undesirable	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
forbidden	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
Nancy	NULL
was	NULL
fretting	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
Hell	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
Nancy	NULL
;	NULL
Nancy	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
;	NULL
Edward	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
talked	NULL
and	NULL
talked	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
talked	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
horrible	NULL
pictures	NULL
of	NULL
gloom	NULL
and	NULL
half	NULL
lights	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
emotions	NULL
running	NULL
through	NULL
silent	NULL
nights	NULL
--	NULL
through	NULL
whole	NULL
nights	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
my	NULL
beautiful	NULL
Nancy	NULL
appearing	NULL
suddenly	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
rising	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
long	NULL
hair	NULL
falling	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
split	NULL
cone	NULL
of	NULL
shadow	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
glimmer	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
night-light	NULL
that	NULL
burned	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
agonized	NULL
figure	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
spectre	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
offering	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
his	NULL
reason	NULL
!	NULL

And	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
his	NULL
frantic	NULL
refusal	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
talk	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
talk	NULL
!	NULL

My	NULL
God	NULL
!	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
living	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
enveloped	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
charm	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
quiet	NULL
and	NULL
ordered	NULL
living	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
skilled	NULL
servants	NULL
whose	NULL
mere	NULL
laying	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
dress	NULL
clothes	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
caress	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
hourly	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
they	NULL
appeared	NULL
like	NULL
tender	NULL
,	NULL
ordered	NULL
and	NULL
devoted	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
smiling	NULL
,	NULL
absenting	NULL
themselves	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
proper	NULL
intervals	NULL
;	NULL
driving	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
meets	NULL
--	NULL
just	NULL
good	NULL
people	NULL
!	NULL

How	NULL
the	NULL
devil	NULL
--	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
devil	NULL
do	NULL
they	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

At	NULL
dinner	NULL
one	NULL
evening	NULL
Leonora	NULL
said	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
opened	NULL
a	NULL
telegram	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Nancy	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
India	NULL
,	NULL
tomorrow	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
spoke	NULL
.	NULL

Nancy	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
plate	NULL
;	NULL
Edward	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
eating	NULL
his	NULL
pheasant	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
felt	NULL
very	NULL
bad	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
propose	NULL
to	NULL
Nancy	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
queer	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
given	NULL
me	NULL
any	NULL
warning	NULL
of	NULL
Nancy	NULL
's	NULL
departure	NULL
--	NULL
But	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
English	NULL
manners	NULL
--	NULL
some	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
delicacy	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
hang	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
must	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
I	NULL
trusted	NULL
in	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
Nancy	NULL
Rufford	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tranquility	NULL
of	NULL
ancient	NULL
haunts	NULL
of	NULL
peace	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
trusted	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
Edward	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
interval	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
this	NULL
:	NULL
Upon	NULL
her	NULL
return	NULL
from	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
completely	NULL
broken	NULL
down	NULL
--	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
trust	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
seems	NULL
odd	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
anything	NULL
about	NULL
breakdowns	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
ingenious	NULL
torments	NULL
that	NULL
fate	NULL
prepares	NULL
for	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
come	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
strain	NULL
having	NULL
relaxed	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
long	NULL
illness	NULL
and	NULL
death	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
widow	NULL
goes	NULL
to	NULL
pieces	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
rowing	NULL
contest	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
crew	NULL
collapses	NULL
and	NULL
lies	NULL
forward	NULL
upon	NULL
its	NULL
oars	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
certain	NULL
tones	NULL
in	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
;	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
steady	NULL
stare	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
bloodshot	NULL
eyes	NULL
on	NULL
rising	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
dinner	NULL
table	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
hotel	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
moral	NULL
scruples	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
his	NULL
social	NULL
code	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
his	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
playing	NULL
it	NULL
too	NULL
low	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
rendered	NULL
Nancy	NULL
perfectly	NULL
safe	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
no	NULL
danger	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
from	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
smash	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
relaxed	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
broke	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
drifted	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
increasing	NULL
momentum	NULL
,	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
stream	NULL
of	NULL
destiny	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
may	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
restraints	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
religion	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
acted	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
lines	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
instinctive	NULL
desires	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
herself	NULL
;	NULL
or	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
let	NULL
loose	NULL
the	NULL
bonds	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
standards	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
conventions	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
traditions	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
natural	NULL
self	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
torn	NULL
between	NULL
her	NULL
intense	NULL
,	NULL
maternal	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
intense	NULL
jealousy	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
realizes	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
she	NULL
loves	NULL
has	NULL
met	NULL
what	NULL
appears	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
final	NULL
passion	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
divided	NULL
between	NULL
an	NULL
intense	NULL
disgust	NULL
for	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
weakness	NULL
in	NULL
conceiving	NULL
this	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
intense	NULL
pity	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
miseries	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
enduring	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
equally	NULL
intense	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
hid	NULL
from	NULL
herself	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
respect	NULL
for	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
determination	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
particular	NULL
affair	NULL
,	NULL
unspotted	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
human	NULL
heart	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
mysterious	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
acting	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
then	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
hatred	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
final	NULL
virtue	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
despise	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
realized	NULL
gone	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
suffer	NULL
,	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
agonize	NULL
;	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
break	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
Hell	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
abode	NULL
of	NULL
broken	NULL
resolves	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
line	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
friends	NULL
;	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
her	NULL
away	NULL
herself	NULL
upon	NULL
some	NULL
pretext	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL

That	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
cured	NULL
things	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
decent	NULL
line	NULL
,	NULL
...	NULL
But	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
date	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
incapable	NULL
of	NULL
taking	NULL
any	NULL
line	NULL
whatever	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
pitied	NULL
Edward	NULL
frightfully	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
time	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
acted	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
lines	NULL
of	NULL
pity	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
loathed	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
another	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
acted	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
loathing	NULL
dictated	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
gasped	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
dying	NULL
of	NULL
tuberculosis	NULL
gasps	NULL
for	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
craved	NULL
madly	NULL
for	NULL
communication	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
human	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
human	NULL
soul	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
selected	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
Nancy	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
person	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
her	NULL
necessity	NULL
for	NULL
reticences	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
coldness	NULL
of	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
singularly	NULL
few	NULL
intimates	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
none	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
exception	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Whelen	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
advised	NULL
her	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
with	NULL
La	NULL
Dolciquita	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
religious	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
guided	NULL
her	NULL
through	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Colonel	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
Madeira	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
religious	NULL
she	NULL
now	NULL
avoided	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
visitors	NULL
'	NULL
book	NULL
had	NULL
seven	NULL
hundred	NULL
names	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
soul	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
of	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
Teleragh	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
of	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
lay	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
bed	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
marvellous	NULL
,	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
airy	NULL
bedroom	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
chintzes	NULL

the	NULL
Chippendale	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
portraits	NULL

Ashburnhams	NULL
by	NULL
Zoffany	NULL
and	NULL
Zucchero	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
meet	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
struggle	NULL
up	NULL
--	NULL
supposing	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
within	NULL
driving	NULL
distance	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
Edward	NULL
drive	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
cross-roads	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
drive	NULL
herself	NULL
back	NULL
alone	NULL
;	NULL
Edward	NULL
would	NULL
ride	NULL
off	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

Ride	NULL
Leonora	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
season	NULL
--	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
bad	NULL
.	NULL

Each	NULL
pace	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mare	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
anguish	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
drove	NULL
with	NULL
efficiency	NULL
and	NULL
precision	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
smiled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Gimmers	NULL
and	NULL
Ffoulkes	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Hedley	NULL
Seatons	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
threw	NULL
with	NULL
exactitude	NULL
pennies	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
who	NULL
opened	NULL
gates	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
upright	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
seat	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
dog-cart	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
waved	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
Nancy	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
rode	NULL
off	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
hounds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL
her	NULL
clear	NULL
,	NULL
high	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
chilly	NULL
weather	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Have	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
time	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

Poor	NULL
forlorn	NULL
woman	NULL
!	NULL

...	NULL
There	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
spark	NULL
of	NULL
consolation	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
Rodney	NULL
Bayham	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
Bayham	NULL
,	NULL
followed	NULL
her	NULL
always	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
tried	NULL
her	NULL
abortive	NULL
love-affair	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
mornings	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
ride	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
shafts	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
say	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Good	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
eyes	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
imploring	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
Germans	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
A.	NULL
D.	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
disposition	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
consolation	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
proposed	NULL
ever	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
showed	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
one	NULL
faithful	NULL
soul	NULL
in	NULL
riding-breeches	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
showed	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
losing	NULL
her	NULL
looks	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
losing	NULL
her	NULL
looks	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
forty	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
clean	NULL
run	NULL
as	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
convent	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
clear	NULL
in	NULL
outline	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
clear	NULL
coloured	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
dark	NULL
blue	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
looking-glass	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
always	NULL
the	NULL
doubts	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Rodney	NULL
Bayham	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
took	NULL
them	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
singular	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
aged	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
some	NULL
types	NULL
of	NULL
beauty	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
of	NULL
youth	NULL
made	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
embellishments	NULL
that	NULL
come	NULL
with	NULL
enduring	NULL
sorrow	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
is	NULL
too	NULL
elaborately	NULL
put	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
mean	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
everything	NULL
had	NULL
prospered	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
become	NULL
too	NULL
hard	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
maybe	NULL
,	NULL
overbearing	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
tuned	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
appearing	NULL
efficient	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
sympathetic	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
rarest	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
blends	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
I	NULL
swear	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
restrained	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
intensely	NULL
sympathetic	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
she	NULL
appeared	NULL
also	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
sound	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
record	NULL
of	NULL
humanity	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
record	NULL
of	NULL
sorrows	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
rule	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
sad	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
Nancy	NULL
through	NULL
many	NULL
terrors	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
many	NULL
bad	NULL
places	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
account	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
passionate	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
elder	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
Nancy	NULL
's	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
admiration	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
awakened	NULL
in	NULL
Catholics	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
feeling	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Virgin	NULL
Mary	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
various	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
saints	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
too	NULL
little	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
laid	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
at	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
laid	NULL
there	NULL
the	NULL
offer	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
virtue	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
reason	NULL
.	NULL

Those	NULL
were	NULL
sufficient	NULL
instalments	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
today	NULL
be	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
for	NULL
Nancy	NULL
Rufford	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
reflections	NULL
are	NULL
a	NULL
nuisance	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
crowd	NULL
on	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
--	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
Leonora	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
her	NULL
headaches	NULL
--	NULL
headaches	NULL
lasting	NULL
through	NULL
whole	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
speak	NULL
no	NULL
word	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
no	NULL
sound	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
Nancy	NULL
would	NULL
sit	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
silent	NULL
and	NULL
motionless	NULL
for	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
steeping	NULL
handkerchiefs	NULL
in	NULL
vinegar	NULL
and	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thinking	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
thoughts	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
bad	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
meals	NULL
alone	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
bad	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
too	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
beastly	NULL
bad	NULL
for	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
wavered	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
demeanour	NULL
,	NULL
What	NULL
else	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL

At	NULL
times	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
sit	NULL
silent	NULL
and	NULL
dejected	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
untouched	NULL
food	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
utter	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
monosyllables	NULL
when	NULL
Nancy	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
simply	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
falling	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
other	NULL
times	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
wine	NULL
;	NULL
pull	NULL
himself	NULL
together	NULL
;	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
chaff	NULL
Nancy	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
stake	NULL
and	NULL
binder	NULL
hedge	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
mare	NULL
had	NULL
checked	NULL
at	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
habits	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Chitralis	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
rough	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
girl	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
dull	NULL
companion	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
realized	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
park	NULL
at	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
her	NULL
no	NULL
harm	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
harm	NULL
to	NULL
Nancy	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
gradually	NULL
opened	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
ups	NULL
and	NULL
downs	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
an	NULL
invariably	NULL
gay	NULL
uncle	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
nice	NULL
dog	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
trustworthy	NULL
horse	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
friend	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
find	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
attitudes	NULL
of	NULL
frightful	NULL
dejection	NULL
,	NULL
sunk	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
armchair	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
study	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
gun-room	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
notice	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
door	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
dead	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

Gradually	NULL
it	NULL
forced	NULL
itself	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
attention	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
profound	NULL
differences	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
regarded	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
uncle	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
came	NULL
very	NULL
slowly	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
began	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
giving	NULL
an	NULL
oldish	NULL
horse	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
fellow	NULL
called	NULL
Selmes	NULL
.	NULL

Selmes	NULL
'	NULL
father	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
ruined	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
fraudulent	NULL
solicitor	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Selmes	NULL
family	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
sell	NULL
their	NULL
hunters	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
excited	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
sympathy	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
meeting	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
unmounted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seeing	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
unhappy	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
offered	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
Irish	NULL
cob	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
riding	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
silly	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
really	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
horse	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
from	NULL
thirty	NULL
to	NULL
forty	NULL
pounds	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
gift	NULL
would	NULL
upset	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Edward	NULL
just	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
comfort	NULL
that	NULL
unhappy	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
whose	NULL
father	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
what	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
worse	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
young	NULL
Selmes	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
afford	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
the	NULL
horse	NULL
even	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
recollected	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
immediately	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
offer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
quickly	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Of	NULL
course	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
should	NULL
stable	NULL
the	NULL
horse	NULL
at	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
until	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
round	NULL
or	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
sell	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Nancy	NULL
went	NULL
straight	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
regarded	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
splendid	NULL
instance	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
quick	NULL
consideration	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
feelings	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
distressed	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
cheer	NULL
Leonora	NULL
up	NULL
--	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
cheer	NULL
any	NULL

such	NULL
a	NULL
splendid	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
girlish	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
ever	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
headache	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
collected	NULL
but	NULL
miserably	NULL
weak	NULL
,	NULL
turned	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
uttered	NULL
words	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
amazing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
your	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
mine	NULL

We	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
ruined	NULL

We	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
ruined	NULL
.	NULL

Am	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
suddenly	NULL
Leonora	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
of	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
pushed	NULL
herself	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
pillows	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
elbow	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
there	NULL
--	NULL
crying	NULL
,	NULL
crying	NULL
,	NULL
crying	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
hidden	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tears	NULL
falling	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
fingers	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
flushed	NULL
,	NULL
stammered	NULL
and	NULL
whimpered	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
personally	NULL
insulted	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
if	NULL
Uncle	NULL
Edward	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
bitterness	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
shirt	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
off	NULL
mine	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
off	NULL
yours	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
finish	NULL
the	NULL
sentence	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
feeling	NULL
an	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
hatred	NULL
and	NULL
contempt	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
lying	NULL
there	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
were	NULL
together	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
and	NULL
hacking	NULL
it	NULL
home	NULL
at	NULL
dusk	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
digging	NULL
her	NULL
sharp	NULL
nails	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
palms	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
house	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
silent	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
drooping	NULL
winter	NULL
weather	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
an	NULL
eternity	NULL
of	NULL
torture	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
invaded	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
opening	NULL
doors	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
gay	NULL
voice	NULL
saying	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
mistletoe	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

...	NULL
And	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
gruff	NULL
undertone	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Nancy	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
feet	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
hastened	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
tiptoed	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
approached	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Branshaw	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
big	NULL
hall	NULL
with	NULL
oak	NULL
floors	NULL
and	NULL
tiger	NULL
skins	NULL
.	NULL

Round	NULL
this	NULL
hall	NULL
there	NULL
ran	NULL
a	NULL
gallery	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
doorway	NULL
gave	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
headaches	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
her	NULL
door	NULL
open	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
approaching	NULL
footsteps	NULL
of	NULL
ruin	NULL
and	NULL
disaster	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
she	NULL
hated	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
shut	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
Leonora	NULL
hated	NULL
Edward	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
hatred	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
hell	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
her	NULL
riding-whip	NULL
down	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
right	NULL
had	NULL
Nancy	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
young	NULL
and	NULL
slender	NULL
and	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gay	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
mournful	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
right	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
exactly	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
husband	NULL
happy	NULL
?	NULL

For	NULL
Leonora	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Nancy	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
Edward	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
her	NULL
riding-whip	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
Nancy	NULL
's	NULL
young	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
imagined	NULL
the	NULL
pleasure	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
feel	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
lash	NULL
fell	NULL
across	NULL
those	NULL
queer	NULL
features	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
pleasure	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
feel	NULL
at	NULL
drawing	NULL
the	NULL
handle	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
moment	NULL
toward	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
deep	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
flesh	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
a	NULL
lasting	NULL
wheal	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
left	NULL
a	NULL
lasting	NULL
wheal	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
words	NULL
cut	NULL
deeply	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
neither	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
spoke	NULL
about	NULL
that	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
fortnight	NULL
went	NULL
by	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
of	NULL
deep	NULL
rains	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
heavy	NULL
fields	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
bad	NULL
scent	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
headaches	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
for	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
hunted	NULL
once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
,	NULL
letting	NULL
herself	NULL
be	NULL
piloted	NULL
by	NULL
Bayham	NULL
,	NULL
whilst	NULL
Edward	NULL
looked	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
those	NULL
three	NULL
were	NULL
dining	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
queer	NULL
,	NULL
deliberate	NULL
,	NULL
heavy	NULL
tones	NULL
that	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
days	NULL
(	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
)	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
Nancy	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
more	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
getting	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Rufford	NULL
,	NULL
suggesting	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Leonora	NULL
called	NULL
out	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
How	NULL
dare	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL

How	NULL
dare	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
cried	NULL
out	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
sweet	NULL
Saviour	NULL
,	NULL
help	NULL
me	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
queer	NULL
way	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
forced	NULL
themselves	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
merciless	NULL
trick	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
devil	NULL
that	NULL
pays	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
sweltering	NULL
hell	NULL
of	NULL
ours	NULL
,	NULL
Nancy	NULL
Rufford	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
came	NULL
whilst	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
Leonora	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
intercepted	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
intercepted	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
amazing	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
horrible	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

.	NULL

.	NULL

.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
contained	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
just	NULL
average	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
effects	NULL
on	NULL
Nancy	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
eloped	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
worthless	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
called	NULL
"	NULL
sinking	NULL
lower	NULL
and	NULL
lower	NULL
"	NULL
.	NULL

Whether	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
actually	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
rather	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
eked	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
allowance	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
livelihood	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
stated	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
Nancy	NULL
and	NULL
upbraided	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
with	NULL
living	NULL
in	NULL
luxury	NULL
whilst	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
starved	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
horrible	NULL
in	NULL
tone	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Rufford	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
cruel	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
woman	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
times	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
poor	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
opening	NULL
her	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
distraction	NULL
from	NULL
another	NULL
grief	NULL
,	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
bedroom	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
laughter	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
devil	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
just	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
girl	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
lashing	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
fiend	NULL
,	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
unfortunate	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
unfortunate	NULL
;	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
deemed	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
leave	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
deep	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
nine	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
This	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
atrocious	NULL
thing	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
your	NULL
atrocious	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
moved	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

God	NULL
knows	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
exactly	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
uppermost	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
concern	NULL
and	NULL
horror	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
going	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
father	NULL
whose	NULL
voice	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
shriek	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
motive	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
strong	NULL
with	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
present	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
torturing	NULL
Edward	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
presence	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
was	NULL
sunk	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
two	NULL
candles	NULL
,	NULL
hidden	NULL
by	NULL
green	NULL
glass	NULL
shades	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
green	NULL
shades	NULL
were	NULL
reflected	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
glasses	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
book-cases	NULL
that	NULL
contained	NULL
not	NULL
books	NULL
but	NULL
guns	NULL
with	NULL
gleaming	NULL
brown	NULL
barrels	NULL
and	NULL
fishing-rods	NULL
in	NULL
green	NULL
baize	NULL
over-covers	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
dimly	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
,	NULL
above	NULL
a	NULL
mantelpiece	NULL
encumbered	NULL
with	NULL
spurs	NULL
,	NULL
hooves	NULL
and	NULL
bronze	NULL
models	NULL
of	NULL
horses	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
dark-brown	NULL
picture	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
horse	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
think	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Leonora	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
She	NULL
began	NULL
spiritedly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
any	NULL
ending	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sentence	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
stir	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
spoke	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Leonora	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
want	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
divorce	NULL
you	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL

She	NULL

He	NULL
groaned	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Heaven	NULL
knows	NULL
what	NULL
happened	NULL
in	NULL
Leonora	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
certainly	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
herself	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
probably	NULL
said	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
report	NULL

all	NULL

has	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL

make	NULL
up	NULL
speeches	NULL

To	NULL
follow	NULL
her	NULL
psychological	NULL
development	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
we	NULL
must	NULL
allow	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
upbraided	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
past	NULL
life	NULL

whilst	NULL
Edward	NULL
sat	NULL
absolutely	NULL
silent	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL

in	NULL
speaking	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
afterwards	NULL

she	NULL
has	NULL
said	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL

just	NULL

silent	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
talked	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
endeavour	NULL
to	NULL
sting	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
speech	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
expression	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
grievance	NULL

her	NULL
mood	NULL
changed	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
room	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
gallery	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
there	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
herself	NULL

a	NULL
mood	NULL
of	NULL
absolute	NULL
unselfishness	NULL

of	NULL
absolute	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL

she	NULL
imagined	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
fear	NULL
came	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
committed	NULL
suicide	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
gallery	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
sound	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
regular	NULL
beat	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
clock	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
debased	NULL
condition	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
person	NULL
to	NULL
hang	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
acted	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
straight	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
oiling	NULL
the	NULL
breech	NULL
action	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
gun	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
unusual	NULL
thing	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
evening	NULL
clothes	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
never	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
shoot	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
implement	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
it	NULL
just	NULL
for	NULL
occupation	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
thinking	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
illuminated	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
cast	NULL
upwards	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
round	NULL
orifices	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
candle	NULL
shades	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
imagine	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
find	NULL
Nancy	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
owed	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
answered	NULL
then	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
imagine	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
did	NULL
imagine	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Those	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
words	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
lame	NULL
duck	NULL
,	NULL
back	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
corridors	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
stumbled	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
familiar	NULL
tiger	NULL
skins	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
hall	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
drag	NULL
one	NULL
limb	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
gallery	NULL
she	NULL
perceived	NULL
that	NULL
Nancy	NULL
's	NULL
door	NULL
was	NULL
half	NULL
open	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
sudden	NULL
madness	NULL
possessed	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
action	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
thirst	NULL
for	NULL
self-explanation	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
rooms	NULL
all	NULL
gave	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
gallery	NULL
;	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
east	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
next	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
three	NULL
open	NULL
doors	NULL
,	NULL
side	NULL
by	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
gaping	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
chances	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
night	NULL
might	NULL
bring	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
Leonora	NULL
shudder	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
body	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
Nancy	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
perfectly	NULL
still	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
armchair	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
upright	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
taught	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
convent	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
calm	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
church	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
fell	NULL
,	NULL
black	NULL
and	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
pall	NULL
,	NULL
down	NULL
over	NULL
both	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fire	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
was	NULL
burning	NULL
brightly	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
just	NULL
put	NULL
coals	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
silk	NULL
kimono	NULL
that	NULL
covered	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
clothes	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
off	NULL
were	NULL
exactly	NULL
folded	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
proper	NULL
seats	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
long	NULL
hands	NULL
were	NULL
one	NULL
upon	NULL
each	NULL
arm	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chair	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
pink	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
chintz	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
such	NULL
orderly	NULL
things	NULL
as	NULL
fold	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
clothes	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
off	NULL
upon	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
night	NULL
--	NULL
when	NULL
Edward	NULL
had	NULL
announced	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
received	NULL
that	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
envelope	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
right	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
perceive	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
What	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
late	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
answered	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Just	NULL
thinking	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
in	NULL
whispers	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
below	NULL
their	NULL
breaths	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
fell	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
envelope	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
recognized	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Rufford	NULL
's	NULL
handwriting	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
moments	NULL
when	NULL
thinking	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
stones	NULL
were	NULL
being	NULL
thrown	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
every	NULL
direction	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
run	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
heard	NULL
herself	NULL
exclaim	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
dying	NULL
--	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
's	NULL
dying	NULL

He	NULL
's	NULL
worth	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
either	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
girl	NULL
looked	NULL
past	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
panels	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
half-closed	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
poor	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL

.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
must	NULL
stay	NULL
here	NULL

"	NULL
Leonora	NULL
answered	NULL
fiercely	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
must	NULL
stay	NULL

I	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

Nancy	NULL
answered	NULL

It	NULL
appears	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
Glasgow	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Rufford	NULL
pursued	NULL
her	NULL
disorderly	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
selected	NULL
that	NULL
city	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
profitable	NULL
but	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
natal	NULL
home	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
desired	NULL
to	NULL
cause	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
pain	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
must	NULL

"	NULL
Leonora	NULL
began	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
Edward	NULL

He	NULL
's	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
turned	NULL
her	NULL
calm	NULL
eyes	NULL
upon	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

I	NULL

Leonora	NULL
uttered	NULL
an	NULL
"	NULL

,	NULL
in	NULL

of	NULL

her	NULL

romantically	NULL
those	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL

she	NULL

grown	NULL
up	NULL
so	NULL
quickly	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL

she	NULL

The	NULL

said	NULL

smiled	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

a	NULL
queer	NULL

III	NULL
NANCY	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL

been	NULL
thinking	NULL
ever	NULL
since	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
that	NULL
comment	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
giving	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
horse	NULL
to	NULL
young	NULL
Selmes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
thinking	NULL
and	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
days	NULL
silent	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL
's	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

(	NULL
She	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Leonora	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL
.	NULL
)	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
thinking	NULL
during	NULL
many	NULL
silent	NULL
meals	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
bloodshot	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
creased	NULL
,	NULL
heavy	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
smile	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
gradually	NULL
the	NULL
knowledge	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
love	NULL
Leonora	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
hated	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

Several	NULL
things	NULL
contributed	NULL
to	NULL
form	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
harden	NULL
this	NULL
conviction	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
papers	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
days	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
bed	NULL

Edward	NULL
breakfasted	NULL
alone	NULL

went	NULL
out	NULL
early	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
estate	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
alone	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
papers	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
papers	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
portrait	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL

Beneath	NULL
it	NULL
she	NULL
read	NULL

Nancy	NULL
hardly	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
divorce	NULL
case	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
remarkably	NULL
well	NULL
brought	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Roman	NULL
Catholics	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
practise	NULL

.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
exactly	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
impressed	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
Nancy	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
nice	NULL
women	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
read	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
Nancy	NULL
skip	NULL
those	NULL
pages	NULL

She	NULL
read	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Brand	NULL
divorce	NULL
case	NULL
--	NULL
principally	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
Leonora	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
her	NULL
headache	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
happening	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Brand	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
at	NULL
Christchurch	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whom	NULL
they	NULL
both	NULL
liked	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL

The	NULL
case	NULL
occupied	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
report	NULL
that	NULL
Nancy	NULL
first	NULL
came	NULL
upon	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
kept	NULL
the	NULL
papers	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
methodical	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
rack	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
gun-room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
her	NULL
breakfast	NULL
Nancy	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
quiet	NULL
apartment	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
read	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
affair	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
why	NULL
one	NULL
counsel	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
movements	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Brand	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
why	NULL
a	NULL
chart	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bedroom	NULL
accommodation	NULL
at	NULL
Christchurch	NULL
Old	NULL
Hall	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
produced	NULL
in	NULL
court	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
see	NULL
why	NULL
they	NULL

upon	NULL
a	NULL

the	NULL

all	NULL

should	NULL
occupy	NULL
themselves	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
matters	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
struck	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
odd	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
counsel	NULL
should	NULL
cross-question	NULL
Mr	NULL
Brand	NULL
so	NULL
insistently	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
impertinently	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
feelings	NULL
for	NULL
Miss	NULL
Lupton	NULL
.	NULL

Nancy	NULL
knew	NULL
Miss	NULL
Lupton	NULL
of	NULL
Ringwood	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
jolly	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
rode	NULL
a	NULL
horse	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
white	NULL
fetlocks	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Brand	NULL
persisted	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
love	NULL
Miss	NULL
Lupton	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
love	NULL
Miss	NULL
Lupton	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
married	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
might	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
Uncle	NULL
Edward	NULL
loving	NULL
...	NULL
loving	NULL
anybody	NULL
but	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
married	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
loving	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
misbehaved	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
poor	NULL
people	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
people	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
those	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
these	NULL
matters	NULL
presented	NULL
themselves	NULL
to	NULL
Nancy	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
later	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Brand	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
confess	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
guilty	NULL
intimacy	NULL
"	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

Nancy	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
telling	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
secrets	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
why	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
serious	NULL
offence	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
gentlemanly	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
lessened	NULL
her	NULL
opinion	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Brand	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Brand	NULL
had	NULL
condoned	NULL
that	NULL
offence	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
serious	NULL
secrets	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Brand	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
forced	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Brand	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
mild	NULL
Mr	NULL
Brand	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
before	NULL
their	NULL
departure	NULL
to	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
,	NULL
playing	NULL
"	NULL
Blind	NULL
Man	NULL
's	NULL
Buff	NULL
"	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
children	NULL
and	NULL
kissing	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
caught	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
Mr	NULL
Brand	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Brand	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
possible	NULL
terms	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
incredible	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
there	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
black	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Brand	NULL
drank	NULL
;	NULL
Mr	NULL
Brand	NULL
had	NULL
struck	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Brand	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
drunk	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Brand	NULL
was	NULL
adjudged	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
abrupt	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
columns	NULL
and	NULL
columns	NULL
of	NULL
paper	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
guilty	NULL
of	NULL
cruelty	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
committed	NULL
adultery	NULL
with	NULL
Miss	NULL
Lupton	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
last	NULL
words	NULL
conveyed	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
Nancy	NULL
--	NULL
nothing	NULL
real	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
commanded	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
commit	NULL
adultery	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
one	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
probably	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
catching	NULL
salmon	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
season	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
one	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
gathered	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
kissing	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
holding	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
your	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

.	NULL

.	NULL

.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
reading	NULL
upon	NULL
Nancy	NULL
was	NULL
mysterious	NULL
,	NULL
terrifying	NULL
and	NULL
evil	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
sickness	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
sickness	NULL
that	NULL
grew	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
read	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
painfully	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
asked	NULL
God	NULL
how	NULL
He	NULL
could	NULL
permit	NULL
such	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
love	NULL
Leonora	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
hated	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
loved	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
unthinkable	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
love	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
than	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
fierce	NULL
unknown	NULL
heart	NULL
suddenly	NULL
spoke	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
could	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
herself	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
love	NULL
her	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
had	NULL
occurred	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
rest	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
sick	NULL
feeling	NULL
went	NULL
off	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
finding	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
headaches	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
suddenly	NULL
told	NULL
Leonora	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Brand	NULL
had	NULL
divorced	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
asked	NULL
what	NULL
,	NULL
exactly	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
meant	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
feeling	NULL
so	NULL
weak	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
answered	NULL
just	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
It	NULL
means	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Brand	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Nancy	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
But	NULL
...	NULL
but	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
He	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
Miss	NULL
Lupton	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Leonora	NULL
just	NULL
moved	NULL
a	NULL
hand	NULL
in	NULL
assent	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
shut	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
Nancy	NULL
began	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
horror	NULL
:	NULL
her	NULL
brows	NULL
were	NULL
tight	NULL
above	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
lines	NULL
of	NULL
pain	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
distinct	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
familiar	NULL
,	NULL
great	NULL
hall	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
changed	NULL
aspect	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
andirons	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
brass	NULL
flowers	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
ends	NULL
appeared	NULL
unreal	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
burning	NULL
logs	NULL
were	NULL
just	NULL
logs	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
burning	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
comfortable	NULL
symbols	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
indestructible	NULL
mode	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
flame	NULL
fluttered	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
fireback	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
St	NULL
Bernard	NULL
sighed	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

Outside	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
rain	NULL
fell	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
suddenly	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
might	NULL
marry	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
nearly	NULL
screamed	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
opened	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
lying	NULL
sideways	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
and	NULL
gold	NULL
pillow	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
drawn	NULL
half	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
fireplace	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Nancy	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
imagined	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Are	NULL
n't	NULL
marriages	NULL
sacraments	NULL
?	NULL

Are	NULL
n't	NULL
they	NULL
indissoluble	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
married	NULL
.	NULL

.	NULL

.	NULL

and	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
She	NULL
was	NULL
sobbing	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
married	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
married	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
alive	NULL
or	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Leonora	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
law	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
law	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
....	NULL
"	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Nancy	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
Brands	NULL
are	NULL
Protestants	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
safeness	NULL
descend	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
rest	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
idiotic	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
remembered	NULL
Henry	NULL
VIII	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
basis	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
Protestantism	NULL
rests	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
almost	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
long	NULL
afternoon	NULL
wore	NULL
on	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
flames	NULL
still	NULL
fluttered	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
St	NULL
Bernard	NULL
awoke	NULL
and	NULL
lolloped	NULL
away	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Leonora	NULL
opened	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
almost	NULL
coldly	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
And	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL

Do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
think	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
get	NULL
married	NULL

"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
unlike	NULL
Leonora	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
frightened	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dusk	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
perfectly	NULL
reasonable	NULL
question	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
anyone	NULL
wants	NULL
to	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Several	NULL
people	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL
Leonora	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL

"	NULL
Nancy	NULL
answered	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL

Leonora	NULL
answered	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
dull	NULL
tone	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
will	NULL
have	NULL
money	NULL
enough	NULL
from	NULL

most	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
then	NULL
asked	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
me	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
Nancy	NULL
answered	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
marry	NULL
me	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
told	NULL
to	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL

go	NULL
on	NULL
living	NULL
there	NULL

She	NULL
added	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
If	NULL
I	NULL

should	NULL

him	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
frightened	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
writhed	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
couch	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
out	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
God	NULL
!	NULL

...	NULL
"	NULL
Nancy	NULL
ran	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
tablets	NULL
of	NULL
aspirin	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
wet	NULL
handkerchiefs	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
never	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
expression	NULL
of	NULL
agony	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
than	NULL
physical	NULL
pain	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
are	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
happened	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
before	NULL
Leonora	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
casting	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
people	NULL
going	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
about	NULL
Leonora	NULL
and	NULL
bring	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
date	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
about	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
fallen	NULL
behind	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
gets	NULL
hopelessly	NULL
left	NULL
behind	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wish	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
diary	NULL
form	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
:	NULL
On	NULL
the	NULL
1st	NULL
of	NULL
September	NULL
they	NULL
returned	NULL
from	NULL
Nauheim	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
took	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL
1st	NULL
of	NULL
October	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
meets	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

Nancy	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
observed	NULL
very	NULL
fully	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
strange	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

About	NULL
the	NULL
6th	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
month	NULL
Edward	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
horse	NULL
to	NULL
young	NULL
Selmes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Nancy	NULL
had	NULL
cause	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
love	NULL
her	NULL
uncle	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
20th	NULL
she	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
divorce	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
reported	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
papers	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
18th	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
following	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
23rd	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
--	NULL
about	NULL
marriage	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
and	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
possible	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL
's	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
bedroom	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
occur	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
12th	NULL
of	NULL
November	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
for	NULL
introspection	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
introspection	NULL
beneath	NULL
gloomy	NULL
skies	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
old	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
rendered	NULL
darker	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
hollow	NULL
crowned	NULL

with	NULL
their	NULL
black	NULL
shadows	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
situation	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
began	NULL
thinking	NULL
about	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
before	NULL
considered	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
anything	NULL
other	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
humorous	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
nonsensical	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
remembered	NULL
chance	NULL
passages	NULL
in	NULL
chance	NULL
books	NULL
--	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
really	NULL
affected	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
remembered	NULL
someone	NULL
's	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Princess	NULL
Badrulbadour	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
remembered	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
love	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
flame	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
thirst	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
withering	NULL
up	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vitals	NULL
--	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
vitals	NULL
were	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
vague	NULL
recollection	NULL
that	NULL
love	NULL
was	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
render	NULL
a	NULL
hopeless	NULL
lover	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
hopeless	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
remembered	NULL
a	NULL
character	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
to	NULL
drink	NULL
through	NULL
love	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
lovers	NULL
'	NULL
existences	NULL
were	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
punctuated	NULL
with	NULL
heavy	NULL
sighs	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
cottage	NULL
piano	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
tinkly	NULL
,	NULL
reedy	NULL
instrument	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
household	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
turn	NULL
for	NULL
music	NULL
.	NULL

Nancy	NULL
herself	NULL
could	NULL
play	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
simple	NULL
songs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
playing	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sitting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
seat	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
out	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
fading	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
some	NULL
calls	NULL
;	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
after	NULL
some	NULL
planting	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
spinney	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
playing	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
piano	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
doing	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
silly	NULL
lilting	NULL
wavering	NULL
tune	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dusk	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
tune	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
major	NULL
notes	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
cheerful	NULL
insistence	NULL
wavered	NULL
and	NULL
melted	NULL
into	NULL
minor	NULL
sounds	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
,	NULL
beneath	NULL
a	NULL
bridge	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
lights	NULL
on	NULL
dark	NULL
waters	NULL
melt	NULL
and	NULL
waver	NULL
and	NULL
disappear	NULL
into	NULL
black	NULL
depths	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
silly	NULL
old	NULL
tune	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
goes	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
--	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
willow	NULL
tree	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
:	NULL
Thou	NULL
art	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
lost	NULL
loves	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
The	NULL
only	NULL
true	NULL
plant	NULL
found	NULL
.	NULL

--	NULL
That	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
Herrick	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
music	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
reedy	NULL
,	NULL
irregular	NULL
,	NULL
lilting	NULL
sound	NULL
that	NULL
goes	NULL
with	NULL
Herrick	NULL
,	NULL
And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
dusk	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
heavy	NULL
,	NULL
hewn	NULL
,	NULL
dark	NULL
pillars	NULL
that	NULL
supported	NULL
the	NULL
gallery	NULL
were	NULL
like	NULL
mourning	NULL
presences	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
had	NULL
sunk	NULL
to	NULL
nothing	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
glow	NULL
amongst	NULL
white	NULL
ashes	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sentimental	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
place	NULL
and	NULL
light	NULL
and	NULL
hour	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
suddenly	NULL
Nancy	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
crying	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
crying	NULL
quietly	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
with	NULL
long	NULL
convulsive	NULL
sobs	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
everything	NULL
gay	NULL
,	NULL
everything	NULL
charming	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
sweetness	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Unhappiness	NULL
;	NULL
unhappiness	NULL
;	NULL
unhappiness	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
no	NULL
happy	NULL
being	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
was	NULL
agonizing	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
hopeless	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
drinking	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
;	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
he	NULL
sighed	NULL
deeply	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
appeared	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
burning	NULL
with	NULL
inward	NULL
flame	NULL
;	NULL
drying	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
with	NULL
thirst	NULL
;	NULL
withering	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
vitals	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
torturing	NULL
conviction	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
visited	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
must	NULL
love	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
other	NULL
than	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
pedagogic	NULL
sectarianism	NULL
she	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
Catholics	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Protestant	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Edward	NULL
loved	NULL
somebody	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
grew	NULL
hopeless	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
sighed	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
St	NULL
Bernard	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
meals	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
feel	NULL
an	NULL
intolerable	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
drink	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL
of	NULL
wine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
another	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
a	NULL
third	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
find	NULL
herself	NULL
grow	NULL
gay	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
the	NULL
gaiety	NULL
went	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
burning	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
inward	NULL
flame	NULL
;	NULL
desiccating	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
with	NULL
thirst	NULL
;	NULL
withering	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
vitals	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
evening	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
gun-room	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
meeting	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
National	NULL
Reserve	NULL
Committee	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
beside	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
decanter	NULL
of	NULL
whisky	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
wineglassful	NULL
and	NULL
drank	NULL
it	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

Flame	NULL
then	NULL
really	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
fill	NULL
her	NULL
body	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
legs	NULL
swelled	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
grew	NULL
feverish	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
dragged	NULL
her	NULL
tall	NULL
height	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bed	NULL
reeled	NULL
beneath	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
arms	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
kissing	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
that	NULL
burned	NULL
;	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
that	NULL
burned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
neck	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
fire	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
never	NULL
touched	NULL
alcohol	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
once	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
have	NULL
such	NULL
thoughts	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
died	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
left	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
shame	NULL
so	NULL
insupportable	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
brain	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
vanished	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
anguish	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
another	NULL
person	NULL
was	NULL
solely	NULL
sympathy	NULL
for	NULL
Leonora	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
determined	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
spent	NULL
in	NULL
acting	NULL
as	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
handmaiden	NULL
--	NULL
sweeping	NULL
,	NULL
tending	NULL
,	NULL
embroidering	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
some	NULL
Deborah	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
medieval	NULL
saint	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
unfortunately	NULL
,	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Catholic	NULL
hagiology	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
pictured	NULL
herself	NULL
as	NULL
some	NULL
personage	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
depressed	NULL
,	NULL
earnest	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
tightly	NULL
closed	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
clear	NULL
white	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
watering	NULL
flowers	NULL
or	NULL
tending	NULL
an	NULL
embroidery	NULL
frame	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
desired	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
Edward	NULL
to	NULL
Africa	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
path	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
charging	NULL
lion	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
saved	NULL
for	NULL
Leonora	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
cost	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
sad	NULL
thoughts	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
childish	NULL
ones	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
--	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
must	NULL
live	NULL
sadly	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
she	NULL
now	NULL
knew	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
received	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
the	NULL
blow	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
wished	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
in	NULL
India	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
blow	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
called	NULL
first	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
sweet	NULL
Saviour	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Our	NULL
Lord	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
sweet	NULL
Saviour	NULL
!	NULL

--	NULL
that	NULL
He	NULL
might	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
impossible	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
India	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
realized	NULL
from	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
demeanour	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
India	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
must	NULL
then	NULL
be	NULL
right	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
determinations	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
Cid	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
Lohengrin	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
Chevalier	NULL
Bayard	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
mutinied	NULL
and	NULL
revolted	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
leave	NULL
that	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wished	NULL
her	NULL
gone	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
witness	NULL
his	NULL
amours	NULL
with	NULL
another	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
prepared	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
witness	NULL
his	NULL
amours	NULL
with	NULL
another	NULL
young	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
stay	NULL
there	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
comfort	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
desperate	NULL
shock	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
mother	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
living	NULL
your	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
prosperity	NULL
and	NULL
respect	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
even	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Rufford	NULL
's	NULL
daughter	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
these	NULL
words	NULL
meant	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
as	NULL
sleeping	NULL
beneath	NULL
the	NULL
arches	NULL
whilst	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
fell	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
conveyed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
"	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
"	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
Platonic	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
duty	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
comfort	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
mother	NULL
that	NULL
bore	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
hardly	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
meant	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
with	NULL
another	NULL
man	NULL
--	NULL
therefore	NULL
she	NULL
pitied	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
terrible	NULL
in	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
trembled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
woman	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
accesses	NULL
of	NULL
madness	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
struck	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
conscience	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
duty	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
parents	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
accord	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
awakened	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
duty	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
undressed	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
care	NULL
and	NULL
meticulously	NULL
folded	NULL
the	NULL
clothes	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
often	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
threw	NULL
them	NULL
helter-skelter	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
duty	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
prevailing	NULL
mood	NULL
when	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
clean-run	NULL
,	NULL
golden-haired	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
black	NULL
,	NULL
appeared	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
doorway	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
dying	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
conscious	NULL
mind	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
within	NULL
herself	NULL
for	NULL
months	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
dying	NULL
--	NULL
actually	NULL
and	NULL
physically	NULL
dying	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
short	NULL
moment	NULL
her	NULL
spirit	NULL
could	NULL
say	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Domine	NULL
,	NULL
nunc	NULL
dimittis	NULL
,	NULL
...	NULL
Lord	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
lettest	NULL
thou	NULL
thy	NULL
servant	NULL
depart	NULL
in	NULL
peace	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
cheerfully	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
Glasgow	NULL
and	NULL
rescue	NULL
her	NULL
fallen	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

IV	NULL
AND	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

in	NULL
tune	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
mood	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL

and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
dying	NULL

love	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
dying	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
that	NULL
fact	NULL
had	NULL
suddenly	NULL
slipped	NULL
into	NULL
place	NULL
and	NULL
become	NULL
real	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
niched	NULL
marker	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
whist	NULL
tablet	NULL
slips	NULL
round	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
pressure	NULL
of	NULL
your	NULL
thumb	NULL

That	NULL
rubber	NULL
at	NULL

was	NULL
made	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
suddenly	NULL
Leonora	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
become	NULL
different	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
become	NULL
different	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
attitude	NULL
towards	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
frail	NULL
,	NULL
white	NULL

silken	NULL
kimono	NULL

sat	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
fire	NULL

but	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
throne	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
close	NULL
dress	NULL
of	NULL
black	NULL
lace	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
gleaming	NULL
white	NULL
shoulders	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
coiled	NULL
yellow	NULL
hair	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
considered	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
beautiful	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
pinched	NULL
,	NULL
shrivelled	NULL
,	NULL
blue	NULL
with	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
shivering	NULL
,	NULL
suppliant	NULL

Yet	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
commanding	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
commanding	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
morrow	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
Glasgow	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
stay	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
dying	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
proud	NULL
and	NULL
happy	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
listen	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
Leonora	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
business	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
body	NULL

she	NULL

Nancy	NULL

possessed	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
precious	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
shield	NULL
and	NULL
bear	NULL
away	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL

as	NULL
if	NULL
Leonora	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
hungry	NULL
dog	NULL

trying	NULL
to	NULL
spring	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
lamb	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL

carrying	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL

For	NULL

at	NULL
that	NULL

Leonora	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
cruel	NULL

Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
hunger	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
cruelty	NULL
had	NULL
driven	NULL
Edward	NULL
to	NULL
madness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
sheltered	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL

by	NULL
her	NULL

no	NULL

quivering	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

Leonora	NULL

loudly	NULL

insistently	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
bitterly	NULL
imperative	NULL
tone	NULL

She	NULL
repeated	NULL
that	NULL

She	NULL

the	NULL
man	NULL

working	NULL

her	NULL

He	NULL
at	NULL

was	NULL
resolved	NULL

malely	NULL

knew	NULL
the	NULL

Leonora	NULL
talked	NULL
on	NULL

her	NULL
eyes	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
hardly	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

hardly	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
Nancy	NULL
said	NULL

after	NULL
hours	NULL

hours	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
screamed	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
wavered	NULL
swiftly	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
closed	NULL
door	NULL

And	NULL
Nancy	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
springing	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
chair	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
white	NULL
arms	NULL
stretched	NULL
wide	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
clasping	NULL
the	NULL

to	NULL
her	NULL
breast	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
saying	NULL

And	NULL
they	NULL
sat	NULL

crouching	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
each	NULL

crying	NULL

they	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL

all	NULL
through	NULL

all	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
Edward	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL

through	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
went	NULL

Next	NULL

they	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
three	NULL

he	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

nothing	NULL

announce	NULL
her	NULL
belief	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
Omnipotent	NULL
Deity	NULL

That	NULL
may	NULL
sound	NULL
romantic	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
record	NULL
of	NULL
fatigue	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
why	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL

resent	NULL
it	NULL

but	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

Florence	NULL
selected	NULL
me	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
purposes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
Edward	NULL
called	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
chat	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
stop	NULL
him	NULL
cutting	NULL
his	NULL
throat	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
eighteen	NULL
months	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
quietly	NULL
writing	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
room	NULL
at	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
when	NULL
Leonora	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
pathetic	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Rufford	NULL
about	NULL
Nancy	NULL
.	NULL

Colonel	NULL
Rufford	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
army	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
up	NULL
an	NULL
appointment	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
tea-planting	NULL
estate	NULL
in	NULL
Ceylon	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
letter	NULL
was	NULL
pathetic	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
brief	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
inarticulate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
business-like	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
boat	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
his	NULL
daughter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
his	NULL
daughter	NULL
quite	NULL
mad	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
appears	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
Aden	NULL
Nancy	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
local	NULL
paper	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
suicide	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
Red	NULL
Sea	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
mad	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
remarked	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Luton	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
chaperoning	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
Omnipotent	NULL
Deity	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
made	NULL
any	NULL
fuss	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
quite	NULL
dry	NULL
and	NULL
glassy	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
mad	NULL
Nancy	NULL
could	NULL
behave	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Colonel	NULL
Rufford	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
anticipate	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
any	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
child	NULL
's	NULL
recovery	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
someone	NULL
from	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
soothe	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
effect	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
just	NULL
simply	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Please	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
lost	NULL
all	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pathetic	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
simple	NULL
,	NULL
enormous	NULL
request	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
colonel	NULL
strikes	NULL
me	NULL
as	NULL
pathetic	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
cursed	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
atrocious	NULL
temper	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
cursed	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
half-mad	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
drank	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
daughter	NULL
was	NULL
totally	NULL
mad	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
goodness	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
nature	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
believed	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
Ceylon	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
soothe	NULL
his	NULL
daughter	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
ever	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Nancy	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
daresay	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
agreed	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
public	NULL
grounds	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
someone	NULL
soothing	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
from	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
to	NULL
Ceylon	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sent	NULL
me	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
nurse	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
after	NULL
Nancy	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
of	NULL
thirteen	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
first	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
off	NULL
I	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
rushing	NULL
through	NULL
Provence	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
the	NULL
steamer	NULL
at	NULL
Marseilles	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
good	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
Ceylon	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
nurse	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
doctors	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
Kandy	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
Nancy	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
England	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
climate	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
voyage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
restore	NULL
her	NULL
reason	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL
restored	NULL
her	NULL
reason	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
aware	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
forty	NULL
paces	NULL
from	NULL
where	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
now	NULL
writing	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
romantic	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
dressed	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
is	NULL
quite	NULL
quiet	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
beautiful	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
nurse	NULL
looks	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
efficiently	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
makings	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
situation	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
humdrum	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
concerned	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL
marry	NULL
Nancy	NULL
if	NULL
her	NULL
reason	NULL
were	NULL
ever	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
restored	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
appreciate	NULL
the	NULL
meaning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Anglican	NULL
marriage	NULL
service	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
probable	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
reason	NULL
will	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
restored	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
appreciate	NULL
the	NULL
meaning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Anglican	NULL
marriage	NULL
service	NULL
.	NULL

Therefore	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
marry	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
law	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
here	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
where	NULL
I	NULL
started	NULL
thirteen	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
the	NULL
attendant	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
beautiful	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
pays	NULL
no	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
estranged	NULL
from	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
married	NULL
Rodney	NULL
Bayham	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
absence	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
at	NULL
Bayham	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
rather	NULL
dislikes	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
has	NULL
got	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
disapprove	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
with	NULL
Rodney	NULL
Bayham	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
disapprove	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
.	NULL

Possibly	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
jealous	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
jealous	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
my	NULL
fainter	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
way	NULL
I	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
perceive	NULL
myself	NULL
following	NULL
the	NULL
lines	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
really	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
polygamist	NULL
;	NULL
with	NULL
Nancy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
and	NULL
possibly	NULL
even	NULL
with	NULL
Florence	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
like	NULL
every	NULL
other	NULL
man	NULL
;	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
probably	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
American	NULL
origin	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
fainter	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
assure	NULL
you	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
a	NULL
strictly	NULL
respectable	NULL
person	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
done	NULL
anything	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
anxious	NULL
mother	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
daughter	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
careful	NULL
dean	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cathedral	NULL
would	NULL
object	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
only	NULL
followed	NULL
,	NULL
faintly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
unconscious	NULL
desires	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
has	NULL
got	NULL

Florence	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
I	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
bought	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
Leonora	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
really	NULL
want	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
wanted	NULL
mostly	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
cease	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
nurse-attendant	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
a	NULL
nurse-attendant	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
wanted	NULL
Nancy	NULL
Rufford	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Only	NULL
she	NULL
is	NULL
mad	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
and	NULL
fantastic	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
people	NULL
have	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
want	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
content	NULL
everybody	NULL
;	NULL
yet	NULL
everybody	NULL
has	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
make	NULL
head	NULL
or	NULL
tail	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
beyond	NULL
me	NULL

Is	NULL
there	NULL
any	NULL
terrestial	NULL
paradise	NULL
where	NULL
,	NULL
amidst	NULL
the	NULL
whispering	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
olive-leaves	NULL

people	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
they	NULL
like	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
like	NULL
and	NULL
take	NULL
their	NULL
ease	NULL
in	NULL
shadows	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
coolness	NULL
?	NULL

Or	NULL
are	NULL
all	NULL
men	NULL
's	NULL
lives	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
lives	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
good	NULL
people	NULL
--	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
lives	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Dowells	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Ruffords	NULL
--	NULL
broken	NULL
,	NULL
tumultuous	NULL
,	NULL
agonized	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
unromantic	NULL
,	NULL
lives	NULL
,	NULL
periods	NULL
punctuated	NULL
by	NULL
screams	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
imbecilities	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
deaths	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
agonies	NULL
?	NULL

Who	NULL
the	NULL
devil	NULL
knows	NULL
?	NULL

For	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
imbecility	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
closing	NULL
scenes	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
tragedy	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
women	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
wanted	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
Edward	NULL
who	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
perfectly	NULL
clear	NULL
line	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
drunk	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
drunk	NULL
or	NULL
sober	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
stuck	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
demanded	NULL
by	NULL
convention	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
traditions	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

Nancy	NULL
Rufford	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
exported	NULL
to	NULL
India	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Nancy	NULL
Rufford	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
exported	NULL
to	NULL
India	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
from	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
conventional	NULL
line	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
tune	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
tradition	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
daresay	NULL
it	NULL
worked	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
good	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
politic	NULL
.	NULL

Conventions	NULL
and	NULL
traditions	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
,	NULL
work	NULL
blindly	NULL
but	NULL
surely	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
preservation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
normal	NULL
type	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
extinction	NULL
of	NULL
proud	NULL
,	NULL
resolute	NULL
and	NULL
unusual	NULL
individuals	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
normal	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sentimentalist	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
society	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
need	NULL
too	NULL
many	NULL
sentimentalists	NULL
.	NULL

Nancy	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
splendid	NULL
creature	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
madness	NULL
.	NULL

Society	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
need	NULL
individuals	NULL
with	NULL
touches	NULL
of	NULL
madness	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
Nancy	NULL
found	NULL
themselves	NULL
steamrolled	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
survives	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
perfectly	NULL
normal	NULL
type	NULL
,	NULL
married	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
rather	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
rabbit	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
Rodney	NULL
Bayham	NULL
is	NULL
rather	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
rabbit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
hear	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
is	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
baby	NULL
in	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
'	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
those	NULL
splendid	NULL
and	NULL
tumultuous	NULL
creatures	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
magnetism	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
passions	NULL
--	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
really	NULL
loved	NULL
--	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
earth	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
best	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
would	NULL
Nancy	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
living	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
Edward	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL

For	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
Nancy	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
cruelty	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
definite	NULL
actual	NULL
cruelty	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
people	NULL
suffer	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
desired	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Edward	NULL
suffer	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
hell	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
unimaginable	NULL
hell	NULL
.	NULL

Those	NULL
two	NULL
women	NULL
pursued	NULL
that	NULL
poor	NULL
devil	NULL
and	NULL
flayed	NULL
the	NULL
skin	NULL
off	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
whips	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
bled	NULL
almost	NULL
visibly	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
stand	NULL
,	NULL
naked	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
waist	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
forearms	NULL
shielding	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
flesh	NULL
hanging	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
rags	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
exaggeration	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
feel	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
Leonora	NULL
and	NULL
Nancy	NULL
banded	NULL
themselves	NULL
together	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
execution	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
humanity	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
disposal	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
Sioux	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
Apache	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
him	NULL
well	NULL
tied	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
stake	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tortures	NULL
they	NULL
inflicted	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Night	NULL
after	NULL
night	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
hear	NULL
them	NULL
talking	NULL
;	NULL
talking	NULL
;	NULL
maddened	NULL
,	NULL
sweating	NULL
,	NULL
seeking	NULL
oblivion	NULL
in	NULL
drink	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
lie	NULL
there	NULL
and	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
voices	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
day	NULL
Leonora	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
announce	NULL
the	NULL
results	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
deliberations	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
like	NULL
judges	NULL
debating	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
sentence	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
criminal	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
like	NULL
ghouls	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
immobile	NULL
corpse	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
tomb	NULL
beside	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
blame	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
--	NULL
though	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
active	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
perfectly	NULL
normal	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
normal	NULL
circumstances	NULL
her	NULL
desires	NULL
were	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
needed	NULL
by	NULL
society	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
desired	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
decorum	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
establishment	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
desired	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
waste	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
desired	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
up	NULL
appearances	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
utterly	NULL
and	NULL
entirely	NULL
normal	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
utterly	NULL
undeniable	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
acted	NULL
perfectly	NULL
normally	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
perfectly	NULL
abnormal	NULL
situation	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
mad	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
agonized	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
complexion	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mad	NULL
woman	NULL
;	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
very	NULL
wicked	NULL
;	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
villain	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
piece	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
would	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
?	NULL

Steel	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
normal	NULL
,	NULL
hard	NULL
,	NULL
polished	NULL
substance	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
hot	NULL
fire	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
become	NULL
red	NULL
,	NULL
soft	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
handled	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
you	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fire	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
hot	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
drip	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
with	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
for	NULL
normal	NULL
circumstances	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
Mr	NULL
Rodney	NULL
Bayham	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
will	NULL
keep	NULL
a	NULL
separate	NULL
establishment	NULL
,	NULL
secretly	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Portsmouth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
occasional	NULL
trips	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
Budapest	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
broke	NULL
and	NULL
simply	NULL
went	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
adopted	NULL
unfamiliar	NULL
and	NULL
therefore	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
and	NULL
ungraceful	NULL
attitudes	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
one	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
for	NULL
revenge	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
haranguing	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
for	NULL
hours	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
she	NULL
harangued	NULL
for	NULL
hours	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
the	NULL
silent	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Edward	NULL
just	NULL
once	NULL
tripped	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
undoing	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
whisky	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
perpetually	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
want	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
want	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
ever	NULL
answered	NULL
was	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
told	NULL
you	NULL
"	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
meant	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
in	NULL
India	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
should	NULL
cable	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
just	NULL
once	NULL
he	NULL
tripped	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
Leonora	NULL
's	NULL
eternal	NULL
question	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
desired	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
pick	NULL
himself	NULL
together	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
daily	NULL
occupations	NULL
if	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
five	NULL
thousand	NULL
miles	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
continue	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
He	NULL
prayed	NULL
his	NULL
God	NULL
for	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sentimentalist	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
determined	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
five	NULL
thousand	NULL
miles	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
continue	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
way	NULL
she	NULL
worked	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
:	NULL
She	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
belong	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
divorce	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
dissolution	NULL
of	NULL
marriage	NULL
from	NULL
Rome	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
considered	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
warn	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
monster	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
of	NULL
La	NULL
Dolciquita	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
Florence	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
agonies	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
endured	NULL
during	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
violent	NULL
,	NULL
overbearing	NULL
,	NULL
vain	NULL
,	NULL
drunken	NULL
,	NULL
arrogant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
monstrously	NULL
a	NULL
prey	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
sexual	NULL
necessities	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
hearing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
miseries	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
Leonora	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
aspect	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
aunt	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
swift	NULL
cruelty	NULL
of	NULL
youth	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
swift	NULL
solidarity	NULL
that	NULL
attaches	NULL
woman	NULL
to	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
resolves	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
aunt	NULL
said	NULL
incessantly	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
must	NULL
save	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
life	NULL
;	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
save	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
needs	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
period	NULL
of	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
from	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
tire	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
save	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
wretched	NULL
fellow	NULL
knew	NULL
--	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
instinct	NULL
that	NULL
runs	NULL
between	NULL
human	NULL
beings	NULL
living	NULL
together	NULL
--	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
remained	NULL
dumb	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
stretched	NULL
out	NULL
no	NULL
finger	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
required	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
decent	NULL
member	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
five	NULL
thousand	NULL
miles	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
continue	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
putting	NULL
a	NULL
stopper	NULL
upon	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
told	NULL
you	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
came	NULL
one	NULL
night	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
hell	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
picture	NULL
that	NULL
never	NULL
left	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dim	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
rising	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
greenish	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
effect	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
greenish	NULL
tinge	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shadows	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tall	NULL
bedposts	NULL
that	NULL
framed	NULL
her	NULL
body	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
straight	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
unflinching	NULL
cruelty	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
belong	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
your	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
answered	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
says	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
hated	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
unthinkable	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
immense	NULL
temptation	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
the	NULL
unthinkable	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
physical	NULL
desire	NULL
but	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mental	NULL
certitude	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
submitted	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
remain	NULL
his	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
desired	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
distance	NULL
of	NULL
five	NULL
thousand	NULL
miles	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
never	NULL
love	NULL
you	NULL
now	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
man	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
belong	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
your	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
never	NULL
love	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fantastic	NULL
display	NULL
of	NULL
cruelty	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
meant	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
belong	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
pulled	NULL
himself	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
normal	NULL
tones	NULL
;	NULL
gruff	NULL
,	NULL
husky	NULL
,	NULL
overbearing	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
servant	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
horse	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
your	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
your	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
is	NULL
all	NULL
nonsense	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
baffled	NULL
,	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
women	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
I	NULL
came	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
.	NULL

VI	NULL
MY	NULL
coming	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
certainly	NULL
calmed	NULL
things	NULL
down	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
fortnight	NULL
that	NULL
intervened	NULL
between	NULL
my	NULL
arrival	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
departure	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
endless	NULL
talking	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
or	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
send	NULL
me	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
interval	NULL
,	NULL
give	NULL
Edward	NULL
a	NULL
hell	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
discovered	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
five	NULL
thousand	NULL
miles	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
love	NULL
him	NULL
steadfastly	NULL
as	NULL
people	NULL
do	NULL
in	NULL
sentimental	NULL
novels	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
smash	NULL
that	NULL
aspiration	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
repeated	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
possible	NULL
tone	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
love	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
detested	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
brutality	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
overbearingness	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
drinking	NULL
habits	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
pledged	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
deep	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
pledged	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
memories	NULL
of	NULL
Maisie	NULL
Maidan	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
Florence	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
never	NULL
said	NULL
anything	NULL
.	NULL

Did	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
love	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
she	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
I	NULL
daresay	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
certainly	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
before	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
reputation	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
certainly	NULL
had	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
call	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
record	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
good	NULL
soldiering	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
saving	NULL
lives	NULL
at	NULL
sea	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
excellent	NULL
landlord	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
sportsman	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
quite	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
things	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
appear	NULL
as	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
little	NULL
or	NULL
no	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
responsibility	NULL
towards	NULL
a	NULL
county	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
country	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
career	NULL
--	NULL
although	NULL
they	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
entirely	NULL
lacking	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
communal	NULL
solidarity	NULL
--	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
immense	NULL
and	NULL
automatically	NULL
working	NULL
instinct	NULL
that	NULL
attaches	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
interest	NULL
of	NULL
womanhood	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
possible	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
woman	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
off	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
husband	NULL
or	NULL
lover	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
rather	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
will	NULL
only	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
has	NULL
reason	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
woman	NULL
has	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
thinks	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
brute	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
she	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
instinctive	NULL
feeling	NULL
for	NULL
suffering	NULL
femininity	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
"	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
saying	NULL
is	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
attach	NULL
any	NULL
particular	NULL
importance	NULL
to	NULL
these	NULL
generalizations	NULL
of	NULL
mine	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
wrong	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
only	NULL
an	NULL
ageing	NULL
American	NULL
with	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
may	NULL
take	NULL
my	NULL
generalizations	NULL
or	NULL
leave	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
pretty	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
Nancy	NULL
Rufford	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
loved	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
very	NULL
deeply	NULL
and	NULL
tenderly	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL
good	NULL
and	NULL
strong	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
unfaithful	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
public	NULL
services	NULL
had	NULL
cost	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
Leonora	NULL
thought	NULL
they	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
cost	NULL
.	NULL

Nancy	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL
good	NULL
and	NULL
strong	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
owe	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
feminine	NULL
public	NULL
opinion	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
driven	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
instinct	NULL
for	NULL
self-preservation	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
well	NULL
imagine	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
Edward	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
unfaithful	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Basil	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
memories	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
unfaithful	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
share	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sex	NULL
instinct	NULL
that	NULL
makes	NULL
women	NULL
be	NULL
intolerably	NULL
cruel	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
beloved	NULL
person	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
point	NULL
,	NULL
Nancy	NULL
Rufford	NULL
loved	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
even	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
getting	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
Aden	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
suicide	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
mad	NULL
.	NULL

Because	NULL
that	NULL
may	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
Leonora	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
both	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
very	NULL
tired	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
held	NULL
passionately	NULL
the	NULL
doctrine	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
love	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
desperately	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
doctrine	NULL
as	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
existence	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
belief	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
personal	NULL
immortality	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
that	NULL
Nancy	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
loved	NULL
Edward	NULL
after	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
her	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
career	NULL
and	NULL
character	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
believed	NULL
maunderingly	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
essential	NULL
attractiveness	NULL
in	NULL
himself	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
continue	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
loving	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
loving	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
underneath	NULL
her	NULL
official	NULL
aspect	NULL
of	NULL
hatred	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
only	NULL
pretended	NULL
to	NULL
hate	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
quite	NULL
atrocious	NULL
telegram	NULL
from	NULL
Brindisi	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
another	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
prove	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
feelings	NULL
creditable	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
member	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
feminine	NULL
commonweal	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
leave	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
is	NULL
another	NULL
point	NULL
that	NULL
worries	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
aspects	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
sad	NULL
affair	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
says	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
desiring	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
five	NULL
thousand	NULL
miles	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
continue	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
monster	NULL
of	NULL
selfishness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
desiring	NULL
the	NULL
ruin	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
supposing	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
love	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
necessity	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
existence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
nothing	NULL
by	NULL
word	NULL
or	NULL
by	NULL
action	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
Nancy	NULL
's	NULL
love	NULL
alive	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
called	NULL
selfish	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
replied	NULL
that	NULL
showed	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
abominably	NULL
selfish	NULL
nature	NULL
even	NULL
though	NULL
his	NULL
actions	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
perfectly	NULL
correct	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
leave	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
actions	NULL
were	NULL
perfectly	NULL
--	NULL
were	NULL
monstrously	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
cruelly	NULL
--	NULL
correct	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
still	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
Leonora	NULL
take	NULL
away	NULL
his	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
Leonora	NULL
damn	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
deepest	NULL
hell	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
stirring	NULL
a	NULL
finger	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
daresay	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
object	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
letting	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
think	NULL
worse	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
than	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
there	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
three	NULL
presented	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
the	NULL
spectacle	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
assure	NULL
you	NULL
that	NULL
during	NULL
my	NULL
stay	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
fortnight	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
fine	NULL
old	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
noticed	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
affected	NULL
that	NULL
good	NULL
opinion	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
look	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
remember	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
thing	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
betrayed	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
remember	NULL
,	NULL
right	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Leonora	NULL
read	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
telegram	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
tremor	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
eyelash	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
shaking	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
country	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
kept	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
jolly	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
even	NULL
longer	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
kept	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
until	NULL
eight	NULL
days	NULL
after	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
funeral	NULL
.	NULL

Immediately	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
particular	NULL
dinner	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
dinner	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
received	NULL
the	NULL
announcement	NULL
that	NULL
Nancy	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
for	NULL
India	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
day	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
asked	NULL
Leonora	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
me	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
then	NULL
said	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
spare	NULL
you	NULL
the	NULL
record	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
emotions	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
Nancy	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
favour	NULL
my	NULL
suit	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
waste	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
upon	NULL
tickets	NULL
and	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
waste	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
upon	NULL
travel	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
India	NULL
if	NULL
Leonora	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
any	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
marrying	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
assure	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
absolutely	NULL
perfect	NULL
British	NULL
matron	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
quite	NULL
favoured	NULL
my	NULL
suit	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
husband	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
considered	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
before	NULL
taking	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
important	NULL
step	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
Leonora	NULL
used	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
"	NULL
taking	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
important	NULL
step	NULL
"	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
perfect	NULL
.	NULL

Actually	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
me	NULL
enough	NULL
but	NULL
my	NULL
programme	NULL
included	NULL
the	NULL
buying	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Kershaw	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
away	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
Fordingbridge	NULL
road	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
settling	NULL
down	NULL
there	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
suit	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
lives	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
periphrasis	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
Philadelphia	NULL
or	NULL
Timbuctoo	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
loved	NULL
Nancy	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
Leonora	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
left	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
left	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
understanding	NULL
that	NULL
Nancy	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
India	NULL
on	NULL
probation	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
perfectly	NULL
reasonable	NULL
arrangement	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
a	NULL
reasonable	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
simply	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
follow	NULL
Nancy	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
India	NULL
after	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
'	NULL
time	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
follow	NULL
Nancy	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
India	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
must	NULL
confess	NULL
to	NULL
having	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
Leonora	NULL
for	NULL
not	NULL
having	NULL
warned	NULL
me	NULL
earlier	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
going	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
queer	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
straight	NULL
methods	NULL
that	NULL
Roman	NULL
Catholics	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
adopt	NULL
in	NULL
dealing	NULL
with	NULL
matters	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
afraid	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
propose	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
considerably	NULL
greater	NULL
advances	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
earlier	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
away	NULL
so	NULL
soon	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
;	NULL
perhaps	NULL
Roman	NULL
Catholics	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
queer	NULL
,	NULL
shifty	NULL
ways	NULL
,	NULL
are	NULL
always	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
are	NULL
dealing	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
queer	NULL
,	NULL
shifty	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
human	NULL
nature	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
quite	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
Nancy	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
away	NULL
so	NULL
soon	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
tried	NULL
making	NULL
love	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
produced	NULL
another	NULL
complication	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
queer	NULL
the	NULL
fantastic	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
quite	NULL
good	NULL
people	NULL
will	NULL
do	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
up	NULL
their	NULL
appearance	NULL
of	NULL
calm	NULL
pococurantism	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
called	NULL
me	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
over	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
seat	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
dog-cart	NULL
whilst	NULL
Edward	NULL
drove	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
railway	NULL
station	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
departure	NULL
to	NULL
India	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
wanted	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
witness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
calmness	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
function	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
luggage	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
already	NULL
packed	NULL
and	NULL
sent	NULL
off	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
berth	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
steamer	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
taken	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
timed	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
so	NULL
exactly	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
went	NULL
like	NULL
clockwork	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
the	NULL
date	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Rufford	NULL
would	NULL
get	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
letter	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
almost	NULL
exactly	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
receive	NULL
his	NULL
telegram	NULL
asking	NULL
his	NULL
daughter	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
been	NULL
quite	NULL
beautifully	NULL
and	NULL
quite	NULL
mercilessly	NULL
arranged	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
Edward	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
gave	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Rufford	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
telegraphing	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Somebody	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
travelling	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
ship	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
serve	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
efficient	NULL
chaperon	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
amazing	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
better	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
attempted	NULL
to	NULL
gouge	NULL
out	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
with	NULL
carving	NULL
knives	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
"	NULL
good	NULL
people	NULL
"	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
my	NULL
interview	NULL
with	NULL
Leonora	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
desultorily	NULL
into	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
gun-room	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
find	NULL
her	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
vague	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
proposing	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
presume	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
come	NULL
of	NULL
quite	NULL
such	NULL
good	NULL
people	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
Ashburnhams	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
was	NULL
lounging	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
smoking	NULL
a	NULL
cigar	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
for	NULL
quite	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
candles	NULL
glowed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
shades	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
reflections	NULL
were	NULL
green	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
glasses	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
book-cases	NULL
that	NULL
held	NULL
guns	NULL
and	NULL
fishing-rods	NULL
.	NULL

Over	NULL
the	NULL
mantelpiece	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
brownish	NULL
picture	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
horse	NULL
.	NULL

Those	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
quietest	NULL
moments	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
ever	NULL
known	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
looked	NULL
me	NULL
straight	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Look	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
drive	NULL
with	NULL
Nancy	NULL
and	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
tomorrow	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
drive	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
Nancy	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
morrow	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
lay	NULL
there	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
fluttering	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
perfectly	NULL
calm	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
lifting	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
so	NULL
desperately	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
Nancy	NULL
Rufford	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
dying	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Poor	NULL
devil	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
guess	NULL
he	NULL
just	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
somebody	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
solicitor	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
all	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
carried	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
programme	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
breath	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
clear	NULL
winter	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
frost	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
bright	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
winding	NULL
road	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
heather	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
bracken	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
hard	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
back-seat	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dog-cart	NULL
;	NULL
Nancy	NULL
was	NULL
beside	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
talked	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
the	NULL
cob	NULL
went	NULL
;	NULL
Edward	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
whip	NULL
a	NULL
cluster	NULL
of	NULL
deer	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
coombe	NULL
three-quarters	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
hounds	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
level	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
road	NULL
beside	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
trees	NULL
going	NULL
into	NULL
Fordingbridge	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
pulled	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
dog-cart	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
Nancy	NULL
might	NULL
say	NULL
good-bye	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
huntsman	NULL
and	NULL
cap	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
last	NULL
sovereign	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
ridden	NULL
with	NULL
those	NULL
hounds	NULL
ever	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
thirteen	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
train	NULL
was	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
late	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
market-day	NULL
at	NULL
Swindon	NULL
or	NULL
wherever	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
they	NULL
talked	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
train	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
;	NULL
Edward	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
first-class	NULL
carriage	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
elderly	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
shake	NULL
mine	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
upon	NULL
those	NULL
people	NULL
's	NULL
faces	NULL
no	NULL
expression	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
kind	NULL
whatever	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
signal	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
's	NULL
departure	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
bright	NULL
red	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
about	NULL
as	NULL
passionate	NULL
a	NULL
statement	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
get	NULL
into	NULL
that	NULL
scene	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
looking	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
cap	NULL
of	NULL
brown	NULL
fur	NULL
that	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
match	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
So	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
answered	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
So	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
swung	NULL
round	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
heel	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
large	NULL
,	NULL
slouching	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
walking	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
deliberate	NULL
pace	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
followed	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
dog-cart	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
horrible	NULL
performance	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
ever	NULL
seen	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
holy	NULL
peace	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
peace	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
which	NULL
passes	NULL
all	NULL
understanding	NULL
,	NULL
descended	NULL
upon	NULL
Branshaw	NULL
Teleragh	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
went	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
daily	NULL
duties	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
triumphant	NULL
smile	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
faint	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
quite	NULL
triumphant	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
guess	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
since	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
any	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
her	NULL
man	NULL
back	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
well	NULL
cured	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
infatuation	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
beneath	NULL
his	NULL
breath	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
just	NULL
caught	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Thou	NULL
hast	NULL
conquered	NULL
,	NULL
O	NULL
pale	NULL
Galilean	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
his	NULL
sentimentality	NULL

He	NULL
addressed	NULL

see	NULL
that	NULL

a	NULL
happy	NULL

The	NULL

the	NULL

Without	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
merely	NULL
a	NULL
jealousy	NULL
arising	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
desired	NULL
myself	NULL
to	NULL
possess	NULL
Leonora	NULL
or	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
because	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
were	NULL
sacrificed	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
two	NULL
persons	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
ever	NULL
really	NULL
loved	NULL
--	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
and	NULL
Nancy	NULL
Rufford	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
modern	NULL
mansion	NULL
,	NULL
replete	NULL
with	NULL
every	NULL
convenience	NULL
and	NULL
dominated	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
quite	NULL
respectable	NULL
and	NULL
eminently	NULL
economical	NULL
master	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
Nancy	NULL
Rufford	NULL
should	NULL
become	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
tragic	NULL
shades	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
poor	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
naked	NULL
and	NULL
reclining	NULL
amidst	NULL
darkness	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
cold	NULL
rocks	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ancient	NULL
Greek	NULL
damned	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Tartarus	NULL
or	NULL
wherever	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
Nancy	NULL
...	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
yesterday	NULL
at	NULL
lunch	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
suddenly	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Shuttlecocks	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
repeated	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
"	NULL
shuttlecocks	NULL
"	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
passing	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Leonora	NULL
has	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
girl	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
shuttlecock	NULL
being	NULL
tossed	NULL
backwards	NULL
and	NULL
forwards	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
violent	NULL
personalities	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

Leonora	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
deliver	NULL
her	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
Edward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
tacitly	NULL
and	NULL
silently	NULL
forced	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
odd	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
himself	NULL
considered	NULL
that	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
women	NULL
used	NULL
him	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
shuttlecock	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
sent	NULL
him	NULL
backwards	NULL
and	NULL
forwards	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
blooming	NULL
parcel	NULL
that	NULL
someone	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
the	NULL
postage	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Leonora	NULL
also	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
and	NULL
Nancy	NULL
picked	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
threw	NULL
her	NULL
down	NULL
as	NULL
suited	NULL
their	NULL
purely	NULL
vagrant	NULL
moods	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
there	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
pretty	NULL
picture	NULL
.	NULL

Mind	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
preaching	NULL
anything	NULL
contrary	NULL
to	NULL
accepted	NULL
morality	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
advocating	NULL
free	NULL
love	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
or	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

Society	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
society	NULL
can	NULL
only	NULL
exist	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
normal	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
virtuous	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
slightly	NULL
deceitful	NULL
flourish	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
passionate	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
headstrong	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
too-truthful	NULL
are	NULL
condemned	NULL
to	NULL
suicide	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
madness	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
guess	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
fainter	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
category	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
passionate	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
headstrong	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
too-truthful	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
conceal	NULL
from	NULL
myself	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
loved	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
love	NULL
him	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
courage	NULL
and	NULL
virility	NULL
and	NULL
possibly	NULL
also	NULL
the	NULL
physique	NULL
of	NULL
Edward	NULL
Ashburnham	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
fancy	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
much	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seems	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
elder	NULL
brother	NULL
who	NULL
took	NULL
me	NULL
out	NULL
on	NULL
several	NULL
excursions	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
many	NULL
dashing	NULL
things	NULL
whilst	NULL
I	NULL
just	NULL
watched	NULL
him	NULL
robbing	NULL
the	NULL
orchards	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
distance	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sentimentalist	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

.	NULL

.	NULL

.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
society	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
breed	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
rabbits	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
is	NULL
what	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
here	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
society	NULL
--	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
that	NULL
absurd	NULL
figure	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
American	NULL
millionaire	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
bought	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ancient	NULL
haunts	NULL
of	NULL
English	NULL
peace	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
sit	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Edward	NULL
's	NULL
gun-room	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
absolutely	NULL
quiet	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
visits	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
visit	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
is	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
interests	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
twenty	NULL
minutes	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
walk	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
,	NULL
beneath	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
oaks	NULL
,	NULL
alongside	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
clumps	NULL
of	NULL
gorse	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
American	NULL
mail	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
tenants	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
boys	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tradesmen	NULL
will	NULL
touch	NULL
their	NULL
hats	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
life	NULL
peters	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
shall	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
dine	NULL
and	NULL
Nancy	NULL
will	NULL
sit	NULL
opposite	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
nurse	NULL
standing	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Enigmatic	NULL
,	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
utterly	NULL
well-behaved	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
knife	NULL
and	NULL
fork	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
Nancy	NULL
will	NULL
stare	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
that	NULL
have	NULL
over	NULL
them	NULL
strained	NULL
,	NULL
stretched	NULL
brows	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
perhaps	NULL
twice	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
meal	NULL
her	NULL
knife	NULL
and	NULL
fork	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
suspended	NULL
in	NULL
mid-air	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
will	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
believes	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
Omnipotent	NULL
Deity	NULL
or	NULL
she	NULL
will	NULL
utter	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
word	NULL
"	NULL
shuttle-cocks	NULL
"	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
perfect	NULL
flush	NULL
of	NULL
health	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
lustre	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
coiled	NULL
black	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
poise	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
neck	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
grace	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
hands	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
means	NULL
nothing	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
picture	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
meaning	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
queer	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
always	NULL
Leonora	NULL
to	NULL
cheer	NULL
you	NULL
up	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
sadden	NULL
you	NULL

Her	NULL
husband	NULL
is	NULL
quite	NULL
an	NULL
economical	NULL
person	NULL
of	NULL
so	NULL
normal	NULL
a	NULL
figure	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
can	NULL
get	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
proportion	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
clothes	NULL
ready-made	NULL

That	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
desideratum	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
story	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
child	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
brought	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
Romanist	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
suddenly	NULL
occurs	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
forgotten	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
how	NULL
Edward	NULL
met	NULL
his	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
peace	NULL
had	NULL
descended	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
Leonora	NULL
was	NULL
quietly	NULL
triumphant	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
said	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
merely	NULL
a	NULL
passing	NULL
phase	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
afternoon	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
stables	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
flooring	NULL
that	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
loose-box	NULL
.	NULL

Edward	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
animation	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
necessity	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
the	NULL
numbers	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Hampshire	NULL
territorials	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
proper	NULL
standard	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
sober	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
quiet	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
skin	NULL
was	NULL
clear-coloured	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
golden	NULL
and	NULL
perfectly	NULL
brushed	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
level	NULL
brick-dust	NULL
red	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
complexion	NULL
went	NULL
clean	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rims	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
eyelids	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
porcelain	NULL
blue	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
regarded	NULL
me	NULL
frankly	NULL
and	NULL
directly	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
expressionless	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
was	NULL
deep	NULL
and	NULL
rough	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
well	NULL
back	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
legs	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
We	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
them	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
two	NULL
thousand	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
and	NULL
fifty	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

A	NULL
stable-boy	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
telegram	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
opened	NULL
it	NULL
negligently	NULL
,	NULL
regarded	NULL
it	NULL
without	NULL
emotion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
complete	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
handed	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
pinkish	NULL
paper	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sprawled	NULL
handwriting	NULL
I	NULL
read	NULL
:	NULL

Safe	NULL

rattling	NULL
good	NULL
time	NULL

Nancy	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
gentleman	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sentimentalist	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
compounded	NULL
of	NULL
indifferent	NULL
poems	NULL
and	NULL
novels	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
just	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
roof	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stable	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
looking	NULL
to	NULL
Heaven	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whispered	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
catch	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
two	NULL
fingers	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
waistcoat	NULL
pocket	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
grey	NULL
,	NULL
frieze	NULL
suit	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
neat	NULL
pen-knife	NULL
--	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
pen-knife	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
might	NULL
just	NULL
take	NULL
that	NULL
wire	NULL
to	NULL
Leonora	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
direct	NULL
,	NULL
challenging	NULL
,	NULL
brow-beating	NULL
glare	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
guess	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
eyes	NULL

Why	NULL
should	NULL
I	NULL
hinder	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
wanted	NULL

the	NULL
world	NULL

let	NULL

Not	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
hundreds	NULL
and	NULL
hundreds	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
deserved	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
poor	NULL
devil	NULL
should	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL

that	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
intend	NULL

interfere	NULL

remarked	NULL

I	NULL
must	NULL

I	NULL
trotted	NULL
