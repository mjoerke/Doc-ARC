CHAPTER	O
I	O
I	O
MEET	O
SIR	B-PER
HENRY	I-PER
CURTIS	I-PER
It	O
is	O
a	O
curious	O
thing	O
that	O
at	O
my	O
age	O
--	O
fifty-five	O
last	O
birthday	O
--	O
I	O
should	O
find	O
myself	O
taking	O
up	O
a	O
pen	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
write	O
a	O
history	O
.	O

I	O
wonder	O
what	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
history	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
when	O
I	O
have	O
finished	O
it	O
,	O
if	O
ever	O
I	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
trip	O
!	O

I	O
have	O
done	O
a	O
good	O
many	O
things	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
,	O
which	O
seems	O
a	O
long	O
one	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
owing	O
to	O
my	O
having	O
begun	O
work	O
so	O
young	O
,	O
perhaps	O
.	O

At	O
an	O
age	O
when	O
other	B-PER
boys	I-PER
are	O
at	O
school	B-ORG
I	O
was	O
earning	O
my	O
living	O
as	O
a	B-PER
trader	I-PER
in	I-PER
the	I-PER
old	I-PER
Colony	I-PER
.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
trading	O
,	O
hunting	O
,	O
fighting	O
,	O
or	O
mining	O
ever	O
since	O
.	O

And	O
yet	O
it	O
is	O
only	O
eight	O
months	O
ago	O
that	O
I	O
made	O
my	O
pile	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
big	O
pile	O
now	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
got	O
it	O
--	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
yet	O
know	O
how	O
big	O
--	O
but	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
think	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
through	O
the	O
last	O
fifteen	O
or	O
sixteen	O
months	O
again	O
for	O
it	O
;	O
no	O
,	O
not	O
if	O
I	O
knew	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
come	O
out	O
safe	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
,	O
pile	O
and	O
all	O
.	O

But	O
then	O
I	O
am	O
a	B-PER
timid	I-PER
man	I-PER
,	O
and	O
dislike	O
violence	O
;	O
moreover	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
almost	O
sick	O
of	O
adventure	O
.	O

I	O
wonder	O
why	O
I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
write	O
this	O
book	O
:	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
in	O
my	O
line	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
a	B-PER
literary	I-PER
man	I-PER
,	O
though	O
very	O
devoted	O
to	O
the	O
Old	O
Testament	O
and	O
also	O
to	O
the	O
"	O
Ingoldsby	O
Legends	O
.	O
"	O

Let	O
me	O
try	O
to	O
set	O
down	O
my	O
reasons	O
,	O
just	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
I	O
have	O
any	O
.	O

First	O
reason	O
:	O
Because	O
Sir	B-PER
Henry	I-PER
Curtis	I-PER
and	O
Captain	B-PER
John	I-PER
Good	I-PER
asked	O
me	O
.	O

Second	O
reason	O
:	O
Because	O
I	O
am	O
laid	O
up	O
here	B-GPE
at	O
Durban	B-GPE
with	O
the	O
pain	O
in	O
my	O
left	O
leg	O
.	O

Ever	O
since	O
that	O
confounded	O
lion	O
got	O
hold	O
of	O
me	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
liable	O
to	O
this	O
trouble	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
rather	O
bad	O
just	O
now	O
,	O
it	O
makes	O
me	O
limp	O
more	O
than	O
ever	O
.	O

There	O
must	O
be	O
some	O
poison	O
in	O
a	O
lion	O
's	O
teeth	O
,	O
otherwise	O
how	O
is	O
it	O
that	O
when	O
your	O
wounds	O
are	O
healed	O
they	O
break	O
out	O
again	O
,	O
generally	O
,	O
mark	O
you	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
of	O
year	O
that	O
you	O
got	O
your	O
mauling	O
?	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
hard	O
thing	O
when	O
one	O
has	O
shot	O
sixty-five	O
lions	O
or	O
more	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
sixty-sixth	O
should	O
chew	O
your	O
leg	O
like	O
a	O
quid	O
of	O
tobacco	O
.	O

It	O
breaks	O
the	O
routine	O
of	O
the	O
thing	O
,	O
and	O
putting	O
other	O
considerations	O
aside	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
an	B-PER
orderly	I-PER
man	I-PER
and	O
do	O
n't	O
like	O
that	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
.	O

Third	O
reason	O
:	O
Because	O
I	O
want	O
my	B-PER
boy	I-PER
Harry	B-PER
,	I-PER
who	I-PER
is	I-PER
over	I-PER
there	I-PER
at	I-PER
the	I-PER
hospital	I-PER
in	I-PER
London	I-PER
studying	I-PER
to	I-PER
become	I-PER
a	I-PER
doctor	I-PER
,	O
to	O
have	O
something	O
to	O
amuse	O
him	O
and	O
keep	O
him	O
out	O
of	O
mischief	O
for	O
a	O
week	O
or	O
so	O
.	O

Hospital	B-ORG
work	O
must	O
sometimes	O
pall	O
and	O
grow	O
rather	O
dull	O
,	O
for	O
even	O
of	O
cutting	O
up	O
dead	O
bodies	O
there	O
may	O
come	O
satiety	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
this	O
history	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
dull	O
,	O
whatever	O
else	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
,	O
it	O
will	O
put	O
a	O
little	O
life	O
into	O
things	O
for	O
a	O
day	O
or	O
two	O
while	O
Harry	B-PER
is	O
reading	O
of	O
our	O
adventures	O
.	O

Fourth	O
reason	O
and	O
last	O
:	O
Because	O
I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
tell	O
the	O
strangest	O
story	O
that	O
I	O
remember	O
.	O

It	O
may	O
seem	O
a	O
queer	O
thing	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
especially	O
considering	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
no	B-PER
woman	I-PER
in	O
it	O
--	O
except	O
Foulata	B-PER
.	O

Stop	O
,	O
though	O
!	O

there	O
is	O
Gagaoola	B-PER
,	O
if	O
she	O
was	O
a	B-PER
woman	I-PER
,	O
and	O
not	O
a	B-PER
fiend	I-PER
.	O

But	O
she	O
was	O
a	O
hundred	O
at	O
least	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
not	O
marriageable	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
count	O
her	O
.	O

At	O
any	O
rate	O
,	O
I	O
can	O
safely	O
say	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
_	O
petticoat	O
_	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O
history	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
better	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
yoke	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
stiff	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
feel	O
as	O
though	O
I	O
were	O
bogged	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
axle	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
"	O
_	O
sutjes	O
,	O
sutjes	O
_	O
,	O
"	O
as	O
the	B-PER
Boers	I-PER
say	O
--	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
they	O
spell	O
it	O
--	O
softly	O
does	O
it	O
.	O

A	O
strong	O
team	O
will	O
come	O
through	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
too	O
poor	O
.	O

You	O
can	O
never	O
do	O
anything	O
with	O
poor	O
oxen	O
.	O

Now	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
start	O

I	O
,	O
Allan	B-PER

of	O
Durban	B-GPE

Natal	B-GPE
,	O
Gentleman	B-PER

make	O
oath	O
and	O
say	O
--	O
That	O
's	O
how	O
I	O
headed	O
my	O
deposition	O
before	O
the	B-PER
magistrate	I-PER
about	O
poor	O
Khiva	B-PER
's	O
and	O
Ventvögel	B-PER
's	O
sad	O
deaths	O
;	O
but	O
somehow	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
seem	O
quite	O
the	O
right	O
way	O
to	O
begin	O
a	O
book	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
besides	O
,	O
am	O
I	O
a	B-PER
gentleman	I-PER
?	O

What	O
is	O
a	B-PER
gentleman	I-PER
?	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
quite	O
know	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
niggers	B-PER
--	O
no	O
,	O
I	O
will	O
scratch	O
out	O
that	O
word	O
"	O
niggers	B-PER
,	O
"	O
for	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
like	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
've	O
known	O
natives	B-PER
who	O
_	O
are	O
_	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
you	O
will	O
say	O
,	O
Harry	B-PER
,	O
my	B-PER
boy	I-PER
,	O
before	O
you	O
have	O
done	O
with	O
this	O
tale	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
known	O
mean	B-PER
whites	I-PER
with	I-PER
lots	I-PER
of	I-PER
money	I-PER
and	I-PER
fresh	I-PER
out	I-PER
from	I-PER
home	I-PER
,	O
too	O
,	O
who	O
_	O
are	O
not	O
_	O
.	O

At	O
any	O
rate	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
born	O
a	B-PER
gentleman	I-PER
,	O
though	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
nothing	O
but	O
a	B-PER
poor	I-PER
travelling	I-PER
trader	I-PER
and	I-PER
hunter	I-PER
all	O
my	O
life	O
.	O

Whether	O
I	O
have	O
remained	O
so	O
I	O
known	O
not	O
,	O
you	O
must	O
judge	O
of	O
that	O
.	O

Heaven	B-FAC
knows	O
I	O
've	O
tried	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
killed	O
many	B-PER
men	I-PER
in	O
my	O
time	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
slain	O
wantonly	O
or	O
stained	O
my	O
hand	O
in	O
innocent	O
blood	O
,	O
but	O
only	O
in	O
self-defence	O
.	O

The	B-PER
Almighty	I-PER
gave	O
us	O
our	O
lives	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
suppose	O
He	B-PER
meant	O
us	O
to	O
defend	O
them	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
I	O
have	O
always	O
acted	O
on	O
that	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
hope	O
it	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
brought	O
up	O
against	O
me	O
when	O
my	O
clock	O
strikes	O
.	O

There	O
,	O
there	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
a	B-LOC
cruel	I-LOC
and	I-LOC
a	I-LOC
wicked	I-LOC
world	I-LOC
,	O
and	O
for	O
a	B-PER
timid	I-PER
man	I-PER
I	O
have	O
been	O
mixed	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
fighting	O
.	O

I	O
can	O
not	O
tell	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
any	O
rate	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
stolen	O
,	O
though	O
once	O
I	O
cheated	O
a	B-PER
Kafir	I-PER
out	O
of	O
a	O
herd	O
of	O
cattle	O
.	O

But	O
then	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
me	O
a	O
dirty	O
turn	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
has	O
troubled	O
me	O
ever	O
since	O
into	O
the	O
bargain	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
eighteen	O
months	O
or	O
so	O
ago	O
since	O
first	O
I	O
met	O
Sir	B-PER
Henry	I-PER
Curtis	I-PER
and	O
Captain	B-PER
Good	I-PER
.	O

It	O
was	O
in	O
this	O
way	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
been	O
up	O
elephant	O
hunting	O
beyond	O
Bamangwato	B-GPE
,	O
and	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
bad	O
luck	O
.	O

Everything	O
went	O
wrong	O
that	O
trip	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
top	O
up	O
with	O
I	O
got	O
the	O
fever	O
badly	O
.	O

So	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
well	O
enough	O
I	O
trekked	O
down	O
to	O
the	B-FAC
Diamond	I-FAC
Fields	I-FAC
,	O
sold	O
such	O
ivory	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
together	O
with	O
my	O
wagon	O
and	O
oxen	O
,	O
discharged	O
my	B-PER
hunters	I-PER
,	O
and	O
took	O
the	O
post-cart	O
to	O
the	B-LOC
Cape	I-LOC
.	O

After	O
spending	O
a	O
week	O
in	O
Cape	B-GPE
Town	I-GPE
,	O
finding	O
that	O
they	O
overcharged	O
me	O
at	O
the	B-FAC
hotel	I-FAC
,	O
and	O
having	O
seen	O
everything	O
there	O
was	O
to	O
see	O
,	O
including	O
the	O
botanical	O
gardens	O
,	O
which	O
seem	O
to	O
me	O
likely	O
to	O
confer	O
a	O
great	O
benefit	O
on	O
the	B-GPE
country	I-GPE
,	O
and	O
the	B-FAC
new	I-FAC
Houses	I-FAC
of	I-FAC
Parliament	I-FAC
,	O
which	O
I	O
expect	O
will	O
do	O
nothing	O
of	O
the	O
sort	O
,	O
I	O
determined	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
Natal	B-GPE
by	O
the	O
_	O
Dunkeld	B-GPE
_	O
,	O
then	O
lying	O
at	O
the	O
docks	O
waiting	O
for	O
the	B-FAC
_	I-FAC
Edinburgh	I-FAC
Castle	I-FAC
_	I-FAC
due	O
in	O
from	O
England	B-GPE
.	O

I	O
took	O
my	O
berth	O
and	O
went	O
aboard	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
afternoon	O
the	B-PER
Natal	I-PER
passengers	I-PER
from	I-PER
the	I-PER
_	I-PER
Edinburgh	I-PER
Castle	I-PER
_	I-PER
transhipped	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
weighed	O
and	O
put	O
to	O
sea	B-LOC
.	O

Among	O
these	B-PER
passengers	I-PER
who	I-PER
came	I-PER
on	I-PER
board	I-PER
were	O
two	B-PER
who	I-PER
excited	I-PER
my	I-PER
curiosity	I-PER
.	O

One	O
,	O
a	B-PER
gentleman	I-PER
of	I-PER
about	I-PER
thirty	I-PER
,	O
was	O
perhaps	O
the	B-PER
biggest-chested	I-PER
and	I-PER
longest-armed	I-PER
man	I-PER
I	I-PER
ever	I-PER
saw	I-PER
.	O

He	O
had	O
yellow	O
hair	O
,	O
a	O
thick	O
yellow	O
beard	O
,	O
clear-cut	O
features	O
,	O
and	O
large	O
grey	O
eyes	O
set	O
deep	O
in	O
his	O
head	O
.	O

I	O
never	O
saw	O
a	B-PER
finer-looking	I-PER
man	I-PER
,	O
and	O
somehow	O
he	O
reminded	O
me	O
of	O
an	B-PER
ancient	I-PER
Dane	I-PER
.	O

Not	O
that	O
I	O
know	O
much	O
of	O
ancient	B-PER
Danes	I-PER
,	O
though	O
I	O
knew	O
a	B-PER
modern	I-PER
Dane	I-PER
who	I-PER
did	I-PER
me	I-PER
out	I-PER
of	I-PER
ten	I-PER
pounds	I-PER
;	O
but	O
I	O
remember	O
once	O
seeing	O
a	O
picture	O
of	O
some	B-PER
of	I-PER
those	I-PER
gentry	I-PER
,	O
who	O
,	O
I	O
take	O
it	O
,	O
were	O
a	B-PER
kind	I-PER
of	I-PER
white	I-PER
Zulus	I-PER
.	O

They	O
were	O
drinking	O
out	O
of	O
big	O
horns	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
long	O
hair	O
hung	O
down	O
their	O
backs	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
looked	O
at	O
my	B-PER
friend	I-PER
standing	I-PER
there	I-PER
by	I-PER
the	I-PER
companion-ladder	I-PER
,	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
only	O
let	O
his	O
grow	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
put	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
chain	O
shirts	O
on	O
to	O
his	O
great	O
shoulders	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
hold	O
of	O
a	O
battle-axe	O
and	O
a	O
horn	O
mug	O
,	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
sat	O
as	O
a	B-PER
model	I-PER
for	I-PER
that	I-PER
picture	I-PER
.	O

And	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
curious	O

suspected	O

that	O

I	O
do	O

it	O

asked	O

what	O
is	O
a	B-PER
gentleman	I-PER

I	O
'll	O
answer	O
the	O
question	O
now	O
:	O
A	B-PER
Royal	I-PER
Naval	I-PER
officer	I-PER
is	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
general	O

there	O
may	O
be	O
a	O
black	O
sheep	O
among	O
them	O
here	O
and	O
there	O
.	O

I	O
fancy	O
it	O
is	O
just	O
the	B-LOC
wide	I-LOC
seas	I-LOC
and	O
the	O
breath	O
of	O
God	B-PER
's	O
winds	O
that	O
wash	O
their	O

and	O
blow	O
the	O
bitterness	O
out	O
of	O
their	O

and	O
make	O
them	O
what	O
men	B-PER
ought	O
to	O
be	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
to	O
return	O
,	O
I	O
proved	O
right	O
again	O
;	O
I	O
ascertained	O
that	O
the	B-PER
dark	I-PER
man	I-PER
_	O
was	O
_	O
a	B-PER
naval	I-PER
officer	I-PER

a	B-PER

after	O
seventeen	O

been	O
turned	O
out	O

employ	O
with	O
the	O
barren	O
honour	O
of	O
a	B-PER

rank	O

because	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
that	O
he	O

This	O
is	O
what	O
people	B-PER
who	I-PER
serve	I-PER
the	I-PER
Queen	I-PER
have	O
to	O
expect	O

I	O
suppose	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
mind	O
it	O

but	O
for	O
my	O

part	O
I	O
had	O
rather	O

my	O

as	O
a	B-PER

One	O

The	B-PER

and	O
rather	O
a	B-PER
curious	I-PER

He	O
was	O
so	O
very	O

so	O
very	O
clean-shaved	O

and	O
he	O
always	O
wore	O
an	O
eye-glass	O
in	O
his	O

It	O
seemed	O

grow	O
there	O

no	O

and	O
he	O
never	O

it	O
out	O

At	O

I	O
thought	O

afterwards	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
this	O

a	O

He	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
his	O

when	O
he	O
went	O
to	O

together	O
with	O

he	O
had	O
two	O

that	O

my	O

none	O

the	O

often	O
caused	O
me	O
to	O
break	O
the	O

But	O
I	O
am	O
anticipating	O

Soon	NULL
after	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
under	NULL
way	NULL
evening	NULL
closed	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
brought	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
dirty	NULL
weather	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
keen	NULL
breeze	NULL
sprung	NULL
up	NULL
off	NULL
land	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
aggravated	NULL
Scotch	NULL
mist	NULL
soon	NULL
drove	NULL
everybody	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
deck	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
Dunkeld	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
flat-bottomed	NULL
punt	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
going	NULL
up	NULL
light	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
rolled	NULL
very	NULL
heavily	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
almost	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
right	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
stood	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
engines	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
warm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
amused	NULL
myself	NULL
with	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
pendulum	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
fixed	NULL
opposite	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
swinging	NULL
slowly	NULL
backwards	NULL
and	NULL
forwards	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
vessel	NULL
rolled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
marking	NULL
the	NULL
angle	NULL
she	NULL
touched	NULL
at	NULL
each	NULL
lurch	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
pendulum	NULL
's	NULL
wrong	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
properly	NULL
weighted	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
suddenly	NULL
said	NULL
a	NULL
somewhat	NULL
testy	NULL
voice	NULL
at	NULL
my	NULL
shoulder	NULL
.	NULL

Looking	NULL
round	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
naval	NULL
officer	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
noticed	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
passengers	NULL
came	NULL
aboard	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
what	NULL
makes	NULL
you	NULL
think	NULL
so	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Think	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
there	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
righted	NULL
herself	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
roll	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
ship	NULL
had	NULL
really	NULL
rolled	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
degree	NULL
that	NULL
thing	NULL
pointed	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
rolled	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
just	NULL
like	NULL
these	NULL
merchant	NULL
skippers	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
always	NULL
so	NULL
confoundedly	NULL
careless	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Just	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
dinner-bell	NULL
rang	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sorry	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
dreadful	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
officer	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Royal	NULL
Navy	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
gets	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
subject	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
only	NULL
know	NULL
one	NULL
worse	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
a	NULL
merchant	NULL
skipper	NULL
express	NULL
his	NULL
candid	NULL
opinion	NULL
of	NULL
officers	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Royal	NULL
Navy	NULL
.	NULL

Captain	NULL
Good	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
we	NULL
found	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
Curtis	NULL
already	NULL
seated	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
and	NULL
Captain	NULL
Good	NULL
were	NULL
placed	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
sat	NULL
opposite	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
captain	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
soon	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
shooting	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
not	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
asking	NULL
me	NULL
many	NULL
questions	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
inquisitive	NULL
about	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
answering	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
elephants	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sitting	NULL
quite	NULL
quiet	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
our	NULL
talk	NULL
,	NULL
started	NULL
visibly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Excuse	NULL
me	NULL

sir	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
leaning	NULL
forward	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL

and	NULL
speaking	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
deep	NULL
voice	NULL

a	NULL
very	NULL
suitable	NULL
voice	NULL

it	NULL
seemed	NULL

out	NULL

great	NULL

I	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL

The	NULL
big	NULL
man	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL

I	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
mutter	NULL

fortunate	NULL

into	NULL
his	NULL

Presently	NULL
dinner	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL

and	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
saloon	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
strolled	NULL
up	NULL

asked	NULL
me	NULL

come	NULL
into	NULL

cabin	NULL

smoke	NULL

I	NULL
accepted	NULL

a	NULL

when	NULL

down	NULL

had	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL

now	NULL
that	NULL

He	NULL

till	NULL
five	NULL

But	NULL
just	NULL
about	NULL
five	NULL

a	NULL
misfortune	NULL
befell	NULL
us	NULL

as	NULL
sometimes	NULL

Here	NULL
Captain	NULL
Good	NULL
nodded	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
vigorously	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL

The	NULL
ship	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
big	NULL
roll	NULL
just	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
looking-glass	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
fixed	NULL
opposite	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
starboard	NULL

was	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
nearly	NULL
over	NULL
our	NULL
heads	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
hands	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
pockets	NULL

staring	NULL
upwards	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
nodding	NULL
like	NULL
anything	NULL

"	NULL
As	NULL
I	NULL

you	NULL
know	NULL

It	NULL

happened	NULL

just	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
quarrelled	NULL
our	NULL
father	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
off	NULL
making	NULL
his	NULL
will	NULL
until	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL

The	NULL
result	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
brother	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
brought	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL

duty	NULL

him	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
quarrel	NULL

so	NULL
bitter	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

it	NULL
(	NULL

he	NULL
sighed	NULL
deeply	NULL

anything	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
grudged	NULL
him	NULL
justice	NULL

I	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL

went	NULL
on	NULL
Sir	NULL

my	NULL
brother	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
account	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL

Without	NULL
saying	NULL
anything	NULL

me	NULL
he	NULL
drew	NULL
out	NULL
this	NULL
paltry	NULL
sum	NULL

and	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
adopted	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL

off	NULL

This	NULL
I	NULL

afterwards	NULL

Some	NULL
three	NULL

passed	NULL

I	NULL
heard	NULL
nothing	NULL

I	NULL
wrote	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL

Doubtless	NULL
the	NULL

never	NULL
reached	NULL
him	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
time	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
I	NULL
grew	NULL
more	NULL

more	NULL
troubled	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL

I	NULL
found	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Quatermain	NULL

time	NULL

I	NULL
became	NULL

anxious	NULL

find	NULL
out	NULL
if	NULL
my	NULL

alive	NULL

dead	NULL

and	NULL
if	NULL
alive	NULL

him	NULL
home	NULL

I	NULL
set	NULL
enquiries	NULL
on	NULL
foot	NULL

your	NULL
letter	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL

the	NULL
results	NULL

cut	NULL
a	NULL

Well	NULL

as	NULL
you	NULL
may	NULL
guess	NULL

generally	NULL

are	NULL

much	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL

the	NULL
ways	NULL

But	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
you	NULL
meet	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
takes	NULL
the	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
collect	NULL
traditions	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
natives	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tries	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
history	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
dark	NULL
land	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
who	NULL
first	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
the	NULL
legend	NULL

a	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
first	NULL
elephant	NULL
hunt	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Matabele	NULL
country	NULL

His	NULL
name	NULL

a	NULL

for	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL

and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
little	NULL
game	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
attack	NULL

fever	NULL

was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
way	NULL
generally	NULL

this	NULL

reminded	NULL

about	NULL

with	NULL
large	NULL

We	NULL
talked	NULL
together	NULL

for	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
speak	NULL
broken	NULL

I	NULL
understood	NULL

A	NULL
week	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
fever	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
evening	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
tent	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
chewing	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
leg	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
miserable	NULL
fowl	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
native	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
cloth	NULL
worth	NULL
twenty	NULL
fowls	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hot	NULL
red	NULL
sun	NULL
sinking	NULL
down	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
suddenly	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
figure	NULL
,	NULL
apparently	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
European	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
coat	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
slope	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rising	NULL
ground	NULL
opposite	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
figure	NULL
crept	NULL
along	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
knees	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
staggered	NULL
forward	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
yards	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL
legs	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
fall	NULL
and	NULL
crawl	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Seeing	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
somebody	NULL
in	NULL
distress	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
sent	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
hunters	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
he	NULL
arrived	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
suppose	NULL
it	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL

Yes	NULL

José	NULL
Silvestre	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
his	NULL
skeleton	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
skin	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bright	NULL
yellow	NULL
with	NULL
bilious	NULL
fever	NULL

his	NULL

he	NULL
moaned	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
were	NULL
cracked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
tongue	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
protruded	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL

was	NULL
swollen	NULL
and	NULL
blackish	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
water	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
milk	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
drank	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
great	NULL
gulps	NULL

two	NULL
quarts	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
stopping	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
have	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
fever	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
fell	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
rave	NULL
about	NULL
Suliman	NULL
's	NULL
Mountains	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
diamonds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
carried	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
tent	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
enough	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

About	NULL
eleven	NULL
o'clock	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
quieter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
rest	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
dawn	NULL
I	NULL
woke	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
half	NULL
light	NULL
saw	NULL
Silvestre	NULL
sitting	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
,	NULL
gaunt	NULL
form	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gazing	NULL
out	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL

Presently	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
ray	NULL

shot	NULL
right	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL

Suddenly	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
groped	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
shirt	NULL

brought	NULL
out	NULL
what	NULL

thought	NULL

this	NULL

a	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
too	NULL
old	NULL

I	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
III	NULL
UMBOPA	NULL
ENTERS	NULL
OUR	NULL
SERVICE	NULL
It	NULL
takes	NULL
from	NULL
four	NULL
to	NULL
five	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
speed	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vessel	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Cape	NULL
to	NULL
Durban	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
landing	NULL
is	NULL
bad	NULL
at	NULL
East	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
made	NULL
that	NULL
wonderful	NULL
harbour	NULL
they	NULL
talk	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sink	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
mint	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
ship	NULL
is	NULL
delayed	NULL
for	NULL
twenty-four	NULL
hours	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
cargo	NULL
boats	NULL
can	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
goods	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
occasion	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
breakers	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Bar	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tugs	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
strings	NULL
of	NULL
ugly	NULL
flat-bottomed	NULL
boats	NULL
behind	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
into	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
packages	NULL
were	NULL
bundled	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
crash	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
matter	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
slap-bang	NULL
;	NULL
whether	NULL
they	NULL
contained	NULL
china	NULL
or	NULL
woollen	NULL
goods	NULL
they	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
treatment	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
saw	NULL
one	NULL
case	NULL
holding	NULL
four	NULL
dozen	NULL
of	NULL
champagne	NULL
smashed	NULL
all	NULL
to	NULL
bits	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
champagne	NULL
fizzing	NULL
and	NULL
boiling	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dirty	NULL
cargo	NULL
boat	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
wicked	NULL
waste	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
evidently	NULL
so	NULL
the	NULL
Kafirs	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
boat	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
unbroken	NULL
bottles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
knocking	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
necks	NULL
drank	NULL
the	NULL
contents	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
allowed	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
expansion	NULL
caused	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fizz	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
themselves	NULL
swelling	NULL
,	NULL
rolled	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boat	NULL
,	NULL
calling	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
liquor	NULL
was	NULL
"	NULL
tagati	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
bewitched	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
vessel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
them	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
strongest	NULL
medicine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
good	NULL
as	NULL
dead	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

Those	NULL
Kafirs	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
shore	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
great	NULL
fright	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
will	NULL
touch	NULL
champagne	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
steaming	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
Natal	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
over	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
Curtis	NULL
's	NULL
offer	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
I	NULL
told	NULL
them	NULL
many	NULL
hunting	NULL
yarns	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
true	NULL
ones	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
need	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
lies	NULL
about	NULL
hunting	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
curious	NULL
things	NULL
happen	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
whose	NULL
business	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
hunt	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
beautiful	NULL
evening	NULL
in	NULL
January	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
our	NULL
hottest	NULL
month	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
steamed	NULL
past	NULL
the	NULL
coast	NULL
of	NULL
Natal	NULL
,	NULL
expecting	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
Durban	NULL
Point	NULL
by	NULL
sunset	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
lovely	NULL
coast	NULL
all	NULL
along	NULL
from	NULL
East	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
red	NULL
sandhills	NULL
and	NULL
wide	NULL
sweeps	NULL
of	NULL
vivid	NULL
green	NULL
,	NULL
dotted	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
with	NULL
Kafir	NULL
kraals	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
bordered	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
ribbon	NULL
of	NULL
white	NULL
surf	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
spouts	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
pillars	NULL
of	NULL
foam	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
hits	NULL
the	NULL
rocks	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
you	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
Durban	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
richness	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
landscape	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
sheer	NULL
kloofs	NULL
cut	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hills	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
rushing	NULL
rains	NULL
of	NULL
centuries	NULL
,	NULL
down	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
rivers	NULL
sparkle	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
deepest	NULL
green	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bush	NULL
,	NULL
growing	NULL
as	NULL
God	NULL
planted	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
greens	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mealie	NULL
gardens	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sugar	NULL
patches	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
smiling	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
placid	NULL
sea	NULL
,	NULL
puts	NULL
a	NULL
finish	NULL
and	NULL
gives	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
homeliness	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
beautiful	NULL
a	NULL
view	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
requires	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
complete	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
perhaps	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
because	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
lived	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wilderness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
therefore	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
value	NULL
of	NULL
civilisation	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
it	NULL
drives	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
game	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Garden	NULL
of	NULL
Eden	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
fair	NULL
before	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
always	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
fairer	NULL
when	NULL
Eve	NULL
adorned	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
return	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
miscalculated	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
down	NULL
before	NULL
we	NULL
dropped	NULL
anchor	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
Point	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
gun	NULL
which	NULL
told	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
folks	NULL
of	NULL
Durban	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
Mail	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
Bar	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
comfortably	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
seeing	NULL
the	NULL
Mails	NULL
carried	NULL
off	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
life-boat	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
we	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shining	NULL
so	NULL
brightly	NULL
over	NULL
sea	NULL
and	NULL
shore	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
almost	NULL
paled	NULL
the	NULL
quick	NULL
,	NULL
large	NULL
flashes	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
lighthouse	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
shore	NULL
floated	NULL
sweet	NULL
spicy	NULL
odours	NULL
that	NULL
always	NULL
remind	NULL
me	NULL
of	NULL
hymns	NULL
and	NULL
missionaries	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
houses	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Berea	NULL
sparkled	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
lights	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
brig	NULL
lying	NULL
near	NULL
also	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
music	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sailors	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
worked	NULL
at	NULL
getting	NULL
the	NULL
anchor	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
ready	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
.	NULL

Altogether	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
night	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
sometimes	NULL
get	NULL
in	NULL
Southern	NULL
Africa	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
threw	NULL
a	NULL
garment	NULL
of	NULL
peace	NULL
over	NULL
everybody	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL
threw	NULL
a	NULL
garment	NULL
of	NULL
silver	NULL
over	NULL
everything	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
bulldog	NULL
,	NULL
belonging	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
sporting	NULL
passenger	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
yield	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
gentle	NULL
influences	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
forgetting	NULL
his	NULL
yearning	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
close	NULL
quarters	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
baboon	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cage	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
foc	NULL
'	NULL
sle	NULL
,	NULL
snored	NULL
happily	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL

the	NULL

,	NULL
dreaming	NULL
no	NULL

that	NULL

I	NULL

That	NULL
is	NULL
something	NULL

let	NULL
me	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
one	NULL
has	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
journey	NULL
like	NULL
this	NULL
before	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
now	NULL
as	NULL

I	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
flatly	NULL
,	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL

Captain	NULL

that	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL

was	NULL
the	NULL
fate	NULL

the	NULL

I	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
frankly	NULL
,	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
as	NULL
their	NULL
fates	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
ours	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
paused	NULL
to	NULL
watch	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

Captain	NULL
Good	NULL
looked	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
change	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
must	NULL
take	NULL
our	NULL
chance	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
may	NULL
perhaps	NULL
wonder	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
am	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
told	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
timid	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
undertake	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
journey	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
reasons	NULL
.	NULL

First	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
a	NULL
fatalist	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
time	NULL
is	NULL
appointed	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
quite	NULL
without	NULL
reference	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
movements	NULL
and	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Suliman	NULL
's	NULL
Mountains	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
killed	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
go	NULL
there	NULL
and	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
killed	NULL
.	NULL

God	NULL
Almighty	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
knows	NULL
His	NULL
mind	NULL
about	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
need	NULL
not	NULL
trouble	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
point	NULL
.	NULL

Secondly	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
nearly	NULL
forty	NULL
years	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
hunted	NULL
and	NULL
traded	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
made	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
living	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
average	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
elephant	NULL
hunter	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
takes	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
trade	NULL
is	NULL
between	NULL
four	NULL
and	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
you	NULL
see	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
lived	NULL
through	NULL
about	NULL
seven	NULL
generations	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
class	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
time	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
far	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
anyway	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
anything	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ordinary	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
my	NULL
debts	NULL
are	NULL
paid	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
nothing	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
support	NULL
my	NULL
son	NULL
Harry	NULL
whilst	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
earning	NULL
a	NULL
living	NULL
,	NULL
whereas	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
set	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
affair	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
nutshell	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Quatermain	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
giving	NULL
me	NULL
his	NULL
most	NULL
serious	NULL
attention	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
your	NULL
motives	NULL
for	NULL
undertaking	NULL
an	NULL
enterprise	NULL
which	NULL
you	NULL
believe	NULL
can	NULL
only	NULL
end	NULL
in	NULL
disaster	NULL
reflect	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
credit	NULL
on	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

Whether	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
event	NULL
alone	NULL
can	NULL
show	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
whether	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
right	NULL
or	NULL
wrong	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
going	NULL
through	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
sweet	NULL
or	NULL
bitter	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
knocked	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
hope	NULL
we	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
shooting	NULL
first	NULL

eh	NULL
,	NULL
Good	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
yes	NULL

"	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
captain	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
have	NULL
all	NULL
three	NULL
of	NULL

accustomed	NULL

to	NULL
hold	NULL
our	NULL

hands	NULL

so	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
turning	NULL
back	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
I	NULL
vote	NULL
we	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
saloon	NULL
and	NULL
take	NULL
an	NULL
observation	NULL
just	NULL
for	NULL
luck	NULL

And	NULL
we	NULL
did	NULL

through	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL

Next	NULL

we	NULL
went	NULL

you	NULL

Mountains	NULL

having	NULL
once	NULL

up	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
I	NULL
set	NULL
about	NULL
making	NULL
the	NULL
necessary	NULL
preparations	NULL
.	NULL

First	NULL
I	NULL
secured	NULL
the	NULL
deed	NULL
from	NULL
Sir	NULL

,	NULL
providing	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
boy	NULL

in	NULL
case	NULL

accidents	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
some	NULL
difficulty	NULL
about	NULL
its	NULL
legal	NULL
execution	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
stranger	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
property	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
charged	NULL
is	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
ultimately	NULL
got	NULL
over	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
help	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
lawyer	NULL

who	NULL
charged	NULL
£	NULL
20	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
job	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
price	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
outrageous	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
pocketed	NULL
my	NULL
cheque	NULL
for	NULL
£	NULL
500	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
paid	NULL
this	NULL
tribute	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
bump	NULL
of	NULL
caution	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
purchased	NULL
a	NULL
wagon	NULL

a	NULL
span	NULL
of	NULL
oxen	NULL
on	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
's	NULL
behalf	NULL

beauties	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
twenty-two-foot	NULL
wagon	NULL

very	NULL
strong	NULL

back	NULL

in	NULL
my	NULL
opinion	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL

could	NULL

the	NULL
wood	NULL

anything	NULL

is	NULL
green	NULL
wood	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
show	NULL
out	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
trip	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
particular	NULL
vehicle	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
we	NULL
call	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
half-tented	NULL
"	NULL
wagon	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
covered	NULL
in	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
after	NULL
twelve	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
part	NULL
free	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
necessaries	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
with	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
after	NULL
part	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
hide	NULL
"	NULL
cartle	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
or	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
two	NULL
people	NULL
could	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
also	NULL
racks	NULL
for	NULL
rifles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
many	NULL
other	NULL
little	NULL
conveniences	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
gave	NULL
£	NULL
125	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
cheap	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
price	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
bought	NULL
a	NULL
beautiful	NULL
team	NULL
of	NULL
twenty	NULL
Zulu	NULL
oxen	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
kept	NULL
my	NULL
eye	NULL
on	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

Sixteen	NULL
oxen	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
number	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
team	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
took	NULL
four	NULL
extra	NULL
to	NULL
allow	NULL
for	NULL
casualties	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
Zulu	NULL
cattle	NULL
are	NULL
small	NULL
and	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
size	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Africander	NULL
oxen	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
generally	NULL
used	NULL
for	NULL
transport	NULL
purposes	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
will	NULL
live	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
Africanders	NULL
would	NULL
starve	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
moderate	NULL
load	NULL
can	NULL
make	NULL
five	NULL
miles	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
better	NULL
going	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
quicker	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
liable	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
footsore	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
is	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
lot	NULL
were	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
"	NULL
salted	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
worked	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
South	NULL
Africa	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
proof	NULL
,	NULL
comparatively	NULL
speaking	NULL
,	NULL
against	NULL
red	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
so	NULL
frequently	NULL
destroys	NULL
whole	NULL
teams	NULL
of	NULL
oxen	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
strange	NULL
"	NULL
veldt	NULL
"	NULL
or	NULL
grass	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
"	NULL
lung	NULL
sick	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
dreadful	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
pneumonia	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
prevalent	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
country	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
been	NULL
inoculated	NULL
against	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
is	NULL
done	NULL
by	NULL
cutting	NULL
a	NULL
slit	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tail	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
ox	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
binding	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
diseased	NULL
lung	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
animal	NULL
which	NULL
has	NULL
died	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sickness	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
result	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
ox	NULL
sickens	NULL
,	NULL
takes	NULL
the	NULL
disease	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
mild	NULL
form	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
causes	NULL
its	NULL
tail	NULL
to	NULL
drop	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
rule	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
foot	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
root	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
becomes	NULL
proof	NULL
against	NULL
future	NULL
attacks	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seems	NULL
cruel	NULL
to	NULL
rob	NULL
the	NULL
animal	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
tail	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
country	NULL
where	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
flies	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
the	NULL
tail	NULL
and	NULL
keep	NULL
the	NULL
ox	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
lose	NULL
both	NULL
tail	NULL
and	NULL
ox	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
tail	NULL
without	NULL
an	NULL
ox	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
to	NULL
dust	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
it	NULL
does	NULL
look	NULL
odd	NULL
to	NULL
trek	NULL
along	NULL
behind	NULL
twenty	NULL
stumps	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
there	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
tails	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seems	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
Nature	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
trifling	NULL
mistake	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stuck	NULL
the	NULL
stern	NULL
ornaments	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
prize	NULL
bull-dogs	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rumps	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
oxen	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
provisioning	NULL
and	NULL
medicines	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
required	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
careful	NULL
consideration	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
lumbering	NULL
the	NULL
wagon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
everything	NULL
absolutely	NULL
necessary	NULL
.	NULL

Fortunately	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
Good	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
doctor	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
at	NULL
some	NULL
point	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
previous	NULL
career	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
medical	NULL
and	NULL
surgical	NULL
instruction	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
kept	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
qualified	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
knows	NULL
more	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
than	NULL
many	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
can	NULL
write	NULL
M.D.	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
splendid	NULL
travelling	NULL
medicine	NULL
chest	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
set	NULL
of	NULL
instruments	NULL
.	NULL

Whilst	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
Durban	NULL
he	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL
a	NULL
Kafir	NULL
's	NULL
big	NULL
toe	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pleasure	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
nonplussed	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
Kafir	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
sat	NULL
stolidly	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
operation	NULL
,	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
white	NULL
one	NULL
"	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
pinch	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
remained	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
these	NULL
questions	NULL
were	NULL
satisfactorily	NULL
settled	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
further	NULL
important	NULL
points	NULL
for	NULL
consideration	NULL
,	NULL
namely	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
arms	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
servants	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
arms	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
put	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
list	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
finally	NULL
decided	NULL
on	NULL
from	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
ample	NULL
store	NULL
that	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
England	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
those	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
owned	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
copy	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
our	NULL

armament	NULL

doubtless	NULL
the	NULL

will	NULL
observe	NULL
that	NULL

,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
cartridges	NULL
were	NULL
interchangeable	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
important	NULL
point	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
make	NULL
no	NULL
apology	NULL
for	NULL
detailing	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
every	NULL
experienced	NULL
hunter	NULL
will	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
vital	NULL

is	NULL
to	NULL

Now	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
much	NULL
consultation	NULL
we	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
number	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
limited	NULL
to	NULL
five	NULL
,	NULL
namely	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
driver	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
leader	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
three	NULL
servants	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
driver	NULL
and	NULL
leader	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
without	NULL
much	NULL
difficulty	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
Zulus	NULL
,	NULL
named	NULL
respectively	NULL
Goza	NULL
and	NULL
Tom	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
servants	NULL
proved	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
difficult	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
trustworthy	NULL
and	NULL
brave	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
business	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
sort	NULL
our	NULL
lives	NULL
might	NULL
depend	NULL
upon	NULL
their	NULL
conduct	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
I	NULL
secured	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
a	NULL
Hottentot	NULL
named	NULL
Ventvögel	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
"	NULL
windbird	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
Zulu	NULL
named	NULL
Khiva	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
merit	NULL
of	NULL
speaking	NULL
English	NULL
perfectly	NULL
.	NULL

Ventvögel	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
before	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
perfect	NULL
"	NULL
spoorers	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
game	NULL
trackers	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
ever	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tough	NULL
as	NULL
whipcord	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
tire	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
one	NULL
failing	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
common	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
race	NULL
,	NULL
drink	NULL
.	NULL

Put	NULL
him	NULL
within	NULL
reach	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bottle	NULL
of	NULL
gin	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
trust	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
region	NULL
of	NULL
grog-shops	NULL
this	NULL
little	NULL
weakness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
secured	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
men	NULL
I	NULL
looked	NULL
in	NULL
vain	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
third	NULL
to	NULL
suit	NULL
my	NULL
purpose	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
we	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
start	NULL
without	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
trusting	NULL
to	NULL
luck	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
suitable	NULL
man	NULL
on	NULL
our	NULL
way	NULL
up	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
fixed	NULL
for	NULL
our	NULL
departure	NULL
the	NULL
Zulu	NULL
Khiva	NULL
informed	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
Kafir	NULL
was	NULL
waiting	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

Accordingly	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
table	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
told	NULL
Khiva	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
handsome-looking	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
somewhere	NULL
about	NULL
thirty	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
light-coloured	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
Zulu	NULL
,	NULL
entered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lifting	NULL
his	NULL
knob-stick	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
salute	NULL
,	NULL
squatted	NULL
himself	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
haunches	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
any	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
mistake	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
you	NULL
rush	NULL
into	NULL
conversation	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
Zulu	NULL
is	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
you	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
of	NULL
little	NULL
dignity	NULL
or	NULL
consequence	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
observed	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
Keshla	NULL
"	NULL
or	NULL
ringed	NULL
man	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wore	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
ring	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
species	NULL
of	NULL
gum	NULL
polished	NULL
with	NULL
fat	NULL
and	NULL
worked	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hair	NULL

which	NULL
is	NULL
usually	NULL
assumed	NULL
by	NULL
Zulus	NULL
on	NULL
attaining	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
age	NULL
or	NULL
dignity	NULL
.	NULL

Also	NULL
it	NULL
struck	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
familiar	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

I	NULL
said	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL

answered	NULL

a	NULL

remembered	NULL

inspanned	NULL
I	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL

man	NULL

who	NULL
held	NULL
some	NULL
small	NULL
command	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
native	NULL
auxiliaries	NULL

he	NULL

expressed	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
his	NULL
doubts	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
safety	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
camp	NULL

At	NULL

I	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL

hold	NULL
his	NULL
tongue	NULL

and	NULL
leave	NULL
such	NULL
matters	NULL
to	NULL
wiser	NULL

but	NULL
afterwards	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

That	NULL

my	NULL

Why	NULL

you	NULL
ask	NULL

I	NULL
answered	NULL
suspiciously	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
wandered	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL

.	NULL

I	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
North	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
to	NULL
Zululand	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
Cetewayo	NULL

serving	NULL
there	NULL

[	NULL

who	NULL
taught	NULL
my	NULL
hands	NULL

Afterwards	NULL
I	NULL
ran	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
Zululand	NULL

came	NULL
to	NULL
Natal	NULL
because	NULL
I	NULL
wanted	NULL

I	NULL

Since	NULL

Now	NULL
I	NULL

Here	NULL

am	NULL
a	NULL

am	NULL
worth	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
spoken	NULL

"	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
puzzled	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
speech	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
evident	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
manner	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
main	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
telling	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL

but	NULL
somehow	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
ordinary	NULL
run	NULL

Zulus	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
rather	NULL
mistrusted	NULL
his	NULL
offer	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
without	NULL
pay	NULL
.	NULL

Being	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
difficulty	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
translated	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
to	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
and	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
them	NULL
their	NULL
opinion	NULL
.	NULL

Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

Umbopa	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
slipping	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
military	NULL
great	NULL
coat	NULL

he	NULL
wore	NULL

himself	NULL

moocha	NULL
round	NULL
his	NULL
centre	NULL

a	NULL

Certainly	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
magnificent-looking	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
finer	NULL
native	NULL

Standing	NULL
about	NULL
six	NULL

three	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
broad	NULL
in	NULL
proportion	NULL

and	NULL
very	NULL
shapely	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
that	NULL
light	NULL

too	NULL

his	NULL
skin	NULL
looked	NULL
scarcely	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
IV	NULL
AN	NULL
ELEPHANT	NULL
HUNT	NULL
Now	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
propose	NULL

narrate	NULL

near	NULL
the	NULL
junction	NULL
of	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL

more	NULL

a	NULL
thousand	NULL
miles	NULL
from	NULL
Durban	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
on	NULL
foot	NULL

owing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
frequent	NULL
presence	NULL

the	NULL
dreadful	NULL

,	NULL
whose	NULL
bite	NULL
is	NULL
fatal	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
animals	NULL

We	NULL
left	NULL
Durban	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
January	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
week	NULL
of	NULL
May	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
camped	NULL
near	NULL
Sitanda	NULL
's	NULL
Kraal	NULL
.	NULL

Our	NULL
adventures	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
were	NULL
many	NULL
and	NULL
various	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
which	NULL
befall	NULL
every	NULL
African	NULL
hunter	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
exception	NULL

be	NULL
presently	NULL
detailed	NULL

I	NULL
shall	NULL
not	NULL
set	NULL
them	NULL
down	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
lest	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
render	NULL
this	NULL
history	NULL
too	NULL
wearisome	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
Inyati	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
outlying	NULL
trading	NULL
station	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Matabele	NULL
country	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
Lobengula	NULL
(	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
and	NULL
cruel	NULL
scoundrel	NULL
)	NULL
is	NULL
king	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
many	NULL
regrets	NULL
we	NULL
parted	NULL
from	NULL
our	NULL
comfortable	NULL
wagon	NULL
.	NULL

Only	NULL
twelve	NULL
oxen	NULL
remained	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
span	NULL
of	NULL
twenty	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
at	NULL
Durban	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
we	NULL
lost	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
bite	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cobra	NULL
,	NULL
three	NULL
had	NULL
perished	NULL
from	NULL
"	NULL
poverty	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
strayed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
three	NULL
died	NULL
from	NULL
eating	NULL
the	NULL
poisonous	NULL
herb	NULL
called	NULL
"	NULL
tulip	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Five	NULL
more	NULL
sickened	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
cause	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
we	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
cure	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
doses	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
infusion	NULL
made	NULL
by	NULL
boiling	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
tulip	NULL
leaves	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
administered	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
effective	NULL
antidote	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wagon	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
oxen	NULL
we	NULL
left	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
immediate	NULL
charge	NULL
of	NULL
Goza	NULL
and	NULL
Tom	NULL
,	NULL
our	NULL
driver	NULL
and	NULL
leader	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
trustworthy	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
requesting	NULL
a	NULL
worthy	NULL
Scotch	NULL
missionary	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
distant	NULL
place	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
an	NULL
eye	NULL
on	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
accompanied	NULL
by	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
,	NULL
Khiva	NULL
,	NULL
Ventvögel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
bearers	NULL
whom	NULL
we	NULL
hired	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
started	NULL
off	NULL
on	NULL
foot	NULL
upon	NULL
our	NULL
wild	NULL
quest	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
silent	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
departure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
was	NULL
wondering	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
ever	NULL
see	NULL
our	NULL
wagon	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
my	NULL
part	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
we	NULL
tramped	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
marching	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
,	NULL
broke	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
Zulu	NULL
chant	NULL
about	NULL
how	NULL
some	NULL
brave	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tameness	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
started	NULL
off	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
vast	NULL
wilderness	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
new	NULL
things	NULL
or	NULL
die	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
,	NULL
lo	NULL
and	NULL
behold	NULL
!	NULL

when	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
travelled	NULL
far	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
wilderness	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
wilderness	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
beautiful	NULL
place	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
young	NULL
wives	NULL
and	NULL
fat	NULL
cattle	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
game	NULL
to	NULL
hunt	NULL
and	NULL
enemies	NULL
to	NULL
kill	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
we	NULL
all	NULL
laughed	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
omen	NULL
.	NULL

Umbopa	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
cheerful	NULL
savage	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dignified	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
suffering	NULL
from	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fits	NULL
of	NULL
brooding	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
wonderful	NULL
knack	NULL
of	NULL
keeping	NULL
up	NULL
our	NULL
spirits	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
all	NULL
grew	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
adventure	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
treat	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
dearly	NULL
love	NULL
a	NULL
hunting	NULL
yarn	NULL
.	NULL

About	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
's	NULL
march	NULL
from	NULL
Inyati	NULL
we	NULL
came	NULL
across	NULL
a	NULL
peculiarly	NULL
beautiful	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
well-watered	NULL
woodland	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
kloofs	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hills	NULL
were	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
dense	NULL
bush	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
idoro	NULL
"	NULL
bush	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
natives	NULL
call	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
places	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
wacht-een-beche	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
or	NULL
"	NULL
wait-a-little	NULL
thorn	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
great	NULL
quantities	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lovely	NULL
"	NULL
machabell	NULL
"	NULL
tree	NULL
,	NULL
laden	NULL
with	NULL
refreshing	NULL
yellow	NULL
fruit	NULL
having	NULL
enormous	NULL
stones	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
tree	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
elephant	NULL
's	NULL
favourite	NULL
food	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
wanting	NULL
signs	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
brutes	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
was	NULL
their	NULL
spoor	NULL
frequent	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
many	NULL
places	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
were	NULL
broken	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
uprooted	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
elephant	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
destructive	NULL
feeder	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
march	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
spot	NULL
of	NULL
great	NULL
loveliness	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bush-clad	NULL
hill	NULL
lay	NULL
a	NULL
dry	NULL
river-bed	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
pools	NULL
of	NULL
crystal	NULL
water	NULL
all	NULL
trodden	NULL
round	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
hoof-prints	NULL
of	NULL
game	NULL
.	NULL

Facing	NULL
this	NULL
hill	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
park-like	NULL
plain	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
grew	NULL
clumps	NULL
of	NULL
flat-topped	NULL
mimosa	NULL
,	NULL
varied	NULL
with	NULL
occasional	NULL
glossy-leaved	NULL
machabells	NULL

and	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
stretched	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
of	NULL
pathless	NULL
,	NULL
silent	NULL
bush	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
we	NULL
emerged	NULL
into	NULL
this	NULL
river-bed	NULL
path	NULL
suddenly	NULL
we	NULL
started	NULL
a	NULL
troop	NULL
of	NULL
tall	NULL
giraffes	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
galloped	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
sailed	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
strange	NULL
gait	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
tails	NULL
screwed	NULL
up	NULL
over	NULL
their	NULL
backs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
hoofs	NULL
rattling	NULL
like	NULL
castanets	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
about	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
from	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
therefore	NULL
practically	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
shot	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
walking	NULL
ahead	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
express	NULL
loaded	NULL
with	NULL
solid	NULL
ball	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
resist	NULL
temptation	NULL
.	NULL

Lifting	NULL
his	NULL
gun	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
let	NULL
drive	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
cow	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
some	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
chance	NULL
the	NULL
ball	NULL
struck	NULL
it	NULL
full	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
neck	NULL
,	NULL
shattering	NULL
the	NULL
spinal	NULL
column	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
giraffe	NULL
went	NULL
rolling	NULL
head	NULL
over	NULL
heels	NULL
just	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
rabbit	NULL
.	NULL

never	NULL

re-echoed	NULL
Sir	NULL

I	NULL

from	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
Good	NULL

established	NULL

at	NULL

Really	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
missed	NULL
we	NULL
overlooked	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
giraffe	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
set	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
boys	NULL
"	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
giraffe	NULL
's	NULL
meat	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
build	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
scherm	NULL
"	NULL
near	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pools	NULL
and	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
is	NULL
done	NULL
by	NULL
cutting	NULL
a	NULL
quantity	NULL
of	NULL
thorn	NULL
bushes	NULL
and	NULL
piling	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shape	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
circular	NULL
hedge	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
space	NULL
enclosed	NULL

smoothed	NULL

and	NULL
dry	NULL
tambouki	NULL

if	NULL

a	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL

a	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL

was	NULL
finished	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL
peeped	NULL
up	NULL

and	NULL
our	NULL
dinners	NULL
of	NULL
giraffe	NULL
steaks	NULL
and	NULL
roasted	NULL
marrow-bones	NULL
were	NULL
ready	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
we	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
those	NULL
marrow-bones	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
job	NULL
to	NULL
crack	NULL
them	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
greater	NULL
luxury	NULL
than	NULL
giraffe	NULL

,	NULL
unless	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
elephant	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
that	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
morrow	NULL

We	NULL
ate	NULL
our	NULL
simple	NULL
meal	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL
,	NULL
pausing	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
to	NULL
thank	NULL
Good	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
wonderful	NULL
shot	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
we	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
smoke	NULL
and	NULL
yarn	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
picture	NULL
we	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
squatting	NULL
there	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
short	NULL
grizzled	NULL
hair	NULL
sticking	NULL
up	NULL
straight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
yellow	NULL
locks	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
getting	NULL
rather	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
contrast	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
weighing	NULL
only	NULL
nine	NULL
stone	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL

Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
is	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
broad	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
weighs	NULL
fifteen	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
curious-looking	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
,	NULL
taking	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL

the	NULL

into	NULL
consideration	NULL

was	NULL
Captain	NULL
John	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
R.N	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
leather	NULL
bag	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
comfortable	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
shooting	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
civilised	NULL
country	NULL
,	NULL
absolutely	NULL
clean	NULL
,	NULL
tidy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
well	NULL
dressed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
shooting	NULL
suit	NULL
of	NULL
brown	NULL
tweed	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
hat	NULL
to	NULL
match	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
neat	NULL
gaiters	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
beautifully	NULL
shaved	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
eye-glass	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
false	NULL
teeth	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
perfect	NULL
order	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
altogether	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
the	NULL
neatest	NULL
man	NULL
I	NULL
ever	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wilderness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
even	NULL
sported	NULL
a	NULL
collar	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
supply	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
white	NULL
gutta-percha	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
weigh	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
innocently	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
expressed	NULL
my	NULL
astonishment	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
always	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
out	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Ah	NULL
!	NULL

if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
foreseen	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
raiment	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
we	NULL
three	NULL
sat	NULL
yarning	NULL
away	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
moonlight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
Kafirs	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
yards	NULL
off	NULL
sucking	NULL
their	NULL
intoxicating	NULL
"	NULL
daccha	NULL
"	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
pipe	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
mouthpiece	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
horn	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
eland	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
one	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
they	NULL
rolled	NULL
themselves	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
blankets	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
except	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
apart	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
chin	NULL
resting	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thinking	NULL
deeply	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
mixed	NULL
much	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
Kafirs	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bush	NULL
behind	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL

said	NULL
I	NULL

we	NULL
all	NULL
started	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL

Hardly	NULL
had	NULL

done	NULL

when	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
pool	NULL

about	NULL
a	NULL

whispered	NULL
the	NULL
Kafirs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
afterwards	NULL
we	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
succession	NULL
of	NULL
vast	NULL
shadowy	NULL
forms	NULL
moving	NULL
slowly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
bush	NULL
.	NULL

Up	NULL
jumped	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
burning	NULL
for	NULL
slaughter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
kill	NULL
elephant	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
shoot	NULL
giraffe	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
caught	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
arm	NULL
and	NULL
pulled	NULL
him	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

no	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
whispered	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
let	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
seems	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
in	NULL

paradise	NULL

game	NULL

I	NULL
vote	NULL
we	NULL
stop	NULL
here	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL

and	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
go	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
,	NULL
presently	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
surprised	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
hitherto	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
pushing	NULL
forward	NULL
as	NULL
fast	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
especially	NULL
since	NULL
we	NULL
ascertained	NULL
at	NULL
Inyati	NULL
that	NULL
about	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
an	NULL
Englishman	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
Neville	NULL
_	NULL
had	NULL
_	NULL
sold	NULL
his	NULL
wagon	NULL
there	NULL

and	NULL
gone	NULL
on	NULL
up	NULL
country	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
his	NULL
hunter	NULL
instincts	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
.	NULL

Good	NULL
jumped	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
longing	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
shot	NULL
at	NULL
those	NULL
elephants	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
went	NULL
against	NULL
my	NULL
conscience	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL

as	NULL
that	NULL
escape	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL

them	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL

now	NULL
let	NULL

we	NULL

off	NULL

then	NULL
perhaps	NULL
we	NULL

catch	NULL
them	NULL

they	NULL
move	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
others	NULL
agreed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
proceeded	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
our	NULL
preparations	NULL
.	NULL

Good	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
shook	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
eye-glass	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
false	NULL
teeth	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
trousers	NULL
pocket	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
folding	NULL
each	NULL
article	NULL
neatly	NULL

placed	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dew	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mackintosh	NULL
sheet	NULL

Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
contented	NULL
ourselves	NULL
with	NULL
rougher	NULL
arrangements	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
were	NULL
curled	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
blankets	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dropping	NULL
off	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
dreamless	NULL
sleep	NULL
that	NULL
rewards	NULL
the	NULL
traveller	NULL
.	NULL

Going	NULL
,	NULL
going	NULL
,	NULL
go	NULL
--	NULL
What	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
?	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
came	NULL
sounds	NULL
of	NULL
violent	NULL
scuffling	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
next	NULL
instant	NULL
there	NULL
broke	NULL
upon	NULL
our	NULL
ears	NULL
a	NULL
succession	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
awful	NULL
roars	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
mistaking	NULL
their	NULL
origin	NULL
;	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
lion	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
noise	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
all	NULL
jumped	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
confused	NULL
mass	NULL
,	NULL
yellow	NULL
and	NULL
black	NULL
in	NULL
colour	NULL
,	NULL
staggering	NULL
and	NULL
struggling	NULL
towards	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
seized	NULL
our	NULL
rifles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
slipping	NULL
on	NULL
our	NULL
veldtschoons	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
shoes	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
untanned	NULL
hide	NULL
,	NULL
ran	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
scherm	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
mass	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
rolling	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
it	NULL
struggled	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
lay	NULL
quite	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
we	NULL
saw	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
there	NULL
lay	NULL
a	NULL
sable	NULL
antelope	NULL
bull	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
beautiful	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
African	NULL
antelopes	NULL
--	NULL
quite	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
transfixed	NULL
by	NULL
its	NULL
great	NULL
curved	NULL
horns	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
magnificent	NULL
black-maned	NULL
lion	NULL
,	NULL
also	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

Evidently	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
:	NULL
The	NULL
sable	NULL
antelope	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
drink	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
pool	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
lion	NULL
--	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
--	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
in	NULL
wait	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
the	NULL
antelope	NULL
drank	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
lion	NULL
had	NULL
sprung	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
received	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
sharp	NULL
curved	NULL
horns	NULL
and	NULL
transfixed	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
before	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
similar	NULL
thing	NULL
happen	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
lion	NULL
,	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
free	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
torn	NULL
and	NULL
bitten	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
neck	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bull	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
maddened	NULL
with	NULL
fear	NULL
and	NULL
pain	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
rushed	NULL
on	NULL
until	NULL
it	NULL
dropped	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
examined	NULL
the	NULL
beasts	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
we	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
Kafirs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
between	NULL
us	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
drag	NULL
their	NULL
carcases	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
scherm	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
wake	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
till	NULL
dawn	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
light	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
making	NULL
ready	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
fray	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
took	NULL
with	NULL
us	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
eight-bore	NULL
rifles	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
supply	NULL
of	NULL
ammunition	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
our	NULL
large	NULL
water-bottles	NULL
,	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
weak	NULL
cold	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
always	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
stuff	NULL
to	NULL
shoot	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
swallowing	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
breakfast	NULL
we	NULL
started	NULL
,	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
,	NULL
Khiva	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Ventvögel	NULL
accompanying	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
other	NULL
Kafirs	NULL
we	NULL
left	NULL
with	NULL
instructions	NULL
to	NULL
skin	NULL
the	NULL
lion	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sable	NULL
antelope	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
finding	NULL
the	NULL
broad	NULL
elephant	NULL
trail	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Ventvögel	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
examination	NULL
,	NULL
pronounced	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
by	NULL
between	NULL
twenty	NULL
and	NULL
thirty	NULL
elephants	NULL
,	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
full-grown	NULL
bulls	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
herd	NULL
had	NULL
moved	NULL
on	NULL
some	NULL
way	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
nine	NULL
o'clock	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
already	NULL
very	NULL
hot	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
broken	NULL
trees	NULL
,	NULL
bruised	NULL
leaves	NULL
and	NULL
bark	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
smoking	NULL
droppings	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
we	NULL
caught	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
herd	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
numbered	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Ventvögel	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
between	NULL
twenty	NULL
and	NULL
thirty	NULL
,	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
hollow	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
finished	NULL
their	NULL
morning	NULL
meal	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
flapping	NULL
their	NULL
great	NULL
ears	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
splendid	NULL
sight	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
about	NULL
two	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
from	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

Taking	NULL
a	NULL
handful	NULL
of	NULL
dry	NULL
grass	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
threw	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
was	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
if	NULL
once	NULL
they	NULL
winded	NULL
us	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
off	NULL
before	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
shot	NULL
.	NULL

Finding	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
blew	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
elephants	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
crept	NULL
on	NULL
stealthily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thanks	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
cover	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
within	NULL
forty	NULL
yards	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
brutes	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
broadside	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
three	NULL
splendid	NULL
bulls	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
enormous	NULL
tusks	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
whispered	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
one	NULL
;	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
covering	NULL
the	NULL
elephant	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Good	NULL
the	NULL
bull	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
tusks	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
whispered	NULL
.	NULL

Boom	NULL
!	NULL

boom	NULL
!	NULL

boom	NULL
!	NULL

went	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
heavy	NULL
rifles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
came	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
's	NULL
elephant	NULL
dead	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
hammer	NULL
,	NULL
shot	NULL
right	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

Mine	NULL
fell	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
knees	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
tearing	NULL
along	NULL
straight	NULL
past	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
I	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
barrel	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ribs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
good	NULL
earnest	NULL
.	NULL

Hastily	NULL
slipping	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL
fresh	NULL
cartridges	NULL
I	NULL
ran	NULL
close	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
ball	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
brain	NULL
put	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
brute	NULL
's	NULL
struggles	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
Good	NULL
had	NULL
fared	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
bull	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
screaming	NULL
with	NULL
rage	NULL
and	NULL
pain	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
gave	NULL
mine	NULL
its	NULL
quietus	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
reaching	NULL
the	NULL
captain	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
excitement	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
appeared	NULL
that	NULL
on	NULL
receiving	NULL
the	NULL
bullet	NULL
the	NULL
bull	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
and	NULL
come	NULL
straight	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
assailant	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
barely	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
charged	NULL
on	NULL
blindly	NULL
past	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
encampment	NULL
.	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
the	NULL
herd	NULL
had	NULL
crashed	NULL
off	NULL
in	NULL
wild	NULL
alarm	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
direction	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
awhile	NULL
we	NULL
debated	NULL
whether	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
wounded	NULL
bull	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
the	NULL
herd	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finally	NULL
deciding	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL
alternative	NULL
,	NULL
departed	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
big	NULL
tusks	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
often	NULL
wished	NULL
since	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
easy	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
the	NULL
elephants	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
a	NULL
trail	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
carriage	NULL
road	NULL
behind	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
crushing	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
thick	NULL
bush	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
furious	NULL
flight	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
tambouki	NULL
grass	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
was	NULL
another	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
struggled	NULL
on	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
broiling	NULL
sun	NULL
for	NULL
over	NULL
two	NULL
hours	NULL
before	NULL
we	NULL
found	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
the	NULL
exception	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
bull	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
standing	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
unquiet	NULL
way	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
manner	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
kept	NULL
lifting	NULL
their	NULL
trunks	NULL
to	NULL
test	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
look-out	NULL
for	NULL
mischief	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
solitary	NULL
bull	NULL
stood	NULL
fifty	NULL
yards	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
herd	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
keeping	NULL
sentry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
about	NULL
sixty	NULL
yards	NULL
from	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

Thinking	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
or	NULL
wind	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
start	NULL
them	NULL
off	NULL
again	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
nearer	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
all	NULL
aimed	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
bull	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
my	NULL
whispered	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
fired	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
three	NULL
shots	NULL
took	NULL
effect	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

Again	NULL
the	NULL
herd	NULL
started	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
unfortunately	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
further	NULL
on	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
nullah	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
dried-out	NULL
water	NULL
track	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
steep	NULL
banks	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
resembling	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
Prince	NULL
Imperial	NULL
was	NULL
killed	NULL
in	NULL
Zululand	NULL
.	NULL

Into	NULL
this	NULL
the	NULL
elephants	NULL
plunged	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
we	NULL
found	NULL
them	NULL
struggling	NULL
in	NULL
wild	NULL
confusion	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
bank	NULL
,	NULL
filling	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
screams	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
trumpeting	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
pushed	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
aside	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
selfish	NULL
panic	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
like	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
human	NULL
beings	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
was	NULL
our	NULL
opportunity	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
firing	NULL
away	NULL
as	NULL
quickly	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
load	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
killed	NULL
five	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
beasts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
bagged	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
herd	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
they	NULL
not	NULL
suddenly	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
their	NULL
attempts	NULL
to	NULL
climb	NULL
the	NULL
bank	NULL
and	NULL
rushed	NULL
headlong	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
nullah	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
tired	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
also	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
sick	NULL
of	NULL
slaughter	NULL
,	NULL
eight	NULL
elephants	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
good	NULL
bag	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
after	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
rested	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Kafirs	NULL
had	NULL
cut	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
hearts	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
elephants	NULL
for	NULL
supper	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
started	NULL
homewards	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
pleased	NULL
with	NULL
our	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
our	NULL
minds	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
the	NULL
bearers	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
morrow	NULL
to	NULL
chop	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
tusks	NULL
.	NULL

Shortly	NULL
after	NULL
we	NULL
re-passed	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
where	NULL
Good	NULL
had	NULL
wounded	NULL
the	NULL
patriarchal	NULL
bull	NULL
we	NULL
came	NULL
across	NULL
a	NULL
herd	NULL
of	NULL
eland	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
shoot	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
meat	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
trotted	NULL
past	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
stopped	NULL
behind	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
patch	NULL
of	NULL
bush	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
wheeling	NULL
round	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
Good	NULL
was	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
near	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
having	NULL
seen	NULL
an	NULL
eland	NULL
close	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
handed	NULL
his	NULL
rifle	NULL
to	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
followed	NULL
by	NULL
Khiva	NULL
,	NULL
strolled	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
patch	NULL
of	NULL
bush	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
sorry	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
excuse	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
rest	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
going	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
reddest	NULL
glory	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
were	NULL
admiring	NULL
the	NULL
lovely	NULL
scene	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
suddenly	NULL
we	NULL
heard	NULL
an	NULL
elephant	NULL
scream	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
its	NULL
huge	NULL
and	NULL
rushing	NULL
form	NULL
with	NULL
uplifted	NULL
trunk	NULL
and	NULL
tail	NULL
silhouetted	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
fiery	NULL
globe	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
second	NULL
we	NULL
saw	NULL
something	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
Good	NULL
and	NULL
Khiva	NULL
tearing	NULL
back	NULL
towards	NULL
us	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
wounded	NULL
bull	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
--	NULL
charging	NULL
after	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
we	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
dare	NULL
to	NULL
fire	NULL
--	NULL
though	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
distance	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
of	NULL
little	NULL
use	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
hitting	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
a	NULL
dreadful	NULL
thing	NULL
happened	NULL
--	NULL
Good	NULL
fell	NULL
a	NULL
victim	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
civilised	NULL
dress	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
he	NULL
consented	NULL
to	NULL
discard	NULL
his	NULL
trousers	NULL
and	NULL
gaiters	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
hunt	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
flannel	NULL
shirt	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
veldt-schoons	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
trousers	NULL
cumbered	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
desperate	NULL
race	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
sixty	NULL
yards	NULL
from	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
boot	NULL
,	NULL
polished	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
dry	NULL
grass	NULL
,	NULL
slipped	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
elephant	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
gasp	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
we	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
die	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ran	NULL
as	NULL
hard	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
three	NULL
seconds	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
ended	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

Khiva	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Zulu	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
saw	NULL
his	NULL
master	NULL
fall	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
brave	NULL
lad	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
turned	NULL
and	NULL
flung	NULL
his	NULL
assegai	NULL
straight	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
elephant	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
stuck	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
trunk	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
scream	NULL
of	NULL
pain	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
brute	NULL
seized	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
Zulu	NULL
,	NULL
hurled	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
placing	NULL
one	NULL
huge	NULL
foot	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
body	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
,	NULL
twined	NULL
its	NULL
trunk	NULL
round	NULL
his	NULL
upper	NULL
part	NULL
and	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
V	NULL
OUR	NULL
MARCH	NULL
INTO	NULL
THE	NULL
DESERT	NULL
We	NULL
had	NULL
killed	NULL
nine	NULL
elephants	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
us	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
tusks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
brought	NULL
them	NULL
into	NULL
camp	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
bury	NULL
them	NULL
carefully	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sand	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
tree	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
conspicuous	NULL
mark	NULL
for	NULL
miles	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
wonderfully	NULL
fine	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
ivory	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
averaging	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
between	NULL
forty	NULL
and	NULL
fifty	NULL
pounds	NULL
a	NULL
tusk	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
tusks	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
bull	NULL
that	NULL
killed	NULL
poor	NULL
Khiva	NULL
scaled	NULL
one	NULL
hundred	NULL
and	NULL
seventy	NULL
pounds	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
nearly	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
judge	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Khiva	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
buried	NULL
what	NULL
remained	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
ant-bear	NULL
hole	NULL
,	NULL
together	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
assegai	NULL
to	NULL
protect	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
journey	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
day	NULL
we	NULL
marched	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
hoping	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
might	NULL
live	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
dig	NULL
up	NULL
our	NULL
buried	NULL
ivory	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
due	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
wearisome	NULL
tramp	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
many	NULL
adventures	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
not	NULL
space	NULL
to	NULL
detail	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
reached	NULL
Sitanda	NULL
's	NULL
Kraal	NULL
,	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
Lukanga	NULL
River	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
starting-point	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
expedition	NULL
.	NULL

Very	NULL
well	NULL
do	NULL
I	NULL
recollect	NULL
our	NULL
arrival	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
scattered	NULL
native	NULL
settlement	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
stone	NULL
cattle	NULL
kraals	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
cultivated	NULL
lands	NULL
down	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
these	NULL
savages	NULL
grew	NULL
their	NULL
scanty	NULL
supply	NULL
of	NULL
grain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
beyond	NULL
it	NULL
stretched	NULL
great	NULL
tracts	NULL
of	NULL
waving	NULL
"	NULL
veld	NULL
"	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
tall	NULL
grass	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
which	NULL
herds	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
smaller	NULL
game	NULL
were	NULL
wandering	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
vast	NULL
desert	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
spot	NULL
appears	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
outpost	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fertile	NULL
country	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
natural	NULL
causes	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
abrupt	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
soil	NULL
is	NULL
due	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
so	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
below	NULL
our	NULL
encampment	NULL
flowed	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
stream	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
farther	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
stony	NULL
slope	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
down	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
poor	NULL
Silvestre	NULL
creeping	NULL
back	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
reach	NULL
Solomon	NULL
's	NULL
Mines	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
beyond	NULL
that	NULL
slope	NULL
begins	NULL
the	NULL
waterless	NULL
desert	NULL
,	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
species	NULL
of	NULL
karoo	NULL
shrub	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
evening	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
pitched	NULL
our	NULL
camp	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
ball	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
sinking	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
,	NULL
sending	NULL
glorious	NULL
rays	NULL
of	NULL
many-coloured	NULL
light	NULL
flying	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
its	NULL
vast	NULL
expanse	NULL
.	NULL

Leaving	NULL
Good	NULL
to	NULL
superintend	NULL
the	NULL
arrangement	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
little	NULL
camp	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
took	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
walking	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
slope	NULL
opposite	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
gazed	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
air	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
clear	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
far	NULL
away	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
distinguish	NULL
the	NULL
faint	NULL
blue	NULL
outlines	NULL
,	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
capped	NULL
with	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Suliman	NULL
Berg	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL

and	NULL

reach	NULL
him	NULL
somehow	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
tone	NULL
of	NULL
quiet	NULL
confidence	NULL
which	NULL
marked	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
hope	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
camp	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

Behind	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
also	NULL
gazing	NULL
earnestly	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
far-off	NULL
mountains	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
Kafir	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Zulu	NULL
spoke	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
observed	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
addressing	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
attached	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

pointing	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
mountain	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
broad	NULL
assegai	NULL

I	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
sharply	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
by	NULL
addressing	NULL
his	NULL
master	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
familiar	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
for	NULL
natives	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
name	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL

themselves	NULL

it	NULL

not	NULL
decent	NULL

call	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
man	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
heathenish	NULL
appellations	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Zulu	NULL
laughed	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
little	NULL
laugh	NULL
which	NULL
angered	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL

besides	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
curious	NULL

I	NULL
translated	NULL

Again	NULL

And	NULL
without	NULL

lifted	NULL

returned	NULL

too	NULL

"	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
we	NULL
made	NULL
our	NULL
arrangements	NULL
for	NULL
starting	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
drag	NULL
our	NULL
heavy	NULL
elephant	NULL
rifles	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
kit	NULL
with	NULL
us	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
dismissing	NULL
our	NULL
bearers	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
arrangement	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
native	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
kraal	NULL
close	NULL
by	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
care	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
till	NULL
we	NULL
returned	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
heart	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
such	NULL
things	NULL
as	NULL
those	NULL
sweet	NULL
tools	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tender	NULL
mercies	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
thief	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
savage	NULL
whose	NULL
greedy	NULL
eyes	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
gloating	NULL
over	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
took	NULL
some	NULL
precautions	NULL
.	NULL

First	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
I	NULL
loaded	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
rifles	NULL
,	NULL
placing	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
full	NULL
cock	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
informed	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
touched	NULL
them	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
the	NULL
experiment	NULL
instantly	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
eight-bore	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
go	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
blew	NULL
a	NULL
hole	NULL
right	NULL
through	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
oxen	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
being	NULL
driven	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
kraal	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
knocking	NULL
him	NULL
head	NULL
over	NULL
heels	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
recoil	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
considerably	NULL
startled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
pleased	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ox	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
impudence	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
nothing	NULL
would	NULL
induce	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
touch	NULL
the	NULL
guns	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Put	NULL
the	NULL

out	NULL
of	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
or	NULL
they	NULL
will	NULL
murder	NULL
us	NULL

"	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
things	NULL
was	NULL
missing	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
kill	NULL
him	NULL

his	NULL
people	NULL
by	NULL
witchcraft	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
died	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
steal	NULL
the	NULL
rifles	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
haunt	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
turn	NULL
his	NULL
cattle	NULL
mad	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
milk	NULL
sour	NULL
till	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
weariness	NULL

and	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
devils	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
guns	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
generally	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
judgment	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
superstitious	NULL

Kafir	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
villain	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
thus	NULL
disposed	NULL

we	NULL
arranged	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL

equipment	NULL

a	NULL
small	NULL
one	NULL
indeed	NULL
for	NULL
such	NULL

dared	NULL

But	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
our	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
reducing	NULL
the	NULL
weight	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
taken	NULL
but	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
absolutely	NULL
necessary	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
great	NULL
difficulty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
promise	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
present	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
hunting-knife	NULL
each	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
persuading	NULL
three	NULL
wretched	NULL
natives	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
with	NULL
us	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
stage	NULL
,	NULL
twenty	NULL
miles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
gourd	NULL
holding	NULL
a	NULL
gallon	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
apiece	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
object	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
enable	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
refill	NULL
our	NULL
water-bottles	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
night	NULL
's	NULL
march	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
we	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
start	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cool	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
gave	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
these	NULL
natives	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
shoot	NULL
ostriches	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
abounded	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
jabbered	NULL
and	NULL
shrugged	NULL
their	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
mad	NULL
and	NULL
should	NULL
perish	NULL
of	NULL
thirst	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
say	NULL
seemed	NULL
probable	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
being	NULL
desirous	NULL
of	NULL
obtaining	NULL
the	NULL
knives	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
almost	NULL
unknown	NULL
treasures	NULL
up	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
consented	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
probably	NULL
reflected	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
our	NULL
subsequent	NULL
extinction	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
affair	NULL
of	NULL
theirs	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
we	NULL
rested	NULL
and	NULL
slept	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
sunset	NULL
ate	NULL
a	NULL
hearty	NULL
meal	NULL
of	NULL
fresh	NULL

washed	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
tea	NULL

the	NULL
last	NULL

sadly	NULL

were	NULL

drink	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
day	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
made	NULL
our	NULL
final	NULL
preparations	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL

moon	NULL
to	NULL
rise	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL

about	NULL
nine	NULL
o'clock	NULL

up	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
glory	NULL

flooding	NULL
the	NULL
wild	NULL
country	NULL
with	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
throwing	NULL
a	NULL
silver	NULL
sheen	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
expanse	NULL
of	NULL
rolling	NULL
desert	NULL
before	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
solemn	NULL

quiet	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
alien	NULL
to	NULL
man	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
star-studded	NULL
firmament	NULL

We	NULL
rose	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
were	NULL
ready	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
we	NULL
hesitated	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL

men	NULL
can	NULL
make	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
doubtful	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
can	NULL
succeed	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
three	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
will	NULL
stand	NULL
together	NULL
for	NULL
good	NULL
or	NULL
for	NULL
evil	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
before	NULL
we	NULL
start	NULL
let	NULL
us	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
pray	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Power	NULL
who	NULL
shapes	NULL
the	NULL
destinies	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
ages	NULL
since	NULL
has	NULL
marked	NULL
out	NULL
our	NULL
paths	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
please	NULL
Him	NULL
to	NULL
direct	NULL
our	NULL
steps	NULL
in	NULL
accordance	NULL
with	NULL
His	NULL
will	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Taking	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
space	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
covered	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Good	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
likewise	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
a	NULL
first-rate	NULL
praying	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
few	NULL
hunters	NULL
are	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
speak	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
once	NULL
since	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
deep	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
religious	NULL
.	NULL

Good	NULL
too	NULL
is	NULL
pious	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
swear	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
remember	NULL
,	NULL
excepting	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
single	NULL
occasion	NULL
,	NULL
ever	NULL
putting	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
prayer	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
life	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
during	NULL
that	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
somehow	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
happier	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Our	NULL
future	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
completely	NULL
unknown	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
unknown	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
awful	NULL
always	NULL
bring	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
nearer	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
Maker	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
_	NULL
trek	NULL
_	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

So	NULL
we	NULL
started	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
guide	NULL
ourselves	NULL
by	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
distant	NULL
mountains	NULL
and	NULL
old	NULL
José	NULL
da	NULL
Silvestre	NULL
's	NULL
chart	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
considering	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
drawn	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
dying	NULL
and	NULL
half-distraught	NULL
man	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
fragment	NULL
of	NULL
linen	NULL
three	NULL
centuries	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
our	NULL
sole	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
success	NULL
depended	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
we	NULL
failed	NULL
in	NULL
finding	NULL
that	NULL
pool	NULL
of	NULL
bad	NULL
water	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
Dom	NULL
marked	NULL
as	NULL
being	NULL
situated	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
sixty	NULL
miles	NULL
from	NULL
our	NULL
starting-point	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
mountains	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
probability	NULL
we	NULL
must	NULL
perish	NULL
miserably	NULL
of	NULL
thirst	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
the	NULL
chances	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
finding	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
great	NULL
sea	NULL
of	NULL
sand	NULL
and	NULL
karoo	NULL
scrub	NULL
seemed	NULL
almost	NULL
infinitesimal	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
supposing	NULL
that	NULL
da	NULL
Silvestra	NULL
had	NULL
marked	NULL
the	NULL
pool	NULL
correctly	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
its	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
dried	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
generations	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
trampled	NULL
in	NULL
by	NULL
game	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
drifting	NULL
sand	NULL
?	NULL

On	NULL
we	NULL
tramped	NULL
silently	NULL
as	NULL
shades	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
heavy	NULL
sand	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
karoo	NULL
bushes	NULL
caught	NULL
our	NULL
feet	NULL
and	NULL
retarded	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sand	NULL
worked	NULL
into	NULL
our	NULL
veldtschoons	NULL
and	NULL
Good	NULL
's	NULL
shooting-boots	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
every	NULL
few	NULL
miles	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
stop	NULL
and	NULL
empty	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
kept	NULL
fairly	NULL
cool	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
was	NULL
thick	NULL
and	NULL
heavy	NULL
,	NULL
giving	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
creamy	NULL
feel	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
made	NULL
fair	NULL
progress	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
silent	NULL
and	NULL
lonely	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
,	NULL
oppressively	NULL
so	NULL
indeed	NULL
.	NULL

Good	NULL
felt	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
once	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
whistle	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
Girl	NULL
I	NULL
left	NULL
behind	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
notes	NULL
sounded	NULL
lugubrious	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
vast	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

Shortly	NULL
afterwards	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
incident	NULL
occurred	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
startled	NULL
us	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
rise	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
laugh	NULL
.	NULL

Good	NULL
was	NULL
leading	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
holder	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
compass	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
sailor	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
he	NULL
understood	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
toiling	NULL
along	NULL
in	NULL
single	NULL
file	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
suddenly	NULL
we	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
exclamation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
vanished	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
second	NULL
there	NULL
arose	NULL
all	NULL
around	NULL
us	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
hubbub	NULL
,	NULL
snorts	NULL
,	NULL
groans	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wild	NULL
sounds	NULL
of	NULL
rushing	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
faint	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
descry	NULL
dim	NULL
galloping	NULL
forms	NULL
half	NULL
hidden	NULL
by	NULL
wreaths	NULL
of	NULL
sand	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
natives	NULL
threw	NULL
down	NULL
their	NULL
loads	NULL
and	NULL
prepared	NULL
to	NULL
bolt	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
remembering	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nowhere	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
cast	NULL
themselves	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
and	NULL
howled	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
ghosts	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
and	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
stood	NULL
amazed	NULL
;	NULL
nor	NULL
was	NULL
our	NULL
amazement	NULL
lessened	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
perceived	NULL
the	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
Good	NULL
careering	NULL
off	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mountains	NULL
,	NULL
apparently	NULL
mounted	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
horse	NULL
and	NULL
halloaing	NULL
wildly	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
another	NULL
second	NULL
he	NULL
threw	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
thud	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
;	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
stumbled	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
herd	NULL
of	NULL
sleeping	NULL
quagga	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
Good	NULL
actually	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
brute	NULL
naturally	NULL
enough	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
off	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Calling	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
ran	NULL
towards	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
afraid	NULL
lest	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
hurt	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
great	NULL
relief	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sand	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
eye-glass	NULL
still	NULL
fixed	NULL
firmly	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eye	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
shaken	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
frightened	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
way	NULL
injured	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
this	NULL
we	NULL
travelled	NULL
on	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
further	NULL
misadventure	NULL
till	NULL
about	NULL
one	NULL
o'clock	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
halt	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
drunk	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
water	NULL
was	NULL
precious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rested	NULL
for	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
started	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
the	NULL
east	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
blush	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
cheek	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
faint	NULL
rays	NULL
of	NULL
primrose	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
changed	NULL
presently	NULL
to	NULL
golden	NULL
bars	NULL
,	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
dawn	NULL
glided	NULL
out	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
stars	NULL
grew	NULL
pale	NULL
and	NULL
paler	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
they	NULL
vanished	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
golden	NULL
moon	NULL
waxed	NULL
wan	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
mountain	NULL
ridges	NULL
stood	NULL
out	NULL
against	NULL
her	NULL
sickly	NULL
face	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
bones	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
cheek	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
dying	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
came	NULL
spear	NULL
upon	NULL
spear	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
flashing	NULL
far	NULL
away	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
boundless	NULL
wilderness	NULL
,	NULL
piercing	NULL
and	NULL
firing	NULL
the	NULL
veils	NULL
of	NULL
mist	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
was	NULL
draped	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
tremulous	NULL
golden	NULL
glow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
we	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
halt	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
glad	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
we	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
once	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
fully	NULL
up	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
almost	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
travel	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
length	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
spied	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
pile	NULL
of	NULL
boulders	NULL
rising	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
plain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
we	NULL
dragged	NULL
ourselves	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
luck	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
here	NULL
we	NULL
found	NULL
an	NULL
overhanging	NULL
slab	NULL
of	NULL
rock	NULL
carpeted	NULL
beneath	NULL
with	NULL
smooth	NULL
sand	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
afforded	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
grateful	NULL
shelter	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
heat	NULL
.	NULL

Underneath	NULL
this	NULL
we	NULL
crept	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
having	NULL
drunk	NULL
some	NULL
water	NULL
and	NULL
eaten	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
biltong	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
were	NULL
sound	NULL
asleep	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
three	NULL
o'clock	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
before	NULL
we	NULL
woke	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
our	NULL
bearers	NULL
preparing	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
enough	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
already	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
knives	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
tempted	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
farther	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
we	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
hearty	NULL
drink	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
emptied	NULL
our	NULL
water-bottles	NULL
,	NULL
filled	NULL
them	NULL
up	NULL
again	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
gourds	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
watched	NULL
them	NULL
depart	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
twenty	NULL
miles	NULL
'	NULL
tramp	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
half-past	NULL
four	NULL
we	NULL
also	NULL
started	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
lonely	NULL
and	NULL
desolate	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
exception	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
ostriches	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
living	NULL
creature	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
on	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
vast	NULL
expanse	NULL
of	NULL
sandy	NULL
plain	NULL
.	NULL

Evidently	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
dry	NULL
for	NULL
game	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
exception	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
deadly-looking	NULL
cobra	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
we	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
reptiles	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
insect	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
found	NULL
abundant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
common	NULL
or	NULL
house	NULL
fly	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
single	NULL
spies	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
battalions	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
the	NULL
Old	NULL
Testament	NULL
[	NULL
1	NULL
]	NULL
says	NULL
somewhere	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
an	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
insect	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
fly	NULL
.	NULL

Go	NULL
where	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
you	NULL
find	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
always	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
enclosed	NULL
in	NULL
amber	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
told	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
million	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
exactly	NULL
like	NULL
his	NULL
descendant	NULL
of	NULL
to-day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
little	NULL
doubt	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
man	NULL
lies	NULL
dying	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
buzzing	NULL
round	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
this	NULL
event	NULL
happens	NULL
to	NULL
occur	NULL
in	NULL
summer	NULL
--	NULL
watching	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL
to	NULL
settle	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
nose	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
sunset	NULL
we	NULL
halted	NULL
,	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL
to	NULL
rise	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
beautiful	NULL
and	NULL
serene	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
halt	NULL
about	NULL
two	NULL
o'clock	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
trudged	NULL
on	NULL
wearily	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
the	NULL
welcome	NULL
sun	NULL
put	NULL
a	NULL
period	NULL
to	NULL
our	NULL
labours	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
drank	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
and	NULL
flung	NULL
ourselves	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sand	NULL
,	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
tired	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
asleep	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
need	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
a	NULL
watch	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
fear	NULL
from	NULL
anybody	NULL
or	NULL
anything	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
vast	NULL
untenanted	NULL
plain	NULL
.	NULL

Our	NULL
only	NULL
enemies	NULL
were	NULL
heat	NULL
,	NULL
thirst	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
flies	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
far	NULL
rather	NULL
would	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
faced	NULL
any	NULL
danger	NULL
from	NULL
man	NULL
or	NULL
beast	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
awful	NULL
trinity	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
time	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
lucky	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
sheltering	NULL
rock	NULL
to	NULL
guard	NULL
us	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
that	NULL
about	NULL
seven	NULL
o'clock	NULL
we	NULL
woke	NULL
up	NULL
experiencing	NULL
the	NULL
exact	NULL
sensations	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
attribute	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
beefsteak	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
gridiron	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
were	NULL
literally	NULL
being	NULL
baked	NULL
through	NULL
and	NULL
through	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
burning	NULL
sun	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sucking	NULL
our	NULL
very	NULL
blood	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
sat	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
gasped	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Phew	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
grabbing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
halo	NULL
of	NULL
flies	NULL
which	NULL
buzzed	NULL
cheerfully	NULL
round	NULL
my	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
heat	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
affect	NULL
_	NULL
them	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
word	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
hot	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

echoed	NULL
Good	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
hot	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
shelter	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
.	NULL

Look	NULL
where	NULL
we	NULL
would	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
rock	NULL
or	NULL
tree	NULL
,	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
an	NULL
unending	NULL
glare	NULL
,	NULL
rendered	NULL
dazzling	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
heated	NULL
air	NULL
that	NULL
danced	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
surface	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
dances	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
red-hot	NULL
stove	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
we	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
stand	NULL
this	NULL
for	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

We	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
blankly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
we	NULL
must	NULL
dig	NULL
a	NULL
hole	NULL
,	NULL
get	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cover	NULL
ourselves	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
karoo	NULL
bushes	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
promising	NULL
suggestion	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
we	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
trowel	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
with	NULL
us	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
help	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
about	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
we	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
delving	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
patch	NULL
of	NULL
ground	NULL
some	NULL
ten	NULL
feet	NULL
long	NULL
by	NULL
twelve	NULL
wide	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
depth	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
we	NULL
cut	NULL
a	NULL
quantity	NULL
of	NULL
low	NULL
scrub	NULL
with	NULL
our	NULL
hunting-knives	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
creeping	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
hole	NULL
,	NULL
pulled	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
us	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
exception	NULL
of	NULL
Ventvögel	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
whom	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
Hottentot	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
heat	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
particular	NULL
effect	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
gave	NULL
us	NULL
some	NULL
slight	NULL
shelter	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
burning	NULL
rays	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
amateur	NULL
grave	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
imagined	NULL
than	NULL
described	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Black	NULL
Hole	NULL
of	NULL
Calcutta	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
we	NULL
lived	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
we	NULL
lay	NULL
panting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
moistening	NULL
our	NULL
lips	NULL
from	NULL
our	NULL
scanty	NULL
supply	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
we	NULL
followed	NULL
our	NULL
inclinations	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
finished	NULL
all	NULL
we	NULL
possessed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
two	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
exercise	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
rigid	NULL
care	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
if	NULL
our	NULL
water	NULL
failed	NULL
us	NULL
we	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL
soon	NULL
we	NULL
must	NULL
perish	NULL
miserably	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
everything	NULL
has	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
only	NULL
you	NULL
live	NULL
long	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
somehow	NULL
that	NULL
miserable	NULL
day	NULL
wore	NULL
on	NULL
towards	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

About	NULL
three	NULL
o'clock	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
we	NULL
determined	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
bear	NULL
it	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
walking	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
killed	NULL
slowly	NULL
by	NULL
heat	NULL
and	NULL
thirst	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
dreadful	NULL
hole	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
taking	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
drink	NULL
from	NULL
our	NULL
fast	NULL
diminishing	NULL
supply	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
warmed	NULL
to	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
temperature	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
blood	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
staggered	NULL
forward	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
then	NULL
covered	NULL
some	NULL
fifty	NULL
miles	NULL
of	NULL
wilderness	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
the	NULL
reader	NULL
will	NULL
refer	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rough	NULL
copy	NULL
and	NULL
translation	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
da	NULL
Silvestra	NULL
's	NULL
map	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
is	NULL
marked	NULL
as	NULL
measuring	NULL
forty	NULL
leagues	NULL
across	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
pan	NULL
bad	NULL
water	NULL
"	NULL
is	NULL
set	NULL
down	NULL
as	NULL
being	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
forty	NULL
leagues	NULL
is	NULL
one	NULL
hundred	NULL
and	NULL
twenty	NULL
miles	NULL
,	NULL
consequently	NULL
we	NULL
ought	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
within	NULL
twelve	NULL
or	NULL
fifteen	NULL
miles	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
if	NULL
any	NULL
should	NULL
really	NULL
exist	NULL
.	NULL

Through	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
we	NULL
crept	NULL
slowly	NULL
and	NULL
painfully	NULL
along	NULL
,	NULL
scarcely	NULL
doing	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
sunset	NULL
we	NULL
rested	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
drinking	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
some	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
we	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
and	NULL
indistinct	NULL
hillock	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
flat	NULL
surface	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
plain	NULL
about	NULL
eight	NULL
miles	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
it	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
ant-hill	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
dropping	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
I	NULL
fell	NULL
to	NULL
wondering	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL
we	NULL
marched	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
exhausted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
suffering	NULL
tortures	NULL
from	NULL
thirst	NULL
and	NULL
prickly	NULL
heat	NULL
.	NULL

Nobody	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
not	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
can	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
through	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
walked	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
staggered	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
falling	NULL
from	NULL
exhaustion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
being	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
a	NULL
halt	NULL
every	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
scarcely	NULL
energy	NULL
left	NULL
in	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

Up	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
Good	NULL
had	NULL
chatted	NULL
and	NULL
joked	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
merry	NULL
fellow	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
joke	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
two	NULL
o'clock	NULL
,	NULL
utterly	NULL
worn	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
body	NULL
and	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
queer	NULL
hill	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
sand	NULL
koppie	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
sight	NULL
resembled	NULL
a	NULL
gigantic	NULL
ant-heap	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
feet	NULL
high	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
covering	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
base	NULL
nearly	NULL
two	NULL
acres	NULL
of	NULL
ground	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
we	NULL
halted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
driven	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
by	NULL
our	NULL
desperate	NULL
thirst	NULL
,	NULL
sucked	NULL
down	NULL
our	NULL
last	NULL
drops	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
but	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
pint	NULL
a	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
drunk	NULL
a	NULL
gallon	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
we	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
dropping	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
remark	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
Zulu	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
we	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL

we	NULL
shall	NULL
all	NULL
be	NULL

the	NULL
moon	NULL
rises	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
shuddered	NULL
,	NULL
hot	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
near	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
awful	NULL
death	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
pleasant	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
keep	NULL
me	NULL
from	NULL
sleeping	NULL

WATER	NULL
!	NULL

Two	NULL
hours	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
four	NULL
o'clock	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
woke	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
heavy	NULL
demand	NULL
of	NULL
bodily	NULL
fatigue	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
satisfied	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
torturing	NULL
thirst	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
suffering	NULL
asserted	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
sleep	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
dreaming	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
bathing	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
running	NULL
stream	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
green	NULL
banks	NULL
and	NULL
trees	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
awoke	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
myself	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
arid	NULL
wilderness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
water	NULL
this	NULL
day	NULL
we	NULL
must	NULL
perish	NULL
miserably	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
human	NULL
creature	NULL
could	NULL
live	NULL
long	NULL
without	NULL
water	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
heat	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
sat	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
rubbed	NULL
my	NULL
grimy	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
dry	NULL
and	NULL
horny	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
my	NULL
lips	NULL
and	NULL
eyelids	NULL
were	NULL
stuck	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
after	NULL
some	NULL
friction	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
open	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
dawn	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bright	NULL
feel	NULL
of	NULL
dawn	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
thick	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
hot	NULL
murkiness	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
describe	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
others	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
sleeping	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
it	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
light	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
drew	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
pocket	NULL
copy	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Ingoldsby	NULL
Legends	NULL
"	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
read	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
Jackdaw	NULL
of	NULL
Rheims	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
where	NULL
"	NULL
A	NULL
nice	NULL
little	NULL
boy	NULL
held	NULL
a	NULL
golden	NULL
ewer	NULL
,	NULL
Embossed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
water	NULL
as	NULL
pure	NULL
As	NULL
any	NULL
that	NULL
flows	NULL
between	NULL
Rheims	NULL
and	NULL
Namur	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
literally	NULL
I	NULL
smacked	NULL
my	NULL
cracking	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
smack	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
mere	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
pure	NULL
water	NULL
made	NULL
me	NULL
mad	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
the	NULL
Cardinal	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
there	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
bell	NULL
,	NULL
book	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
candle	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
whipped	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
drunk	NULL
his	NULL
water	NULL
up	NULL
;	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
filled	NULL
it	NULL
already	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
suds	NULL
of	NULL
soap	NULL
"	NULL
worthy	NULL
of	NULL
washing	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Pope	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
consecrated	NULL
curse	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Catholic	NULL
Church	NULL
should	NULL
fall	NULL
upon	NULL
me	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
doing	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
almost	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
light-headed	NULL
with	NULL
thirst	NULL
,	NULL
weariness	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
food	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
fell	NULL
to	NULL
thinking	NULL
how	NULL
astonished	NULL
the	NULL
Cardinal	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
nice	NULL
little	NULL
boy	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
jackdaw	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
looked	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
burnt	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
brown-eyed	NULL
,	NULL
grizzly-haired	NULL
little	NULL
elephant	NULL
hunter	NULL
suddenly	NULL
bound	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
dirty	NULL
face	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
basin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
swallow	NULL
every	NULL
drop	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
precious	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
idea	NULL
amused	NULL
me	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
laughed	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
cackled	NULL
aloud	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
woke	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
rub	NULL
_	NULL
their	NULL
_	NULL
dirty	NULL
faces	NULL
and	NULL
drag	NULL
_	NULL
their	NULL
_	NULL
gummed-up	NULL
lips	NULL
and	NULL
eyelids	NULL
apart	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
well	NULL
awake	NULL
we	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
discuss	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
serious	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
a	NULL
drop	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
turned	NULL
the	NULL
bottles	NULL
upside	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
licked	NULL
their	NULL
tops	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
failure	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
dry	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
bone	NULL
.	NULL

Good	NULL
,	NULL

had	NULL
charge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
flask	NULL
of	NULL

got	NULL
it	NULL

and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
longingly	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
promptly	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
to	NULL
drink	NULL
raw	NULL
spirit	NULL
would	NULL
only	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
precipitate	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
we	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
water	NULL
we	NULL
shall	NULL
die	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
we	NULL
can	NULL
trust	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
Dom	NULL
's	NULL

there	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
some	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
nobody	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
derive	NULL
much	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
remark	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
evident	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
great	NULL
faith	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
map	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
gradually	NULL
growing	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
sat	NULL
staring	NULL
blankly	NULL
at	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
observed	NULL
the	NULL
Hottentot	NULL
Ventvögel	NULL
rise	NULL
and	NULL
begin	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
about	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
he	NULL
stopped	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
uttering	NULL
a	NULL
guttural	NULL
exclamation	NULL
,	NULL
pointed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

we	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
rising	NULL
simultaneously	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sand	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
it	NULL

what	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Springbucks	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
in	NULL
Dutch	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
answered	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL

This	NULL
little	NULL
discovery	NULL
put	NULL
new	NULL
life	NULL
into	NULL
us	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
wonderful	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
desperate	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
catches	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
hope	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
feels	NULL
almost	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
night	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
star	NULL
is	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
Ventvögel	NULL
was	NULL
lifting	NULL
his	NULL
snub	NULL
nose	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sniffing	NULL
the	NULL
hot	NULL
air	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
Impala	NULL
ram	NULL
who	NULL
scents	NULL
danger	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
_	NULL
smell	NULL
_	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
we	NULL
felt	NULL
quite	NULL
jubilant	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
we	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
wonderful	NULL
instinct	NULL
these	NULL
wild-bred	NULL
men	NULL
possess	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
gloriously	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
revealed	NULL
so	NULL
grand	NULL
a	NULL
sight	NULL
to	NULL
our	NULL
astonished	NULL
eyes	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
we	NULL
even	NULL
forgot	NULL
our	NULL
thirst	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
forty	NULL
or	NULL
fifty	NULL
miles	NULL
from	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
glittering	NULL
like	NULL
silver	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
rays	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
sun	NULL
,	NULL
soared	NULL
Sheba	NULL
's	NULL
Breasts	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
stretching	NULL
away	NULL
for	NULL
hundreds	NULL
of	NULL
miles	NULL
on	NULL
either	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
ran	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
Suliman	NULL
Berg	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
describe	NULL
the	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
grandeur	NULL
and	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
sight	NULL
,	NULL
language	NULL
seems	NULL
to	NULL
fail	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
impotent	NULL
even	NULL
before	NULL
its	NULL
memory	NULL
.	NULL

Straight	NULL
before	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
rose	NULL
two	NULL
enormous	NULL
mountains	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
like	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
in	NULL
Africa	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
indeed	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
such	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
measuring	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
fifteen	NULL
thousand	NULL
feet	NULL
in	NULL
height	NULL
,	NULL
standing	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
miles	NULL
apart	NULL
,	NULL
linked	NULL
together	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
precipitous	NULL
cliff	NULL
of	NULL
rock	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
towering	NULL
in	NULL
awful	NULL
white	NULL
solemnity	NULL
straight	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
mountains	NULL
placed	NULL
thus	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
pillars	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
gigantic	NULL
gateway	NULL
,	NULL
are	NULL
shaped	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
fashion	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
breasts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
the	NULL
mists	NULL
and	NULL
shadows	NULL
beneath	NULL
them	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
recumbent	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
veiled	NULL
mysteriously	NULL
in	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
bases	NULL
swell	NULL
gently	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
plain	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
distance	NULL
perfectly	NULL
round	NULL
and	NULL
smooth	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
vast	NULL
hillock	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
snow	NULL
,	NULL
exactly	NULL
corresponding	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
nipple	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
female	NULL
breast	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
stretch	NULL
of	NULL
cliff	NULL
that	NULL
connects	NULL
them	NULL
appears	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
some	NULL
thousands	NULL
of	NULL
feet	NULL
in	NULL
height	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perfectly	NULL
precipitous	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
flank	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
can	NULL
reach	NULL
,	NULL
extent	NULL
similar	NULL
lines	NULL
of	NULL
cliff	NULL
,	NULL
broken	NULL
only	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
by	NULL
flat	NULL
table-topped	NULL
mountains	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
world-famed	NULL
one	NULL
at	NULL
Cape	NULL
Town	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
formation	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
common	NULL
in	NULL
Africa	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
describe	NULL
the	NULL
comprehensive	NULL
grandeur	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
view	NULL
is	NULL
beyond	NULL
my	NULL
powers	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
so	NULL
inexpressibly	NULL
solemn	NULL
and	NULL
overpowering	NULL
about	NULL
those	NULL
huge	NULL
volcanoes	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
doubtless	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
extinct	NULL
volcanoes	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
quite	NULL
awed	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
lights	NULL
played	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
brown	NULL
and	NULL
swelling	NULL
masses	NULL
beneath	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
to	NULL
veil	NULL
the	NULL
majestic	NULL
sight	NULL
from	NULL
our	NULL
curious	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
strange	NULL
vapours	NULL
and	NULL
clouds	NULL
gathered	NULL
and	NULL
increased	NULL
around	NULL
the	NULL
mountains	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
presently	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
trace	NULL
their	NULL
pure	NULL
and	NULL
gigantic	NULL
outlines	NULL
,	NULL
showing	NULL
ghostlike	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
fleecy	NULL
envelope	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
afterwards	NULL
discovered	NULL
,	NULL
usually	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
wrapped	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
gauze-like	NULL
mist	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
doubtless	NULL
accounted	NULL
for	NULL
our	NULL
not	NULL
having	NULL
seen	NULL
them	NULL
more	NULL
clearly	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

Sheba	NULL
's	NULL
Breasts	NULL
had	NULL
scarcely	NULL
vanished	NULL
into	NULL
cloud-clad	NULL
privacy	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
our	NULL
thirst	NULL
--	NULL
literally	NULL
a	NULL
burning	NULL
question	NULL
--	NULL
reasserted	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
for	NULL
Ventvögel	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
smelt	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
no	NULL
signs	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
look	NULL
which	NULL
way	NULL
we	NULL
would	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
might	NULL
reach	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
arid	NULL
sweltering	NULL
sand	NULL
and	NULL
karoo	NULL
scrub	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
walked	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
hillock	NULL
and	NULL
gazed	NULL
about	NULL
anxiously	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
story	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
drop	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
indication	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
pan	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
pool	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
spring	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
are	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
angrily	NULL
to	NULL
Ventvögel	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
still	NULL
he	NULL
lifted	NULL
his	NULL
ugly	NULL
snub	NULL
nose	NULL
and	NULL
sniffed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
smell	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
Baas	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
somewhere	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
clouds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
about	NULL
two	NULL
months	NULL
hence	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
fall	NULL
and	NULL
wash	NULL
our	NULL
bones	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
stroked	NULL
his	NULL
yellow	NULL
beard	NULL
thoughtfully	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
suggested	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Rot	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Good	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
whoever	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
being	NULL
found	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hill	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
us	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hopelessly	NULL
enough	NULL
we	NULL
scrambled	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
sandy	NULL
sides	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hillock	NULL
,	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
leading	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
he	NULL
stopped	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
petrified	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

_	NULL
Nanzia	NULL
manzie	NULL
_	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

that	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Here	NULL
is	NULL
water	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
cried	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
loud	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
rushed	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
sure	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
cut	NULL
or	NULL
indentation	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sand	NULL
koppie	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
undoubted	NULL
pool	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
place	NULL
we	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
stop	NULL
to	NULL
inquire	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
did	NULL
we	NULL
hesitate	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
black	NULL
and	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
appearance	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
imitation	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
bound	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
rush	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
second	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
our	NULL
stomachs	NULL
sucking	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
uninviting	NULL
fluid	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
nectar	NULL
fit	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
gods	NULL
.	NULL

Heavens	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
we	NULL
did	NULL
drink	NULL
!	NULL

Then	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
drinking	NULL
we	NULL
tore	NULL
off	NULL
our	NULL
clothes	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pool	NULL
,	NULL
absorbing	NULL
the	NULL
moisture	NULL
through	NULL
our	NULL
parched	NULL
skins	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
,	NULL
Harry	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
taps	NULL
to	NULL
summon	NULL
"	NULL
hot	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
"	NULL
cold	NULL
"	NULL
from	NULL
an	NULL
unseen	NULL
,	NULL
vasty	NULL
cistern	NULL
,	NULL
can	NULL
have	NULL
little	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
luxury	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
muddy	NULL
wallow	NULL
in	NULL
brackish	NULL
tepid	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
we	NULL
rose	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
refreshed	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
to	NULL
on	NULL
our	NULL
"	NULL
biltong	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
scarcely	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
touch	NULL
a	NULL
mouthful	NULL
for	NULL
twenty-four	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ate	NULL
our	NULL
fill	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
we	NULL
smoked	NULL
a	NULL
pipe	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
blessed	NULL
pool	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
overhanging	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
bank	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
slept	NULL
till	NULL
noon	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
we	NULL
rested	NULL
there	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
thanking	NULL
our	NULL
stars	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
lucky	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
bad	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
forgetting	NULL
to	NULL
render	NULL
a	NULL
due	NULL
share	NULL
of	NULL
gratitude	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
shade	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
long-departed	NULL
da	NULL
Silvestra	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
set	NULL
its	NULL
position	NULL
down	NULL
so	NULL
accurately	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
tail	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
shirt	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wonderful	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
pan	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
lasted	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
account	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
supposition	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
fed	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
spring	NULL
deep	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sand	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
filled	NULL
both	NULL
ourselves	NULL
and	NULL
our	NULL
water-bottles	NULL
as	NULL
full	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
far	NULL
better	NULL
spirits	NULL
we	NULL
started	NULL
off	NULL
again	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
night	NULL
we	NULL
covered	NULL
nearly	NULL
five-and-twenty	NULL
miles	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
needless	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
found	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
lucky	NULL
enough	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
shade	NULL
behind	NULL
some	NULL
ant-heaps	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
rose	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
awhile	NULL
,	NULL
cleared	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
mysterious	NULL
mists	NULL
,	NULL
Suliman	NULL
's	NULL
Berg	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
majestic	NULL
Breasts	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
only	NULL
about	NULL
twenty	NULL
miles	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
towering	NULL
right	NULL
above	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
grander	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
approach	NULL
of	NULL
evening	NULL
we	NULL
marched	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
story	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
daylight	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
found	NULL
ourselves	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL

's	NULL
left	NULL
breast	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
steadily	NULL
steering	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
our	NULL
water	NULL
was	NULL
exhausted	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
suffering	NULL
severely	NULL
from	NULL
thirst	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
indeed	NULL
could	NULL
we	NULL
see	NULL
any	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
relieving	NULL
it	NULL
till	NULL
we	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
line	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
far	NULL
above	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
resting	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
driven	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
by	NULL
our	NULL
torturing	NULL
thirst	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
toiling	NULL
painfully	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
burning	NULL
heat	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
lava	NULL
slopes	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
we	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
huge	NULL
base	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mountain	NULL
was	NULL
composed	NULL
entirely	NULL
of	NULL
lava	NULL
beds	NULL
belched	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
bowels	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
far	NULL
past	NULL
age	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
eleven	NULL
o'clock	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
utterly	NULL
exhausted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
generally	NULL
speaking	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
bad	NULL
state	NULL
indeed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lava	NULL
clinker	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
must	NULL
drag	NULL
ourselves	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
smooth	NULL
compared	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
clinker	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Island	NULL
of	NULL
Ascension	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
instance	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
yet	NULL
rough	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
our	NULL
feet	NULL
very	NULL
sore	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
together	NULL
with	NULL
our	NULL
other	NULL
miseries	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
pretty	NULL
well	NULL
finished	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
above	NULL
us	NULL
were	NULL
some	NULL
large	NULL
lumps	NULL
of	NULL
lava	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
towards	NULL
these	NULL
we	NULL
steered	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
lying	NULL
down	NULL
beneath	NULL
their	NULL
shade	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
reached	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
our	NULL
surprise	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
capacity	NULL
for	NULL
surprise	NULL
left	NULL
in	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
plateau	NULL
or	NULL
ridge	NULL
close	NULL
by	NULL
we	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
clinker	NULL
was	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
dense	NULL
green	NULL
growth	NULL
.	NULL

Evidently	NULL
soil	NULL
formed	NULL
of	NULL
decomposed	NULL
lava	NULL
had	NULL
rested	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
due	NULL
course	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
the	NULL
receptacle	NULL
of	NULL
seeds	NULL
deposited	NULL
by	NULL
birds	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
we	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
much	NULL
further	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
growth	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
live	NULL
on	NULL
grass	NULL
like	NULL
Nebuchadnezzar	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
requires	NULL
a	NULL
special	NULL
dispensation	NULL
of	NULL
Providence	NULL
and	NULL
peculiar	NULL
digestive	NULL
organs	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
we	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
rocks	NULL
and	NULL
groaned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
I	NULL
wished	NULL
heartily	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
started	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
fool	NULL
's	NULL
errand	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
sitting	NULL
there	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
hobble	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
patch	NULL
of	NULL
green	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
great	NULL
astonishment	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
perceived	NULL
that	NULL
usually	NULL
very	NULL
dignified	NULL
individual	NULL
dancing	NULL
and	NULL
shouting	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
maniac	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
waving	NULL
something	NULL
green	NULL
.	NULL

Off	NULL
we	NULL
all	NULL
scrambled	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
fast	NULL
as	NULL
our	NULL
wearied	NULL
limbs	NULL
would	NULL
carry	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
hoping	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
,	NULL
son	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
shouted	NULL
in	NULL
Zulu	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
food	NULL
and	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
Macumazahn	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
he	NULL
waved	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
melon	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
hit	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
patch	NULL
of	NULL
wild	NULL
melons	NULL
,	NULL
thousands	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dead	NULL
ripe	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Melons	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
yelled	NULL
to	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
next	NULL
me	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
minute	NULL
his	NULL
false	NULL
teeth	NULL
were	NULL
fixed	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
we	NULL
ate	NULL
about	NULL
six	NULL
each	NULL
before	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
poor	NULL
fruit	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
doubt	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
ever	NULL
thought	NULL
anything	NULL
nicer	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
melons	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
nutritious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
satisfied	NULL
our	NULL
thirst	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
pulpy	NULL
substance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
a	NULL
stock	NULL
to	NULL
cool	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
simple	NULL
process	NULL
of	NULL
cutting	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL
and	NULL
setting	NULL
them	NULL
end	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hot	NULL
sun	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
cold	NULL
by	NULL
evaporation	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
hungry	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
still	NULL
some	NULL
biltong	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
our	NULL
stomachs	NULL
turned	NULL
from	NULL
biltong	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
sparing	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
find	NULL
more	NULL
food	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
a	NULL
lucky	NULL
thing	NULL
chanced	NULL
.	NULL

Looking	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
flock	NULL
of	NULL
about	NULL
ten	NULL
large	NULL
birds	NULL
flying	NULL
straight	NULL
towards	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

_	NULL
Skit	NULL
,	NULL
Baas	NULL
,	NULL
skit	NULL
!	NULL

_	NULL
"	NULL
"	NULL
Shoot	NULL
,	NULL
master	NULL
,	NULL
shoot	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

whispered	NULL
the	NULL
Hottentot	NULL
,	NULL
throwing	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
example	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
all	NULL
followed	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
birds	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
flock	NULL
of	NULL
_	NULL
pauw	NULL
_	NULL
or	NULL
bustards	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
pass	NULL
within	NULL
fifty	NULL
yards	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

Taking	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
repeating	NULL
Winchesters	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
waited	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
nearly	NULL
over	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
jumped	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
seeing	NULL
me	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
pauw	NULL
_	NULL
bunched	NULL
up	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
expected	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
fired	NULL
two	NULL
shots	NULL
straight	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
thick	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
luck	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
brought	NULL
one	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
weighed	NULL
about	NULL
twenty	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
fire	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
dry	NULL
melon	NULL
stalks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
toasting	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
made	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
feed	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
tasted	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
ate	NULL
that	NULL
_	NULL
pauw	NULL
_	NULL
;	NULL
nothing	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
leg-bones	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
beak	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
felt	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
afterwards	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
night	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
again	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL
,	NULL
carrying	NULL
as	NULL
many	NULL
melons	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
with	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
we	NULL
ascended	NULL
we	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
grew	NULL
cooler	NULL
and	NULL
cooler	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
relief	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
dawn	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
judge	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
miles	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
line	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
we	NULL
discovered	NULL
more	NULL
melons	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
any	NULL
anxiety	NULL
about	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
we	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
soon	NULL
get	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
snow	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
ascent	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
become	NULL
very	NULL
precipitous	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
made	NULL
but	NULL
slow	NULL
progress	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
.	NULL

Also	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
we	NULL
ate	NULL
our	NULL
last	NULL
morsel	NULL
of	NULL
biltong	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
exception	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
pauw	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
no	NULL
living	NULL
thing	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
mountain	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
had	NULL
we	NULL
come	NULL
across	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
spring	NULL
or	NULL
stream	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
struck	NULL
us	NULL
as	NULL
very	NULL
odd	NULL
,	NULL
considering	NULL
the	NULL
expanse	NULL
of	NULL
snow	NULL
above	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
must	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
melt	NULL
sometimes	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
afterwards	NULL
discovered	NULL
,	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
cause	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
quite	NULL
beyond	NULL
my	NULL
power	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
streams	NULL
flowed	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
north	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mountains	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
we	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
very	NULL
anxious	NULL
about	NULL
food	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
escaped	NULL
death	NULL
by	NULL
thirst	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
probable	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
of	NULL
hunger	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
events	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

appreciate	NULL
the	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL

ten	NULL

we	NULL
trudged	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
suddenly	NULL
Umbopa	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL
marching	NULL
along	NULL

me	NULL

wrapped	NULL

that	NULL

looked	NULL

caught	NULL
me	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
arm	NULL

"	NULL
Look	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
pointing	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
springing	NULL
slope	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
nipple	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
followed	NULL
his	NULL
glance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
two	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
from	NULL
us	NULL
perceived	NULL
what	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
hole	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
cave	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
sure	NULL
enough	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
hole	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
mouth	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cavern	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
da	NULL
Silvestra	NULL
wrote	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
too	NULL
soon	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
reached	NULL
shelter	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
startling	NULL
rapidity	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
nearly	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
latitudes	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
but	NULL
little	NULL
twilight	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
we	NULL
crept	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
cave	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
appear	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
big	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
huddling	NULL
ourselves	NULL
together	NULL
for	NULL
warmth	NULL
,	NULL
swallowed	NULL
what	NULL
remained	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
brandy	NULL
--	NULL
barely	NULL
a	NULL
mouthful	NULL
each	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
forget	NULL
our	NULL
miseries	NULL
in	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
cold	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
intense	NULL
to	NULL
allow	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
great	NULL
altitude	NULL
the	NULL
thermometer	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
marked	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
fourteen	NULL
or	NULL
fifteen	NULL
degrees	NULL
below	NULL
freezing	NULL
point	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
temperature	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
enervated	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
by	NULL
hardship	NULL
,	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
food	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
heat	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
reader	NULL
may	NULL
imagine	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
describe	NULL
.	NULL

Suffice	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
as	NULL
near	NULL
death	NULL
from	NULL
exposure	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
ever	NULL
felt	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
we	NULL
sat	NULL
hour	NULL
after	NULL
hour	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
still	NULL
and	NULL
bitter	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
the	NULL
frost	NULL
wander	NULL
round	NULL
and	NULL
nip	NULL
us	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
finger	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
vain	NULL
did	NULL
we	NULL
huddle	NULL
up	NULL
closer	NULL
and	NULL
closer	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
warmth	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
miserable	NULL
starved	NULL
carcases	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
would	NULL
drop	NULL
into	NULL
an	NULL
uneasy	NULL
slumber	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
sleep	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
fortunate	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
I	NULL
doubt	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
ever	NULL
woke	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
will	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
kept	NULL
ourselves	NULL
alive	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
very	NULL
long	NULL
before	NULL
dawn	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
Hottentot	NULL
Ventvögel	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
teeth	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
chattering	NULL
all	NULL
night	NULL
like	NULL
castanets	NULL
,	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
sigh	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
his	NULL
teeth	NULL
stopped	NULL
chattering	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
anything	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
concluding	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
back	NULL
was	NULL
resting	NULL
against	NULL
mine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
colder	NULL
and	NULL
colder	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
it	NULL
felt	NULL
like	NULL
ice	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
length	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
grey	NULL
with	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
golden	NULL
arrows	NULL
sped	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
the	NULL
glorious	NULL
sun	NULL
peeped	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
lava	NULL
wall	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
in	NULL
upon	NULL
our	NULL
half-frozen	NULL
forms	NULL
.	NULL

Also	NULL
it	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
Ventvögel	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
there	NULL
amongst	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
_	NULL
stone	NULL
dead	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
wonder	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
felt	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
fellow	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
sigh	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
frozen	NULL
almost	NULL
stiff	NULL
.	NULL

Shocked	NULL
beyond	NULL
measure	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
dragged	NULL
ourselves	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
corpse	NULL
--	NULL
how	NULL
strange	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
horror	NULL
we	NULL
mortals	NULL
have	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
companionship	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
dead	NULL
body	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
it	NULL
sitting	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
arms	NULL
clasped	NULL
about	NULL
its	NULL
knees	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
sunlight	NULL
was	NULL
pouring	NULL
its	NULL
cold	NULL
rays	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
here	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
straight	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
mouth	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cave	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
an	NULL
exclamation	NULL
of	NULL
fear	NULL
from	NULL
someone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
my	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
:	NULL
Sitting	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cavern	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
twenty	NULL
feet	NULL
long	NULL
--	NULL
was	NULL
another	NULL
form	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
rested	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL
chest	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
arms	NULL
hung	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
too	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
_	NULL
dead	NULL
man	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
others	NULL
saw	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
proved	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
our	NULL
shattered	NULL
nerves	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
we	NULL
scrambled	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cave	NULL
as	NULL
fast	NULL
as	NULL
our	NULL
half-frozen	NULL
limbs	NULL
would	NULL
carry	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
VII	NULL
SOLOMON	NULL
'S	NULL
ROAD	NULL
Outside	NULL
the	NULL
cavern	NULL
we	NULL
halted	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
rather	NULL
foolish	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
going	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Good	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Because	NULL
it	NULL
has	NULL
struck	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
--	NULL
what	NULL
we	NULL
saw	NULL
--	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
my	NULL
brother	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
idea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
re-entered	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
proof	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
the	NULL
bright	NULL
light	NULL
outside	NULL
,	NULL
our	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
weak	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
with	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
pierce	NULL
the	NULL
gloom	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cave	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
grew	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
semi-darkness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
advanced	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
knelt	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
peered	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Thank	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
of	NULL
relief	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
_	NULL
not	NULL
_	NULL
my	NULL
brother	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
drew	NULL
near	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
body	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
middle	NULL
life	NULL
with	NULL
aquiline	NULL
features	NULL
,	NULL
grizzled	NULL
hair	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
black	NULL
moustache	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
skin	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
yellow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stretched	NULL
tightly	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
bones	NULL
.	NULL

Its	NULL
clothing	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
exception	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
remains	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woollen	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
hose	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
removed	NULL

leaving	NULL
the	NULL
skeleton-like	NULL

naked	NULL

Round	NULL
the	NULL
neck	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
corpse	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
frozen	NULL
perfectly	NULL

We	NULL
gazed	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL

astonished	NULL
,	NULL
forgetting	NULL
our	NULL

in	NULL
this	NULL

the	NULL
great	NULL
secret	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
discovered	NULL
:	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
awful	NULL
loneliness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
evidence	NULL
sat	NULL
before	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
even	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
trace	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
strongly-marked	NULL
features	NULL
a	NULL
likeness	NULL
to	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
poor	NULL
friend	NULL
Silvestre	NULL
his	NULL
descendant	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
perhaps	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
fancy	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sad	NULL
memento	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fate	NULL
that	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
overtakes	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
penetrate	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
unknown	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
doubtless	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
still	NULL
sit	NULL
,	NULL
crowned	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
dread	NULL
majesty	NULL
of	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
centuries	NULL
yet	NULL
unborn	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
startle	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
wanderers	NULL
like	NULL
ourselves	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
ever	NULL
any	NULL
such	NULL
should	NULL
come	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
invade	NULL
his	NULL
loneliness	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
thing	NULL
overpowered	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
already	NULL
almost	NULL
perished	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
with	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
hunger	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
us	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
voice	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
stay	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
will	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
companion	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
lifting	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
body	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Hottentot	NULL
Ventvögel	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
placed	NULL
it	NULL
near	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
Dom	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
stooped	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
jerk	NULL
broke	NULL
the	NULL
rotten	NULL
string	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
crucifix	NULL
which	NULL
hung	NULL
round	NULL
da	NULL
Silvestra	NULL
's	NULL
neck	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
fingers	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
cold	NULL
to	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
unfasten	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
it	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
bone	NULL
pen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
before	NULL
me	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
write	NULL
--	NULL
sometimes	NULL
I	NULL
use	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
sign	NULL
my	NULL
name	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
leaving	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
proud	NULL
white	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
past	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
Hottentot	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
their	NULL
eternal	NULL
vigil	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
eternal	NULL
snows	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
crept	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cave	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
welcome	NULL
sunshine	NULL
and	NULL
resumed	NULL
our	NULL
path	NULL
,	NULL
wondering	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
hearts	NULL
how	NULL
many	NULL
hours	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
before	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
even	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
walked	NULL
about	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
we	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
plateau	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
nipple	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mountain	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
rise	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
exact	NULL
centre	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
side	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
lay	NULL
below	NULL
us	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
landscape	NULL
was	NULL
wreathed	NULL
in	NULL
billows	NULL
of	NULL
morning	NULL
fog	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
higher	NULL
layers	NULL
of	NULL
mist	NULL
cleared	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
revealed	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
slope	NULL
of	NULL
snow	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
patch	NULL
of	NULL
green	NULL
grass	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
five	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
beneath	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
stream	NULL
was	NULL
running	NULL
.	NULL

Nor	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL
stream	NULL
,	NULL
basking	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bright	NULL
sun	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
and	NULL
lay	NULL
a	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
from	NULL
ten	NULL
to	NULL
fifteen	NULL
_	NULL
large	NULL
antelopes	NULL
_	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
distance	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
species	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sight	NULL
filled	NULL
us	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
unreasoning	NULL
joy	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
only	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
food	NULL
in	NULL
plenty	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
beasts	NULL
were	NULL
fully	NULL
six	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
long	NULL
shot	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
depended	NULL
on	NULL
when	NULL
our	NULL
lives	NULL
hung	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
results	NULL
.	NULL

Rapidly	NULL
we	NULL
discussed	NULL
the	NULL
advisability	NULL
of	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
stalk	NULL
the	NULL
game	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
dismissed	NULL
it	NULL
reluctantly	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
begin	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
favourable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
further	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
must	NULL
certainly	NULL
be	NULL
perceived	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
careful	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
blinding	NULL
background	NULL
of	NULL
snow	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
traverse	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
try	NULL
from	NULL
where	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Which	NULL
shall	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
Quatermain	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
repeating	NULL
rifles	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
expresses	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Here	NULL
again	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Winchester	NULL
repeaters	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
carrying	NULL
poor	NULL
Ventvögel	NULL
's	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
--	NULL
were	NULL
sighted	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
thousand	NULL
yards	NULL
,	NULL
whereas	NULL
the	NULL
expresses	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
sighted	NULL
to	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
and	NULL
fifty	NULL
,	NULL
beyond	NULL
which	NULL
distance	NULL
shooting	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
guess-work	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
hit	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
express	NULL
bullets	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
"	NULL
expanding	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
were	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
the	NULL
game	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
knotty	NULL
point	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
must	NULL
risk	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
use	NULL
the	NULL
expresses	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
buck	NULL
opposite	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

Aim	NULL
well	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shoulder	NULL
and	NULL
high	NULL
up	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
I	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
may	NULL
all	NULL
fire	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
pause	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
aiming	NULL
his	NULL
level	NULL
best	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
indeed	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
is	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
knows	NULL
that	NULL
life	NULL
itself	NULL
depends	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
shot	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Fire	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
in	NULL
Zulu	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
almost	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
instant	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
rifles	NULL
rang	NULL
out	NULL
loudly	NULL
;	NULL
three	NULL
clouds	NULL
of	NULL
smoke	NULL
hung	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
before	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
echoes	NULL
went	NULL
flying	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
silent	NULL
snow	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
the	NULL
smoke	NULL
cleared	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
revealed	NULL
--	NULL
oh	NULL
,	NULL
joy	NULL
!	NULL

--	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
buck	NULL
lying	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
kicking	NULL
furiously	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
death	NULL
agony	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
yell	NULL
of	NULL
triumph	NULL
--	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
saved	NULL
--	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
starve	NULL
.	NULL

Weak	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
rushed	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
intervening	NULL
slope	NULL
of	NULL
snow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
shooting	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
animal	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
liver	NULL
were	NULL
lying	NULL
before	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
difficulty	NULL
arose	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
fuel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
therefore	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
no	NULL
fire	NULL
to	NULL
cook	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
gazed	NULL
at	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
in	NULL
dismay	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Starving	NULL
men	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
fanciful	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Good	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
we	NULL
must	NULL
eat	NULL
raw	NULL
meat	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
way	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dilemma	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
our	NULL
gnawing	NULL
hunger	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
proposition	NULL
less	NULL
distasteful	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
otherwise	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
we	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
liver	NULL
and	NULL
buried	NULL
them	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
patch	NULL
of	NULL
snow	NULL
to	NULL
cool	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
we	NULL
washed	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ice-cold	NULL
water	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stream	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lastly	NULL
ate	NULL
them	NULL
greedily	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
sounds	NULL
horrible	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
honestly	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
tasted	NULL
anything	NULL
so	NULL
good	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
raw	NULL
meat	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
changed	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

Our	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
vigour	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
our	NULL
feeble	NULL
pulses	NULL
grew	NULL
strong	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
blood	NULL
went	NULL
coursing	NULL
through	NULL
our	NULL
veins	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
mindful	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
results	NULL
of	NULL
over-feeding	NULL
on	NULL
starved	NULL
stomachs	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
careful	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
stopping	NULL
whilst	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
hungry	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Thank	NULL
Heaven	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
brute	NULL
has	NULL
saved	NULL
our	NULL
lives	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
Quatermain	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
rose	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
antelope	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
certain	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
size	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
donkey	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
large	NULL
curved	NULL
horns	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
one	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
before	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
species	NULL
was	NULL
new	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
brown	NULL
in	NULL
colour	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
faint	NULL
red	NULL
stripes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
grew	NULL
a	NULL
thick	NULL
coat	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
afterwards	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
natives	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
wonderful	NULL
country	NULL
call	NULL
these	NULL
bucks	NULL
"	NULL
_	NULL
inco	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
are	NULL
very	NULL
rare	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
found	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
altitude	NULL
where	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
game	NULL
will	NULL
live	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
animal	NULL
was	NULL
fairly	NULL
hit	NULL
high	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shoulder	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
whose	NULL
bullet	NULL
brought	NULL
it	NULL
down	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
discover	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
mindful	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
marvellous	NULL
shot	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
giraffe	NULL
,	NULL
secretly	NULL
set	NULL
it	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
prowess	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
contradict	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
busy	NULL
satisfying	NULL
our	NULL
hunger	NULL
that	NULL
hitherto	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
found	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
about	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
set	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
meat	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
inspect	NULL
our	NULL
surroundings	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
mist	NULL
had	NULL
cleared	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
eight	NULL
o'clock	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
had	NULL
sucked	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
before	NULL
us	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
not	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
describe	NULL
the	NULL
glorious	NULL
panorama	NULL
which	NULL
unfolded	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
our	NULL
gaze	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
anything	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
shall	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
,	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Behind	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
us	NULL
towered	NULL
Sheba	NULL
's	NULL
snowy	NULL
Breasts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
below	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
five	NULL
thousand	NULL
feet	NULL
beneath	NULL
where	NULL
we	NULL
stood	NULL
,	NULL
lay	NULL
league	NULL
on	NULL
league	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
lovely	NULL
champaign	NULL
country	NULL

Here	NULL
were	NULL
dense	NULL
patches	NULL
of	NULL
lofty	NULL
forest	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
river	NULL
wound	NULL
its	NULL
silvery	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
stretched	NULL
a	NULL
vast	NULL
expanse	NULL
of	NULL
rich	NULL
,	NULL
undulating	NULL
veld	NULL
or	NULL
grass	NULL
land	NULL
,	NULL
whereon	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
just	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
countless	NULL
herds	NULL
of	NULL
game	NULL
or	NULL
cattle	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
distance	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL

This	NULL

appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
ringed	NULL
in	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
wall	NULL
of	NULL
distant	NULL
mountains	NULL

To	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL

less	NULL
mountainous	NULL

that	NULL
is	NULL

stood	NULL
up	NULL

with	NULL

between	NULL

amongst	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
groups	NULL

The	NULL

lay	NULL
before	NULL
us	NULL

sunlight	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
breath	NULL
of	NULL
Nature	NULL
's	NULL
happy	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
curious	NULL
things	NULL
struck	NULL
us	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
gazed	NULL
.	NULL

First	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
before	NULL
us	NULL
must	NULL
lie	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
three	NULL
thousand	NULL
feet	NULL
higher	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
crossed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
secondly	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
rivers	NULL
flowed	NULL
from	NULL
south	NULL
to	NULL
north	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
painful	NULL
reason	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
water	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
southern	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vast	NULL
range	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
stood	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
northern	NULL
face	NULL
were	NULL
many	NULL
streams	NULL
,	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
unite	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
river	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
winding	NULL
away	NULL
farther	NULL
than	NULL
our	NULL
eyes	NULL
could	NULL
follow	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
and	NULL
gazed	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
wonderful	NULL
view	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
spoke	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
n't	NULL
there	NULL
something	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
map	NULL
about	NULL
Solomon	NULL
's	NULL
Great	NULL
Road	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
nodded	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
gazing	NULL
out	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
far	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
look	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
pointed	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
to	NULL
our	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

Good	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
looked	NULL
accordingly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
winding	NULL
away	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
plain	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
wide	NULL
turnpike	NULL
road	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
because	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
reaching	NULL
the	NULL
plain	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
turned	NULL
behind	NULL
some	NULL
broken	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
;	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
lose	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
wonder	NULL
.	NULL

Somehow	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
particularly	NULL
unnatural	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
Roman	NULL
road	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
strange	NULL
land	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
accepted	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
quite	NULL
near	NULL
us	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
n't	NULL
we	NULL
better	NULL
be	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
start	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
sound	NULL
advice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
washed	NULL
our	NULL
faces	NULL
and	NULL
hands	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
stream	NULL
we	NULL
acted	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
we	NULL
made	NULL
our	NULL
way	NULL
over	NULL
boulders	NULL
and	NULL
across	NULL
patches	NULL
of	NULL
snow	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
reaching	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
rise	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
at	NULL
our	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
splendid	NULL
road	NULL
cut	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
solid	NULL
rock	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
fifty	NULL
feet	NULL
wide	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
apparently	NULL
well	NULL
kept	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
odd	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
walked	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
single	NULL
hundred	NULL
paces	NULL
behind	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
Sheba	NULL
's	NULL
Breasts	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
vanished	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
entire	NULL
surface	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mountain	NULL
being	NULL
strewn	NULL
with	NULL
boulders	NULL
interspersed	NULL
with	NULL
patches	NULL
of	NULL
snow	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
make	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
Quatermain	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
shook	NULL
my	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Good	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
ran	NULL
right	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
range	NULL
and	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
sand	NULL
there	NULL
has	NULL
covered	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
above	NULL
us	NULL
it	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
obliterated	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
volcanic	NULL
eruption	NULL
of	NULL
molten	NULL
lava	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

This	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
suggestion	NULL
;	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
accepted	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
proceeded	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
mountain	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
proved	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
different	NULL
business	NULL
travelling	NULL
along	NULL
down	NULL
hill	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
magnificent	NULL
pathway	NULL
with	NULL
full	NULL
stomachs	NULL
from	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
travelling	NULL
uphill	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
quite	NULL
starved	NULL
and	NULL
almost	NULL
frozen	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
melancholy	NULL
recollections	NULL
of	NULL
poor	NULL
Ventvögel	NULL
's	NULL
sad	NULL
fate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
grim	NULL
cave	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
company	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
Dom	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
positively	NULL
cheerful	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
unknown	NULL
dangers	NULL
before	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
mile	NULL
we	NULL
walked	NULL
the	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
grew	NULL
softer	NULL
and	NULL
balmier	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
before	NULL
us	NULL
shone	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
yet	NULL
more	NULL
luminous	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
saw	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
engineering	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
road	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
St.	NULL
Gothard	NULL
in	NULL
Switzerland	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
similar	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
difficulty	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL
great	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Old	NULL
World	NULL
engineer	NULL
who	NULL
laid	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
one	NULL
place	NULL
we	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
ravine	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
feet	NULL
broad	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
feet	NULL
deep	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
vast	NULL
gulf	NULL
was	NULL
actually	NULL
filled	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
huge	NULL
blocks	NULL
of	NULL
dressed	NULL
stone	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
arches	NULL
pierced	NULL
through	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
waterway	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
sublimely	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
another	NULL
place	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
cut	NULL
in	NULL
zigzags	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
precipice	NULL
five	NULL
hundred	NULL
feet	NULL
deep	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
third	NULL
it	NULL
tunnelled	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
base	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
intervening	NULL
ridge	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
space	NULL
of	NULL
thirty	NULL
yards	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
we	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
sides	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tunnel	NULL
were	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
quaint	NULL
sculptures	NULL
,	NULL
mostly	NULL
of	NULL
mailed	NULL
figures	NULL
driving	NULL
in	NULL
chariots	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
beautiful	NULL
,	NULL
represented	NULL
a	NULL
whole	NULL
battle	NULL
scene	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
convoy	NULL
of	NULL
captives	NULL
being	NULL
marched	NULL
off	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
inspecting	NULL
this	NULL
ancient	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
this	NULL
Solomon	NULL
's	NULL
Road	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
my	NULL
humble	NULL
opinion	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Egyptians	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
here	NULL
before	NULL
Solomon	NULL
's	NULL
people	NULL
ever	NULL
set	NULL
a	NULL
foot	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
Egyptian	NULL
or	NULL
Phoenician	NULL
handiwork	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

By	NULL
midday	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
advanced	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
mountain	NULL
to	NULL
search	NULL
the	NULL
region	NULL
where	NULL
wood	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

First	NULL
we	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
scattered	NULL
bushes	NULL
which	NULL
grew	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
frequent	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
we	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
winding	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
vast	NULL
grove	NULL
of	NULL
silver	NULL
trees	NULL
similar	NULL
to	NULL
those	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
slopes	NULL
of	NULL
Table	NULL
Mountain	NULL
at	NULL
Cape	NULL
Town	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
before	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
my	NULL
wanderings	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Cape	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
appearance	NULL
here	NULL
astonished	NULL
me	NULL
greatly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ah	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
surveying	NULL
these	NULL
shining-leaved	NULL
trees	NULL
with	NULL
evident	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
here	NULL
is	NULL
lots	NULL
of	NULL
wood	NULL
,	NULL
let	NULL
us	NULL
stop	NULL
and	NULL
cook	NULL
some	NULL
dinner	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
about	NULL
digested	NULL
that	NULL
raw	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Nobody	NULL
objected	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
we	NULL
made	NULL
our	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
stream	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
babbling	NULL
away	NULL
not	NULL
far	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
goodly	NULL
fire	NULL
of	NULL
dry	NULL
boughs	NULL
blazing	NULL
.	NULL

Cutting	NULL
off	NULL
some	NULL
substantial	NULL
hunks	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
flesh	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
inco	NULL
_	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
with	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
proceeded	NULL
to	NULL
toast	NULL
them	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
sharp	NULL
sticks	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
sees	NULL
the	NULL
Kafirs	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ate	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
relish	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
filling	NULL
ourselves	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
lit	NULL
our	NULL
pipes	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
ourselves	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
compared	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
hardships	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
recently	NULL
undergone	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
almost	NULL
heavenly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
brook	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
banks	NULL
were	NULL
clothed	NULL
with	NULL
dense	NULL
masses	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
gigantic	NULL
species	NULL
of	NULL
maidenhair	NULL
fern	NULL
interspersed	NULL
with	NULL
feathery	NULL
tufts	NULL
of	NULL
wild	NULL
asparagus	NULL

sung	NULL
merrily	NULL
at	NULL
our	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
soft	NULL
air	NULL
murmured	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
leaves	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
silver	NULL
trees	NULL
,	NULL
doves	NULL
cooed	NULL
around	NULL

and	NULL
bright-winged	NULL
birds	NULL
flashed	NULL
like	NULL
living	NULL
gems	NULL
from	NULL
bough	NULL
to	NULL
bough	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Paradise	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
magic	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
combined	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
overwhelming	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
dangers	NULL
left	NULL
behind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
promised	NULL
land	NULL
reached	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
charm	NULL
us	NULL
into	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
and	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
sat	NULL
conversing	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
mixture	NULL
of	NULL
broken	NULL
English	NULL
and	NULL
Kitchen	NULL
Zulu	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
earnestly	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
lay	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
eyes	NULL
half	NULL
shut	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
that	NULL
fragrant	NULL
bed	NULL
of	NULL
fern	NULL
and	NULL
watched	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
I	NULL
missed	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
looked	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
I	NULL
observed	NULL
him	NULL
sitting	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
bank	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stream	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
bathing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
on	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
flannel	NULL
shirt	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
natural	NULL
habits	NULL
of	NULL
extreme	NULL
neatness	NULL
having	NULL
reasserted	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
actively	NULL
employed	NULL
in	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
elaborate	NULL
toilet	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
washed	NULL
his	NULL
gutta-percha	NULL
collar	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
shaken	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
trousers	NULL
,	NULL
coat	NULL
and	NULL
waistcoat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
folding	NULL
them	NULL
up	NULL
neatly	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
them	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
shaking	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
sadly	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
scanned	NULL
the	NULL
numerous	NULL
rents	NULL
and	NULL
tears	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
naturally	NULL
had	NULL
resulted	NULL
from	NULL
our	NULL
frightful	NULL
journey	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
boots	NULL
,	NULL
scrubbed	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
handful	NULL
of	NULL
fern	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finally	NULL
rubbed	NULL
them	NULL
over	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
fat	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
carefully	NULL
saved	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
inco	NULL
_	NULL
meat	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
looked	NULL
,	NULL
comparatively	NULL
speaking	NULL
,	NULL
respectable	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
inspected	NULL
them	NULL
judiciously	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
eye-glass	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
boots	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
a	NULL
fresh	NULL
operation	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
bag	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
carried	NULL
he	NULL
produced	NULL
a	NULL
pocket-comb	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
fixed	NULL
a	NULL
tiny	NULL
looking-glass	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
surveyed	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Apparently	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
satisfied	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
proceeded	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
care	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
pause	NULL
whilst	NULL
he	NULL
again	NULL
contemplated	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
;	NULL
still	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
chin	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
accumulated	NULL
scrub	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
ten	NULL
days	NULL
'	NULL
beard	NULL
was	NULL
flourishing	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Surely	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
thought	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
shave	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
so	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

Taking	NULL
the	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
fat	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
greased	NULL
his	NULL
boots	NULL
,	NULL
Good	NULL
washed	NULL
it	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
stream	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
diving	NULL
again	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bag	NULL
he	NULL
brought	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
pocket	NULL
razor	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
guard	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
are	NULL
bought	NULL
by	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
are	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
cutting	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
by	NULL
those	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
undertake	NULL
a	NULL
sea	NULL
voyage	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
rubbed	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
chin	NULL
vigorously	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
fat	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
.	NULL

Evidently	NULL
it	NULL
proved	NULL
a	NULL
painful	NULL
process	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
groaned	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
convulsed	NULL
with	NULL
inward	NULL
laughter	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
watched	NULL
him	NULL
struggling	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
stubbly	NULL
beard	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
odd	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
shave	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
fat	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
circumstances	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
getting	NULL
the	NULL
hair	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
chin	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
suddenly	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
watching	NULL
,	NULL
became	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
flash	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
that	NULL
passed	NULL
just	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

Good	NULL
sprang	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
profane	NULL
exclamation	NULL
(	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
safety	NULL
razor	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
certainly	NULL
have	NULL
cut	NULL
his	NULL
throat	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
did	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
exclamation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
.	NULL

Standing	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
twenty	NULL
paces	NULL
from	NULL
where	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ten	NULL
from	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
tall	NULL
and	NULL
copper-coloured	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
wore	NULL
great	NULL
plumes	NULL
of	NULL
black	NULL
feathers	NULL
and	NULL
short	NULL
cloaks	NULL
of	NULL
leopard	NULL
skins	NULL
;	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
I	NULL
noticed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
stood	NULL
a	NULL
youth	NULL
of	NULL
about	NULL
seventeen	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
still	NULL
raised	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
body	NULL
bent	NULL
forward	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
attitude	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Grecian	NULL
statue	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
spear-thrower	NULL
.	NULL

Evidently	NULL
the	NULL
flash	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
caused	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
weapon	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
hurled	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
looked	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
soldier-like	NULL
man	NULL
stepped	NULL
forward	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
group	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
catching	NULL
the	NULL
youth	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
arm	NULL
said	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
advanced	NULL
upon	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
,	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
had	NULL
seized	NULL
their	NULL
rifles	NULL
and	NULL
lifted	NULL
them	NULL
threateningly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
party	NULL
of	NULL
natives	NULL
still	NULL
came	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
struck	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
rifles	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
treated	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
contempt	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Put	NULL
down	NULL
your	NULL
guns	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
halloed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
that	NULL
our	NULL
only	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
safety	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
conciliation	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
obeyed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
walking	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
I	NULL
addressed	NULL
the	NULL
elderly	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
checked	NULL
the	NULL
youth	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Greeting	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
in	NULL
Zulu	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
knowing	NULL
what	NULL
language	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
my	NULL
surprise	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
understood	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Greeting	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
answered	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
tongue	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dialect	NULL
so	NULL
closely	NULL
allied	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
neither	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
nor	NULL
myself	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
understanding	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
afterwards	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
language	NULL
spoken	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
people	NULL
is	NULL
an	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Zulu	NULL
tongue	NULL
,	NULL
bearing	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
relationship	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
of	NULL
Chaucer	NULL
does	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
nineteenth	NULL
century	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Whence	NULL
come	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
who	NULL
are	NULL

?	NULL

and	NULL
why	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
faces	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fourth	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
sons	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
pointed	NULL
to	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
flashed	NULL
across	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
faces	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
before	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
great	NULL
form	NULL
like	NULL
their	NULL
forms	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
reflect	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
coincidence	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
are	NULL
strangers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
peace	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
speaking	NULL
very	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
understand	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
man	NULL
is	NULL
our	NULL
servant	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
lie	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
no	NULL
strangers	NULL
can	NULL
cross	NULL
the	NULL
mountains	NULL
where	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
perish	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
what	NULL
do	NULL
your	NULL

matter	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
if	NULL
ye	NULL
are	NULL

ye	NULL

then	NULL
to	NULL

O	NULL
strangers	NULL

"	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
slightly	NULL
staggered	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
especially	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
steal	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
sides	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
hung	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
what	NULL
looked	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
and	NULL
heavy	NULL
knife	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
does	NULL
that	NULL
beggar	NULL
say	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Good	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
says	NULL
we	NULL

going	NULL

be	NULL
killed	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
answered	NULL
grimly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

Lord	NULL

"	NULL

groaned	NULL
Good	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
when	NULL
perplexed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
false	NULL
teeth	NULL
,	NULL
dragging	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
set	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
allowing	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
fly	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
jaw	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
snap	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
fortunate	NULL
move	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
next	NULL
second	NULL
the	NULL
dignified	NULL
crowd	NULL
of	NULL
Kukuanas	NULL
uttered	NULL
a	NULL
simultaneous	NULL
yell	NULL
of	NULL
horror	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
bolted	NULL
back	NULL
some	NULL
yards	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL

up	NULL

said	NULL
I.	NULL

It	NULL

whispered	NULL
Sir	NULL

excitedly	NULL

He	NULL
moved	NULL
them	NULL

He	NULL
obeyed	NULL
,	NULL
slipping	NULL
the	NULL
set	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
sleeve	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
flannel	NULL
shirt	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
another	NULL
second	NULL
curiosity	NULL
had	NULL
overcome	NULL
fear	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
advanced	NULL
slowly	NULL
.	NULL

Apparently	NULL

promptly	NULL
curled	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL

grinned	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

they	NULL
shouted	NULL

Turning	NULL
his	NULL

slowly	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
gesture	NULL
of	NULL
ineffable	NULL
contempt	NULL

Good	NULL

again	NULL

;	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
tipped	NULL
a	NULL
wink	NULL
towards	NULL
my	NULL
express	NULL
rifle	NULL
.	NULL

Umbopa	NULL
rose	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
something	NULL
as	NULL
nearly	NULL
resembling	NULL
a	NULL
grin	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
ever	NULL
seen	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
dignified	NULL
face	NULL
he	NULL
handed	NULL
me	NULL
the	NULL
gun	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

Lord	NULL

Lords	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
obeisance	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
rifle	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
perceived	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
_	NULL
klipspringer	NULL
_	NULL
antelope	NULL
standing	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
rock	NULL
about	NULL
seventy	NULL
yards	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
risk	NULL
the	NULL
shot	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ye	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
buck	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
pointing	NULL
the	NULL
animal	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
party	NULL
before	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Tell	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
possible	NULL

my	NULL

answered	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yet	NULL
shall	NULL
I	NULL
kill	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
quietly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
smiled	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
my	NULL
lord	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
raised	NULL
the	NULL
rifle	NULL
and	NULL
covered	NULL
the	NULL
buck	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
animal	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
might	NULL
well	NULL
be	NULL
excused	NULL
for	NULL
missing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
to	NULL
miss	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
drew	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
breath	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
slowly	NULL
pressed	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
trigger	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
buck	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
stone	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Bang	NULL
!	NULL

thud	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
antelope	NULL
sprang	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
rock	NULL
dead	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
door	NULL
nail	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
groan	NULL
of	NULL
simultaneous	NULL
terror	NULL
burst	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
group	NULL
before	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
want	NULL
meat	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
remarked	NULL
coolly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
go	NULL
fetch	NULL
that	NULL
buck	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
sign	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
followers	NULL
departed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
returned	NULL
bearing	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
klipspringer	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
noticed	NULL
with	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
hit	NULL
it	NULL
fairly	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
shoulder	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
gathered	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
creature	NULL

gazing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bullet-hole	NULL
in	NULL
consternation	NULL

"	NULL
Ye	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
ye	NULL
yet	NULL
doubt	NULL

The	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
suggestion	NULL
in	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL
tramping	NULL
along	NULL

behind	NULL

his	NULL

fully	NULL
occupied	NULL

attempts	NULL

prevent	NULL
his	NULL
flannel	NULL
shirt	NULL
from	NULL
flapping	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
breeze	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
my	NULL
astonishment	NULL
I	NULL
butted	NULL
into	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
walking	NULL
along	NULL
immediately	NULL
behind	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
evidently	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
listening	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
interest	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
expression	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
most	NULL
curious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
me	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
struggling	NULL
with	NULL
partial	NULL
success	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
something	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
forgotten	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
while	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
pressing	NULL
on	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
rate	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
undulating	NULL
plain	NULL
beneath	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
mountains	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
crossed	NULL
now	NULL
loomed	NULL
high	NULL
above	NULL
our	NULL
heads	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Sheba	NULL
's	NULL
Breasts	NULL
were	NULL
veiled	NULL
modestly	NULL
in	NULL
diaphanous	NULL
wreaths	NULL
of	NULL
mist	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
grew	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
lovely	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
vegetation	NULL
was	NULL
luxuriant	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
being	NULL
tropical	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
bright	NULL
and	NULL
warm	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
burning	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
gracious	NULL
breeze	NULL
blew	NULL
softly	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
odorous	NULL
slopes	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mountains	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
new	NULL
land	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
an	NULL
earthly	NULL
paradise	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
beauty	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
natural	NULL
wealth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
climate	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
its	NULL
like	NULL

The	NULL
Transvaal	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
country	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
Kukuanaland	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
started	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
had	NULL
despatched	NULL
a	NULL
runner	NULL
to	NULL
warn	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kraal	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
military	NULL
command	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
arrival	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
departed	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
speed	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
informed	NULL
me	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
keep	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
running	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
exercise	NULL
much	NULL
practised	NULL
among	NULL
his	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
message	NULL
now	NULL
became	NULL
apparent	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
we	NULL
arrived	NULL
within	NULL
two	NULL
miles	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kraal	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
company	NULL
after	NULL
company	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
issuing	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
gates	NULL
and	NULL
marching	NULL
towards	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
laid	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
upon	NULL
my	NULL
arm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
remarked	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
warm	NULL
reception	NULL
.	NULL

Something	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
tone	NULL
attracted	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
'	NULL
attention	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
not	NULL
my	NULL

be	NULL
afraid	NULL

said	NULL
hastily	NULL

gates	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
kraal	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
stretch	NULL
of	NULL
rising	NULL
ground	NULL
sloping	NULL
gently	NULL
upwards	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
the	NULL
companies	NULL
formed	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
splendid	NULL
sight	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
company	NULL
about	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
strong	NULL
,	NULL
charging	NULL
swiftly	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
rise	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
flashing	NULL
spears	NULL
and	NULL
waving	NULL
plumes	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
their	NULL
appointed	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
we	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
slope	NULL
twelve	NULL
such	NULL
companies	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
three	NULL
thousand	NULL
six	NULL
hundred	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
taken	NULL
up	NULL
their	NULL
positions	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
we	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
company	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
gaze	NULL
in	NULL
astonishment	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
magnificent	NULL
set	NULL
of	NULL
warriors	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
ever	NULL
seen	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
mature	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
mostly	NULL
veterans	NULL
of	NULL
about	NULL
forty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
was	NULL
under	NULL
six	NULL
feet	NULL
in	NULL
height	NULL
,	NULL
whilst	NULL
many	NULL
stood	NULL
six	NULL
feet	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
wore	NULL
upon	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
heavy	NULL
black	NULL
plumes	NULL
of	NULL
Sakaboola	NULL
feathers	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
those	NULL
which	NULL
adorned	NULL
our	NULL
guides	NULL
.	NULL

About	NULL
their	NULL
waists	NULL
and	NULL
beneath	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
knees	NULL
were	NULL
bound	NULL
circlets	NULL
of	NULL
white	NULL
ox	NULL
tails	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
left	NULL
hands	NULL
they	NULL
carried	NULL
round	NULL
shields	NULL
measuring	NULL
about	NULL
twenty	NULL
inches	NULL
across	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
shields	NULL
are	NULL
very	NULL
curious	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
framework	NULL
is	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
iron	NULL
plate	NULL
beaten	NULL
out	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
stretched	NULL
milk-white	NULL
ox-hide	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
weapons	NULL
that	NULL
each	NULL
man	NULL
bore	NULL
were	NULL
simple	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
most	NULL
effective	NULL
,	NULL
consisting	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
heavy	NULL
two-edged	NULL
spear	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
wooden	NULL
shaft	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
blade	NULL
being	NULL
about	NULL
six	NULL
inches	NULL
across	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
widest	NULL
part	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
spears	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
used	NULL
for	NULL
throwing	NULL
but	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
Zulu	NULL
"	NULL
_	NULL
bangwan	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
or	NULL
stabbing	NULL
assegai	NULL
,	NULL
are	NULL
for	NULL
close	NULL
quarters	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
wound	NULL
inflicted	NULL
by	NULL
them	NULL
is	NULL
terrible	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
addition	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
_	NULL
bangwan	NULL
_	NULL
every	NULL
man	NULL
carried	NULL
three	NULL
large	NULL
and	NULL
heavy	NULL
knives	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
knife	NULL
weighing	NULL
about	NULL
two	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
knife	NULL
was	NULL
fixed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ox-tail	NULL
girdle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
two	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
round	NULL
shield	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
knives	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
called	NULL
"	NULL
_	NULL
tollas	NULL
_	NULL
"	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Kukuanas	NULL
,	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
throwing	NULL
assegai	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Zulus	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Kukuana	NULL
warriors	NULL
can	NULL
cast	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
accuracy	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
distance	NULL
of	NULL
fifty	NULL
yards	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
their	NULL
custom	NULL
on	NULL
charging	NULL
to	NULL
hurl	NULL
a	NULL
volley	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
enemy	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
close	NULL
quarters	NULL
.	NULL

Each	NULL
company	NULL
remained	NULL
still	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
collection	NULL
of	NULL
bronze	NULL
statues	NULL
till	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
opposite	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
signal	NULL
given	NULL
by	NULL
its	NULL
commanding	NULL
officer	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
distinguished	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
leopard	NULL
skin	NULL
cloak	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
some	NULL
paces	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
,	NULL
every	NULL
spear	NULL
was	NULL
raised	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
throats	NULL
sprang	NULL
forth	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
roar	NULL
the	NULL
royal	NULL
salute	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
_	NULL
Koom	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL
formed	NULL
up	NULL
behind	NULL
us	NULL
and	NULL
followed	NULL
us	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
kraal	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
regiment	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Greys	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
called	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
white	NULL
shields	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
crack	NULL
corps	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Kukuana	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
marching	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
rear	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
tread	NULL
that	NULL
shook	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
length	NULL
,	NULL
branching	NULL
off	NULL
from	NULL
Solomon	NULL
's	NULL
Great	NULL
Road	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
wide	NULL
fosse	NULL
surrounding	NULL
the	NULL
kraal	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fenced	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
palisade	NULL
of	NULL
piles	NULL
formed	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
trunks	NULL
of	NULL
trees	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
gateway	NULL
this	NULL
fosse	NULL
is	NULL
spanned	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
primitive	NULL
drawbridge	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
let	NULL
down	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
guard	NULL
to	NULL
allow	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
kraal	NULL
is	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
well	NULL
laid	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Through	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
runs	NULL
a	NULL
wide	NULL
pathway	NULL
intersected	NULL
at	NULL
right	NULL
angles	NULL
by	NULL
other	NULL
pathways	NULL
so	NULL
arranged	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
the	NULL
huts	NULL
into	NULL
square	NULL
blocks	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
block	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
quarters	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
company	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
huts	NULL
are	NULL
dome-shaped	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
built	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Zulus	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
framework	NULL
of	NULL
wattle	NULL
,	NULL
beautifully	NULL
thatched	NULL
with	NULL
grass	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
unlike	NULL
the	NULL
Zulu	NULL
huts	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
doorways	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
men	NULL
could	NULL
walk	NULL
.	NULL

Also	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
much	NULL
larger	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
surrounded	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
verandah	NULL
about	NULL
six	NULL
feet	NULL
wide	NULL
,	NULL
beautifully	NULL
paved	NULL
with	NULL
powdered	NULL
lime	NULL
trodden	NULL
hard	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
along	NULL
each	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
wide	NULL
pathway	NULL
that	NULL
pierces	NULL
the	NULL
kraal	NULL
were	NULL
ranged	NULL
hundreds	NULL
of	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
brought	NULL
out	NULL
by	NULL
curiosity	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
native	NULL
race	NULL
,	NULL
are	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
handsome	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
are	NULL
tall	NULL
and	NULL
graceful	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
figures	NULL
are	NULL
wonderfully	NULL
fine	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
rather	NULL
curly	NULL
than	NULL
woolly	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
features	NULL
are	NULL
frequently	NULL
aquiline	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
lips	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
unpleasantly	NULL
thick	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
among	NULL
most	NULL
African	NULL
races	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
what	NULL
struck	NULL
us	NULL
most	NULL
was	NULL
their	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
quiet	NULL
and	NULL
dignified	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
well-bred	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
way	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
habituées	NULL
_	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fashionable	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
respect	NULL
they	NULL
differ	NULL
from	NULL
Zulu	NULL
women	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
cousins	NULL
the	NULL
Masai	NULL
who	NULL
inhabit	NULL
the	NULL
district	NULL
beyond	NULL
Zanzibar	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
curiosity	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
them	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
allowed	NULL
no	NULL
rude	NULL
expressions	NULL
of	NULL
astonishment	NULL
or	NULL
savage	NULL
criticism	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
their	NULL
lips	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
trudged	NULL
wearily	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
old	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
surreptitious	NULL
motion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
crowning	NULL
wonder	NULL
of	NULL
poor	NULL
Good	NULL
's	NULL
"	NULL
beautiful	NULL
white	NULL
legs	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
did	NULL
they	NULL
suffer	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
intense	NULL
admiration	NULL
which	NULL
evidently	NULL
mastered	NULL
their	NULL
minds	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
expression	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
fixed	NULL
their	NULL
dark	NULL
eyes	NULL
upon	NULL
this	NULL
new	NULL
and	NULL
snowy	NULL
loveliness	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
Good	NULL
's	NULL
skin	NULL
is	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
modest	NULL
by	NULL
nature	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
we	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kraal	NULL
,	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
halted	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
hut	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
surrounded	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
distance	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
circle	NULL
of	NULL
smaller	NULL
ones	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Enter	NULL
,	NULL
Sons	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Stars	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
magniloquent	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
deign	NULL
to	NULL
rest	NULL
awhile	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
humble	NULL
habitations	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
little	NULL
food	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
ye	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
need	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
your	NULL
belts	NULL
tight	NULL
from	NULL
hunger	NULL
;	NULL
some	NULL
honey	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
milk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
ox	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
sheep	NULL
;	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
lords	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
food	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
I.	NULL
"	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
;	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
weary	NULL
with	NULL
travelling	NULL
through	NULL
realms	NULL
of	NULL
air	NULL
;	NULL
now	NULL
let	NULL
us	NULL
rest	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Accordingly	NULL
we	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
hut	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
found	NULL
amply	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
our	NULL
comfort	NULL
.	NULL

Couches	NULL
of	NULL
tanned	NULL
skins	NULL
were	NULL
spread	NULL
for	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
lie	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
water	NULL
was	NULL
placed	NULL
for	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
wash	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
we	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
shouting	NULL
outside	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stepping	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
damsels	NULL
bearing	NULL
milk	NULL
and	NULL
roasted	NULL
mealies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
honey	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
pot	NULL
.	NULL

Behind	NULL
these	NULL
were	NULL
some	NULL
youths	NULL
driving	NULL
a	NULL
fat	NULL
young	NULL
ox	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
received	NULL
the	NULL
gifts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
drew	NULL
the	NULL
knife	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
girdle	NULL
and	NULL
dexterously	NULL
cut	NULL
the	NULL
ox	NULL
's	NULL
throat	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
skinned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
jointed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
meat	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL
for	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
party	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
presented	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
warriors	NULL
round	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
distributed	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
white	NULL
lords	NULL
'	NULL
gift	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Umbopa	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
assistance	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
extremely	NULL
prepossessing	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
boil	NULL
our	NULL
portion	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
earthenware	NULL
pot	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
fire	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
built	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
hut	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
ready	NULL
we	NULL
sent	NULL
a	NULL
message	NULL
to	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
Scragga	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
's	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
join	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sitting	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
little	NULL
stools	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
several	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
hut	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Kukuanas	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
squat	NULL
upon	NULL
their	NULL
haunches	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
Zulus	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
helped	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
through	NULL
our	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
was	NULL
most	NULL
affable	NULL
and	NULL
polite	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
struck	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
one	NULL
regarded	NULL
us	NULL
with	NULL
doubt	NULL
.	NULL

Together	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
party	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
overawed	NULL
by	NULL
our	NULL
white	NULL
appearance	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
our	NULL
magic	NULL
properties	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
discovering	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
ate	NULL
,	NULL
drank	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
slept	NULL
like	NULL
other	NULL
mortals	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
awe	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
wear	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
replaced	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
sullen	NULL
suspicion	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
me	NULL
feel	NULL
rather	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
meal	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
suggested	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
well	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
discover	NULL
if	NULL
our	NULL
hosts	NULL
knew	NULL
anything	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
brother	NULL
's	NULL
fate	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
seen	NULL
or	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
wiser	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
a	NULL
relative	NULL
lost	NULL
from	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
Stars	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

After	NULL
supper	NULL
we	NULL
produced	NULL
our	NULL
pipes	NULL
and	NULL
lit	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
proceeding	NULL
which	NULL
filled	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
and	NULL
Scragga	NULL
with	NULL
astonishment	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Kukuanas	NULL
were	NULL
evidently	NULL
unacquainted	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
divine	NULL
delights	NULL
of	NULL
tobacco-smoke	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
herb	NULL
is	NULL
grown	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL
extensively	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
Zulus	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
use	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
snuff	NULL
only	NULL

and	NULL
quite	NULL
failed	NULL

identify	NULL
it	NULL

its	NULL

form	NULL

Presently	NULL
I	NULL
asked	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
proceed	NULL
on	NULL
our	NULL
journey	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
delighted	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
that	NULL
preparations	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
for	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
messengers	NULL
having	NULL
already	NULL
departed	NULL
to	NULL
inform	NULL
Twala	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
coming	NULL

It	NULL
appeared	NULL
that	NULL
Twala	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
principal	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
known	NULL
as	NULL
Loo	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
ready	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
annual	NULL
feast	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
held	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
week	NULL
of	NULL
June	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
this	NULL
gathering	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
exception	NULL
of	NULL
certain	NULL
detachments	NULL

purposes	NULL

are	NULL
brought	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
paraded	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
annual	NULL
witch-hunt	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
more	NULL
by-and-by	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
held	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
start	NULL
at	NULL
dawn	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
accompany	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
expected	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
reach	NULL
Loo	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
unless	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
detained	NULL
by	NULL

or	NULL
by	NULL
swollen	NULL
rivers	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
us	NULL
this	NULL
information	NULL
our	NULL
visitors	NULL
bade	NULL
us	NULL
good-night	NULL
;	NULL

,	NULL
having	NULL
arranged	NULL
to	NULL
watch	NULL
turn	NULL

turn	NULL
about	NULL

three	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
flung	NULL
ourselves	NULL
down	NULL

slept	NULL
the	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
IX	NULL
TWALA	NULL
THE	NULL
KING	NULL
It	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
detail	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
the	NULL
incidents	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
journey	NULL
to	NULL
Loo	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
took	NULL
two	NULL
full	NULL
days	NULL
'	NULL
travelling	NULL
along	NULL
Solomon	NULL
's	NULL
Great	NULL
Road	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
pursued	NULL
its	NULL
even	NULL
course	NULL
right	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
of	NULL
Kukuanaland	NULL
.	NULL

Suffice	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
richer	NULL
and	NULL
richer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
kraals	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
wide	NULL
surrounding	NULL
belts	NULL
of	NULL
cultivation	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
numerous	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
built	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
principles	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
camp	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
reached	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
guarded	NULL
by	NULL
ample	NULL
garrisons	NULL
of	NULL
troops	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Kukuanaland	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
Germans	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Zulus	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Masai	NULL
,	NULL
every	NULL
able-bodied	NULL
man	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
soldier	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
nation	NULL
is	NULL
available	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL
wars	NULL
,	NULL
offensive	NULL
or	NULL
defensive	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
we	NULL
travelled	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
overtaken	NULL
by	NULL
thousands	NULL
of	NULL
warriors	NULL
hurrying	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
Loo	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
present	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
annual	NULL
review	NULL
and	NULL
festival	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
splendid	NULL
troops	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
saw	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
sunset	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
stopped	NULL
to	NULL
rest	NULL
awhile	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
summit	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
heights	NULL
over	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
ran	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
beautiful	NULL
and	NULL
fertile	NULL
plain	NULL
before	NULL
us	NULL
lay	NULL
Loo	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
native	NULL
town	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
an	NULL
enormous	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
five	NULL
miles	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
outlying	NULL
kraals	NULL
projecting	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
serve	NULL
on	NULL
grand	NULL
occasions	NULL
as	NULL
cantonments	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
regiments	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
horseshoe-shaped	NULL
hill	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
destined	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
better	NULL
acquainted	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
two	NULL
miles	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
north	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
beautifully	NULL
situated	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kraal	NULL
,	NULL
dividing	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
two	NULL
portions	NULL
,	NULL
runs	NULL
a	NULL
river	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
bridged	NULL
in	NULL
several	NULL
places	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
indeed	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
slopes	NULL
of	NULL
Sheba	NULL
's	NULL
Breasts	NULL
.	NULL

Sixty	NULL
or	NULL
seventy	NULL
miles	NULL
away	NULL
three	NULL
great	NULL
snow-capped	NULL
mountains	NULL
,	NULL
placed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
points	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
triangle	NULL
,	NULL
started	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
level	NULL
plain	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
conformation	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
mountains	NULL
is	NULL
unlike	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
Sheba	NULL
's	NULL
Breasts	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
sheer	NULL
and	NULL
precipitous	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
smooth	NULL
and	NULL
rounded	NULL
.	NULL

Infadoos	NULL
saw	NULL
us	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
volunteered	NULL
a	NULL
remark	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
road	NULL
ends	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
pointing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
mountains	NULL
known	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
Kukuanas	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Three	NULL
Witches	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
does	NULL
it	NULL
end	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Who	NULL
knows	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
answered	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
shrug	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
mountains	NULL
are	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
caves	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
pit	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
there	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
wise	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
time	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
whatever	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
for	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
country	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
there	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
our	NULL
kings	NULL
are	NULL
buried	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Place	NULL
of	NULL
Death	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
for	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
asked	NULL
eagerly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Nay	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
lords	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
dropped	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Stars	NULL
should	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
look	NULL
.	NULL

Evidently	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
right	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
Stars	NULL

learn	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
instance	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
wise	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
these	NULL
mountains	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
bright	NULL
stones	NULL

pretty	NULL
playthings	NULL

and	NULL
yellow	NULL
iron	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
lord	NULL
is	NULL
wise	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
coldly	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL

can	NULL
not	NULL
talk	NULL

my	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
I	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
mountains	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
are	NULL
Solomon	NULL

I	NULL
said	NULL

Umbopa	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL

apparently	NULL
plunged	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fits	NULL
of	NULL
abstraction	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
common	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

caught	NULL
my	NULL
words	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

put	NULL

the	NULL
diamonds	NULL

there	NULL

you	NULL

you	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
dost	NULL
thou	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL

Umbopa	NULL

"	NULL

I	NULL
asked	NULL
sharply	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
his	NULL
mysterious	NULL
ways	NULL

He	NULL
laughed	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
dreamed	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
too	NULL
turned	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
heel	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
what	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Sir	NULL

suggested	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL

said	NULL
Sir	NULL

gloomily	NULL

"	NULL

somehow	NULL
I	NULL

Slowly	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
sank	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
suddenly	NULL
darkness	NULL
rushed	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
tangible	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
breathing-space	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
soft	NULL
transformation	NULL
scene	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
latitudes	NULL
twilight	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
exist	NULL

The	NULL
change	NULL
from	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
night	NULL
is	NULL
as	NULL
quick	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
absolute	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
from	NULL
life	NULL
to	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
sank	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
wreathed	NULL
in	NULL
shadows	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
see	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
west	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
glow	NULL

then	NULL
come	NULL
rays	NULL
of	NULL
silver	NULL
light	NULL

and	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL

glorious	NULL
moon	NULL
lights	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
plain	NULL
and	NULL
shoots	NULL
its	NULL
gleaming	NULL
arrows	NULL
far	NULL
and	NULL
wide	NULL
,	NULL
filling	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL
refulgence	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
stood	NULL
and	NULL
watched	NULL
the	NULL
lovely	NULL
sight	NULL
,	NULL
whilst	NULL
the	NULL
stars	NULL
grew	NULL
pale	NULL
before	NULL
this	NULL
chastened	NULL
majesty	NULL

and	NULL
felt	NULL
our	NULL
hearts	NULL
lifted	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

beauty	NULL
that	NULL

Mine	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
rough	NULL
life	NULL

there	NULL
are	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL

lived	NULL
for	NULL

one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
that	NULL
moon	NULL
shine	NULL
over	NULL
Kukuanaland	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
our	NULL
meditations	NULL
were	NULL
broken	NULL
in	NULL
upon	NULL
by	NULL
our	NULL
polite	NULL
friend	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
my	NULL

journey	NULL

where	NULL
a	NULL
hut	NULL

made	NULL
ready	NULL

The	NULL
moon	NULL
is	NULL
now	NULL
bright	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
shall	NULL
not	NULL
fall	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

We	NULL
assented	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
's	NULL
time	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
outskirts	NULL

the	NULL
town	NULL

mapped	NULL

thousands	NULL

Unlimited	NULL

Soon	NULL
we	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
moat	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
drawbridge	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
met	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
rattling	NULL
of	NULL
arms	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
hoarse	NULL
challenge	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sentry	NULL
.	NULL

Infadoos	NULL
gave	NULL
some	NULL
password	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
catch	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
salute	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
passed	NULL
on	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
central	NULL
street	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
grass	NULL
city	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
nearly	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
's	NULL
tramp	NULL
,	NULL
past	NULL
endless	NULL
lines	NULL
of	NULL
huts	NULL
,	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
halted	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
huts	NULL
which	NULL
surrounded	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
courtyard	NULL
of	NULL
powdered	NULL
limestone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
informed	NULL
us	NULL
that	NULL
these	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
our	NULL
"	NULL
poor	NULL

quarters	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
entered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
hut	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
assigned	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL

These	NULL
huts	NULL
were	NULL
superior	NULL

in	NULL
each	NULL

so	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
washed	NULL

earthenware	NULL

We	NULL
ate	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
beds	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
all	NULL
moved	NULL

a	NULL

at	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL

smiled	NULL

we	NULL

ourselves	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL

thoroughly	NULL
wearied	NULL
with	NULL
our	NULL
long	NULL
journey	NULL

When	NULL
we	NULL
woke	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL

growled	NULL
Good	NULL

when	NULL
one	NULL

only	NULL
a	NULL

a	NULL

that	NULL

I	NULL
asked	NULL
accordingly	NULL

but	NULL
was	NULL
informed	NULL
that	NULL
these	NULL
sacred	NULL
relics	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
been	NULL
taken	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
us	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
forenoon	NULL
.	NULL

Somewhat	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
astonishment	NULL
and	NULL
disappointment	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
requested	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
to	NULL
step	NULL
outside	NULL

we	NULL
proceeded	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
toilet	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
admitted	NULL
.	NULL

Good	NULL
even	NULL
went	NULL
the	NULL
length	NULL

again	NULL
shaving	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL

the	NULL
left	NULL

on	NULL
which	NULL
now	NULL
appeared	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
fair	NULL
crop	NULL
of	NULL
whiskers	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
impressed	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
on	NULL
no	NULL
account	NULL
touch	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
ourselves	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
contented	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
wash	NULL
and	NULL
combing	NULL
our	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
's	NULL
yellow	NULL
locks	NULL
were	NULL
now	NULL
almost	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
more	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
ancient	NULL
Dane	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
my	NULL
grizzled	NULL
scrub	NULL
was	NULL
fully	NULL
an	NULL
inch	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
inch	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
way	NULL
I	NULL
considered	NULL
my	NULL
maximum	NULL
length	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
eaten	NULL
our	NULL
breakfast	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
smoked	NULL
a	NULL
pipe	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
message	NULL
was	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL
less	NULL
a	NULL
personage	NULL
than	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
Twala	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
pleased	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
remarked	NULL
in	NULL
reply	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
prefer	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
higher	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
yet	NULL
weary	NULL
with	NULL
our	NULL
journey	NULL
,	NULL
&	NULL
c.	NULL
,	NULL
&	NULL
c	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
always	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
dealing	NULL
with	NULL
uncivilised	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
too	NULL
great	NULL
a	NULL
hurry	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
are	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
mistake	NULL
politeness	NULL
for	NULL
awe	NULL
or	NULL
servility	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
quite	NULL
as	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Twala	NULL
as	NULL
Twala	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
employing	NULL
the	NULL
interval	NULL
in	NULL
preparing	NULL
such	NULL
presents	NULL
as	NULL
our	NULL
slender	NULL
stock	NULL
of	NULL
goods	NULL
permitted	NULL
--	NULL
namely	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Winchester	NULL
rifle	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
used	NULL
by	NULL
poor	NULL
Ventvögel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
beads	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rifle	NULL
and	NULL
ammunition	NULL
we	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
present	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
royal	NULL
highness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
beads	NULL
were	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
wives	NULL
and	NULL
courtiers	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
given	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
to	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
and	NULL
Scragga	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
delighted	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
having	NULL
seen	NULL
such	NULL
things	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
length	NULL
we	NULL
declared	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
ready	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
guided	NULL
by	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
,	NULL
started	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
audience	NULL
,	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
carrying	NULL
the	NULL
rifle	NULL
and	NULL
beads	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
walking	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
we	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
enclosure	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
surrounding	NULL
the	NULL
huts	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
allotted	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
fifty	NULL
times	NULL
as	NULL
big	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
covered	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
six	NULL
or	NULL
seven	NULL
acres	NULL
of	NULL
ground	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
outside	NULL
fence	NULL
stood	NULL
a	NULL
row	NULL
of	NULL
huts	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
habitations	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
's	NULL
wives	NULL
.	NULL

Exactly	NULL
opposite	NULL
the	NULL
gateway	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
further	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
space	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
large	NULL
hut	NULL
,	NULL
built	NULL
by	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
majesty	NULL
resided	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
was	NULL
open	NULL
ground	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
open	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
filled	NULL
by	NULL
company	NULL
after	NULL
company	NULL
of	NULL
warriors	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
mustered	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
seven	NULL
or	NULL
eight	NULL
thousand	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
men	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
as	NULL
statues	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
advanced	NULL
through	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
an	NULL
adequate	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
grandeur	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
spectacle	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
presented	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
waving	NULL
plumes	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
glancing	NULL
spears	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
iron-backed	NULL
ox-hide	NULL
shields	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
space	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
hut	NULL
was	NULL
empty	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
before	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
placed	NULL
several	NULL
stools	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
three	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
sign	NULL
from	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
seated	NULL
ourselves	NULL
,	NULL
Umbopa	NULL
standing	NULL
behind	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
position	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hut	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
we	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
dead	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
concentrated	NULL
gaze	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
eight	NULL
thousand	NULL
pairs	NULL
of	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
somewhat	NULL
trying	NULL
ordeal	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
we	NULL
carried	NULL
it	NULL
off	NULL
as	NULL
best	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
length	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hut	NULL
opened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
gigantic	NULL
figure	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
splendid	NULL
tiger-skin	NULL
karross	NULL
flung	NULL
over	NULL
its	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
stepped	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
followed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
Scragga	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
withered-up	NULL
monkey	NULL
,	NULL
wrapped	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fur	NULL
cloak	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
figure	NULL
seated	NULL
itself	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
stool	NULL
,	NULL
Scragga	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
stand	NULL
behind	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
withered-up	NULL
monkey	NULL
crept	NULL
on	NULL
all	NULL
fours	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
shade	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hut	NULL
and	NULL
squatted	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
gigantic	NULL
figure	NULL
slipped	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
karross	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
up	NULL
before	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
truly	NULL
alarming	NULL
spectacle	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
enormous	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
entirely	NULL
repulsive	NULL
countenance	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
beheld	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
lips	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
thick	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
Negro	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
nose	NULL
was	NULL
flat	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
gleaming	NULL
black	NULL
eye	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
was	NULL
represented	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
hollow	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
whole	NULL
expression	NULL
was	NULL
cruel	NULL
and	NULL
sensual	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
degree	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
head	NULL
rose	NULL
a	NULL
magnificent	NULL
plume	NULL
of	NULL
white	NULL
ostrich	NULL
feathers	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
body	NULL
was	NULL
clad	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
shirt	NULL
of	NULL
shining	NULL
chain	NULL
armour	NULL
,	NULL
whilst	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
waist	NULL
and	NULL
right	NULL
knee	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
garnishes	NULL
of	NULL
white	NULL
ox-tail	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
his	NULL
right	NULL
hand	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
huge	NULL
spear	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
neck	NULL
a	NULL
thick	NULL
torque	NULL
of	NULL
gold	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
bound	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
forehead	NULL
shone	NULL
dully	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
and	NULL
enormous	NULL
uncut	NULL
diamond	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
silence	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
we	NULL
rightly	NULL
guessed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
,	NULL
raised	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
javelin	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

Instantly	NULL
eight	NULL
thousand	NULL
spears	NULL
were	NULL
lifted	NULL
in	NULL
answer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
eight	NULL
thousand	NULL
throats	NULL
rang	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
royal	NULL
salute	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
_	NULL
Koom	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Three	NULL
times	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
repeated	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
each	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
shook	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
noise	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
can	NULL
only	NULL
be	NULL
compared	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
deepest	NULL
notes	NULL
of	NULL
thunder	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Be	NULL
humble	NULL
,	NULL
O	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
piped	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
thin	NULL
voice	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
monkey	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shade	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL

"	NULL
"	NULL

_	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL

boomed	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
eight	NULL

in	NULL

"	NULL

_	NULL
Be	NULL
humble	NULL

O	NULL
people	NULL

_	NULL
"	NULL
Then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
silence	NULL
again	NULL
--	NULL
dead	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
broken	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
soldier	NULL
on	NULL
our	NULL
left	NULL
dropped	NULL
his	NULL
shield	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
fell	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
clatter	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
limestone	NULL
flooring	NULL
.	NULL

Twala	NULL
turned	NULL
his	NULL
one	NULL
cold	NULL
eye	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
noise	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL
hither	NULL
,	NULL
thou	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
fine	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
stepped	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ranks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
thy	NULL
shield	NULL
that	NULL
fell	NULL

thou	NULL
awkward	NULL

thou	NULL
make	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL

What	NULL
hast	NULL

"	NULL

We	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
fellow	NULL
turn	NULL
pale	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
dusky	NULL
skin	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL

he	NULL
murmured	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL

"	NULL

was	NULL
the	NULL

Scragga	NULL

roared	NULL
the	NULL

Scragga	NULL
stepped	NULL
forward	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
ill-favoured	NULL
grin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lifted	NULL
his	NULL
spear	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
poor	NULL
victim	NULL
covered	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
us	NULL

we	NULL
were	NULL
petrified	NULL
with	NULL
horror	NULL

"	NULL
Once	NULL

twice	NULL

he	NULL
waved	NULL
the	NULL
spear	NULL

struck	NULL

right	NULL
home	NULL

the	NULL
spear	NULL
stood	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
foot	NULL

the	NULL
soldier	NULL
's	NULL
back	NULL

He	NULL
flung	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL

dropped	NULL
dead	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
multitude	NULL
about	NULL

rose	NULL
something	NULL

a	NULL
murmur	NULL

it	NULL
rolled	NULL
round	NULL

The	NULL

was	NULL
finished	NULL

there	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
corpse	NULL

and	NULL
we	NULL

up	NULL

I	NULL
handed	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
rifle	NULL

The	NULL

took	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
gingerly	NULL

laid	NULL
it	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
observed	NULL
the	NULL
wizened	NULL
monkey-like	NULL
figure	NULL
creeping	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hut	NULL

It	NULL
crept	NULL
on	NULL
all	NULL

but	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
sat	NULL
it	NULL
rose	NULL
upon	NULL
its	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
throwing	NULL
the	NULL
furry	NULL
covering	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
revealed	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
and	NULL
weird	NULL
countenance	NULL

Apparently	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
great	NULL
age	NULL
so	NULL
shrunken	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
size	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
no	NULL

the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
year-old	NULL

,	NULL
although	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
number	NULL

yellow	NULL
wrinkles	NULL

Set	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL
sunken	NULL
slit	NULL

that	NULL
represented	NULL
the	NULL
mouth	NULL

beneath	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
chin	NULL
curved	NULL
outwards	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
point	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
nose	NULL

the	NULL

might	NULL

it	NULL

large	NULL

still	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
fire	NULL
and	NULL
intelligence	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
gleamed	NULL

played	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
snow-white	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
projecting	NULL
parchment-coloured	NULL
skull	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
jewels	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
charnel-house	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
bare	NULL

and	NULL
yellow	NULL
in	NULL
hue	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
its	NULL
wrinkled	NULL
scalp	NULL
moved	NULL
and	NULL
contracted	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
hood	NULL

a	NULL
cobra	NULL

The	NULL
figure	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
this	NULL

,	NULL
resting	NULL
and	NULL
talking	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
exciting	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
thousand	NULL
watch	NULL
fires	NULL
glowed	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
we	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
tramp	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
feet	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
clashing	NULL
of	NULL
hundreds	NULL
of	NULL
spears	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
regiments	NULL
passed	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
appointed	NULL
places	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
ready	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
dance	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL
moon	NULL
shone	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
splendour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
stood	NULL
watching	NULL
her	NULL
rays	NULL
,	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
arrived	NULL
,	NULL
clad	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
war	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
accompanied	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
guard	NULL
of	NULL
twenty	NULL
men	NULL
to	NULL
escort	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dance	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
recommended	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
donned	NULL
the	NULL
shirts	NULL
of	NULL
chain	NULL
armour	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
putting	NULL
them	NULL
on	NULL
under	NULL
our	NULL
ordinary	NULL
clothing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finding	NULL
to	NULL
our	NULL
surprise	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
neither	NULL
very	NULL
heavy	NULL
nor	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
steel	NULL
shirts	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
evidently	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
for	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
large	NULL
stature	NULL

hung	NULL
somewhat	NULL
loosely	NULL
upon	NULL
Good	NULL

myself	NULL

but	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
's	NULL
fitted	NULL
his	NULL
magnificent	NULL
frame	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
glove	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
strapping	NULL
our	NULL
revolvers	NULL
round	NULL
our	NULL
waists	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
taking	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
hands	NULL
the	NULL
battle-axes	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
armour	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
started	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
arriving	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
kraal	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
been	NULL
received	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
closely	NULL
packed	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
twenty	NULL
thousand	NULL
men	NULL
arranged	NULL
round	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
regiments	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
regiments	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
turn	NULL
divided	NULL
into	NULL
companies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
between	NULL
each	NULL
company	NULL
ran	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
path	NULL
to	NULL
allow	NULL
space	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
witch-finders	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
up	NULL

down	NULL

Anything	NULL
more	NULL
imposing	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL

that	NULL
was	NULL
presented	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
vast	NULL
and	NULL
orderly	NULL
concourse	NULL
of	NULL
armed	NULL
men	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
conceive	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
they	NULL
stood	NULL
perfectly	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL
poured	NULL
her	NULL
light	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL

upon	NULL
their	NULL

waving	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
harmonious	NULL

of	NULL
their	NULL

Wherever	NULL

Quicker	NULL
and	NULL
quicker	NULL
she	NULL
danced	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
lashed	NULL
herself	NULL
into	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
frenzy	NULL
of	NULL
excitement	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
foam	NULL
flew	NULL
in	NULL
specks	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
gnashing	NULL
jaws	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
start	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
flesh	NULL
to	NULL
quiver	NULL
visibly	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
she	NULL
stopped	NULL
dead	NULL
and	NULL
stiffened	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
pointer	NULL
dog	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
scents	NULL
game	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
outstretched	NULL
wand	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
creep	NULL
stealthily	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
soldiers	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
that	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
their	NULL
stoicism	NULL
gave	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
shrank	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
ourselves	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
followed	NULL
her	NULL
movements	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
horrible	NULL
fascination	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
creeping	NULL
and	NULL
crouching	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
dog	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
Isanusi	NULL
_	NULL
was	NULL
before	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
halted	NULL
and	NULL
pointed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
crept	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
pace	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
shriek	NULL
she	NULL
sprang	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
touched	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
warrior	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
forked	NULL
wand	NULL
.	NULL

Instantly	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
comrades	NULL
,	NULL
those	NULL
standing	NULL
immediately	NULL
next	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
seized	NULL
the	NULL
doomed	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
arm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
advanced	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
resist	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
we	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
dragged	NULL
his	NULL
limbs	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
paralysed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
fingers	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
spear	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
limp	NULL
like	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
newly	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
villainous	NULL
executioners	NULL
stepped	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
they	NULL
met	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
executioners	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
for	NULL
orders	NULL

Almost	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
were	NULL
uttered	NULL
the	NULL
horrible	NULL

was	NULL
done	NULL

One	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
driven	NULL
his	NULL

into	NULL
the	NULL
victim	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
assurance	NULL
double	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL

dashed	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
brains	NULL

great	NULL

just	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
Madame	NULL
Defarge	NULL

as	NULL

said	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
was	NULL
dragged	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
paces	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
stretched	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Hardly	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
done	NULL
before	NULL
another	NULL
poor	NULL
wretch	NULL
was	NULL
brought	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
ox	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
slaughter	NULL

This	NULL
time	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL

from	NULL
the	NULL
leopard-skin	NULL
cloak	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
wore	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
of	NULL
rank	NULL
.	NULL

Again	NULL
the	NULL
awful	NULL
syllables	NULL
were	NULL
spoken	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
victim	NULL
fell	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

counted	NULL

And	NULL
so	NULL
the	NULL
deadly	NULL
game	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
bodies	NULL
were	NULL
stretched	NULL
in	NULL
rows	NULL
behind	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
gladiatorial	NULL
shows	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Cæsars	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Spanish	NULL
bull-fights	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
liberty	NULL
of	NULL
doubting	NULL
if	NULL
either	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
half	NULL
so	NULL
horrible	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
Kukuana	NULL
witch-hunt	NULL
.	NULL

Gladiatorial	NULL
shows	NULL
and	NULL
Spanish	NULL
bull-fights	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
contributed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
amusement	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
certainly	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
most	NULL
confirmed	NULL
sensation-monger	NULL
would	NULL
fight	NULL
shy	NULL
of	NULL
sensation	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
cards	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
proper	NULL
person	NULL
,	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL

event	NULL

"	NULL

Once	NULL
we	NULL
rose	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
remonstrate	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
were	NULL
sternly	NULL
repressed	NULL
by	NULL
Twala	NULL

should	NULL

"	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
answer	NULL
vouchsafed	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

About	NULL
half-past	NULL
ten	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pause	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
witch-finders	NULL
gathered	NULL
themselves	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
apparently	NULL
exhausted	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
bloody	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
performance	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
presently	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
our	NULL
surprise	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
ancient	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
Gagool	NULL
,	NULL
rose	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
crouching	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
supporting	NULL
herself	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
stick	NULL
,	NULL
staggered	NULL
off	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
space	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
sight	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
this	NULL
frightful	NULL
vulture-headed	NULL
old	NULL
creature	NULL
,	NULL
bent	NULL
nearly	NULL
double	NULL
with	NULL
extreme	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
gather	NULL
strength	NULL
by	NULL
degrees	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
she	NULL
rushed	NULL
about	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
actively	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
ill-omened	NULL
pupils	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
and	NULL
fro	NULL
she	NULL
ran	NULL
,	NULL
chanting	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
suddenly	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
dash	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
man	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
regiments	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
touched	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
this	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
groan	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
regiment	NULL
which	NULL
evidently	NULL
he	NULL
commanded	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
officers	NULL
seized	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
execution	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
learned	NULL
afterwards	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
great	NULL
wealth	NULL
and	NULL
importance	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
indeed	NULL
a	NULL
cousin	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
slain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Twala	NULL
counted	NULL
one	NULL
hundred	NULL
and	NULL
three	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Gagool	NULL
again	NULL
sprang	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
fro	NULL
,	NULL
gradually	NULL
drawing	NULL
nearer	NULL
and	NULL
nearer	NULL
to	NULL
ourselves	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Hang	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
myself	NULL

when	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
old	NULL
fiend	NULL
dancing	NULL
nearer	NULL
and	NULL
nearer	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
heart	NULL
positively	NULL
sank	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
boots	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
glanced	NULL
behind	NULL
us	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
rows	NULL
of	NULL
corpses	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shivered	NULL
.	NULL

Nearer	NULL
and	NULL
nearer	NULL
waltzed	NULL
Gagool	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
like	NULL

glowing	NULL

nearer	NULL

every	NULL

in	NULL
that	NULL
vast	NULL

watching	NULL
her	NULL
movements	NULL
with	NULL
intense	NULL
anxiety	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
and	NULL
pointed	NULL

"	NULL
Which	NULL

it	NULL

asked	NULL
Sir	NULL

to	NULL
himself	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
all	NULL

at	NULL

for	NULL

without	NULL

Thoroughly	NULL

out	NULL

we	NULL

asleep	NULL

slept	NULL

about	NULL
eleven	NULL

Then	NULL
we	NULL
rose	NULL
,	NULL
washed	NULL

ate	NULL
a	NULL
hearty	NULL
breakfast	NULL

After	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
outside	NULL

walked	NULL
about	NULL

amusing	NULL
ourselves	NULL

Returning	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hut	NULL
we	NULL
ate	NULL
some	NULL
dinner	NULL

passed	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
receiving	NULL
visits	NULL
of	NULL
ceremony	NULL
and	NULL
curiosity	NULL

At	NULL
length	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
set	NULL

and	NULL
we	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
hours	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
quiet	NULL
as	NULL
our	NULL
melancholy	NULL
forebodings	NULL
would	NULL
allow	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

Finally	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
half-past	NULL
eight	NULL

a	NULL
messenger	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL

to	NULL
bid	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
annual	NULL
"	NULL
dance	NULL
of	NULL
girls	NULL
"	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL

be	NULL
celebrated	NULL

Hastily	NULL
we	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
chain	NULL
shirts	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
us	NULL

and	NULL
taking	NULL
our	NULL
rifles	NULL

ammunition	NULL
with	NULL
us	NULL

so	NULL
as	NULL

them	NULL

case	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
fly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
suggested	NULL
by	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
started	NULL
boldly	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
with	NULL
inward	NULL
fear	NULL
and	NULL
trembling	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
great	NULL
space	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
's	NULL
kraal	NULL
bore	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
different	NULL
appearance	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
presented	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
previous	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
grim	NULL
ranks	NULL
of	NULL
serried	NULL
warriors	NULL
were	NULL
company	NULL
after	NULL
company	NULL
of	NULL
Kukuana	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
over-dressed	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
clothing	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
each	NULL
crowned	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
wreath	NULL
of	NULL
flowers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
holding	NULL
a	NULL
palm	NULL
leaf	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL

the	NULL

sat	NULL
Twala	NULL

attended	NULL

the	NULL

twelve	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
also	NULL
present	NULL
about	NULL

amongst	NULL

I	NULL
recognised	NULL

night	NULL

Twala	NULL
greeted	NULL
us	NULL
with	NULL
much	NULL

cordiality	NULL

though	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
fix	NULL

viciously	NULL

now	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL

Never	NULL

an	NULL

Sir	NULL

scarcely	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
the	NULL

crept	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL

assembly	NULL
fixed	NULL
their	NULL
eyes	NULL
upon	NULL

stared	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XII	NULL
BEFORE	NULL
THE	NULL
BATTLE	NULL
Luckily	NULL
for	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
chiefs	NULL
knew	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
paths	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
town	NULL
perfectly	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
passed	NULL
by	NULL
side-ways	NULL
unmolested	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
the	NULL
gloom	NULL
we	NULL
made	NULL
fair	NULL
progress	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
we	NULL
journeyed	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
the	NULL
eclipse	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
disappeared	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
became	NULL
again	NULL
visible	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
watched	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
burst	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
silver	NULL
streak	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
accompanied	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
wondrous	NULL
ruddy	NULL
glow	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
hung	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
blackness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
celestial	NULL
lamp	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
wild	NULL
and	NULL
lovely	NULL
sight	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
another	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
the	NULL
stars	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
fade	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
sufficient	NULL
light	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
our	NULL
whereabouts	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
then	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
clear	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
of	NULL
Loo	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
approaching	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
flat-topped	NULL
hill	NULL
,	NULL
measuring	NULL
some	NULL
two	NULL
miles	NULL
in	NULL
circumference	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
hill	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
formation	NULL
common	NULL
in	NULL
South	NULL
Africa	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
high	NULL
;	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
greatest	NULL
elevation	NULL
is	NULL
scarcely	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
200	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
shaped	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
horseshoe	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
sides	NULL
are	NULL
rather	NULL
precipitous	NULL

strewn	NULL
with	NULL
boulders	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
table-land	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
summit	NULL
is	NULL
ample	NULL
camping-ground	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
utilised	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
military	NULL
cantonment	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
mean	NULL
strength	NULL
.	NULL

Its	NULL
ordinary	NULL
garrison	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
regiment	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
thousand	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
toiled	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
steep	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mountain	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
returning	NULL
moonlight	NULL
we	NULL
perceived	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
several	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
regiments	NULL
encamped	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

Reaching	NULL
the	NULL
table-land	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
found	NULL
crowds	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
roused	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
shivering	NULL
with	NULL
fear	NULL
and	NULL
huddled	NULL
up	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
consternation	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
natural	NULL
phenomenon	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
witnessing	NULL
.	NULL

Passing	NULL
through	NULL
these	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
gained	NULL
a	NULL
hut	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
astonished	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
two	NULL
men	NULL
waiting	NULL
,	NULL
laden	NULL
with	NULL
our	NULL
few	NULL
goods	NULL
and	NULL
chattels	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
behind	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
hasty	NULL
flight	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
explained	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
also	NULL
for	NULL
these	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
lifted	NULL
up	NULL
Good	NULL
's	NULL
long-lost	NULL
trousers	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
an	NULL
exclamation	NULL
of	NULL
rapturous	NULL
delight	NULL
Good	NULL
sprang	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
instantly	NULL
proceeded	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
them	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Surely	NULL
my	NULL
lord	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
hide	NULL
his	NULL
beautiful	NULL
white	NULL
legs	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

exclaimed	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
regretfully	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Good	NULL
persisted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
once	NULL
only	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
Kukuana	NULL
people	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
his	NULL
beautiful	NULL
legs	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Good	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
modest	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

Henceforward	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
satisfy	NULL
their	NULL
æsthetic	NULL
longings	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
one	NULL
whisker	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
transparent	NULL
eye	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
movable	NULL
teeth	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
gazing	NULL
with	NULL
fond	NULL
remembrance	NULL
at	NULL
Good	NULL
's	NULL
trousers	NULL
,	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
next	NULL
informed	NULL
us	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
commanded	NULL
the	NULL
regiments	NULL
to	NULL
muster	NULL
so	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
broke	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
fully	NULL
the	NULL
origin	NULL
and	NULL
circumstances	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rebellion	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
decided	NULL
on	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
chiefs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
introduce	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
the	NULL
rightful	NULL
heir	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
throne	NULL
,	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
.	NULL

Accordingly	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
troops	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
some	NULL
twenty	NULL

men	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
flower	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Kukuana	NULL

--	NULL
were	NULL
mustered	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
open	NULL
space	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
drawn	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
three	NULL
sides	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
dense	NULL
square	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presented	NULL
a	NULL
magnificent	NULL
spectacle	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
took	NULL
our	NULL
station	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
square	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
speedily	NULL
surrounded	NULL
by	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
principal	NULL
chiefs	NULL
and	NULL
officers	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
silence	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
proclaimed	NULL
,	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
proceeded	NULL
to	NULL
address	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
narrated	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
vigorous	NULL
and	NULL
graceful	NULL
language	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
most	NULL
Kukuanas	NULL
of	NULL
high	NULL
rank	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
born	NULL
orator	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
history	NULL
of	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
's	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
basely	NULL
murdered	NULL
by	NULL
Twala	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
and	NULL
child	NULL
driven	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
starve	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
suffered	NULL
and	NULL
groaned	NULL
under	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
cruel	NULL
rule	NULL
,	NULL
instancing	NULL
the	NULL
proceedings	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
previous	NULL
night	NULL

when	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
pretence	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
being	NULL
evil-doers	NULL

many	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL
land	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
dragged	NULL
forth	NULL

wickedly	NULL

Next	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL

led	NULL
him	NULL
over	NULL

That	NULL

seen	NULL
the	NULL
wickedness	NULL

for	NULL
a	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL

assist	NULL
them	NULL

set	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
rightful	NULL

in	NULL
his	NULL

He	NULL
finished	NULL
his	NULL
discourse	NULL
amidst	NULL
a	NULL

approbation	NULL

Then	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
stepped	NULL
forward	NULL

reiterated	NULL
all	NULL

they	NULL
marched	NULL

Half	NULL
an	NULL

afterwards	NULL
we	NULL
held	NULL
a	NULL

of	NULL

at	NULL
which	NULL
all	NULL

Indeed	NULL

we	NULL

about	NULL
twenty	NULL

they	NULL

It	NULL

it	NULL

Speaking	NULL
personally	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
this	NULL
last	NULL
remark	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
mournful	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
gleam	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL

which	NULL
belied	NULL
its	NULL
melancholy	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL

actually	NULL
likes	NULL

After	NULL
this	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL

hours	NULL

so	NULL

Just	NULL
about	NULL
dawn	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
awakened	NULL

who	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL

parties	NULL

in	NULL
our	NULL

We	NULL
rose	NULL

dressed	NULL
ourselves	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL

each	NULL
putting	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL

for	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL

we	NULL
felt	NULL
exceedingly	NULL

Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
went	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL

about	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL

dressed	NULL
himself	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
native	NULL

he	NULL
remarked	NULL

as	NULL
he	NULL
drew	NULL
the	NULL

steel	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL

which	NULL
it	NULL

Nor	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
stop	NULL
there	NULL

At	NULL
his	NULL

him	NULL

Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL

presented	NULL

off	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
advantage	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
arrived	NULL
presently	NULL

arrayed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL

I	NULL
thought	NULL
to	NULL

that	NULL

never	NULL

two	NULL

splendid	NULL
men	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Good	NULL
and	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL
suit	NULL
us	NULL
nearly	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
begin	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
Good	NULL
insisted	NULL
upon	NULL
keeping	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
new-found	NULL
trousers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
stout	NULL

short	NULL
gentleman	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
eye-glass	NULL

and	NULL
one	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
shaved	NULL

arrayed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
mail	NULL
shirt	NULL

carefully	NULL
tucked	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
seedy	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
corduroys	NULL
,	NULL
looks	NULL
more	NULL
remarkable	NULL
than	NULL
imposing	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
my	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
chain	NULL
shirt	NULL
being	NULL
too	NULL
big	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
over	NULL
all	NULL
my	NULL

,	NULL
which	NULL
caused	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
bulge	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
somewhat	NULL
ungainly	NULL

I	NULL
discarded	NULL
my	NULL

,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
retaining	NULL
only	NULL
my	NULL
veldtschoons	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
battle	NULL
with	NULL
bare	NULL
legs	NULL

in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
lighter	NULL
for	NULL

quickly	NULL

a	NULL

that	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

use	NULL

a	NULL

_	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
revolver	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
huge	NULL
plume	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
pinned	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
shooting	NULL

,	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
bloodthirsty	NULL
finish	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
appearance	NULL
,	NULL
completed	NULL
my	NULL
modest	NULL
equipment	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
addition	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
articles	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
our	NULL
rifles	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
ammunition	NULL
was	NULL
scarce	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
useless	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
charge	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
arranged	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
carried	NULL
behind	NULL
us	NULL
by	NULL
bearers	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
equipped	NULL
ourselves	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
swallowed	NULL
some	NULL
food	NULL
hastily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
started	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
one	NULL
point	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
table-land	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mountain	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
koppie	NULL
of	NULL
brown	NULL
stone	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
served	NULL
the	NULL
double	NULL
purpose	NULL
of	NULL
head-quarters	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
conning	NULL
tower	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
we	NULL
found	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
surrounded	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
regiment	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Greys	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
undoubtedly	NULL
the	NULL
finest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Kukuana	NULL
army	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
first	NULL
seen	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
outlying	NULL
kraal	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
regiment	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
three	NULL
thousand	NULL
five	NULL
hundred	NULL
strong	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
held	NULL
in	NULL
reserve	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
lying	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
in	NULL
companies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
's	NULL
forces	NULL
creep	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
Loo	NULL
in	NULL
long	NULL
ant-like	NULL
columns	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
length	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
columns	NULL
--	NULL
three	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL

and	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
numbering	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
judged	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
eleven	NULL
or	NULL
twelve	NULL
thousand	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
clear	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
the	NULL
regiments	NULL
formed	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
one	NULL
body	NULL
marched	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
came	NULL
on	NULL
slowly	NULL
towards	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ah	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
attack	NULL
us	NULL
on	NULL
three	NULL
sides	NULL
at	NULL

This	NULL
seemed	NULL
rather	NULL
serious	NULL

for	NULL
our	NULL
position	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL

But	NULL
since	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
dictate	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
way	NULL
we	NULL

we	NULL
had	NULL

the	NULL

THE	NULL
ATTACK	NULL
Slowly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
appearance	NULL
of	NULL
haste	NULL
or	NULL
excitement	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
columns	NULL
crept	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
within	NULL
about	NULL
five	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
main	NULL

centre	NULL
column	NULL
halted	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
root	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
tongue	NULL
of	NULL
open	NULL
plain	NULL
which	NULL
ran	NULL
up	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL

to	NULL
give	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
divisions	NULL
to	NULL
circumvent	NULL
our	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
shaped	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
horse-shoe	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
two	NULL
points	NULL
facing	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
of	NULL

The	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL

was	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

be	NULL
delivered	NULL
simultaneously	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

This	NULL
piqued	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
loading	NULL
the	NULL
express	NULL
with	NULL
solid	NULL
ball	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
waited	NULL
till	NULL
my	NULL
friend	NULL
walked	NULL
some	NULL
ten	NULL
yards	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
force	NULL

in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL

accompanied	NULL
only	NULL

an	NULL
orderly	NULL

then	NULL
,	NULL
lying	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
resting	NULL
the	NULL
express	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
rock	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
covered	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rifle	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
all	NULL
expresses	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
sighted	NULL
to	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
and	NULL
fifty	NULL
yards	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
to	NULL
allow	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
drop	NULL
in	NULL
trajectory	NULL
I	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
half-way	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
neck	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
ought	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
calculated	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
chest	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
quite	NULL
still	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
me	NULL
every	NULL
opportunity	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
excitement	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL

this	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL

Getting	NULL
dead	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
sight	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
pressed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
puff	NULL
of	NULL
smoke	NULL
had	NULL
cleared	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
disgust	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
my	NULL
man	NULL
standing	NULL
there	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL

three	NULL
paces	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
stretched	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
apparently	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

Turning	NULL
swiftly	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
officer	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
aimed	NULL
at	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
towards	NULL

out	NULL

if	NULL
possible	NULL

it	NULL

When	NULL
a	NULL

is	NULL
master	NULL
of	NULL

one	NULL
art	NULL
he	NULL
likes	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
reputation	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL

Moved	NULL
quite	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
myself	NULL
at	NULL
my	NULL
failure	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
a	NULL
rash	NULL

covering	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
ran	NULL

I	NULL
let	NULL
drive	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL

Instantly	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL

threw	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL

and	NULL
fell	NULL
forward	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL

came	NULL
an	NULL
ominous	NULL

from	NULL
our	NULL

a	NULL
similar	NULL
roar	NULL
rose	NULL
on	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL

the	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
before	NULL
us	NULL
opened	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL

advanced	NULL
towards	NULL

up	NULL
the	NULL

at	NULL
a	NULL
slow	NULL

singing	NULL
a	NULL

kept	NULL
up	NULL

from	NULL
our	NULL

Ignosi	NULL

accounted	NULL

several	NULL

we	NULL
produced	NULL
no	NULL

humanity	NULL

he	NULL
who	NULL

on	NULL

On	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL

the	NULL

driven	NULL

swarms	NULL

Ignosi	NULL

who	NULL

standing	NULL

took	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

at	NULL

issued	NULL

Instantly	NULL
the	NULL
reserve	NULL
regiment	NULL
around	NULL
us	NULL

the	NULL
Greys	NULL

extended	NULL
itself	NULL

Again	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
of	NULL
command	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
repeated	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
captains	NULL

in	NULL
another	NULL
second	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
intense	NULL
disgust	NULL

I	NULL
found	NULL
myself	NULL
involved	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
furious	NULL
onslaught	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL

foe	NULL

Getting	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
behind	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
's	NULL

I	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL

and	NULL
toddled	NULL
along	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
killed	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
I	NULL
liked	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
--	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
plunging	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
flying	NULL
groups	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
re-form	NULL
behind	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
sure	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
remember	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
dreadful	NULL
rolling	NULL
noise	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
meeting	NULL
of	NULL
shields	NULL

the	NULL
sudden	NULL
apparition	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
huge	NULL
ruffian	NULL

whose	NULL
eyes	NULL
seemed	NULL
literally	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
starting	NULL
out	NULL

his	NULL
head	NULL

making	NULL
straight	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
bloody	NULL
spear	NULL

But	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
pride	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
rose	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
sank	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
before	NULL
which	NULL
most	NULL
people	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
collapsed	NULL
once	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL

Seeing	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
stood	NULL
where	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
killed	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
horrid	NULL
apparition	NULL
came	NULL
I	NULL
flung	NULL
myself	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL

him	NULL
so	NULL
cleverly	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
stop	NULL
himself	NULL

he	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
header	NULL
right	NULL
over	NULL

Before	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
rise	NULL
again	NULL

_	NULL
I	NULL
_	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL

settled	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
from	NULL
behind	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
revolver	NULL
.	NULL

Shortly	NULL
after	NULL
this	NULL
somebody	NULL
knocked	NULL
me	NULL
down	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
no	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
came	NULL

I	NULL
found	NULL

back	NULL

The	NULL

Thus	NULL
adjured	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
taking	NULL
hasty	NULL
counsel	NULL
with	NULL
Good	NULL

Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL

I	NULL
delivered	NULL
my	NULL
opinion	NULL
briefly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

being	NULL
trapped	NULL

our	NULL

especially	NULL

was	NULL
to	NULL
initiate	NULL
an	NULL
attack	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
recommended	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
attack	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
delivered	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL

"	NULL
before	NULL
our	NULL
wounds	NULL
grew	NULL

also	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL

Otherwise	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
captains	NULL
might	NULL
change	NULL
their	NULL
minds	NULL

and	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
peace	NULL
with	NULL
Twala	NULL
,	NULL
desert	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
betray	NULL
us	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
expression	NULL
of	NULL
opinion	NULL
seemed	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL

to	NULL
be	NULL
favourably	NULL
received	NULL

indeed	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XIV	NULL
THE	NULL
LAST	NULL
STAND	NULL
OF	NULL
THE	NULL
GREYS	NULL
In	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
more	NULL
minutes	NULL
the	NULL
regiments	NULL
destined	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
flanking	NULL
movements	NULL
had	NULL
tramped	NULL
off	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
keeping	NULL
carefully	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
lee	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rising	NULL
ground	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
conceal	NULL
their	NULL
advance	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
keen	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
scouts	NULL
.	NULL

Half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
was	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
elapse	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
setting	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
horns	NULL
or	NULL
wings	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
army	NULL
before	NULL
any	NULL
stir	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Greys	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
supporting	NULL
regiment	NULL
,	NULL
known	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
Buffaloes	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
formed	NULL
its	NULL
chest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
destined	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
the	NULL
brunt	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
battle	NULL
.	NULL

Both	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
regiments	NULL
were	NULL
almost	NULL
perfectly	NULL
fresh	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
full	NULL
strength	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Greys	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
reserve	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
lost	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
sweeping	NULL
back	NULL
that	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
attack	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
proved	NULL
successful	NULL
in	NULL
breaking	NULL
the	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
defence	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
charged	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
stunned	NULL
for	NULL
my	NULL
pains	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Buffaloes	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
formed	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
defence	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
attacking	NULL
force	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
point	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
breaking	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
scarcely	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
action	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Infadoos	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
wary	NULL
old	NULL
general	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
absolute	NULL
importance	NULL
of	NULL
keeping	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
spirits	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
men	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
eve	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
desperate	NULL
encounter	NULL
,	NULL
employed	NULL
the	NULL
pause	NULL
in	NULL
addressing	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
regiment	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Greys	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
poetical	NULL
language	NULL
:	NULL
explaining	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
the	NULL
honour	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
receiving	NULL
in	NULL
being	NULL
put	NULL
thus	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
forefront	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
battle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
having	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
white	NULL
warrior	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Stars	NULL

fight	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL

their	NULL
ranks	NULL

and	NULL
promising	NULL
large	NULL
rewards	NULL

and	NULL
promotion	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
who	NULL
survived	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
event	NULL
of	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
's	NULL
arms	NULL
being	NULL
successful	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
lines	NULL
of	NULL
waving	NULL
black	NULL
plumes	NULL
and	NULL
stern	NULL
faces	NULL
beneath	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sighed	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
within	NULL
one	NULL
short	NULL
hour	NULL
most	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
magnificent	NULL
veteran	NULL
warriors	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
was	NULL
under	NULL
forty	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
laid	NULL
dead	NULL
or	NULL
dying	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dust	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
otherwise	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
being	NULL
condemned	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
wise	NULL
recklessness	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
life	NULL
which	NULL
marks	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
general	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
often	NULL
saves	NULL
his	NULL
forces	NULL
and	NULL
attains	NULL
his	NULL
ends	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
certain	NULL
slaughter	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
their	NULL
cause	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
remainder	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
army	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
success	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
foredoomed	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
their	NULL
task	NULL
to	NULL
engage	NULL
regiment	NULL
after	NULL
regiment	NULL
of	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
army	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
narrow	NULL
strip	NULL
of	NULL
green	NULL
beneath	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
exterminated	NULL
or	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
wings	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
favourable	NULL
opportunity	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
onslaught	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
they	NULL
never	NULL
hesitated	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
could	NULL
I	NULL
detect	NULL
a	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
fear	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
warrior	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
--	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
certain	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
quit	NULL
the	NULL
blessed	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
day	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
contemplate	NULL
their	NULL
doom	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
tremor	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
contrasting	NULL
their	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
comfortable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
breathing	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
of	NULL
envy	NULL
and	NULL
admiration	NULL
.	NULL

Never	NULL
before	NULL
had	NULL
I	NULL
seen	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
absolute	NULL
devotion	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
complete	NULL
indifference	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
bitter	NULL
fruits	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Behold	NULL
your	NULL
king	NULL

ended	NULL
old	NULL
Infadoos	NULL

pointing	NULL
to	NULL
Ignosi	NULL

"	NULL
go	NULL
fight	NULL

fall	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL

as	NULL
is	NULL

the	NULL

his	NULL

who	NULL

Behold	NULL
your	NULL

Now	NULL
do	NULL
your	NULL
homage	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sacred	NULL
Snake	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
follow	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Incubu	NULL

I	NULL
may	NULL
show	NULL
you	NULL
a	NULL
road	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
of	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL

"	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
's	NULL
pause	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
suddenly	NULL
a	NULL
murmur	NULL
arose	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
serried	NULL
phalanxes	NULL
before	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sound	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
distant	NULL
whisper	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
,	NULL
caused	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
gentle	NULL
tapping	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
handles	NULL
of	NULL
six	NULL
thousand	NULL
spears	NULL
against	NULL
their	NULL
holders	NULL
'	NULL
shields	NULL
.	NULL

Slowly	NULL
it	NULL
swelled	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
its	NULL
growing	NULL
volume	NULL
deepened	NULL
and	NULL
widened	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
roar	NULL
of	NULL
rolling	NULL
noise	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
echoed	NULL
like	NULL
thunder	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
mountains	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
filled	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
with	NULL
heavy	NULL
waves	NULL
of	NULL
sound	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
it	NULL
decreased	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
faint	NULL
degrees	NULL
died	NULL
away	NULL
into	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
suddenly	NULL
out	NULL
crashed	NULL
the	NULL
royal	NULL
salute	NULL
.	NULL

Ignosi	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
to	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
well	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
proud	NULL
man	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
Roman	NULL
emperor	NULL
ever	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
salutation	NULL
from	NULL
gladiators	NULL
"	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Ignosi	NULL
acknowledged	NULL
this	NULL
magnificent	NULL
act	NULL
of	NULL
homage	NULL
by	NULL
lifting	NULL
his	NULL
battle-axe	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
Greys	NULL
filed	NULL
off	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
triple-line	NULL
formation	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
line	NULL
containing	NULL
about	NULL
one	NULL
thousand	NULL
fighting	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
exclusive	NULL
of	NULL
officers	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
companies	NULL
had	NULL
advanced	NULL
some	NULL
five	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
,	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
put	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Buffaloes	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
regiment	NULL
was	NULL
drawn	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
similar	NULL
three-fold	NULL
formation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
to	NULL
march	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
off	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
needless	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
uttering	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
heartfelt	NULL
prayers	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
emerge	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
entertainment	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
whole	NULL
skin	NULL
.	NULL

Many	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
position	NULL
have	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
myself	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
never	NULL
before	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
quite	NULL
so	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
my	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
coming	NULL
off	NULL
safe	NULL
was	NULL
smaller	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
plateau	NULL
the	NULL
Greys	NULL
were	NULL
already	NULL
half-way	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
slope	NULL
ending	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tongue	NULL
of	NULL
grass	NULL
land	NULL
that	NULL
ran	NULL
up	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bend	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mountain	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
frog	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
horse	NULL
's	NULL
foot	NULL
runs	NULL
up	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
shoe	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
excitement	NULL
in	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
camp	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
plain	NULL
beyond	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
great	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
regiment	NULL
after	NULL
regiment	NULL
was	NULL
starting	NULL
forward	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
swinging	NULL
trot	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
reach	NULL
the	NULL
root	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tongue	NULL
of	NULL
land	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
attacking	NULL
force	NULL
could	NULL
emerge	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
plain	NULL
of	NULL
Loo	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
tongue	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
some	NULL
four	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
in	NULL
depth	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
root	NULL
or	NULL
widest	NULL
part	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
six	NULL
hundred	NULL
and	NULL
fifty	NULL
paces	NULL
across	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
tip	NULL
it	NULL
scarcely	NULL
measured	NULL
ninety	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Greys	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
passing	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tip	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tongue	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
formed	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
column	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
reaching	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
broadened	NULL
out	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
reassumed	NULL
their	NULL
triple-line	NULL
formation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
halted	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
we	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Buffaloes	NULL
--	NULL
moved	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
tip	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tongue	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
our	NULL
stand	NULL
in	NULL
reserve	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
one	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Greys	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
slightly	NULL
higher	NULL
ground	NULL
.	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
leisure	NULL
to	NULL
observe	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
entire	NULL
force	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
evidently	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
reinforced	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
attack	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
their	NULL
losses	NULL
,	NULL
number	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
forty	NULL
thousand	NULL
,	NULL
moving	NULL
swiftly	NULL
up	NULL
towards	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
drew	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
root	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tongue	NULL
they	NULL
hesitated	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
regiment	NULL
could	NULL
advance	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
gorge	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
seventy	NULL
yards	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
mouth	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
unassailable	NULL
except	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
walls	NULL
of	NULL
boulder-strewn	NULL
ground	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
the	NULL
famous	NULL
regiment	NULL
of	NULL
Greys	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
pride	NULL
and	NULL
glory	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Kukuana	NULL
army	NULL
,	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
against	NULL
their	NULL
power	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
Romans	NULL
once	NULL
held	NULL
the	NULL
bridge	NULL
against	NULL
thousands	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
hesitated	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finally	NULL
stopped	NULL
their	NULL
advance	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
eagerness	NULL
to	NULL
cross	NULL
spears	NULL
with	NULL
these	NULL
three	NULL
grim	NULL
ranks	NULL
of	NULL
warriors	NULL
who	NULL
stood	NULL
so	NULL
firm	NULL
and	NULL
ready	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
general	NULL
,	NULL
wearing	NULL
the	NULL
customary	NULL
head-dress	NULL
of	NULL
nodding	NULL
ostrich	NULL
plumes	NULL
,	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
attended	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
chiefs	NULL
and	NULL
orderlies	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
none	NULL
other	NULL
than	NULL
Twala	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
gave	NULL
an	NULL
order	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
regiment	NULL
,	NULL
raising	NULL
a	NULL
shout	NULL
,	NULL
charged	NULL
up	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
Greys	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
remained	NULL
perfectly	NULL
still	NULL
and	NULL
silent	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
attacking	NULL
troops	NULL
were	NULL
within	NULL
forty	NULL
yards	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
volley	NULL
of	NULL
_	NULL
tollas	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
throwing-knives	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
rattling	NULL
among	NULL
their	NULL
ranks	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
suddenly	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
bound	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
roar	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
sprang	NULL
forward	NULL
with	NULL
uplifted	NULL
spears	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
regiment	NULL
met	NULL
in	NULL
deadly	NULL
strife	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
second	NULL
the	NULL
roll	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
meeting	NULL
shields	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
our	NULL
ears	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
thunder	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
plain	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
alive	NULL
with	NULL
flashes	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
reflected	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
shimmering	NULL
spears	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
and	NULL
fro	NULL
swung	NULL
the	NULL
surging	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
struggling	NULL
,	NULL
stabbing	NULL
humanity	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
the	NULL
attacking	NULL
lines	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
thinner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
slow	NULL
,	NULL
long	NULL
heave	NULL
the	NULL
Greys	NULL
passed	NULL
over	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
wave	NULL
heaves	NULL
up	NULL
its	NULL
bulk	NULL
and	NULL
passes	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
sunken	NULL
ridge	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
regiment	NULL
was	NULL
completely	NULL
destroyed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
Greys	NULL
had	NULL
but	NULL
two	NULL
lines	NULL
left	NULL
now	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
third	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
number	NULL
were	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

Closing	NULL
up	NULL
shoulder	NULL
to	NULL
shoulder	NULL
,	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
they	NULL
halted	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
and	NULL
awaited	NULL
attack	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
rejoiced	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
's	NULL
yellow	NULL
beard	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
moved	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
fro	NULL
arranging	NULL
the	NULL
ranks	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
yet	NULL
alive	NULL
!	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
we	NULL
moved	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
encounter	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
cumbered	NULL
by	NULL
about	NULL
four	NULL
thousand	NULL
prostrate	NULL
human	NULL
beings	NULL
,	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
dying	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wounded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
literally	NULL
stained	NULL
red	NULL
with	NULL
blood	NULL
.	NULL

Ignosi	NULL
issued	NULL
an	NULL
order	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
rapidly	NULL
passed	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
ranks	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
that	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
enemy	NULL
's	NULL
wounded	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
killed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
this	NULL
command	NULL
was	NULL
scrupulously	NULL
carried	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
shocking	NULL
sight	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
regiment	NULL
,	NULL
distinguished	NULL
by	NULL
white	NULL
plumes	NULL
,	NULL
kilts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shields	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
moving	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
attack	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
thousand	NULL
remaining	NULL
Greys	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
stood	NULL
waiting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
ominous	NULL
silence	NULL
as	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
foe	NULL
was	NULL
within	NULL
forty	NULL
yards	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
hurled	NULL
themselves	NULL
with	NULL
irresistible	NULL
force	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Again	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
awful	NULL
roll	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
meeting	NULL
shields	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
watched	NULL
the	NULL
tragedy	NULL
repeated	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
issue	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
longer	NULL
in	NULL
doubt	NULL
;	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
for	NULL
awhile	NULL
almost	NULL
impossible	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Greys	NULL
should	NULL
again	NULL
prevail	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
attacking	NULL
regiment	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
formed	NULL
of	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
fought	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
fury	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
seemed	NULL
by	NULL
sheer	NULL
weight	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
driving	NULL
the	NULL
veterans	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
slaughter	NULL
was	NULL
truly	NULL
awful	NULL
,	NULL
hundreds	NULL
falling	NULL
every	NULL
minute	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
shouts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
warriors	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
groans	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dying	NULL
,	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
music	NULL
of	NULL
clashing	NULL
spears	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
continuous	NULL
hissing	NULL
undertone	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
_	NULL
S'gee	NULL
,	NULL
s	NULL
'	NULL
gee	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
note	NULL
of	NULL
triumph	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
victor	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
passed	NULL
his	NULL
assegai	NULL
through	NULL
and	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fallen	NULL
foe	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
perfect	NULL
discipline	NULL
and	NULL
steady	NULL
and	NULL
unchanging	NULL
valour	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
wonders	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
veteran	NULL
soldier	NULL
is	NULL
worth	NULL
two	NULL
young	NULL
ones	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
became	NULL
apparent	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
just	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Greys	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
preparing	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
their	NULL
place	NULL
so	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
made	NULL
room	NULL
by	NULL
being	NULL
destroyed	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
's	NULL
deep	NULL
voice	NULL
ringing	NULL
out	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
din	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
caught	NULL
a	NULL
glimpse	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
circling	NULL
battle-axe	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
waved	NULL
it	NULL
high	NULL
above	NULL
his	NULL
plumes	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
Greys	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
rock	NULL
,	NULL
against	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
furious	NULL
waves	NULL
of	NULL
spearmen	NULL
broke	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
recoil	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
they	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
--	NULL
forward	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
;	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
firearms	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
smoke	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Another	NULL
minute	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
onslaught	NULL
grew	NULL
fainter	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ah	NULL
,	NULL
these	NULL
are	NULL
_	NULL
men	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
will	NULL
conquer	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
called	NULL
out	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
grinding	NULL
his	NULL
teeth	NULL
with	NULL
excitement	NULL
at	NULL
my	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
See	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
done	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
puffs	NULL
of	NULL
smoke	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
mouth	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cannon	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
attacking	NULL
regiment	NULL
broke	NULL
away	NULL
in	NULL
flying	NULL
groups	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
white	NULL
head-dresses	NULL
streaming	NULL
behind	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
their	NULL
opponents	NULL
victors	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
alas	NULL
!	NULL

no	NULL
more	NULL
a	NULL
regiment	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
the	NULL
gallant	NULL
triple	NULL
line	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
forty	NULL
minutes	NULL
before	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
into	NULL
action	NULL
three	NULL
thousand	NULL
strong	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
remained	NULL
at	NULL
most	NULL
some	NULL
six	NULL
hundred	NULL
blood-spattered	NULL
men	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
were	NULL
under	NULL
foot	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
they	NULL
cheered	NULL
and	NULL
waved	NULL
their	NULL
spears	NULL
in	NULL
triumph	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
falling	NULL
back	NULL
upon	NULL
us	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
ran	NULL
forward	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
flying	NULL
groups	NULL
of	NULL
foemen	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
rising	NULL
knoll	NULL
of	NULL
ground	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
resuming	NULL
their	NULL
triple	NULL
formation	NULL
,	NULL
formed	NULL
a	NULL
threefold	NULL
ring	NULL
around	NULL
its	NULL
base	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
thanks	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
Heaven	NULL
,	NULL
standing	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mound	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
,	NULL
apparently	NULL
unharmed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
our	NULL
old	NULL
friend	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
regiments	NULL
rolled	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
doomed	NULL
band	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
the	NULL
battle	NULL
closed	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
read	NULL
this	NULL
history	NULL
will	NULL
probably	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
have	NULL
gathered	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
honest	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
coward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
certainly	NULL
in	NULL
no	NULL
way	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
fighting	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
somehow	NULL
it	NULL
has	NULL
often	NULL
been	NULL
my	NULL
lot	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
into	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
positions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
shed	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
blood	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
always	NULL
hated	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
kept	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
blood	NULL
as	NULL
undiminished	NULL
in	NULL
quantity	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
sometimes	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
judicious	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
heels	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
my	NULL
bosom	NULL
burn	NULL
with	NULL
martial	NULL
ardour	NULL
.	NULL

Warlike	NULL
fragments	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Ingoldsby	NULL
Legends	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
together	NULL
with	NULL
numbers	NULL
of	NULL
sanguinary	NULL
verses	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Old	NULL
Testament	NULL
,	NULL
sprang	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
brain	NULL
like	NULL
mushrooms	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
;	NULL
my	NULL
blood	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
hitherto	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
half-frozen	NULL
with	NULL
horror	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
beating	NULL
through	NULL
my	NULL
veins	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
upon	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
savage	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
kill	NULL
and	NULL
spare	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
glanced	NULL
round	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
serried	NULL
ranks	NULL
of	NULL
warriors	NULL
behind	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
somehow	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
wonder	NULL
if	NULL
my	NULL
face	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
theirs	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
they	NULL
stood	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
twitching	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
lips	NULL
apart	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
fierce	NULL
features	NULL
instinct	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
hungry	NULL
lust	NULL
of	NULL
battle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
glare	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bloodhound	NULL
when	NULL
after	NULL
long	NULL
pursuit	NULL
he	NULL
sights	NULL
his	NULL
quarry	NULL
.	NULL

Only	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
judge	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
comparative	NULL
self-possession	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
appearances	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
beat	NULL
as	NULL
calmly	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
beneath	NULL
his	NULL
leopard-skin	NULL
cloak	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
even	NULL
_	NULL
he	NULL
_	NULL
still	NULL
ground	NULL
his	NULL
teeth	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
bear	NULL
it	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL

stand	NULL
here	NULL
till	NULL

"	NULL

I	NULL
asked	NULL

"	NULL
Nay	NULL
,	NULL
Macumazahn	NULL

"	NULL

the	NULL
answer	NULL

"	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
a	NULL
fresh	NULL
regiment	NULL
rushed	NULL
past	NULL
the	NULL
ring	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
mound	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wheeling	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
attacked	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
hither	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
lifting	NULL
his	NULL
battle-axe	NULL
,	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
signal	NULL
to	NULL
advance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
screaming	NULL
the	NULL
wild	NULL
Kukuana	NULL
war-cry	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Buffaloes	NULL
charged	NULL
home	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
rush	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
rush	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
followed	NULL
immediately	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
power	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
remember	NULL
is	NULL
an	NULL
irregular	NULL
yet	NULL
ordered	NULL
advance	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
shake	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
front	NULL
and	NULL
forming	NULL
up	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
regiment	NULL
against	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
charge	NULL
was	NULL
directed	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
an	NULL
awful	NULL
shock	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
dull	NULL
roar	NULL
of	NULL
voices	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
continuous	NULL
flashing	NULL
of	NULL
spears	NULL
,	NULL
seen	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
red	NULL
mist	NULL
of	NULL
blood	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
cleared	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
myself	NULL
standing	NULL
inside	NULL
the	NULL
remnant	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Greys	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mound	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
behind	NULL
no	NULL
less	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
than	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
there	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
afterwards	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
borne	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
furious	NULL
charge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Buffaloes	NULL
almost	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
in	NULL
turn	NULL
were	NULL
pressed	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

Thereon	NULL
he	NULL
dashed	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
circle	NULL

dragged	NULL
me	NULL
into	NULL
shelter	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
fight	NULL
that	NULL
followed	NULL

who	NULL
can	NULL

it	NULL

Again	NULL

again	NULL
the	NULL
multitudes	NULL
surged	NULL
against	NULL
our	NULL
momentarily	NULL
lessening	NULL
circle	NULL

and	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
we	NULL
beat	NULL
them	NULL
back	NULL

"	NULL

that	NULL
his	NULL

him	NULL

Time	NULL

I	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
sweeping	NULL
down	NULL

as	NULL
some	NULL
great	NULL

ventured	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL

But	NULL
suddenly	NULL
there	NULL

a	NULL

out	NULL

he	NULL
shouted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
hurled	NULL
a	NULL
_	NULL
tolla	NULL
_	NULL
straight	NULL
at	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
fortunately	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
coming	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
caught	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
shield	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
transfixed	NULL
,	NULL
remaining	NULL
wedged	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

behind	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
cry	NULL
,	NULL
Twala	NULL
sprang	NULL
forward	NULL
straight	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
battle-axe	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
blow	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
shield	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
mere	NULL
force	NULL

Henry	NULL

strong	NULL

down	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
went	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
instant	NULL
there	NULL
rose	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
regiments	NULL
pressing	NULL
round	NULL
us	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
shout	NULL
of	NULL
dismay	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
looking	NULL
up	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
cause	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
plain	NULL
was	NULL
alive	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
plumes	NULL
of	NULL
charging	NULL
warriors	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
outflanking	NULL
squadrons	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
our	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
time	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
better	NULL
chosen	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
army	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
predicted	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
fixed	NULL
their	NULL
attention	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bloody	NULL
struggle	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
raging	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
remnant	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Greys	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Buffaloes	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
now	NULL
carrying	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
battle	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
distance	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
two	NULL
regiments	NULL
had	NULL
formed	NULL
the	NULL
chest	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
army	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
until	NULL
our	NULL
horns	NULL
were	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
close	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
dreamed	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
approach	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
believed	NULL
these	NULL
forces	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
hidden	NULL
in	NULL
reserve	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
crest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
moon-shaped	NULL
hill	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
even	NULL
assume	NULL
a	NULL
proper	NULL
formation	NULL
for	NULL
defence	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
outflanking	NULL
_	NULL
Impis	NULL
_	NULL
had	NULL
leapt	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
greyhounds	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
flanks	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
the	NULL
fate	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
battle	NULL
was	NULL
decided	NULL
.	NULL

Taken	NULL
on	NULL
both	NULL
flanks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dismayed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
awful	NULL
slaughter	NULL
inflicted	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Greys	NULL
and	NULL
Buffaloes	NULL
,	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
regiments	NULL
broke	NULL
into	NULL
flight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
plain	NULL
between	NULL
us	NULL
and	NULL
Loo	NULL
was	NULL
scattered	NULL
with	NULL
groups	NULL
of	NULL
running	NULL
soldiers	NULL
making	NULL
good	NULL
their	NULL
retreat	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
hosts	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
recently	NULL
surrounded	NULL
us	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Buffaloes	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
melted	NULL
away	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
by	NULL
magic	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
left	NULL
standing	NULL
there	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
rock	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
has	NULL
retreated	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
sight	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
!	NULL

Around	NULL
us	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
and	NULL
dying	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
heaped-up	NULL
masses	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
gallant	NULL
Greys	NULL
there	NULL
remained	NULL
but	NULL
ninety-five	NULL
men	NULL
upon	NULL
their	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

More	NULL
than	NULL
three	NULL
thousand	NULL
four	NULL
hundred	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
one	NULL
regiment	NULL
,	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
rise	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Men	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
calmly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
intervals	NULL
of	NULL
binding	NULL
a	NULL
wound	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
he	NULL
surveyed	NULL
what	NULL
remained	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
corps	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
ye	NULL
have	NULL
kept	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
reputation	NULL
of	NULL
your	NULL

and	NULL
this	NULL

's	NULL

will	NULL
be	NULL
well	NULL
spoken	NULL

by	NULL
your	NULL
children	NULL
's	NULL

"	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
and	NULL
shook	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
Curtis	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Thou	NULL
art	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
captain	NULL

Incubu	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
simply	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
lived	NULL

yet	NULL

I	NULL

"	NULL

At	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
Buffaloes	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
march	NULL
past	NULL
our	NULL
position	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
to	NULL
Loo	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
a	NULL
message	NULL
was	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
from	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
requesting	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
,	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
myself	NULL
to	NULL
join	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Accordingly	NULL
,	NULL
orders	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
issued	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
remaining	NULL
ninety	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Greys	NULL
to	NULL
employ	NULL
themselves	NULL
in	NULL
collecting	NULL
the	NULL
wounded	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
joined	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
informed	NULL
us	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
pressing	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
Loo	NULL
to	NULL
complete	NULL
the	NULL
victory	NULL
by	NULL
capturing	NULL
Twala	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
that	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
we	NULL
discovered	NULL
the	NULL
figure	NULL
of	NULL
Good	NULL
sitting	NULL
on	NULL
an	NULL
ant-heap	NULL
about	NULL
one	NULL
hundred	NULL
paces	NULL
from	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

Close	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Kukuana	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
wounded	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
anxiously	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
remark	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
untoward	NULL
thing	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dead	NULL
body	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Kukuana	NULL
soldier	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
dead	NULL
body	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
sprang	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
knocked	NULL
Good	NULL
head	NULL
over	NULL
heels	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
ant-heap	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
spear	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
rushed	NULL
forward	NULL
in	NULL
terror	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
drew	NULL
near	NULL
we	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
brawny	NULL
warrior	NULL
making	NULL
dig	NULL
after	NULL
dig	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
prostrate	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
at	NULL
each	NULL
prod	NULL
jerked	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
limbs	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

Seeing	NULL
us	NULL
coming	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Kukuana	NULL
gave	NULL
one	NULL
final	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
vicious	NULL
dig	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
shout	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
Take	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
wizard	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

bolted	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Good	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
move	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
concluded	NULL
that	NULL
our	NULL
poor	NULL
comrade	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

Sadly	NULL
we	NULL
came	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
astonished	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
him	NULL
pale	NULL
and	NULL
faint	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
serene	NULL
smile	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
eyeglass	NULL
still	NULL
fixed	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eye	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Capital	NULL
armour	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
murmured	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
catching	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
faces	NULL
bending	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
sold	NULL
that	NULL
beggar	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
fainted	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
examination	NULL
we	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
seriously	NULL
wounded	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
leg	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
_	NULL
tolla	NULL
_	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pursuit	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
chain	NULL
armour	NULL
had	NULL
prevented	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
assailant	NULL
's	NULL
spear	NULL
from	NULL
doing	NULL
anything	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
bruise	NULL
him	NULL
badly	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
merciful	NULL
escape	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
nothing	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
placed	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wicker	NULL
shields	NULL
used	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
wounded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
carried	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
arriving	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
nearest	NULL
gate	NULL
of	NULL
Loo	NULL
we	NULL
found	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
regiments	NULL
watching	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
obedience	NULL
to	NULL
orders	NULL
received	NULL
from	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
other	NULL
regiments	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
way	NULL
guarding	NULL
the	NULL
different	NULL
exits	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
officer	NULL
in	NULL
command	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
regiment	NULL
saluted	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
as	NULL
king	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
informed	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
army	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
refuge	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
whither	NULL
Twala	NULL
himself	NULL
had	NULL
also	NULL
escaped	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
demoralised	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
surrender	NULL
.	NULL

Thereupon	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
taking	NULL
counsel	NULL
with	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
sent	NULL
forward	NULL
heralds	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
gate	NULL
ordering	NULL
the	NULL
defenders	NULL
to	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
promising	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
royal	NULL
word	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
forgiveness	NULL
to	NULL
every	NULL
soldier	NULL
who	NULL
laid	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
before	NULL
nightfall	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
certainly	NULL
burn	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
within	NULL
its	NULL
gates	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
message	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
its	NULL
effect	NULL
.	NULL

Half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
shouts	NULL
and	NULL
cheers	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Buffaloes	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
bridge	NULL
was	NULL
dropped	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
fosse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
gates	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
further	NULL
side	NULL
were	NULL
flung	NULL
open	NULL
.	NULL

Taking	NULL
due	NULL
precautions	NULL
against	NULL
treachery	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
marched	NULL
on	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
roadways	NULL
stood	NULL
thousands	NULL
of	NULL
dejected	NULL
warriors	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
drooping	NULL

and	NULL
their	NULL
shields	NULL

spears	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
headed	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
officers	NULL
,	NULL
saluted	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
as	NULL
king	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
passed	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
we	NULL
marched	NULL
,	NULL
straight	NULL
to	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
kraal	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
we	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
space	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
previously	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
the	NULL

found	NULL

Twala	NULL

I	NULL

The	NULL
ex-king	NULL
laughed	NULL
savagely	NULL

stepping	NULL
forward	NULL
faced	NULL
Curtis	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
they	NULL
stood	NULL
thus	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sinking	NULL
sun	NULL
caught	NULL
their	NULL
stalwart	NULL
frames	NULL

clothed	NULL
them	NULL
both	NULL
in	NULL
fire	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
well-matched	NULL
pair	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
circle	NULL
round	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
battle-axes	NULL
raised	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
sprang	NULL
forward	NULL
and	NULL
struck	NULL
a	NULL
fearful	NULL
blow	NULL
at	NULL
Twala	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
stepped	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
heavy	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
stroke	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
striker	NULL
half	NULL
overbalanced	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
circumstance	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
antagonist	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
prompt	NULL
advantage	NULL
.	NULL

Circling	NULL
his	NULL
massive	NULL
battle-axe	NULL
round	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
brought	NULL
it	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
tremendous	NULL
force	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
heart	NULL
jumped	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
mouth	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
finished	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
no	NULL
;	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
upward	NULL
movement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
arm	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
interposed	NULL
his	NULL
shield	NULL
between	NULL
himself	NULL

the	NULL
axe	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
that	NULL
its	NULL
outer	NULL

was	NULL
shorn	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
axe	NULL
falling	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
left	NULL
shoulder	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
heavily	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
any	NULL
serious	NULL
damage	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
another	NULL
moment	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
got	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
blow	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
received	NULL
by	NULL
Twala	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
shield	NULL

Then	NULL
followed	NULL
blow	NULL
upon	NULL

that	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
turn	NULL
,	NULL
either	NULL
received	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL

avoided	NULL

The	NULL
excitement	NULL
grew	NULL
intense	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
regiment	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
encounter	NULL
forgot	NULL
its	NULL
discipline	NULL
,	NULL

,	NULL
drawing	NULL
near	NULL
,	NULL
shouted	NULL

groaned	NULL
at	NULL
every	NULL
stroke	NULL

Just	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL

too	NULL

Good	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
laid	NULL

me	NULL

recovered	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
faint	NULL

and	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
perceived	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
catching	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
arm	NULL
,	NULL
hopped	NULL
about	NULL
from	NULL
place	NULL
to	NULL
place	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
leg	NULL
,	NULL
dragging	NULL
me	NULL
after	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
yelling	NULL
encouragements	NULL
to	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL

so	NULL
on	NULL

Presently	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
caught	NULL
a	NULL
fresh	NULL
stroke	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
shield	NULL
,	NULL
hit	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
force	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
blow	NULL
cut	NULL
through	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
shield	NULL
and	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
tough	NULL
chain	NULL
armour	NULL
behind	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
gashing	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shoulder	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
yell	NULL
of	NULL
pain	NULL
and	NULL
fury	NULL
Twala	NULL
returned	NULL
the	NULL
blow	NULL
with	NULL
interest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
strength	NULL
,	NULL
shore	NULL
right	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
rhinoceros	NULL
'	NULL
horn	NULL

of	NULL
his	NULL
antagonists	NULL

strengthened	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
bands	NULL
of	NULL
steel	NULL
,	NULL
wounding	NULL
Curtis	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
cry	NULL
of	NULL
dismay	NULL
rose	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Buffaloes	NULL
as	NULL
our	NULL
hero	NULL
's	NULL
broad	NULL
axe-head	NULL
fell	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Twala	NULL
,	NULL
again	NULL
raising	NULL
his	NULL
weapon	NULL
,	NULL
flew	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
shout	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
shut	NULL
my	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
opened	NULL
them	NULL
again	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
's	NULL

lying	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL

Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
great	NULL
arms	NULL
twined	NULL
round	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
middle	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
and	NULL
fro	NULL
they	NULL
swung	NULL
,	NULL
hugging	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
like	NULL
bears	NULL
,	NULL
straining	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
their	NULL
mighty	NULL
muscles	NULL
for	NULL
dear	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
supreme	NULL
effort	NULL
Twala	NULL
swung	NULL
the	NULL
Englishman	NULL
clean	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
rolling	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
lime	NULL
paving	NULL

Twala	NULL
striking	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
Curtis	NULL

_	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
drawn	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
belt	NULL
through	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
armour	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mighty	NULL
struggle	NULL

and	NULL
an	NULL
awful	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Get	NULL

axe	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

yelled	NULL
Good	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
our	NULL
champion	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
dropping	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
tolla	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
snatched	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
axe	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
fastened	NULL
to	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
wrist	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
strip	NULL
of	NULL
buffalo	NULL
hide	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
rolling	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
fought	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
like	NULL
wild	NULL
cats	NULL
,	NULL
drawing	NULL
their	NULL
breath	NULL
in	NULL
heavy	NULL
gasps	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
the	NULL
hide	NULL
string	NULL
burst	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
effort	NULL
,	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
freed	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
weapon	NULL
remaining	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

Another	NULL
second	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
red	NULL
blood	NULL
streaming	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
wound	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL

and	NULL
so	NULL
was	NULL
Twala	NULL
.	NULL

Drawing	NULL
the	NULL
heavy	NULL
_	NULL
tolla	NULL
_	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
belt	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
reeled	NULL
straight	NULL
at	NULL
Curtis	NULL
and	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
breast	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
stab	NULL
came	NULL
home	NULL
true	NULL
and	NULL
strong	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
whoever	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
who	NULL
made	NULL
that	NULL
chain	NULL

,	NULL
he	NULL
understood	NULL
his	NULL
art	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
withstood	NULL
the	NULL
steel	NULL
.	NULL

Again	NULL
Twala	NULL
struck	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
savage	NULL
yell	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
sharp	NULL
knife	NULL
rebounded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
went	NULL
staggering	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
more	NULL
Twala	NULL
came	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
our	NULL
great	NULL
Englishman	NULL
gathered	NULL
himself	NULL

swinging	NULL
the	NULL

round	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL
shriek	NULL
of	NULL
excitement	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
thousand	NULL
throats	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
behold	NULL
!	NULL

Twala	NULL
's	NULL
head	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
spring	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
:	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
fell	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
rolling	NULL
and	NULL
bounding	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
towards	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
,	NULL
stopping	NULL
just	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
the	NULL
corpse	NULL
stood	NULL
upright	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
dull	NULL
crash	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
gold	NULL
torque	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
neck	NULL
rolled	NULL
away	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
pavement	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
,	NULL
overpowered	NULL
by	NULL
faintness	NULL
and	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
blood	NULL
,	NULL
fell	NULL
heavily	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
king	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
lifted	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
eager	NULL
hands	NULL
were	NULL
pouring	NULL
water	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

Another	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
grey	NULL
eyes	NULL
opened	NULL
wide	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
sank	NULL
,	NULL
stepping	NULL
to	NULL
where	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
head	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dust	NULL
,	NULL
unloosed	NULL
the	NULL
diamond	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL

handed	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Ignosi	NULL

Ignosi	NULL
bound	NULL
the	NULL
diadem	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
brows	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
advancing	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
placed	NULL
his	NULL
foot	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
broad	NULL
chest	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
headless	NULL
foe	NULL
and	NULL
broke	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
chant	NULL

or	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
pæan	NULL
of	NULL
triumph	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
beautiful	NULL

yet	NULL
so	NULL
utterly	NULL
savage	NULL

that	NULL
I	NULL
despair	NULL

able	NULL

give	NULL
an	NULL
adequate	NULL
version	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL

Once	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
scholar	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
voice	NULL
read	NULL
aloud	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

to	NULL
make	NULL
my	NULL

still	NULL

A.Q.	NULL
CHAPTER	NULL
XV	NULL
GOOD	NULL
FALLS	NULL
SICK	NULL
After	NULL
the	NULL
fight	NULL
was	NULL
ended	NULL
,	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
and	NULL
Good	NULL
were	NULL
carried	NULL
into	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
hut	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
I	NULL
joined	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
both	NULL
utterly	NULL
exhausted	NULL
by	NULL
exertion	NULL
and	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
blood	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
condition	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
very	NULL
wiry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
can	NULL
stand	NULL
more	NULL
fatigue	NULL
than	NULL
most	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
probably	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
light	NULL
weight	NULL
and	NULL
long	NULL
training	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
done	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
is	NULL
always	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
when	NULL
exhausted	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
old	NULL
wound	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
lion	NULL
gave	NULL
me	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
pain	NULL
.	NULL

Also	NULL
my	NULL
head	NULL
was	NULL
aching	NULL
violently	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
blow	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
received	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
knocked	NULL
senseless	NULL
.	NULL

Altogether	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
miserable	NULL
trio	NULL
than	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
discover	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
our	NULL
only	NULL
comfort	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
reflection	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
fortunate	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
miserable	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
stretched	NULL
dead	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
plain	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
thousands	NULL
of	NULL
brave	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
well	NULL
and	NULL
strong	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

Somehow	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
assistance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
Foulata	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
saving	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
constituted	NULL
herself	NULL
our	NULL
handmaiden	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
especially	NULL
Good	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
chain	NULL
shirts	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
certainly	NULL
saved	NULL
the	NULL
lives	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
flesh	NULL
underneath	NULL
was	NULL
terribly	NULL
contused	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
steel	NULL
links	NULL
had	NULL
kept	NULL
the	NULL
weapons	NULL
from	NULL
entering	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
prevented	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
bruising	NULL
.	NULL

Both	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
and	NULL
Good	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
contusions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL
means	NULL
free	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
a	NULL
remedy	NULL
Foulata	NULL
brought	NULL
us	NULL
some	NULL
pounded	NULL
green	NULL
leaves	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
aromatic	NULL
odour	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
applied	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
plaster	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
us	NULL
considerable	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
bruises	NULL
were	NULL
painful	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
give	NULL
us	NULL
such	NULL
anxiety	NULL
as	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
's	NULL
and	NULL
Good	NULL
's	NULL
wounds	NULL
.	NULL

Good	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
hole	NULL
right	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
fleshy	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
"	NULL
beautiful	NULL
white	NULL
leg	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
blood	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
other	NULL
hurts	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
cut	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
jaw	NULL
,	NULL
inflicted	NULL
by	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
battle-axe	NULL
.	NULL

Luckily	NULL
Good	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
decent	NULL
surgeon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
small	NULL
box	NULL
of	NULL
medicines	NULL
was	NULL
forthcoming	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
cleansed	NULL
the	NULL
wounds	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
stitch	NULL
up	NULL
first	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
's	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
pretty	NULL
satisfactorily	NULL
,	NULL
considering	NULL
the	NULL
imperfect	NULL
light	NULL
given	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
primitive	NULL
Kukuana	NULL
lamp	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hut	NULL
.	NULL

Afterwards	NULL
he	NULL
plentifully	NULL
smeared	NULL
the	NULL
injured	NULL
places	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
antiseptic	NULL
ointment	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pot	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
box	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
covered	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
remains	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
pocket-handkerchief	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
possessed	NULL
.	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
Foulata	NULL
had	NULL
prepared	NULL
us	NULL
some	NULL
strong	NULL
broth	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
weary	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
we	NULL
swallowed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
threw	NULL
ourselves	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
piles	NULL
of	NULL
magnificent	NULL
karrosses	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
fur	NULL
rugs	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
scattered	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
king	NULL
's	NULL
great	NULL
hut	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
strange	NULL
instance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
irony	NULL
of	NULL
fate	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
own	NULL
couch	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wrapped	NULL
in	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
own	NULL
particular	NULL
karross	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
slain	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
slept	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
say	NULL
slept	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
sleep	NULL
was	NULL
indeed	NULL
difficult	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
begin	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
very	NULL
truth	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
"	NULL
Of	NULL
farewells	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dying	NULL
And	NULL
mournings	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

From	NULL
every	NULL
direction	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wailing	NULL
of	NULL
women	NULL
whose	NULL
husbands	NULL

brothers	NULL
had	NULL
perished	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
battle	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
wonder	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
wailed	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
over	NULL
twelve	NULL
thousand	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
nearly	NULL
a	NULL
fifth	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Kukuana	NULL
army	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
destroyed	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
awful	NULL
struggle	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
heart-rending	NULL
to	NULL
lie	NULL
and	NULL
listen	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
cries	NULL
for	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
never	NULL
would	NULL
return	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
me	NULL
understand	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL
horror	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
done	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
further	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
ambition	NULL
.	NULL

Towards	NULL
midnight	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
ceaseless	NULL
crying	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
grew	NULL
less	NULL
frequent	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
broken	NULL
at	NULL
intervals	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
piercing	NULL
howl	NULL
that	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
hut	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
immediate	NULL
rear	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
afterwards	NULL
discovered	NULL
,	NULL
proceeded	NULL
from	NULL
Gagool	NULL
"	NULL
keening	NULL
"	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
king	NULL
Twala	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
fitful	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
wake	NULL
from	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
time	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
start	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
an	NULL
actor	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
terrible	NULL
events	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
twenty-four	NULL
hours	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
I	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
warrior	NULL
whom	NULL
my	NULL
hand	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
account	NULL
charging	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
mountain-top	NULL
;	NULL
now	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
glorious	NULL
ring	NULL
of	NULL
Greys	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
its	NULL
immortal	NULL
stand	NULL
against	NULL
all	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
regiments	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
mound	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
again	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
plumed	NULL
and	NULL
gory	NULL
head	NULL
roll	NULL
past	NULL
my	NULL
feet	NULL
with	NULL
gnashing	NULL
teeth	NULL
and	NULL
glaring	NULL
eye	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
somehow	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
passed	NULL
away	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
dawn	NULL
broke	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
companions	NULL
had	NULL
slept	NULL
no	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL

Good	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
high	NULL
fever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
soon	NULL
afterwards	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
light-headed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
alarm	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
spit	NULL
blood	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
internal	NULL
injury	NULL
,	NULL
inflicted	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
desperate	NULL
efforts	NULL
made	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Kukuana	NULL
warrior	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
previous	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
force	NULL
his	NULL
big	NULL
spear	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
chain	NULL
armour	NULL
.	NULL

Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
pretty	NULL
fresh	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
his	NULL
wound	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
eating	NULL
difficult	NULL
and	NULL
laughter	NULL
an	NULL
impossibility	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
sore	NULL
and	NULL
stiff	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
scarcely	NULL
stir	NULL
.	NULL

About	NULL
eight	NULL
o'clock	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
visit	NULL
from	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
appeared	NULL
but	NULL
little	NULL
the	NULL
worse	NULL
--	NULL
tough	NULL
old	NULL
warrior	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
exertions	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
battle	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
he	NULL
informed	NULL
us	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
delighted	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
much	NULL
grieved	NULL
at	NULL
Good	NULL
's	NULL
condition	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shook	NULL
our	NULL
hands	NULL
cordially	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
noticed	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
addressed	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
reverence	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
something	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
man	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
afterwards	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
Englishman	NULL
was	NULL
looked	NULL
on	NULL
throughout	NULL
Kukuanaland	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
supernatural	NULL
being	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
soldiers	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
fought	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
fought	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
toil	NULL
and	NULL
bloodshed	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
slain	NULL
Twala	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
addition	NULL
to	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
strongest	NULL
warrior	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
single	NULL
combat	NULL
,	NULL
shearing	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
bull-neck	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
stroke	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
stroke	NULL
became	NULL
proverbial	NULL
in	NULL
Kukuanaland	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
any	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
blow	NULL
or	NULL
feat	NULL
of	NULL
strength	NULL
was	NULL
henceforth	NULL
known	NULL
as	NULL
"	NULL
Incubu	NULL
's	NULL
blow	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Infadoos	NULL
told	NULL
us	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
regiments	NULL
had	NULL
submitted	NULL
to	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
like	NULL
submissions	NULL
were	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
arrive	NULL
from	NULL
chiefs	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
outlying	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

Twala	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
further	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
disturbance	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
Scragga	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
only	NULL
legitimate	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
rival	NULL
claimant	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
throne	NULL
left	NULL
alive	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
remarked	NULL
that	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
had	NULL
swum	NULL
to	NULL
power	NULL
through	NULL
blood	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
chief	NULL
shrugged	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
Kukuana	NULL
people	NULL
can	NULL
only	NULL
be	NULL
kept	NULL
cool	NULL
by	NULL
letting	NULL
their	NULL
blood	NULL
flow	NULL
sometimes	NULL
.	NULL

Many	NULL
are	NULL
killed	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
are	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
others	NULL
must	NULL
soon	NULL
grow	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
places	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fallen	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
this	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
quiet	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
visit	NULL
from	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
whose	NULL
brows	NULL
the	NULL
royal	NULL
diadem	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
bound	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
contemplated	NULL
him	NULL
advancing	NULL
with	NULL
kingly	NULL
dignity	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
obsequious	NULL
guard	NULL
following	NULL
his	NULL
steps	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
recalling	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
the	NULL
tall	NULL
Zulu	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
presented	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
at	NULL
Durban	NULL
some	NULL
few	NULL
months	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
asking	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
into	NULL
our	NULL
service	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
reflecting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
strange	NULL
revolutions	NULL

the	NULL
wheel	NULL
of	NULL
fortune	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Hail	NULL

O	NULL
king	NULL

I	NULL
said	NULL

rising	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

was	NULL
the	NULL
ready	NULL
answer	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
going	NULL
well	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
hoped	NULL
to	NULL
arrange	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
feast	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL
weeks	NULL
'	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL

I	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
settled	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
Gagool	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
evil	NULL
genius	NULL

he	NULL
answered	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
kill	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL

She	NULL

she	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL
Yet	NULL
she	NULL

I	NULL
replied	NULL

"	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
easier	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
thoughtfully	NULL

After	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
's	NULL
visit	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
quite	NULL
delirious	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fever	NULL
set	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
wound	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
firm	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
system	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
complicated	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
internal	NULL
injury	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
four	NULL
or	NULL
five	NULL
days	NULL
his	NULL
condition	NULL
was	NULL
most	NULL
critical	NULL
;	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
firmly	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
Foulata	NULL
's	NULL
indefatigable	NULL
nursing	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
died	NULL

Women	NULL
are	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
whatever	NULL
their	NULL
colour	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
somehow	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
curious	NULL
to	NULL
watch	NULL
this	NULL
dusky	NULL
beauty	NULL
bending	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
day	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
fevered	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
couch	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
performing	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
merciful	NULL
errands	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sick-room	NULL
swiftly	NULL
,	NULL
gently	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
as	NULL
fine	NULL
an	NULL
instinct	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
trained	NULL
hospital	NULL
nurse	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
night	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
I	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
did	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
stiffness	NULL
allowed	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Foulata	NULL
bore	NULL
our	NULL
interference	NULL
with	NULL
impatience	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finally	NULL
insisted	NULL
upon	NULL
our	NULL
leaving	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
our	NULL
movements	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
restless	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
.	NULL

Day	NULL
and	NULL
night	NULL
she	NULL
watched	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
tended	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
giving	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
only	NULL
medicine	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
native	NULL
cooling	NULL
drink	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
milk	NULL

in	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
infused	NULL
juice	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
bulb	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
species	NULL
of	NULL
tulip	NULL

and	NULL
keeping	NULL
the	NULL
flies	NULL
from	NULL
settling	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
can	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
picture	NULL
now	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
appeared	NULL
night	NULL
after	NULL
night	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
primitive	NULL
lamp	NULL
;	NULL
Good	NULL
tossing	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
fro	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
features	NULL
emaciated	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
shining	NULL
large	NULL
and	NULL
luminous	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
jabbering	NULL
nonsense	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
yard	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
seated	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
resting	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hut	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
soft-eyed	NULL
,	NULL
shapely	NULL
Kukuana	NULL
beauty	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
weary	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
long	NULL
vigil	NULL
,	NULL
animated	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
infinite	NULL
compassion	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
something	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
compassion	NULL
?	NULL

For	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
we	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
die	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
crept	NULL
about	NULL
with	NULL
heavy	NULL
hearts	NULL
.	NULL

Only	NULL
Foulata	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
will	NULL
live	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
around	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
chief	NULL
hut	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
sufferer	NULL
lay	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
silence	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
's	NULL
order	NULL
all	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
habitations	NULL
behind	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
and	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
removed	NULL
,	NULL
lest	NULL
any	NULL
noise	NULL
should	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sick	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
ears	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
fifth	NULL
of	NULL
Good	NULL
's	NULL
illness	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
my	NULL
habit	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
across	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
before	NULL
turning	NULL
in	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
hours	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
hut	NULL
carefully	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lamp	NULL
placed	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
showed	NULL
the	NULL
figure	NULL
of	NULL
Good	NULL
tossing	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
lying	NULL
quite	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
bitterness	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
heart	NULL
I	NULL
gave	NULL
something	NULL

sob	NULL

came	NULL

behind	NULL
Good	NULL
's	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
creeping	NULL
closer	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
sleeping	NULL
soundly	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
Foulata	NULL
's	NULL
taper	NULL
fingers	NULL
clasped	NULL
tightly	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
poor	NULL
white	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
crisis	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
live	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
slept	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
eighteen	NULL
hours	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
scarcely	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
fear	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
believed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
entire	NULL
period	NULL
did	NULL
this	NULL
devoted	NULL
girl	NULL
sit	NULL
by	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
fearing	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
moved	NULL
and	NULL
drew	NULL
away	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
wake	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
suffered	NULL
from	NULL
cramp	NULL
and	NULL
weariness	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
food	NULL
,	NULL
nobody	NULL
will	NULL
ever	NULL
know	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
woke	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
carried	NULL
away	NULL
--	NULL
her	NULL
limbs	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
stiff	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
move	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
the	NULL
turn	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
been	NULL
taken	NULL
,	NULL
Good	NULL
's	NULL
recovery	NULL
was	NULL
rapid	NULL
and	NULL
complete	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
well	NULL
that	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
owed	NULL
to	NULL
Foulata	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
side	NULL
for	NULL
eighteen	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
fearing	NULL
lest	NULL
by	NULL
moving	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
wake	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
honest	NULL
sailor	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
straight	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hut	NULL
where	NULL
Foulata	NULL
was	NULL
preparing	NULL
the	NULL
mid-day	NULL
meal	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
old	NULL
quarters	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
taking	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
interpret	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
his	NULL
meaning	NULL
clear	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
understood	NULL
him	NULL
marvellously	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
rule	NULL
,	NULL
considering	NULL
how	NULL
extremely	NULL
limited	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
foreign	NULL
vocabulary	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Tell	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Good	NULL

"	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
owe	NULL
her	NULL
my	NULL

that	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
never	NULL
forget	NULL
her	NULL
kindness	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
dying	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
interpreted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
dark	NULL
skin	NULL
she	NULL
actually	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
blush	NULL
.	NULL

Turning	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
swift	NULL
and	NULL
graceful	NULL
motions	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
always	NULL
reminded	NULL
me	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
flight	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
wild	NULL
bird	NULL
,	NULL
Foulata	NULL
answered	NULL
softly	NULL
,	NULL
glancing	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
large	NULL
brown	NULL
eyes	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Nay	NULL

my	NULL

It	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
observed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
lady	NULL
appeared	NULL
entirely	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
forgotten	NULL
the	NULL
share	NULL
which	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
and	NULL
myself	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
preservation	NULL
from	NULL
Twala	NULL
's	NULL
clutches	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
women	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
wife	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
retired	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
little	NULL
interview	NULL
sad	NULL
at	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
Miss	NULL
Foulata	NULL
's	NULL
soft	NULL
glances	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
fatal	NULL
amorous	NULL
propensities	NULL
of	NULL
sailors	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
Good	NULL
in	NULL
particular	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
two	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
prevented	NULL
:	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
keep	NULL
a	NULL
Zulu	NULL
from	NULL
fighting	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
sailor	NULL
from	NULL
falling	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
provocation	NULL
!	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
after	NULL
this	NULL
last	NULL
occurrence	NULL
that	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
held	NULL
his	NULL
great	NULL
"	NULL
indaba	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
or	NULL
council	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
formally	NULL
recognised	NULL
as	NULL
king	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
indunas	NULL

"	NULL
or	NULL
head	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
Kukuanaland	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
spectacle	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
imposing	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
including	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
a	NULL
grand	NULL
review	NULL
of	NULL
troops	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
this	NULL
day	NULL
the	NULL
remaining	NULL
fragments	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Greys	NULL
were	NULL
formally	NULL
paraded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
army	NULL
thanked	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
splendid	NULL
conduct	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
battle	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
each	NULL
man	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
present	NULL
of	NULL
cattle	NULL
,	NULL
promoting	NULL
them	NULL
one	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rank	NULL
of	NULL
officers	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
corps	NULL
of	NULL
Greys	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
process	NULL
of	NULL
formation	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
order	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
promulgated	NULL
throughout	NULL
the	NULL
length	NULL

breadth	NULL
of	NULL
Kukuanaland	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
whilst	NULL
we	NULL
honoured	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
by	NULL
our	NULL
presence	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
three	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
greeted	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
royal	NULL
salute	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
treated	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
ceremony	NULL
and	NULL
respect	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
by	NULL
custom	NULL
accorded	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL
.	NULL

Also	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
death	NULL
was	NULL
publicly	NULL
conferred	NULL
upon	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

Ignosi	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
reaffirmed	NULL
the	NULL
promises	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
blood	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
shed	NULL
without	NULL
trial	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
witch-hunting	NULL
should	NULL
cease	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
ceremony	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
we	NULL
waited	NULL
upon	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
informed	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
now	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
investigate	NULL
the	NULL
mystery	NULL

the	NULL
mines	NULL

which	NULL
Solomon	NULL

asking	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL

at	NULL
some	NULL

THE	NULL

mountains	NULL
is	NULL
called	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
Solomon	NULL
's	NULL
Great	NULL
Road	NULL
runs	NULL
.	NULL

Our	NULL
party	NULL
consisted	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
three	NULL
selves	NULL

Foulata	NULL

waited	NULL
on	NULL

all	NULL

a	NULL

The	NULL

rather	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
peaks	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mountain	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL
mass	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL

a	NULL
solitary	NULL
upheaval	NULL

were	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
triangle	NULL

of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
base	NULL
was	NULL
towards	NULL
us	NULL

one	NULL
peak	NULL
being	NULL
on	NULL
our	NULL
right	NULL

one	NULL
on	NULL
our	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
straight	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

Never	NULL
shall	NULL
I	NULL
forget	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
afforded	NULL
by	NULL
those	NULL
three	NULL
towering	NULL
peaks	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
sunlight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
morning	NULL

High	NULL

high	NULL
above	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
up	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
soared	NULL
their	NULL
twisted	NULL
snow-wreaths	NULL

Beneath	NULL
the	NULL
snow-line	NULL
the	NULL
peaks	NULL
were	NULL
purple	NULL
with	NULL
heaths	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
wild	NULL
moors	NULL
that	NULL
ran	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
slopes	NULL
towards	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Straight	NULL
before	NULL
us	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
ribbon	NULL
of	NULL
Solomon	NULL
's	NULL
Great	NULL
Road	NULL
stretched	NULL
away	NULL
uphill	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
peak	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
five	NULL
miles	NULL
from	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
stopped	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
its	NULL
terminus	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
feelings	NULL
of	NULL
intense	NULL
excitement	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
set	NULL
out	NULL
on	NULL
our	NULL
march	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
imagination	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
read	NULL
this	NULL
history	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
drawing	NULL
near	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
wonderful	NULL
mines	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
cause	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
miserable	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
Portuguese	NULL
Dom	NULL
three	NULL
centuries	NULL

of	NULL
my	NULL
poor	NULL
friend	NULL

his	NULL
ill-starred	NULL
descendant	NULL

and	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
feared	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
George	NULL
Curtis	NULL
,	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
's	NULL
brother	NULL
.	NULL

Were	NULL
we	NULL
destined	NULL

after	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL

gone	NULL
through	NULL

that	NULL

it	NULL

Somehow	NULL

marching	NULL
up	NULL
that	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
did	NULL

Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL

For	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL

a	NULL
half	NULL

more	NULL
we	NULL
tramped	NULL
on	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
heather-fringed	NULL
way	NULL

going	NULL
so	NULL
fast	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
excitement	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
bearers	NULL
of	NULL
Gagool	NULL
's	NULL
hammock	NULL
could	NULL
scarcely	NULL
keep	NULL
pace	NULL
with	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
occupant	NULL
piped	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
stop	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

slowly	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
projecting	NULL
her	NULL
hideous	NULL
shrivelled	NULL
countenance	NULL
between	NULL

fixing	NULL
her	NULL
gleaming	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
laughed	NULL
that	NULL
horrible	NULL

which	NULL
always	NULL
sent	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
shiver	NULL
down	NULL
my	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
quite	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL

out	NULL

us	NULL

However	NULL

on	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL

I	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL

in	NULL
astonishment	NULL

it	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
none	NULL

the	NULL
old	NULL
Dom	NULL

map	NULL

the	NULL
Great	NULL
Road	NULL
branched	NULL
into	NULL
two	NULL

circumvented	NULL

In	NULL
many	NULL
places	NULL

by	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL

this	NULL
surrounding	NULL

was	NULL
built	NULL
entirely	NULL
out	NULL

the	NULL

Along	NULL
this	NULL

we	NULL
pressed	NULL

driven	NULL
by	NULL
curiosity	NULL

what	NULL
were	NULL

which	NULL
we	NULL

the	NULL

As	NULL
we	NULL

we	NULL

that	NULL

some	NULL

rightly	NULL

the	NULL

Before	NULL

Infadoos	NULL

saluted	NULL

by	NULL
lifting	NULL

asked	NULL
us	NULL

at	NULL

If	NULL

Gagool	NULL

As	NULL
it	NULL

we	NULL
announced	NULL

in	NULL

we	NULL

detained	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

we	NULL

Accordingly	NULL

brought	NULL
up	NULL

,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
to	NULL
form	NULL
a	NULL
pillar	NULL
,	NULL
say	NULL
eighty	NULL
feet	NULL
by	NULL
ten	NULL
in	NULL
diameter	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
the	NULL
process	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
one	NULL
instance	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
incalculably	NULL
slow	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
example	NULL
will	NULL
suffice	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
.	NULL

Cut	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
pillars	NULL
we	NULL
discovered	NULL
the	NULL
crude	NULL
likeness	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mummy	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
sat	NULL
what	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
figure	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
Egyptian	NULL
god	NULL
,	NULL
doubtless	NULL
the	NULL
handiwork	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
old-world	NULL
labourer	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mine	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL
was	NULL
executed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
natural	NULL
height	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
an	NULL
idle	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
be	NULL
he	NULL
Phoenician	NULL
workman	NULL
or	NULL
British	NULL
cad	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
immortalise	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
expense	NULL
of	NULL
nature	NULL
's	NULL
masterpieces	NULL
,	NULL
namely	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
five	NULL
feet	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
_	NULL
must	NULL
_	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
nearly	NULL
three	NULL
thousand	NULL
years	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
date	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
execution	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
carving	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
column	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
eight	NULL
feet	NULL
high	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
in	NULL
process	NULL
of	NULL
formation	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
gives	NULL
a	NULL
rate	NULL
of	NULL
growth	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
foot	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
thousand	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
an	NULL
inch	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
fraction	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
century	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
we	NULL
knew	NULL
because	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
standing	NULL
by	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
drop	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
fall	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
the	NULL
stalagmites	NULL
took	NULL
strange	NULL
forms	NULL
,	NULL
presumably	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
dropping	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
spot	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
huge	NULL
mass	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
weighed	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
tons	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shape	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
pulpit	NULL
,	NULL
beautifully	NULL
fretted	NULL
over	NULL
outside	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
design	NULL
that	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
lace	NULL
.	NULL

Others	NULL
resembled	NULL
strange	NULL
beasts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sides	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cave	NULL
were	NULL
fanlike	NULL
ivory	NULL
tracings	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
frost	NULL
leaves	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
pane	NULL
.	NULL

Out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vast	NULL
main	NULL
aisle	NULL
there	NULL
opened	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
smaller	NULL
caves	NULL
,	NULL
exactly	NULL
,	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
chapels	NULL
open	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
great	NULL
cathedrals	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
were	NULL
large	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
wonderful	NULL
instance	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
nature	NULL
carries	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
handiwork	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
unvarying	NULL
laws	NULL
,	NULL
utterly	NULL
irrespective	NULL
of	NULL
size	NULL
--	NULL
were	NULL
tiny	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
little	NULL
nook	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
instance	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
larger	NULL
than	NULL
an	NULL
unusually	NULL
big	NULL
doll	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
model	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
dropped	NULL
,	NULL
tiny	NULL
icicles	NULL
hung	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
spar	NULL
columns	NULL
were	NULL
forming	NULL
in	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
enough	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
examine	NULL
this	NULL
beautiful	NULL
cavern	NULL
so	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
unfortunately	NULL
,	NULL
Gagool	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
indifferent	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
stalactites	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
her	NULL
business	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
annoyed	NULL
me	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
particularly	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
discover	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
what	NULL
system	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
was	NULL
admitted	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
cave	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
of	NULL
man	NULL
or	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
nature	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
;	NULL
also	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
used	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
ancient	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
seemed	NULL
probable	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
consoled	NULL
ourselves	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
would	NULL
investigate	NULL
it	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
on	NULL
our	NULL
way	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
followed	NULL
on	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
heels	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
uncanny	NULL
guide	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
she	NULL
led	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
straight	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vast	NULL
and	NULL
silent	NULL
cave	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
we	NULL
found	NULL
another	NULL
doorway	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
arched	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
square	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
doorways	NULL
of	NULL
Egyptian	NULL
temples	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

asked	NULL
Gagool	NULL
,	NULL
evidently	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
view	NULL
to	NULL
making	NULL
us	NULL
feel	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Lead	NULL

Macduff	NULL

said	NULL
Good	NULL
solemnly	NULL

trying	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
alarmed	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
indeed	NULL
we	NULL
all	NULL
did	NULL
except	NULL
Foulata	NULL

who	NULL
caught	NULL
Good	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
arm	NULL
for	NULL
protection	NULL

"	NULL
This	NULL

said	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL

peeping	NULL
into	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
politely	NULL
made	NULL
way	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
lead	NULL
the	NULL
van	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
inwardly	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
bless	NULL

_	NULL
Tap	NULL

_	NULL
went	NULL

Gagool	NULL

stick	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
trotted	NULL
along	NULL
,	NULL
chuckling	NULL
hideously	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
overcome	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
unaccountable	NULL
presentiment	NULL
of	NULL
evil	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
hung	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL

on	NULL
,	NULL
old	NULL
fellow	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
or	NULL
we	NULL
shall	NULL
lose	NULL
our	NULL
fair	NULL
guide	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Thus	NULL
adjured	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
started	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
about	NULL
twenty	NULL
paces	NULL
found	NULL
myself	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
gloomy	NULL
apartment	NULL
some	NULL
forty	NULL
feet	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
thirty	NULL
broad	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thirty	NULL
high	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
past	NULL
age	NULL
evidently	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
hollowed	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
hand-labour	NULL
,	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mountain	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
apartment	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
nearly	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
lighted	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
vast	NULL
stalactite	NULL
ante-cave	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
glance	NULL
all	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
discern	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
massive	NULL
stone	NULL
table	NULL
running	NULL
down	NULL
its	NULL
length	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
colossal	NULL
white	NULL
figure	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
life-sized	NULL
white	NULL
figures	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
I	NULL
discovered	NULL
a	NULL
brown	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
seated	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
moment	NULL
my	NULL
eyes	NULL
grew	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
what	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
tailing	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
as	NULL
hard	NULL
as	NULL
my	NULL
legs	NULL
could	NULL
carry	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
nervous	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
troubled	NULL
with	NULL
superstitions	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
lived	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
folly	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
free	NULL
to	NULL
own	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
sight	NULL
quite	NULL
upset	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
that	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
caught	NULL
me	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
collar	NULL
and	NULL
held	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
honestly	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
stalactite	NULL
cave	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
promise	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
diamonds	NULL
in	NULL
Kimberley	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
induced	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
it	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
me	NULL
tight	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
stopped	NULL
because	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
second	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
_	NULL
his	NULL
_	NULL
eyes	NULL
became	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
let	NULL
go	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
mop	NULL
the	NULL
perspiration	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
forehead	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
swore	NULL
feebly	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Foulata	NULL
threw	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
round	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL
and	NULL
shrieked	NULL
.	NULL

Only	NULL
Gagool	NULL
chuckled	NULL
loud	NULL
and	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
_	NULL
was	NULL
_	NULL
a	NULL
ghastly	NULL
sight	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
stone	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
holding	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
skeleton	NULL

fifteen	NULL
feet	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
in	NULL
height	NULL

High	NULL
above	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
the	NULL
spear	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
act	NULL
to	NULL

one	NULL

that	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

projected	NULL

away	NULL

followed	NULL

Presently	NULL
she	NULL
stopped	NULL

pointed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

seated	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
looked	NULL

back	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
exclamation	NULL

no	NULL

Yes	NULL

the	NULL

perched	NULL

Over	NULL
the	NULL
surface	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
corpse	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
gathered	NULL
a	NULL
thin	NULL
glassy	NULL
film	NULL

that	NULL
made	NULL
its	NULL
appearance	NULL
yet	NULL
more	NULL
appalling	NULL

for	NULL

were	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL

presently	NULL
we	NULL

SOLOMON	NULL

TREASURE	NULL
CHAMBER	NULL
While	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
engaged	NULL
in	NULL
recovering	NULL
from	NULL
our	NULL
fright	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
examining	NULL
the	NULL
grisly	NULL
wonders	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Place	NULL
of	NULL
Death	NULL
,	NULL
Gagool	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
differently	NULL
occupied	NULL
.	NULL

Somehow	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
marvellously	NULL
active	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
chose	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
scrambled	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
where	NULL
our	NULL
departed	NULL
friend	NULL
Twala	NULL
was	NULL
placed	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
drip	NULL

to	NULL
see	NULL

suggested	NULL
Good	NULL

how	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL

pickling	NULL

"	NULL
or	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
dark	NULL
purpose	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
bending	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
his	NULL
icy	NULL
lips	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
in	NULL
affectionate	NULL
greeting	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
hobbled	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
stopping	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
address	NULL
the	NULL
remark	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
tenor	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
catch	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shrouded	NULL
forms	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
or	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
welcome	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
gone	NULL
through	NULL
this	NULL
mysterious	NULL
and	NULL
horrible	NULL
ceremony	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
squatted	NULL
herself	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
immediately	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
White	NULL
Death	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
up	NULL
prayers	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
spectacle	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
wicked	NULL
creature	NULL
pouring	NULL
out	NULL
supplications	NULL
,	NULL
evil	NULL
ones	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
arch	NULL
enemy	NULL
of	NULL
mankind	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
uncanny	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
caused	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
hasten	NULL
our	NULL
inspection	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
,	NULL
Gagool	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
voice	NULL
--	NULL
somehow	NULL
one	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
dare	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
above	NULL
a	NULL
whisper	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
place	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
lead	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
chamber	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
witch	NULL
promptly	NULL
scrambled	NULL
down	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
lords	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
afraid	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
leering	NULL
up	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Lead	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
lords	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
hobbled	NULL
round	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
Death	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Here	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
chamber	NULL
;	NULL
let	NULL
my	NULL
lords	NULL
light	NULL
the	NULL
lamp	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
enter	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
placed	NULL
the	NULL
gourd	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
oil	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
leaned	NULL
herself	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cave	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
took	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
match	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
still	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
box	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lit	NULL
a	NULL
rush	NULL
wick	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
looked	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
doorway	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
before	NULL
us	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
solid	NULL
rock	NULL
.	NULL

Gagool	NULL
grinned	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
way	NULL
is	NULL
there	NULL

lords	NULL

sternly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
jest	NULL
not	NULL

my	NULL
lords	NULL
.	NULL

See	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
pointed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
rock	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
holding	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
lamp	NULL
we	NULL
perceived	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
stone	NULL
was	NULL
rising	NULL
slowly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
and	NULL
vanishing	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
rock	NULL
above	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
doubtless	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
cavity	NULL
prepared	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
mass	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
width	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
good-sized	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
ten	NULL
feet	NULL
high	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
five	NULL
feet	NULL
thick	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
weighed	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
twenty	NULL
or	NULL
thirty	NULL
tons	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
clearly	NULL
moved	NULL
upon	NULL
some	NULL
simple	NULL
balance	NULL
principle	NULL
of	NULL
counter-weights	NULL
,	NULL
probably	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
opening	NULL
and	NULL
shutting	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
ordinary	NULL
modern	NULL
window	NULL
is	NULL
arranged	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
the	NULL
principle	NULL
was	NULL
set	NULL
in	NULL
motion	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
saw	NULL
;	NULL
Gagool	NULL
was	NULL
careful	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
little	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
some	NULL
very	NULL
simple	NULL
lever	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
moved	NULL
ever	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
by	NULL
pressure	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
secret	NULL
spot	NULL
,	NULL
thereby	NULL
throwing	NULL
additional	NULL
weight	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hidden	NULL
counter-balances	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
causing	NULL
the	NULL
monolith	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
lifted	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
.	NULL

Very	NULL
slowly	NULL
and	NULL
gently	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
stone	NULL
raised	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
vanished	NULL
altogether	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
hole	NULL
presented	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
had	NULL
filled	NULL
.	NULL

Our	NULL
excitement	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
intense	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
Solomon	NULL
's	NULL
treasure	NULL
chamber	NULL
thrown	NULL
open	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
tremble	NULL

shake	NULL
.	NULL

Would	NULL
it	NULL
prove	NULL
a	NULL
hoax	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL

I	NULL
wondered	NULL

or	NULL
was	NULL
old	NULL
Da	NULL

Were	NULL
there	NULL
vast	NULL
hoards	NULL

hidden	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL

hoards	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
us	NULL
the	NULL
richest	NULL
men	NULL

We	NULL
should	NULL

a	NULL
minute	NULL

two	NULL

"	NULL
Enter	NULL

"	NULL
but	NULL
first	NULL

The	NULL

ye	NULL

I	NULL

But	NULL
once	NULL

since	NULL
the	NULL

that	NULL
those	NULL

The	NULL
report	NULL

down	NULL

lived	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL

she	NULL
pointed	NULL

the	NULL
Dead	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
it	NULL

that	NULL

stepped	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
doorway	NULL

held	NULL
it	NULL
high	NULL
above	NULL

pressed	NULL
in	NULL
after	NULL
him	NULL

forgetful	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bag	NULL

found	NULL
ourselves	NULL

first	NULL

all	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL
room	NULL
hewn	NULL
out	NULL

apparently	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
ten	NULL
feet	NULL

there	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
sight	NULL

stored	NULL
one	NULL

the	NULL
arch	NULL

How	NULL

there	NULL

alone	NULL

it	NULL

On	NULL

At	NULL

brain	NULL

there	NULL

this	NULL

We	NULL
turned	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
passed	NULL
it	NULL
I	NULL
perceived	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
unfinished	NULL
wall	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
the	NULL
basket	NULL
of	NULL
food	NULL
which	NULL
poor	NULL
Foulata	NULL
had	NULL
carried	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
brought	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
accursed	NULL
treasure	NULL
chamber	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
our	NULL
grave	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
we	NULL
returned	NULL
and	NULL
reverently	NULL
bore	NULL
in	NULL
Foulata	NULL
's	NULL
corpse	NULL
,	NULL
laying	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
boxes	NULL
of	NULL
coin	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
we	NULL
seated	NULL
ourselves	NULL
,	NULL
leaning	NULL
our	NULL
backs	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
stone	NULL
chests	NULL
which	NULL
contained	NULL
the	NULL
priceless	NULL
treasure	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
us	NULL
divide	NULL
the	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
last	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Accordingly	NULL
we	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
reckoned	NULL
,	NULL
make	NULL
four	NULL
infinitesimally	NULL
small	NULL
meals	NULL
for	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
support	NULL
life	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
biltong	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
or	NULL
dried	NULL
game-flesh	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
gourds	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
held	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
quart	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL

grimly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
let	NULL
us	NULL
eat	NULL

We	NULL
each	NULL
ate	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
portion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
biltong	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
drank	NULL
a	NULL
sip	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

Needless	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
but	NULL
little	NULL
appetite	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
sadly	NULL
in	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
food	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
better	NULL
after	NULL
swallowing	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
we	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
systematic	NULL
examination	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
prison-house	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
faint	NULL

of	NULL
finding	NULL
some	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
exit	NULL
,	NULL
sounding	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
carefully	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
none	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
probable	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
any	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
treasure	NULL
chamber	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lamp	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
burn	NULL
dim	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fat	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
exhausted	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Quatermain	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL

Henry	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL

I	NULL
drew	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL

and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
six	NULL

nothing	NULL

go	NULL
to	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
lamp	NULL
grew	NULL
dimmer	NULL
yet	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
it	NULL
flared	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
showed	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
scene	NULL
in	NULL
strong	NULL
relief	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL

white	NULL

the	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XVIII	NULL
WE	NULL
ABANDON	NULL
HOPE	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
give	NULL
no	NULL
adequate	NULL
description	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
horrors	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
which	NULL
followed	NULL
.	NULL

Mercifully	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
extent	NULL
mitigated	NULL
by	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
position	NULL
as	NULL
ours	NULL
wearied	NULL
nature	NULL
will	NULL
sometimes	NULL
assert	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

Putting	NULL
aside	NULL
the	NULL
terrifying	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
impending	NULL
doom	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
bravest	NULL
man	NULL
on	NULL
earth	NULL
might	NULL
well	NULL
quail	NULL
from	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
fate	NULL
as	NULL
awaited	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
made	NULL
any	NULL
pretensions	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
brave	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
silence	NULL
_	NULL
itself	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
great	NULL
to	NULL
allow	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Reader	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
lain	NULL
awake	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
quiet	NULL
oppressive	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
with	NULL
confidence	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
vivid	NULL
,	NULL
tangible	NULL
thing	NULL
is	NULL
perfect	NULL
stillness	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
surface	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
always	NULL
some	NULL
sound	NULL
or	NULL
motion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
in	NULL
itself	NULL
be	NULL
imperceptible	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
deadens	NULL
the	NULL
sharp	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
absolute	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
here	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
none	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
were	NULL
buried	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bowels	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
huge	NULL
snow-clad	NULL
peak	NULL
.	NULL

Thousands	NULL
of	NULL
feet	NULL
above	NULL
us	NULL
the	NULL
fresh	NULL
air	NULL
rushed	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
snow	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
reached	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
were	NULL
separated	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
tunnel	NULL
and	NULL
five	NULL
feet	NULL
of	NULL
rock	NULL
even	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
awful	NULL
chamber	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Dead	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
make	NULL
no	NULL
noise	NULL
.	NULL

Did	NULL
we	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
it	NULL
who	NULL
lay	NULL
by	NULL
poor	NULL
Foulata	NULL
's	NULL
side	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
crashing	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
artillery	NULL
of	NULL
earth	NULL
and	NULL
heaven	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
our	NULL
ears	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
living	NULL
tomb	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
were	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL
from	NULL
every	NULL
echo	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
--	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
men	NULL
already	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
grave	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
irony	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
forced	NULL
itself	NULL
upon	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
around	NULL
us	NULL
lay	NULL
treasures	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
off	NULL
a	NULL
moderate	NULL
national	NULL
debt	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
build	NULL
a	NULL
fleet	NULL
of	NULL
ironclads	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
we	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
bartered	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
gladly	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
faintest	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
escape	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
,	NULL
doubtless	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
rejoiced	NULL
to	NULL
exchange	NULL
them	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
food	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
privilege	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
speedy	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
our	NULL
sufferings	NULL
.	NULL

Truly	NULL
wealth	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
men	NULL
spend	NULL
their	NULL
lives	NULL
in	NULL
acquiring	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
valueless	NULL
thing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
so	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
wore	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
sounded	NULL
awful	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
intense	NULL
stillness	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
how	NULL
many	NULL
matches	NULL
have	NULL
you	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
box	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Eight	NULL
,	NULL
Curtis	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Strike	NULL
one	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
us	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
contrast	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dense	NULL
darkness	NULL
the	NULL
flame	NULL
nearly	NULL
blinded	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
five	NULL
o'clock	NULL
by	NULL
my	NULL
watch	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
beautiful	NULL
dawn	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
blushing	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
snow-wreaths	NULL
far	NULL
over	NULL
our	NULL
heads	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
breeze	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
stirring	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
mists	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hollows	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
eat	NULL
something	NULL
and	NULL
keep	NULL
up	NULL
our	NULL
strength	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
suggested	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
of	NULL
eating	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

answered	NULL
Good	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
sooner	NULL
we	NULL
die	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
While	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
life	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
hope	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
.	NULL

Accordingly	NULL
we	NULL
ate	NULL
and	NULL
sipped	NULL
some	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
another	NULL
period	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
elapsed	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
well	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
as	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
and	NULL
halloa	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
faint	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
somebody	NULL
catching	NULL
a	NULL
sound	NULL
outside	NULL
.	NULL

Accordingly	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
long	NULL
practice	NULL
at	NULL
sea	NULL
,	NULL
has	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
piercing	NULL
note	NULL
,	NULL
groped	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
and	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
must	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
diabolical	NULL
noise	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
heard	NULL
such	NULL
yells	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
mosquito	NULL
buzzing	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
they	NULL
produced	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
very	NULL
thirsty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
drink	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
we	NULL
stopped	NULL
yelling	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
encroached	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
supply	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
we	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
chests	NULL
of	NULL
useless	NULL
diamonds	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
dreadful	NULL
inaction	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hardest	NULL
circumstances	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
fate	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
my	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
gave	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

Laying	NULL
my	NULL
head	NULL
against	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
's	NULL
broad	NULL
shoulder	NULL
I	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
tears	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
Good	NULL
gulping	NULL
away	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
swearing	NULL
hoarsely	NULL
at	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

Ah	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
good	NULL
and	NULL
brave	NULL
that	NULL
great	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
!	NULL

Had	NULL
we	NULL
been	NULL
two	NULL
frightened	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
our	NULL
nurse	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
treated	NULL
us	NULL
more	NULL
tenderly	NULL
.	NULL

Forgetting	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
share	NULL
of	NULL
miseries	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
to	NULL
soothe	NULL
our	NULL
broken	NULL
nerves	NULL
,	NULL
telling	NULL
stories	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
somewhat	NULL
similar	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
miraculously	NULL
escaped	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
these	NULL
failed	NULL
to	NULL
cheer	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
pointing	NULL
out	NULL
how	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
anticipating	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
which	NULL
must	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
soon	NULL
be	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
death	NULL
from	NULL
exhaustion	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
merciful	NULL
one	NULL
(	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
true	NULL
)	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
diffident	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
once	NULL
before	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
throw	NULL
ourselves	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
mercy	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
higher	NULL
Power	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
for	NULL
my	NULL
part	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
vigour	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
beautiful	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
quiet	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
very	NULL
strong	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
so	NULL
somehow	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
went	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
can	NULL
use	NULL
these	NULL
terms	NULL
where	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
densest	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
lit	NULL
a	NULL
match	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
seven	NULL
o'clock	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
more	NULL
we	NULL
ate	NULL
and	NULL
drank	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
place	NULL
keeps	NULL
fresh	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
thick	NULL
and	NULL
heavy	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
perfectly	NULL
fresh	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Great	NULL
heavens	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
starting	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
come	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
stone	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
air-tight	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
ever	NULL
a	NULL
door	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
must	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
somewhere	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
current	NULL
of	NULL
air	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
stifled	NULL
or	NULL
poisoned	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
first	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
us	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
wonderful	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
this	NULL
mere	NULL
spark	NULL
of	NULL
hope	NULL
wrought	NULL
in	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
three	NULL
groping	NULL
about	NULL
on	NULL
our	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
knees	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
indication	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
draught	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
my	NULL
ardour	NULL
received	NULL
a	NULL
check	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
put	NULL
my	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
something	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
Foulata	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
feeling	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
gave	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
despair	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
considerably	NULL
hurt	NULL
by	NULL
constantly	NULL
knocking	NULL
our	NULL
heads	NULL
against	NULL
tusks	NULL
,	NULL
chests	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sides	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chamber	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Good	NULL
still	NULL
persevered	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
approach	NULL
to	NULL
cheerfulness	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
doing	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
fellows	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
presently	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
constrained	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
come	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Needless	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
we	NULL
scrambled	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
quickly	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Quatermain	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
your	NULL
hand	NULL
here	NULL
where	NULL
mine	NULL
is	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
feel	NULL
anything	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
_	NULL
think	NULL
_	NULL
I	NULL
feel	NULL
air	NULL
coming	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
listen	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
rose	NULL
and	NULL
stamped	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
flame	NULL
of	NULL
hope	NULL
shot	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
hearts	NULL
.	NULL

_	NULL
It	NULL
rang	NULL
hollow	NULL
.	NULL

_	NULL
With	NULL
trembling	NULL
hands	NULL
I	NULL
lit	NULL
a	NULL
match	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
three	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
angle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
far	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chamber	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
accounted	NULL
for	NULL
our	NULL
not	NULL
having	NULL
noticed	NULL
the	NULL
hollow	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
during	NULL
our	NULL
former	NULL
exhaustive	NULL
examination	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
match	NULL
burnt	NULL
we	NULL
scrutinised	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
join	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
solid	NULL
rock	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
great	NULL
heavens	NULL
!	NULL

there	NULL
,	NULL
let	NULL
in	NULL
level	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
rock	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
stone	NULL
ring	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
said	NULL
no	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
excited	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
our	NULL
hearts	NULL
beat	NULL
too	NULL
wildly	NULL
with	NULL
hope	NULL
to	NULL
allow	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

Good	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
knife	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
hooks	NULL
that	NULL
are	NULL
made	NULL
to	NULL
extract	NULL
stones	NULL
from	NULL
horses	NULL
'	NULL
hoofs	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
opened	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
scratched	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
ring	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Finally	NULL
he	NULL
worked	NULL
it	NULL
under	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
levered	NULL
away	NULL
gently	NULL
for	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
breaking	NULL
the	NULL
hook	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
ring	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
.	NULL

Being	NULL
of	NULL
stone	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
rusted	NULL
fast	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
centuries	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
lain	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
been	NULL
of	NULL
iron	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
upright	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
thrust	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
into	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
tugged	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
force	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
nothing	NULL
budged	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
me	NULL
try	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
impatiently	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stone	NULL
,	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
angle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
to	NULL
pull	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
took	NULL
hold	NULL
and	NULL
strained	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
results	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
tried	NULL
and	NULL
failed	NULL
.	NULL

Taking	NULL
the	NULL
hook	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
Good	NULL
scratched	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
crack	NULL
where	NULL
we	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
coming	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL

he	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL

,	NULL
true	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL

I	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

a	NULL

I	NULL
went	NULL

creeping	NULL

our	NULL

by	NULL
the	NULL
chests	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
purpose	NULL

as	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
away	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
struck	NULL
me	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
thought	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
diamonds	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
twenty-four	NULL
hours	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
;	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
diamonds	NULL
was	NULL
nauseous	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL

entailed	NULL

So	NULL
I	NULL
just	NULL
put	NULL
my	NULL
fist	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
chest	NULL
and	NULL
filled	NULL
all	NULL

by	NULL

I	NULL
stuffed	NULL

my	NULL
fingers	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
arose	NULL
the	NULL
delicate	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
tunnel	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
one	NULL
way	NULL
might	NULL
lead	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
safety	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
to	NULL
destruction	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
were	NULL
utterly	NULL
perplexed	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
suddenly	NULL
it	NULL
struck	NULL
Good	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
lit	NULL
the	NULL
match	NULL
the	NULL
draught	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
blew	NULL
the	NULL
flame	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
us	NULL
go	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
draught	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
air	NULL
draws	NULL
inwards	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
outwards	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

We	NULL
took	NULL
this	NULL
suggestion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
feeling	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
with	NULL
our	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
whilst	NULL
trying	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
before	NULL
us	NULL
at	NULL
every	NULL
step	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
departed	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
accursed	NULL
treasure	NULL
chamber	NULL
on	NULL
our	NULL
terrible	NULL
quest	NULL
for	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
ever	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
entered	NULL
again	NULL
by	NULL
living	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
probable	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
find	NULL
tokens	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
visit	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
chests	NULL
of	NULL
jewels	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
empty	NULL
lamp	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
bones	NULL
of	NULL
poor	NULL
Foulata	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
groped	NULL
our	NULL
way	NULL
for	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
sharp	NULL
turn	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
else	NULL
was	NULL
bisected	NULL
by	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
followed	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
led	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
third	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
so	NULL
it	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
hours	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
stone	NULL
labyrinth	NULL
that	NULL
led	NULL
nowhere	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
passages	NULL
are	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
we	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
ancient	NULL
workings	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mine	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
shafts	NULL
and	NULL
adits	NULL
travelled	NULL
hither	NULL
and	NULL
thither	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
ore	NULL
led	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
account	NULL
for	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
multitude	NULL
of	NULL
galleries	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
length	NULL
we	NULL
halted	NULL
,	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
worn	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
fatigue	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
hope	NULL
deferred	NULL
which	NULL
maketh	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
sick	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ate	NULL
up	NULL
our	NULL
poor	NULL
remaining	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
biltong	NULL
and	NULL
drank	NULL
our	NULL
last	NULL
sup	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
our	NULL
throats	NULL
were	NULL
like	NULL
lime-kilns	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
escaped	NULL
Death	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
treasure	NULL
chamber	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tunnels	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
we	NULL
stood	NULL
,	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
utterly	NULL
depressed	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
caught	NULL
a	NULL
sound	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
attention	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
faint	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
far	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
_	NULL
was	NULL
_	NULL
a	NULL
sound	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL
,	NULL
murmuring	NULL
sound	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
heard	NULL
it	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
words	NULL
can	NULL
describe	NULL
the	NULL
blessedness	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
hours	NULL
of	NULL
utter	NULL
,	NULL
awful	NULL
stillness	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
By	NULL
heaven	NULL
!	NULL

it	NULL
's	NULL
running	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Good	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Off	NULL
we	NULL
started	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
faint	NULL
murmur	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
groping	NULL
our	NULL
way	NULL
as	NULL
before	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
rocky	NULL
walls	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
laid	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
basket	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
diamonds	NULL
,	NULL
wishing	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
weight	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
on	NULL
second	NULL
thoughts	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
might	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
die	NULL
rich	NULL
as	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
reflected	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
became	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
audible	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
quite	NULL
loud	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
quiet	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
on	NULL
;	NULL
now	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
distinctly	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
unmistakable	NULL
swirl	NULL
of	NULL
rushing	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
how	NULL
could	NULL
there	NULL
be	NULL
running	NULL
water	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bowels	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
?	NULL

Now	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
quite	NULL
near	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
leading	NULL
,	NULL
swore	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
smell	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Go	NULL
gently	NULL
,	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
we	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
close	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

_	NULL
Splash	NULL
!	NULL

_	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
cry	NULL
from	NULL
Good	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Good	NULL
!	NULL

Good	NULL
!	NULL

where	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

we	NULL
shouted	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
terrified	NULL
distress	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
our	NULL
intense	NULL
relief	NULL
an	NULL
answer	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
choky	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
right	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
rock	NULL
.	NULL

Strike	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
me	NULL
where	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Hastily	NULL
I	NULL
lit	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
remaining	NULL
match	NULL
.	NULL

Its	NULL
faint	NULL
gleam	NULL
discovered	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
running	NULL
at	NULL
our	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
wide	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
way	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
companion	NULL
hanging	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
projecting	NULL
rock	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Stand	NULL
clear	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
sung	NULL
out	NULL
Good	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
swim	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
we	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
splash	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
struggle	NULL
.	NULL

Another	NULL
minute	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
grabbed	NULL
at	NULL
and	NULL
caught	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
's	NULL
outstretched	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
pulled	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
high	NULL
and	NULL
dry	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
tunnel	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
word	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
between	NULL
his	NULL
gasps	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
touch	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
that	NULL
rock	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
known	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
swim	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
runs	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
mill-race	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
feel	NULL
no	NULL
bottom	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

We	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
follow	NULL
the	NULL
banks	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
subterranean	NULL
river	NULL
for	NULL
fear	NULL
lest	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
fall	NULL
into	NULL
it	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
after	NULL
Good	NULL
had	NULL
rested	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
drunk	NULL
our	NULL
fill	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
sweet	NULL
and	NULL
fresh	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
washed	NULL
our	NULL
faces	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
needed	NULL
it	NULL
sadly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
started	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
banks	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
African	NULL
Styx	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
retrace	NULL
our	NULL
steps	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
tunnel	NULL
,	NULL
Good	NULL
dripping	NULL
unpleasantly	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
length	NULL
we	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
another	NULL
gallery	NULL
leading	NULL
to	NULL
our	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
may	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
wearily	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
all	NULL
roads	NULL
are	NULL
alike	NULL
here	NULL
;	NULL
we	NULL
can	NULL
only	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
till	NULL
we	NULL
drop	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Slowly	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
long	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
stumbled	NULL
,	NULL
utterly	NULL
exhausted	NULL
,	NULL
along	NULL
this	NULL
new	NULL
tunnel	NULL
,	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
now	NULL
leading	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

Again	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
abandoning	NULL
that	NULL
basket	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
he	NULL
stopped	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
bumped	NULL
up	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Look	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
whispered	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
is	NULL
my	NULL
brain	NULL
going	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
light	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

We	NULL
stared	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
our	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
far	NULL
ahead	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL
,	NULL
glimmering	NULL
spot	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
larger	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
cottage	NULL
window	NULL
pane	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
faint	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
doubt	NULL
if	NULL
any	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
those	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
ours	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
days	NULL
seen	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
blackness	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
perceived	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
gasp	NULL
of	NULL
hope	NULL
we	NULL
pushed	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
any	NULL
doubt	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
_	NULL
was	NULL
_	NULL
a	NULL
patch	NULL
of	NULL
faint	NULL
light	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
minute	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
breath	NULL
of	NULL
real	NULL
live	NULL
air	NULL
was	NULL
fanning	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
we	NULL
struggled	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
the	NULL
tunnel	NULL
narrowed	NULL
.	NULL

Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
.	NULL

Smaller	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
grew	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
size	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
fox	NULL
's	NULL
earth	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
_	NULL
earth	NULL
_	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
mind	NULL
you	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
rock	NULL
had	NULL
ceased	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
squeeze	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
struggle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
was	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
was	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
dragging	NULL
Foulata	NULL
's	NULL
basket	NULL
after	NULL
me	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
above	NULL
us	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
blessed	NULL
stars	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
nostrils	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
sweet	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
suddenly	NULL
something	NULL
gave	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
rolling	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
through	NULL
grass	NULL
and	NULL
bushes	NULL
and	NULL
soft	NULL
,	NULL
wet	NULL
soil	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
basket	NULL
caught	NULL
in	NULL
something	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
stopped	NULL
.	NULL

Sitting	NULL
up	NULL
I	NULL
halloed	NULL
lustily	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
answering	NULL
shout	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
below	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
's	NULL
wild	NULL
career	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
checked	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
level	NULL
ground	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
scrambled	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
unhurt	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
breathless	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
we	NULL
looked	NULL
for	NULL
Good	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
little	NULL
way	NULL
off	NULL
we	NULL
discovered	NULL
him	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
hammed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
forked	NULL
root	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
knocked	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
soon	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
revulsion	NULL
of	NULL
feeling	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
great	NULL
that	NULL
really	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
we	NULL
cried	NULL
with	NULL
joy	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
escaped	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
awful	NULL
dungeon	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
near	NULL
to	NULL
becoming	NULL
our	NULL
grave	NULL
.	NULL

Surely	NULL
some	NULL
merciful	NULL
Power	NULL
guided	NULL
our	NULL
footsteps	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
jackal	NULL
hole	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
termination	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tunnel	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
yonder	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
mountains	NULL
the	NULL
dawn	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
thought	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
again	NULL
was	NULL
blushing	NULL
rosy	NULL
red	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
the	NULL
grey	NULL
light	NULL
stole	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
slopes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
,	NULL
nearly	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vast	NULL
pit	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
entrance	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
cave	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
dim	NULL
forms	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
Colossi	NULL
who	NULL
sat	NULL
upon	NULL
its	NULL
verge	NULL
.	NULL

Doubtless	NULL
those	NULL
awful	NULL
passages	NULL
,	NULL
along	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
wandered	NULL
the	NULL
livelong	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
originally	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
way	NULL
connected	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
diamond	NULL
mine	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
subterranean	NULL
river	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bowels	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mountain	NULL
,	NULL
Heaven	NULL
only	NULL
knows	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
whence	NULL
it	NULL
flows	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
whither	NULL
it	NULL
goes	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
anxiety	NULL
to	NULL
trace	NULL
its	NULL
course	NULL
.	NULL

Lighter	NULL
it	NULL
grew	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lighter	NULL
yet	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
spectacle	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
presented	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
set	NULL
eyes	NULL
on	NULL
before	NULL
or	NULL
since	NULL
.	NULL

Gaunt-cheeked	NULL
,	NULL
hollow-eyed	NULL
wretches	NULL
,	NULL
smeared	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
with	NULL
dust	NULL
and	NULL
mud	NULL
,	NULL
bruised	NULL
,	NULL
bleeding	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
imminent	NULL
death	NULL
yet	NULL
written	NULL
on	NULL
our	NULL
countenances	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sight	NULL
to	NULL
frighten	NULL
the	NULL
daylight	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
solemn	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
Good	NULL
's	NULL
eye-glass	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
fixed	NULL
in	NULL
Good	NULL
's	NULL
eye	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
doubt	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
taken	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
the	NULL
plunge	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
subterranean	NULL
river	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
the	NULL
roll	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
slope	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
separate	NULL
Good	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
eye-glass	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
we	NULL
rose	NULL
,	NULL
fearing	NULL
that	NULL
our	NULL
limbs	NULL
would	NULL
stiffen	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
stopped	NULL
there	NULL
longer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
commenced	NULL
with	NULL
slow	NULL
and	NULL
painful	NULL
steps	NULL
to	NULL
struggle	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
sloping	NULL
sides	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
pit	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
we	NULL
toiled	NULL
steadfastly	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
clay	NULL
,	NULL
dragging	NULL
ourselves	NULL
on	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
help	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
roots	NULL
and	NULL
grasses	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
clothed	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
basket	NULL
;	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
death	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
parted	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
stood	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
road	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pit	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
opposite	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Colossi	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
fire	NULL
was	NULL
burning	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
huts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
were	NULL
figures	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
staggered	NULL
towards	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
supporting	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
halting	NULL
every	NULL
few	NULL
paces	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
figures	NULL
rose	NULL
,	NULL
saw	NULL
us	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
,	NULL
crying	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
fear	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
,	NULL
Infadoos	NULL
!	NULL

it	NULL
is	NULL
we	NULL
,	NULL

friends	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
rose	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
ran	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
staring	NULL
wildly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
shaking	NULL
with	NULL
fear	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
warrior	NULL
flung	NULL
himself	NULL
down	NULL
before	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
clasping	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL

he	NULL
wept	NULL
aloud	NULL
for	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
XIX	NULL
IGNOSI	NULL
'S	NULL
FAREWELL	NULL
Ten	NULL
days	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
eventful	NULL
morning	NULL
found	NULL
us	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
old	NULL
quarters	NULL
at	NULL
Loo	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
strange	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
little	NULL
the	NULL
worse	NULL
for	NULL
our	NULL
terrible	NULL
experience	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
that	NULL
my	NULL
stubbly	NULL
hair	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
treasure	NULL
cave	NULL
about	NULL
three	NULL
shades	NULL
greyer	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
Good	NULL
never	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
after	NULL
Foulata	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
him	NULL
very	NULL
greatly	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
oldish	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
consider	NULL
her	NULL
removal	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fortunate	NULL
occurrence	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
,	NULL
otherwise	NULL
,	NULL
complications	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
sure	NULL
to	NULL
ensue	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
poor	NULL
creature	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
ordinary	NULL
native	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
of	NULL
great	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
almost	NULL
said	NULL
stately	NULL
,	NULL
beauty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
considerable	NULL
refinement	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
no	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
beauty	NULL
or	NULL
refinement	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
entanglement	NULL
between	NULL
Good	NULL
and	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL
desirable	NULL
occurrence	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Can	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
mate	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
need	NULL
hardly	NULL
state	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
never	NULL
again	NULL
penetrated	NULL
into	NULL
Solomon	NULL
's	NULL
treasure	NULL
chamber	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
recovered	NULL
from	NULL
our	NULL
fatigues	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
process	NULL
which	NULL
took	NULL
us	NULL
forty-eight	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
descended	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
pit	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
finding	NULL
the	NULL
hole	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
crept	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mountain	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
success	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
begin	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
rain	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
obliterated	NULL
our	NULL
spoor	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sides	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vast	NULL
pit	NULL
were	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
ant-bear	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
holes	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
we	NULL
owed	NULL
our	NULL
salvation	NULL
.	NULL

Also	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
we	NULL
started	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Loo	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
further	NULL
examination	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wonders	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stalactite	NULL
cave	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
drawn	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
restless	NULL
feeling	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
penetrated	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
Chamber	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Dead	NULL
.	NULL

Passing	NULL
beneath	NULL
the	NULL
spear	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
White	NULL
Death	NULL
we	NULL
gazed	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
sensations	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
quite	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
describe	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
rock	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
shut	NULL
us	NULL
off	NULL
from	NULL
escape	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
of	NULL
priceless	NULL
treasures	NULL
beyond	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mysterious	NULL
old	NULL
hag	NULL
whose	NULL
flattened	NULL
fragments	NULL
lay	NULL
crushed	NULL
beneath	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fair	NULL
girl	NULL
of	NULL
whose	NULL
tomb	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
portal	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
say	NULL
gazed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
rock	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
examine	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
no	NULL
traces	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
join	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sliding	NULL
door	NULL
;	NULL
nor	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
we	NULL
hit	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
secret	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
utterly	NULL
lost	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
worked	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
we	NULL
tried	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
certainly	NULL
a	NULL
marvellous	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
mechanism	NULL
,	NULL
characteristic	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
massive	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
inscrutable	NULL
simplicity	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
age	NULL
which	NULL
produced	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
doubt	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
has	NULL
such	NULL
another	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
we	NULL
gave	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
disgust	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
mass	NULL
had	NULL
suddenly	NULL
risen	NULL
before	NULL
our	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
doubt	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
screwed	NULL
up	NULL
courage	NULL
to	NULL
step	NULL
over	NULL
Gagool	NULL
's	NULL
mangled	NULL
remains	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
enter	NULL
the	NULL
treasure	NULL
chamber	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sure	NULL
and	NULL
certain	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
unlimited	NULL
diamonds	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
cried	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
leaving	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
treasure	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
biggest	NULL
treasure	NULL
probably	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
's	NULL
history	NULL
has	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
accumulated	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
spot	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
help	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Only	NULL
dynamite	NULL
could	NULL
force	NULL
its	NULL
way	NULL
through	NULL
five	NULL
feet	NULL
of	NULL
solid	NULL
rock	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
we	NULL
left	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
remote	NULL
unborn	NULL
century	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
fortunate	NULL
explorer	NULL
may	NULL
hit	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Open	NULL
Sesame	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
flood	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
with	NULL
gems	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
doubt	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Somehow	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
tens	NULL
of	NULL
millions	NULL
of	NULL
pounds	NULL
'	NULL
worth	NULL
of	NULL
jewels	NULL
which	NULL
lie	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
stone	NULL
coffers	NULL
will	NULL
never	NULL
shine	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
neck	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
earthly	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
and	NULL
Foulata	NULL
's	NULL
bones	NULL
will	NULL
keep	NULL
cold	NULL
company	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
of	NULL
disappointment	NULL
we	NULL
made	NULL
our	NULL
way	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
started	NULL
for	NULL
Loo	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
very	NULL
ungrateful	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
disappointed	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
reader	NULL
will	NULL
remember	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
lucky	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
precaution	NULL
to	NULL
fill	NULL
the	NULL
wide	NULL
pockets	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
old	NULL
shooting	NULL
coat	NULL
and	NULL
trousers	NULL
with	NULL
gems	NULL
before	NULL
we	NULL
left	NULL
our	NULL
prison-house	NULL
,	NULL
also	NULL
Foulata	NULL
's	NULL
basket	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
held	NULL
twice	NULL
as	NULL
many	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
bottle	NULL
had	NULL
occupied	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
space	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
good	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
fell	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
roll	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pit	NULL
,	NULL
including	NULL
several	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
ones	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
crammed	NULL
in	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
coat	NULL
pockets	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
comparatively	NULL
speaking	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
enormous	NULL
quantity	NULL
still	NULL
remained	NULL
,	NULL
including	NULL
ninety-three	NULL
large	NULL
stones	NULL
ranging	NULL
from	NULL
over	NULL
two	NULL
hundred	NULL
to	NULL
seventy	NULL
carats	NULL
in	NULL
weight	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
old	NULL
shooting	NULL
coat	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
basket	NULL
still	NULL
held	NULL
sufficient	NULL
treasure	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
us	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
millionaires	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
term	NULL
is	NULL
understood	NULL
in	NULL
America	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
wealthy	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
enough	NULL
stones	NULL
each	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
finest	NULL
sets	NULL
of	NULL
gems	NULL
in	NULL
Europe	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
badly	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
arriving	NULL
at	NULL
Loo	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
most	NULL
cordially	NULL
received	NULL
by	NULL
Ignosi	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
we	NULL
found	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
busily	NULL
engaged	NULL
in	NULL
consolidating	NULL
his	NULL
power	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
reorganising	NULL
the	NULL
regiments	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
most	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
struggle	NULL
with	NULL
Twala	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
listened	NULL
with	NULL
intense	NULL
interest	NULL
to	NULL
our	NULL
wonderful	NULL
story	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL

frightful	NULL
end	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
thoughtful	NULL

"	NULL

I	NULL
lost	NULL
the	NULL

you	NULL
gave	NULL
me	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL
Baas	NULL

been	NULL
here	NULL
nearly	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
fellow	NULL
fell	NULL
at	NULL
my	NULL
feet	NULL

rolled	NULL
over	NULL

over	NULL

weeping	NULL
for	NULL
joy	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
the	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL

had	NULL
recovered	NULL

risen	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL

away	NULL
at	NULL
each	NULL

apparently	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL

But	NULL
whatever	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
quarrelled	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL

I	NULL
suspect	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lady	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL

out	NULL

over	NULL

up	NULL

How	NULL

Mr.	NULL

when	NULL

very	NULL

"	NULL

That	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
camp	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
George	NULL
Curtis	NULL
told	NULL
us	NULL
his	NULL
story	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
eventful	NULL
as	NULL
our	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
shortly	NULL
,	NULL
amounted	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
little	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
started	NULL
from	NULL
Sitanda	NULL
's	NULL
Kraal	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
reach	NULL
Suliman	NULL
's	NULL
Berg	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
note	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
Jim	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
worthy	NULL
lost	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
till	NULL
to-day	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
acting	NULL
upon	NULL
information	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
received	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
natives	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
headed	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
Sheba	NULL
's	NULL
Breasts	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
ladder-like	NULL
descent	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mountains	NULL
down	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
clearly	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
route	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
marked	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
old	NULL
Dom	NULL
Silvestra	NULL
's	NULL
plan	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
Jim	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
great	NULL
hardships	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
finally	NULL
they	NULL
reached	NULL
this	NULL
oasis	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
a	NULL
terrible	NULL
accident	NULL
befell	NULL
George	NULL
Curtis	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
arrival	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
stream	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Jim	NULL
was	NULL
extracting	NULL
the	NULL
honey	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
nest	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
stingless	NULL
bee	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bank	NULL
immediately	NULL
above	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
so	NULL
doing	NULL
he	NULL
loosened	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
boulder	NULL
of	NULL
rock	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
George	NULL
Curtis	NULL
's	NULL
right	NULL
leg	NULL
,	NULL
crushing	NULL
it	NULL
frightfully	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
lame	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
either	NULL
forward	NULL
or	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
preferred	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
chances	NULL
of	NULL
dying	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
oasis	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
certainty	NULL
of	NULL
perishing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
food	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
pretty	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
supply	NULL
of	NULL
ammunition	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
oasis	NULL
was	NULL
frequented	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
large	NULL
quantities	NULL
of	NULL
game	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
came	NULL
thither	NULL
for	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
they	NULL
shot	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
trapped	NULL
in	NULL
pitfalls	NULL
,	NULL
using	NULL
the	NULL
flesh	NULL
for	NULL
food	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
their	NULL
clothes	NULL
wore	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
hides	NULL
for	NULL
clothing	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
George	NULL
Curtis	NULL
ended	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
lived	NULL
for	NULL
nearly	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
Robinson	NULL
Crusoe	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
man	NULL
Friday	NULL
,	NULL
hoping	NULL
against	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
natives	NULL
might	NULL
come	NULL
here	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
us	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
none	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

Only	NULL
last	NULL
night	NULL
we	NULL
settled	NULL
that	NULL
Jim	NULL
should	NULL
leave	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
reach	NULL
Sitanda	NULL
's	NULL
Kraal	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
assistance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
little	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
ever	NULL
seeing	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
_	NULL
you	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
_	NULL
you	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
fancied	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
forgotten	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
living	NULL
comfortably	NULL
in	NULL
old	NULL
England	NULL
,	NULL
turn	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
promiscuous	NULL
way	NULL
and	NULL
find	NULL
me	NULL
where	NULL
you	NULL
least	NULL
expected	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
wonderful	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
ever	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
merciful	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
main	NULL
facts	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
adventures	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
till	NULL
late	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
By	NULL
Jove	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
George	NULL
Curtis	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
showed	NULL
him	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
diamonds	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
something	NULL
for	NULL
your	NULL
pains	NULL

besides	NULL
my	NULL
worthless	NULL
self	NULL

"	NULL

Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
laughed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
belong	NULL
to	NULL
Quatermain	NULL
and	NULL
Good	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bargain	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
divide	NULL
any	NULL
spoils	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

This	NULL
remark	NULL
set	NULL
me	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
told	NULL
Sir	NULL
Henry	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
our	NULL
joint	NULL
wish	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
third	NULL
portion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
diamonds	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
share	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
handed	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
brother	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
even	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
ourselves	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Finally	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
prevailed	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
consent	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
arrangement	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
George	NULL
Curtis	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
until	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
afterwards	NULL
.	NULL

*	NULL
*	NULL
*	NULL
*	NULL
*	NULL
Here	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
point	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
end	NULL
my	NULL
history	NULL
.	NULL

Our	NULL
journey	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Sitanda	NULL
's	NULL
Kraal	NULL
was	NULL
most	NULL
arduous	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
support	NULL
George	NULL
Curtis	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
right	NULL
leg	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
weak	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
continually	NULL
threw	NULL
out	NULL
splinters	NULL
of	NULL
bone	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
we	NULL
did	NULL
accomplish	NULL
it	NULL
somehow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
its	NULL
details	NULL
would	NULL
only	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
reproduce	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
former	NULL
occasion	NULL
.	NULL

Six	NULL
months	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
date	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
re-arrival	NULL
at	NULL
Sitanda	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
we	NULL
found	NULL
our	NULL
guns	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
goods	NULL
quite	NULL
safe	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
rascal	NULL
in	NULL
charge	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
disgusted	NULL
at	NULL
our	NULL
surviving	NULL
to	NULL
claim	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
saw	NULL
us	NULL
all	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
safe	NULL

sound	NULL
at	NULL
my	NULL
little	NULL
place	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Berea	NULL
,	NULL
near	NULL
Durban	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
now	NULL
writing	NULL

Thence	NULL
I	NULL
bid	NULL
farewell	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
accompanied	NULL

through	NULL
the	NULL

as	NULL

turned	NULL

it	NULL

My	NULL
Dear	NULL
Quatermain	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
send	NULL
you	NULL
a	NULL
line	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
mails	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
George	NULL
,	NULL
Good	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
fetched	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
got	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
boat	NULL
at	NULL
Southampton	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
swell	NULL
Good	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
beautifully	NULL
shaved	NULL
,	NULL
frock	NULL
coat	NULL
fitting	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
glove	NULL
,	NULL
brand	NULL
new	NULL
eye-glass	NULL
,	NULL
etc.	NULL
,	NULL
etc	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
went	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
park	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
I	NULL
met	NULL
some	NULL
people	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
told	NULL
them	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
"	NULL
beautiful	NULL
white	NULL
legs	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
furious	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
as	NULL
some	NULL
ill-natured	NULL
person	NULL
has	NULL
printed	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
Society	NULL
paper	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
Good	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
diamonds	NULL
to	NULL
Streeter	NULL
's	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
valued	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
arranged	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
really	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
afraid	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
put	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seems	NULL
so	NULL
enormous	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
guess-work	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
such	NULL
stones	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
knowledge	NULL
been	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
market	NULL
in	NULL
anything	NULL
like	NULL
such	NULL
quantities	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
appears	NULL
that	NULL
(	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
exception	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
largest	NULL
)	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
finest	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
equal	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
Brazilian	NULL
stones	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
asked	NULL
them	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
buy	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
beyond	NULL
their	NULL
power	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
recommended	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
sell	NULL
by	NULL
degrees	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
period	NULL
of	NULL
years	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
fear	NULL
lest	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
flood	NULL
the	NULL
market	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
offer	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
and	NULL
eighty	NULL
thousand	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
small	NULL
portion	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
must	NULL
come	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
Quatermain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
about	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
insist	NULL
upon	NULL
making	NULL
the	NULL
magnificent	NULL
present	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
share	NULL

which	NULL
does	NULL

Good	NULL

he	NULL
is	NULL
_	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL

His	NULL
time	NULL
is	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
occupied	NULL
in	NULL
shaving	NULL

and	NULL
other	NULL
matters	NULL
connected	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
vain	NULL
adorning	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
still	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
luck	NULL
about	NULL
Foulata	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
home	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
seen	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
to	NULL
touch	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
either	NULL
as	NULL
regards	NULL
her	NULL
figure	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
sweetness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
expression	NULL

I	NULL
want	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
home	NULL

my	NULL
dear	NULL
old	NULL
comrade	NULL

and	NULL

done	NULL
your	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL

and	NULL
have	NULL
lots	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
for	NULL
sale	NULL
quite	NULL
close	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
suit	NULL
you	NULL
admirably	NULL
.	NULL

Do	NULL
come	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
sooner	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
;	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
finish	NULL
writing	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
adventures	NULL
on	NULL

We	NULL
have	NULL
refused	NULL

it	NULL

written	NULL
by	NULL
you	NULL

for	NULL

If	NULL
you	NULL
start	NULL
on	NULL
receipt	NULL

this	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
reach	NULL
here	NULL
by	NULL
Christmas	NULL

him	NULL
down	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL

's	NULL
shooting	NULL

and	NULL
like	NULL
him	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
cool	NULL

he	NULL
shot	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
leg	NULL

cut	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
pellets	NULL
