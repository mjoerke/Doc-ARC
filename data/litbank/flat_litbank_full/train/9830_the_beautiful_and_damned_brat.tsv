THE	B-PER

that	O

It	O
was	O
as	O
a	O

He	NULL

THE	NULL
REPROACHLESS	NULL
APARTMENT	NULL
Fifth	NULL

Sixth	NULL
Avenues	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Anthony	NULL

were	NULL
the	NULL
uprights	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
gigantic	NULL
ladder	NULL
stretching	NULL
from	NULL
Washington	NULL
Square	NULL
to	NULL
Central	NULL
Park	NULL
.	NULL

Coming	NULL
up-town	NULL
on	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bus	NULL
toward	NULL
Fifty-second	NULL
Street	NULL
invariably	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
sensation	NULL
of	NULL
hoisting	NULL
himself	NULL
hand	NULL
by	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
series	NULL
of	NULL
treacherous	NULL
rungs	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
bus	NULL
jolted	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
stop	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
rung	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
something	NULL
akin	NULL
to	NULL
relief	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
descended	NULL
the	NULL
reckless	NULL
metal	NULL
steps	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sidewalk	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
down	NULL
Fifty-second	NULL
Street	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
block	NULL
,	NULL
pass	NULL
a	NULL
stodgy	NULL
family	NULL
of	NULL
brownstone	NULL
houses	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
jiffy	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
ceilings	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
great	NULL
front	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
entirely	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
life	NULL
began	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
he	NULL
slept	NULL
,	NULL
breakfasted	NULL
,	NULL
read	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
entertained	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
house	NULL
itself	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
murky	NULL
material	NULL
,	NULL
built	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
late	NULL
nineties	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
response	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
steadily	NULL
growing	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
small	NULL
apartments	NULL
each	NULL
floor	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
remodelled	NULL

rented	NULL
individually	NULL

Of	NULL
the	NULL
four	NULL
apartments	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
desirable	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
front	NULL
room	NULL
had	NULL
fine	NULL
high	NULL
ceilings	NULL
and	NULL
three	NULL
large	NULL
windows	NULL
that	NULL
loomed	NULL
down	NULL
pleasantly	NULL
upon	NULL
Fifty-second	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
its	NULL
appointments	NULL
it	NULL
escaped	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
safe	NULL
margin	NULL
being	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
particular	NULL
period	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
escaped	NULL
stiffness	NULL
,	NULL
stuffiness	NULL
,	NULL
bareness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
decadence	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
smelt	NULL
neither	NULL
of	NULL
smoke	NULL
nor	NULL
of	NULL
incense	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
tall	NULL
and	NULL
faintly	NULL
blue	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
lounge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
softest	NULL
brown	NULL
leather	NULL
with	NULL
somnolence	NULL
drifting	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
haze	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
high	NULL
screen	NULL
of	NULL
Chinese	NULL
lacquer	NULL
chiefly	NULL
concerned	NULL
with	NULL
geometrical	NULL
fishermen	NULL
and	NULL
huntsmen	NULL
in	NULL
black	NULL
and	NULL
gold	NULL
;	NULL
this	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
corner	NULL
alcove	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
voluminous	NULL
chair	NULL
guarded	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
orange-colored	NULL
standing	NULL
lamp	NULL
.	NULL

Deep	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fireplace	NULL
a	NULL
quartered	NULL

was	NULL
burned	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
murky	NULL
black	NULL

the	NULL
dining-room	NULL

which	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Anthony	NULL
took	NULL
only	NULL
breakfast	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
merely	NULL
a	NULL
magnificent	NULL
potentiality	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
comparatively	NULL
long	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
core	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
apartment	NULL
--	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
bedroom	NULL
and	NULL
bath	NULL
.	NULL

Both	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
immense	NULL
.	NULL

Under	NULL
the	NULL
ceilings	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
former	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
canopied	NULL
bed	NULL
seemed	NULL
of	NULL
only	NULL
average	NULL
size	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
an	NULL
exotic	NULL
rug	NULL
of	NULL
crimson	NULL
velvet	NULL
was	NULL
soft	NULL
as	NULL
fleece	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
bare	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
bathroom	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
contrast	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rather	NULL
portentous	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
bedroom	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
gay	NULL
,	NULL
bright	NULL
,	NULL
extremely	NULL
habitable	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
faintly	NULL
facetious	NULL
.	NULL

Framed	NULL
around	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL
were	NULL
photographs	NULL

equipped	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL

was	NULL
low	NULL

Beside	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL

wardrobe	NULL
bulged	NULL
with	NULL
sufficient	NULL
linen	NULL
for	NULL
three	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

instead	NULL

a	NULL

felt	NULL

lost	NULL

technic	NULL
was	NULL
marred	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wore	NULL

collar	NULL

Had	NULL
he	NULL

Anthony	NULL

this	NULL

summarily	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
the	NULL
Bounds	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
other	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
neighborhood	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
eight	NULL
until	NULL
eleven	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
entirely	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
arrived	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
mail	NULL
and	NULL
cooked	NULL
breakfast	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
nine-thirty	NULL
he	NULL
pulled	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
blanket	NULL
and	NULL
spoke	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
terse	NULL
words	NULL
--	NULL
Anthony	NULL
never	NULL
remembered	NULL
clearly	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
and	NULL
rather	NULL
suspected	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
deprecative	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
served	NULL
breakfast	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
card-table	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL

,	NULL
after	NULL
asking	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
hostility	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
anything	NULL

,	NULL
withdrew	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
mornings	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
broker	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
income	NULL
was	NULL
slightly	NULL
under	NULL
seven	NULL
thousand	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
interest	NULL
on	NULL
money	NULL
inherited	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
grandfather	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
allowed	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
son	NULL
to	NULL
graduate	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
liberal	NULL
allowance	NULL
,	NULL
judged	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
sum	NULL
was	NULL
sufficient	NULL
for	NULL
young	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
needs	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
Christmas	NULL
he	NULL
sent	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
five-hundred-dollar	NULL
bond	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Anthony	NULL
usually	NULL
sold	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
,	NULL
hard	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
visits	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
broker	NULL
varied	NULL
from	NULL
semi-social	NULL
chats	NULL
to	NULL
discussions	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
safety	NULL
of	NULL
eight	NULL
per	NULL
cent	NULL
investments	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Anthony	NULL
always	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
big	NULL
trust	NULL
company	NULL
building	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
link	NULL
him	NULL
definitely	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
fortunes	NULL
whose	NULL
solidarity	NULL
he	NULL
respected	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
assure	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
adequately	NULL
chaperoned	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
hierarchy	NULL
of	NULL
finance	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
these	NULL
hurried	NULL
men	NULL
he	NULL
derived	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
safety	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
contemplating	NULL
his	NULL
grandfather	NULL
's	NULL
money	NULL
--	NULL
even	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
vaguely	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
demand	NULL

made	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
to	NULL
Adam	NULL
Patch	NULL
's	NULL
own	NULL
moral	NULL
righteousness	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
this	NULL
money	NULL
down-town	NULL
seemed	NULL
rather	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
grasped	NULL
and	NULL
held	NULL
by	NULL
sheer	NULL
indomitable	NULL
strengths	NULL
and	NULL
tremendous	NULL
feats	NULL
of	NULL
will	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
addition	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
more	NULL
definitely	NULL
and	NULL
explicitly	NULL
--	NULL

.	NULL

Closely	NULL
as	NULL
Anthony	NULL
trod	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
heels	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
income	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
considered	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
golden	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
many	NULL
millions	NULL
;	NULL

he	NULL
possessed	NULL

the	NULL

creation	NULL

.	NULL

This	NULL
flashes	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
grandfather	NULL
immediately	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
return	NULL
from	NULL
Rome	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
hoped	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
his	NULL
grandfather	NULL
dead	NULL

but	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
by	NULL
telephoning	NULL
from	NULL

Adam	NULL

comparatively	NULL
well	NULL
again	NULL

day	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
concealed	NULL
his	NULL
disappointment	NULL
and	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
Tarrytown	NULL
.	NULL

Five	NULL
miles	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

entered	NULL
an	NULL
elaborately	NULL

Anthony	NULL
was	NULL
late	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
venerable	NULL
philanthropist	NULL
was	NULL
awaiting	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
glass-walled	NULL
sun	NULL
parlor	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
glancing	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL

His	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
mildly	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
irritated	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
for	NULL
Anthony	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
delusion	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
youth	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
handled	NULL
his	NULL
practical	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
scrupulousness	NULL

even	NULL
to	NULL
keeping	NULL
every	NULL

but	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL

primary	NULL
cause	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
success	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
remarked	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
shade	NULL
of	NULL
meek	NULL
accusation	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
sigh	NULL

"	NULL
Sit	NULL

Anthony	NULL
surveyed	NULL
his	NULL
grandfather	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
tacit	NULL
amazement	NULL
which	NULL
always	NULL
attended	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
this	NULL
feeble	NULL
,	NULL
unintelligent	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
possessed	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
power	NULL
that	NULL

bought	NULL
directly	NULL

seemed	NULL

to	NULL
believe	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
pink-and-white	NULL
baby	NULL

The	NULL
span	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
seventy-five	NULL
years	NULL
had	NULL
acted	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
magic	NULL
bellows	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
quarter-century	NULL
had	NULL
blown	NULL
him	NULL
full	NULL
with	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
had	NULL
sucked	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
sucked	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cheeks	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
chest	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girth	NULL
of	NULL
arm	NULL
and	NULL
leg	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
tyrannously	NULL
demanded	NULL
his	NULL
teeth	NULL

one	NULL

suspended	NULL
his	NULL
small	NULL
eyes	NULL
in	NULL
dark-bluish	NULL
sacks	NULL

tweeked	NULL
out	NULL

callously	NULL

Then	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
body	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
attacked	NULL
his	NULL
brain	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
him	NULL
night-sweats	NULL
and	NULL
tears	NULL
and	NULL
unfounded	NULL
dreads	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
split	NULL
his	NULL
intense	NULL
normality	NULL
into	NULL
credulity	NULL
and	NULL
suspicion	NULL
.	NULL

Out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

his	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
cut	NULL
dozens	NULL
of	NULL

obsessions	NULL

his	NULL
energy	NULL
was	NULL
shrunk	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL

and	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
will	NULL

desire	NULL

The	NULL

gingerly	NULL

Anthony	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL

a	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
that	NULL

have	NULL

enough	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL

conclusion	NULL

when	NULL
Anthony	NULL

week	NULL
of	NULL
pleasant	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sunshine	NULL
loitering	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cross-streets	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
so	NULL
languid	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
seem	NULL
weighted	NULL
with	NULL
ghostly	NULL
falling	NULL
leaves	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
lazily	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
window	NULL
finishing	NULL
a	NULL
chapter	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
Erewhon	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
yawn	NULL
about	NULL
five	NULL
,	NULL
toss	NULL
the	NULL
book	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saunter	NULL
humming	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
bath	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
To	NULL
...	NULL
you	NULL
...	NULL
beaut-if-ul	NULL
lady	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
singing	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
tap	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
raise	NULL
...	NULL
my	NULL
...	NULL
eyes	NULL
;	NULL
To	NULL
...	NULL
you	NULL
...	NULL
beaut-if-ul	NULL
la-a-dy	NULL
My	NULL
...	NULL
heart	NULL
...	NULL
cries	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
He	NULL
raised	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
to	NULL
compete	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
flood	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
pouring	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
tub	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
picture	NULL
of	NULL
Hazel	NULL
Dawn	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
an	NULL
imaginary	NULL
violin	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
shoulder	NULL
and	NULL
softly	NULL
caressed	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
phantom	NULL
bow	NULL
.	NULL

Through	NULL
his	NULL
closed	NULL
lips	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
humming	NULL
noise	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
vaguely	NULL
imagined	NULL
resembled	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
violin	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
ceased	NULL
their	NULL
gyrations	NULL
and	NULL
wandered	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
shirt	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
unfasten	NULL
.	NULL

Stripped	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
adopting	NULL
an	NULL
athletic	NULL
posture	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
tiger-skin	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
advertisement	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
regarded	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mirror	NULL
,	NULL
breaking	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
dabble	NULL
a	NULL
tentative	NULL
foot	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tub	NULL
.	NULL

Readjusting	NULL
a	NULL
faucet	NULL
and	NULL
indulging	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
preliminary	NULL
grunts	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
slid	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
temperature	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
he	NULL
relaxed	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
drowsy	NULL
content	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
finished	NULL
his	NULL
bath	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
dress	NULL
leisurely	NULL
and	NULL
walk	NULL
down	NULL
Fifth	NULL
Avenue	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Ritz	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
appointment	NULL
for	NULL
dinner	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
two	NULL
most	NULL
frequent	NULL
companions	NULL
,	NULL
Dick	NULL
Caramel	NULL
and	NULL
Maury	NULL
Noble	NULL
.	NULL

Afterward	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
Maury	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
theatre	NULL
--	NULL
Caramel	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
trot	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
work	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
book	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
finished	NULL
pretty	NULL
soon	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
_	NULL
he	NULL
_	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
on	NULL
_	NULL
his	NULL
_	NULL
book	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
notion	NULL
of	NULL
sitting	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
conjuring	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
words	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
clothe	NULL
thoughts	NULL
but	NULL
thoughts	NULL
worthy	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
clothed	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
absurdly	NULL
beyond	NULL
his	NULL
desires	NULL
.	NULL

Emerging	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
bath	NULL
he	NULL
polished	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
meticulous	NULL
attention	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bootblack	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
wandered	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bedroom	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whistling	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
a	NULL
weird	NULL
,	NULL
uncertain	NULL
melody	NULL
,	NULL
strolled	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
buttoning	NULL
,	NULL
adjusting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
enjoying	NULL
the	NULL
warmth	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
thick	NULL
carpet	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
lit	NULL
a	NULL
cigarette	NULL
,	NULL
tossed	NULL
the	NULL
match	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
paused	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
tracks	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
cigarette	NULL
two	NULL
inches	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
fell	NULL
faintly	NULL
ajar	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
focussed	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
spot	NULL
of	NULL
brilliant	NULL
color	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
roof	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
farther	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
alley	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
red	NULL
negligé	NULL
,	NULL
silk	NULL
surely	NULL
,	NULL
drying	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
still	NULL
hot	NULL
sun	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
whistle	NULL
died	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
stiff	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
cautiously	NULL
another	NULL
step	NULL
nearer	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
beautiful	NULL
.	NULL

Sitting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stone	NULL
parapet	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
cushion	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
color	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
garment	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
leaning	NULL
both	NULL
arms	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
sunny	NULL
areaway	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
Anthony	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL
children	NULL
playing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
watched	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
several	NULL
minutes	NULL
.	NULL

Something	NULL
was	NULL
stirred	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
not	NULL
accounted	NULL
for	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
warm	NULL
smell	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
triumphant	NULL
vividness	NULL
of	NULL
red	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
persistently	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
beautiful	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
he	NULL
understood	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
distance	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
rare	NULL
and	NULL
precious	NULL
distance	NULL
of	NULL
soul	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
distance	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
terrestrial	NULL
yards	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
autumn	NULL
air	NULL
was	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
roofs	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
blurred	NULL
voices	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
not	NULL
altogether	NULL
explained	NULL
second	NULL
,	NULL
posing	NULL
perversely	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
emotion	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
nearer	NULL
to	NULL
adoration	NULL
than	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
deepest	NULL
kiss	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
known	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
finished	NULL
his	NULL
dressing	NULL
,	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
bow	NULL
tie	NULL
and	NULL
adjusted	NULL
it	NULL
carefully	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
three-sided	NULL
mirror	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bathroom	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
yielding	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
impulse	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
quickly	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bedroom	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
looked	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
woman	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
up	NULL
now	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
tossed	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
full	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
fat	NULL
,	NULL
full	NULL
thirty-five	NULL
,	NULL
utterly	NULL
undistinguished	NULL
.	NULL

Making	NULL
a	NULL
clicking	NULL
noise	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
he	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bathroom	NULL
and	NULL
reparted	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
To	NULL
...	NULL
you	NULL
...	NULL
beaut-if-ul	NULL
lady	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
sang	NULL
lightly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
raise	NULL
...	NULL
my	NULL
...	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
last	NULL
soothing	NULL
brush	NULL
that	NULL
left	NULL
an	NULL
iridescent	NULL
surface	NULL
of	NULL
sheer	NULL
gloss	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
his	NULL
bathroom	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
apartment	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
down	NULL
Fifth	NULL
Avenue	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Ritz-Carlton	NULL

THREE	NULL

At	NULL

Anthony	NULL

is	NULL

His	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
smell	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
hot	NULL
,	NULL
doughy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pink	NULL

A	NULL
drug-store	NULL

exhaling	NULL

spilt	NULL
soda	NULL

a	NULL
pleasant	NULL

a	NULL

open	NULL

steamy	NULL
and	NULL
stifling	NULL

smelling	NULL

vaguely	NULL
yellow	NULL

All	NULL
these	NULL
depressed	NULL
him	NULL

reaching	NULL
Sixth	NULL
Avenue	NULL
he	NULL
stopped	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
corner	NULL

emerged	NULL
feeling	NULL
better	NULL

the	NULL
cigar	NULL

was	NULL
cheerful	NULL

humanity	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
navy	NULL

buying	NULL
a	NULL
luxury	NULL
...	NULL

Once	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
apartment	NULL
he	NULL
smoked	NULL
a	NULL
last	NULL
cigarette	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
open	NULL
front	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
enjoying	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
rare	NULL
pungency	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
certainly	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
quality	NULL
almost	NULL
Southern	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
lonesome	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL

He	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
up	NULL
alone	NULL
had	NULL
lately	NULL
learned	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
solitude	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
several	NULL
months	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
careful	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
engagement	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
hurry	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
clubs	NULL
and	NULL
find	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

Oh	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
loneliness	NULL
here	NULL
----	NULL
His	NULL
cigarette	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
smoke	NULL
bordering	NULL
the	NULL
thin	NULL
folds	NULL
of	NULL
curtain	NULL
with	NULL
rims	NULL
of	NULL
faint	NULL
white	NULL
spray	NULL
,	NULL
glowed	NULL
on	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
clock	NULL
in	NULL
St.	NULL
Anne	NULL
's	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
struck	NULL
one	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
querulous	NULL
fashionable	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
elevated	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
block	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
sounded	NULL
a	NULL
rumble	NULL
of	NULL
drums	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
should	NULL
he	NULL
lean	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
window	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
angry	NULL
eagle	NULL
,	NULL
breasting	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
curve	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
reminded	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fantastic	NULL
romance	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lately	NULL
read	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
cities	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
bombed	NULL
from	NULL
aerial	NULL
trains	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
fancied	NULL
that	NULL
Washington	NULL
Square	NULL
had	NULL
declared	NULL
war	NULL
on	NULL
Central	NULL
Park	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
north-bound	NULL
menace	NULL
loaded	NULL
with	NULL
battle	NULL
and	NULL
sudden	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
illusion	NULL
faded	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
diminished	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
faintest	NULL
of	NULL
drums	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
far-away	NULL
droning	NULL
eagle	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
bells	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
continued	NULL
low	NULL
blur	NULL
of	NULL
auto	NULL
horns	NULL
from	NULL
Fifth	NULL
Avenue	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
street	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
safe	NULL
in	NULL
here	NULL
from	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
threat	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
hall	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
guardian	NULL
bedroom	NULL
--	NULL
safe	NULL

safe	NULL

The	NULL
arc-light	NULL
shining	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
window	NULL
seemed	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
hour	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL

only	NULL
brighter	NULL

His	NULL
habits	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
three	NULL
rooms	NULL
in	NULL

Forty-forth	NULL
street	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
seldom	NULL

be	NULL
found	NULL
there	NULL

The	NULL
telephone	NULL

had	NULL
received	NULL
the	NULL

positive	NULL
instructions	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL

His	NULL
spirits	NULL
soared	NULL

Maury	NULL

who	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
equally	NULL
happy	NULL
at	NULL
seeing	NULL
him	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
affection	NULL
just	NULL
behind	NULL
their	NULL
eyes	NULL
which	NULL
both	NULL
would	NULL
conceal	NULL
beneath	NULL
some	NULL
attenuated	NULL
raillery	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
it	NULL
been	NULL
summer	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
together	NULL
and	NULL
indolently	NULL
sipped	NULL
two	NULL
long	NULL
Tom	NULL

as	NULL
they	NULL
wilted	NULL

Remarkable	NULL
that	NULL

the	NULL

her	NULL

She	NULL
's	NULL
just	NULL
been	NULL
carried	NULL
along	NULL

You	NULL
could	NULL
sweep	NULL

Dick	NULL

So	NULL
long	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL

the	NULL

himself	NULL

tries	NULL

So	NULL
does	NULL
every	NULL

The	NULL
incident	NULL

character	NULL
may	NULL

from	NULL
life	NULL

the	NULL
writer	NULL
usually	NULL
interprets	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
terms	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
book	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL

For	NULL
instance	NULL
,	NULL
suppose	NULL
he	NULL
meets	NULL
a	NULL
sea	NULL
captain	NULL

thinks	NULL
he	NULL
's	NULL
an	NULL

The	NULL
truth	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
sees	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
last	NULL

created	NULL

and	NULL
therefore	NULL
he	NULL
knows	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
this	NULL
sea	NULL
captain	NULL
on	NULL
paper	NULL
.	NULL

Dick	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL

can	NULL
set	NULL
down	NULL
any	NULL
consciously	NULL
picturesque	NULL

character-like	NULL
character	NULL

could	NULL
he	NULL
accurately	NULL
transcribe	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL

it	NULL

After	NULL

a	NULL

he	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL

turning	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
dresser	NULL
light	NULL

he	NULL
contemplated	NULL

with	NULL
some	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL

his	NULL

unnaturally	NULL
pale	NULL

lit	NULL
a	NULL
cigarette	NULL

glanced	NULL
through	NULL
several	NULL

the	NULL
morning	NULL

An	NULL
hour	NULL
later	NULL

was	NULL
sitting	NULL

bowed	NULL

returning	NULL

anything	NULL

as	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL

three	NULL

several	NULL

panic	NULL

fraught	NULL

menace	NULL

stupidity	NULL

wear	NULL
proudly	NULL

culminative	NULL
wisdom	NULL

the	NULL
numbered	NULL

Over	NULL
and	NULL
against	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
brain	NULL
persistently	NULL
analyzed	NULL
and	NULL
dealt	NULL
with	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
tiresome	NULL
complex	NULL

which	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
logically	NULL
disposed	NULL
of	NULL
and	NULL
bravely	NULL
trampled	NULL
under	NULL
foot	NULL

had	NULL
sent	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
soft	NULL
slush	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
November	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
library	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
none	NULL

most	NULL
wanted	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
fair	NULL
to	NULL
analyze	NULL

as	NULL
far	NULL

could	NULL
analyze	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
further	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL

of	NULL
course	NULL

presumption	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
in	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
growing	NULL
horror	NULL
and	NULL
loneliness	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
eating	NULL
alone	NULL
frightened	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
preference	NULL

dined	NULL
often	NULL

men	NULL

detested	NULL

which	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
charmed	NULL

seemed	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL

unendurable	NULL

business	NULL

worried	NULL

On	NULL
Thursday	NULL
afternoon	NULL
Gloria	NULL

Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
tea	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL
Plaza	NULL

was	NULL

she	NULL
explained	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
toque	NULL
sat	NULL
rakishly	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
allowing	NULL
yellow	NULL
ripples	NULL
of	NULL
hair	NULL
to	NULL
wave	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
jaunty	NULL
glory	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
higher	NULL
light	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Anthony	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
personality	NULL
was	NULL
infinitely	NULL
softer	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
young	NULL

scarcely	NULL
eighteen	NULL

her	NULL
form	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
tight	NULL
sheath	NULL
,	NULL
known	NULL
then	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
hobble-skirt	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
amazingly	NULL
supple	NULL

slender	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
neither	NULL
"	NULL
artistic	NULL

nor	NULL
stubby	NULL

were	NULL
small	NULL
as	NULL

As	NULL
they	NULL
entered	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
orchestra	NULL
were	NULL
sounding	NULL
the	NULL
preliminary	NULL
whimpers	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL

a	NULL
tune	NULL
full	NULL

at	NULL

Carefully	NULL

Gloria	NULL
considered	NULL
several	NULL
locations	NULL

rather	NULL
to	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
annoyance	NULL
paraded	NULL
him	NULL
circuitously	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
table	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
far	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL

Reaching	NULL
it	NULL
she	NULL
again	NULL
considered	NULL

Would	NULL
she	NULL
sit	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL

left	NULL

Her	NULL
beautiful	NULL
eyes	NULL

lips	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
grave	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
choice	NULL

and	NULL
Anthony	NULL
thought	NULL
again	NULL
how	NULL
naïve	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
every	NULL
gesture	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
for	NULL
hers	NULL
to	NULL
choose	NULL
from	NULL
and	NULL
apportion	NULL

as	NULL

she	NULL
were	NULL
continually	NULL
picking	NULL
out	NULL
presents	NULL

herself	NULL
from	NULL

inexhaustible	NULL
counter	NULL

Abstractedly	NULL
she	NULL
watched	NULL
the	NULL
dancers	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
moments	NULL

commenting	NULL
murmurously	NULL
as	NULL

Thanks	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
cocktail	NULL
Anthony	NULL
welcomed	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
mood	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
,	NULL
moreover	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
impress	NULL
this	NULL
girl	NULL
whose	NULL
interest	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
tantalizingly	NULL
elusive	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
stopped	NULL
to	NULL
browse	NULL
in	NULL
unexpected	NULL
pastures	NULL
,	NULL
hurried	NULL
quickly	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
inobviously	NULL
obvious	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
pose	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
appear	NULL
suddenly	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
novel	NULL
and	NULL
heroic	NULL
colors	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
stir	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
casualness	NULL
she	NULL
showed	NULL
toward	NULL
everything	NULL
except	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
,	NULL
realizing	NULL
simultaneously	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
lack	NULL
the	NULL
debonair	NULL
grace	NULL
he	NULL
craved	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
nothing	NULL

for	NULL
there	NULL
's	NULL
nothing	NULL

can	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
worth	NULL
doing	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
neither	NULL
surprised	NULL
her	NULL
nor	NULL
even	NULL
held	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
certainly	NULL
understood	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
indeed	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
aught	NULL
worth	NULL
understanding	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
approve	NULL
of	NULL
lazy	NULL
men	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
nodded	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
're	NULL
gracefully	NULL
lazy	NULL

Is	NULL
that	NULL
possible	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
American	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
not	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
demanded	NULL
,	NULL
discomfited	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
and	NULL
wandered	NULL
up	NULL
ten	NULL
floors	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
daddy	NULL
's	NULL
mad	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
observed	NULL
dispassionately	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
?	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
just	NULL
why	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
American	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
gracefully	NULL
idle	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
gathered	NULL
conviction	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
it	NULL
astonishes	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL

it	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
understand	NULL
why	NULL
people	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
every	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
down-town	NULL
and	NULL
work	NULL
ten	NULL
hours	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL

at	NULL

certainly	NULL

altruistic	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
broke	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
watched	NULL
him	NULL
inscrutably	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
agree	NULL
or	NULL
disagree	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
neither	NULL

"	NULL

n't	NULL

ever	NULL
form	NULL
judgments	NULL
on	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
exasperation	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
shook	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
wandered	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dancers	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL

She	NULL
confused	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
hindered	NULL
the	NULL
flow	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
ideas	NULL
.	NULL

Self-expression	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL

he	NULL
admitted	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
paused	NULL
slightly	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
word	NULL
and	NULL
Anthony	NULL
suspected	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
"	NULL
beautiful	NULL

"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
undeniably	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
intended	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
eyes	NULL
brightened	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
enlarge	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
theme	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
drawn	NULL
her	NULL
out	NULL

at	NULL
any	NULL

he	NULL
bent	NULL
forward	NULL
slightly	NULL

But	NULL
"	NULL

all	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL

ADMIRATION	NULL
That	NULL
winter	NULL
afternoon	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Plaza	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
succession	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
dates	NULL
"	NULL
Anthony	NULL
made	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
blurred	NULL
and	NULL
stimulating	NULL
days	NULL
before	NULL
Christmas	NULL
.	NULL

Invariably	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
busy	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
particular	NULL
strata	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
's	NULL
social	NULL
life	NULL
claimed	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
finding	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
matter	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
attended	NULL
the	NULL
semi-public	NULL
charity	NULL
dances	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
hotels	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL

dinner	NULL
parties	NULL
in	NULL
Sherry	NULL

apropos	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
daughter	NULL

going	NULL

"	NULL
rattled	NULL
off	NULL
an	NULL
amazing	NULL
holiday	NULL
programme	NULL
that	NULL
included	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
dances	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
received	NULL
cards	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
engagements	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL
for	NULL
lunch	NULL
and	NULL
tea	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
former	NULL
were	NULL
hurried	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
unsatisfactory	NULL
occasions	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sleepy-eyed	NULL
and	NULL
casual	NULL
,	NULL
incapable	NULL
of	NULL
concentrating	NULL
upon	NULL
anything	NULL
or	NULL
of	NULL
giving	NULL
consecutive	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
remarks	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
after	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
sallow	NULL
meals	NULL
he	NULL
accused	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
tendering	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
skin	NULL
and	NULL
bones	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
she	NULL
laughed	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
tea-time	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
infinitely	NULL
more	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
Sunday	NULL
afternoon	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
Christmas	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lull	NULL
directly	NULL
after	NULL
some	NULL
important	NULL
but	NULL
mysterious	NULL
quarrel	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
informed	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
tone	NULL
of	NULL
mingled	NULL
wrath	NULL
and	NULL
amusement	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
apartment	NULL
--	NULL
here	NULL
Anthony	NULL
speculated	NULL
violently	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
giving	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
dinner	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
going	NULL

So	NULL
Anthony	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
supper	NULL

"	NULL

something	NULL

To	NULL
conceal	NULL
a	NULL
guilty	NULL
suspicion	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
arranged	NULL
a	NULL
performance	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
kind	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
approval	NULL
Anthony	NULL
affected	NULL
a	NULL

Well	NULL

we	NULL
'll	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
wretched	NULL
humor	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
evident	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
gray	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
granite	NULL
now	NULL
indeed	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
speaking	NULL
she	NULL
stared	NULL
straight	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
at	NULL
some	NULL
distasteful	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
lobby	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
come	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
followed	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
graceful	NULL
girl	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
enveloping	NULL
fur	NULL
,	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
taxicab	NULL

,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
definite	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL

instructed	NULL
the	NULL
driver	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
Broadway	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
turn	NULL
south	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
several	NULL
casual	NULL
attempts	NULL
at	NULL
conversation	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
adopted	NULL
an	NULL
impenetrable	NULL
armor	NULL
of	NULL
silence	NULL
and	NULL
answered	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
sentences	NULL
as	NULL
morose	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
cold	NULL
darkness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
taxicab	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
assuming	NULL
a	NULL
like	NULL
mood	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
dim	NULL
gloom	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
dozen	NULL
blocks	NULL
down	NULL
Broadway	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL

were	NULL
caught	NULL
by	NULL

He	NULL
leaned	NULL

rapped	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL

was	NULL
receiving	NULL

out	NULL

prepared	NULL

Gloria	NULL

seated	NULL

about	NULL

At	NULL

a	NULL

were	NULL
in	NULL
process	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
joined	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
party	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
evidently	NULL
late	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
study	NULL
in	NULL
national	NULL
sociology	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
meeting	NULL
some	NULL
new	NULL
men	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
pretending	NULL
desperately	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
gesture	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
pretending	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
words	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
scarcely	NULL
perceptible	NULL
motionings	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
eyelids	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
belonged	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
class	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
superior	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
class	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
now	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL

and	NULL
presently	NULL
would	NULL
again	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
higher	NULL
,	NULL
rarer	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
painfully	NULL
refined	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
last	NULL
year	NULL
's	NULL
hat	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
violets	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
yearningly	NULL
pretentious	NULL
and	NULL
palpably	NULL
artificial	NULL
than	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Fascinated	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
and	NULL
Gloria	NULL
watched	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
sit	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
radiate	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
condescendingly	NULL
present	NULL

For	NULL
_	NULL
me	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
said	NULL

this	NULL
is	NULL
practically	NULL
a	NULL

expedition	NULL

to	NULL
be	NULL
cloaked	NULL
with	NULL
belittling	NULL
laughter	NULL
and	NULL
semi-apologetics	NULL
.	NULL

--	NULL
And	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
women	NULL
passionately	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
crowd	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
place	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
accustomed	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
dropped	NULL
in	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
near	NULL
by	NULL
and	NULL
convenient	NULL
--	NULL
every	NULL
party	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
restaurant	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
impression	NULL
...	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
?	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
forever	NULL
changing	NULL
class	NULL

all	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
often	NULL
marrying	NULL
above	NULL
their	NULL
opportunities	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
striking	NULL
suddenly	NULL
a	NULL
magnificent	NULL

a	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
preposterous	NULL
advertising	NULL
scheme	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
celestialized	NULL

.	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
met	NULL
here	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
,	NULL
closing	NULL
their	NULL
eyes	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
economy	NULL
displayed	NULL
in	NULL

One	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL

One	NULL
expected	NULL

sit	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
tables	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
Do	NULL

inquired	NULL
Anthony	NULL
.	NULL

Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
warmed	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
she	NULL
smiled	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
love	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
frankly	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
doubt	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
gray	NULL
eyes	NULL
roved	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
drowsing	NULL
,	NULL
idle	NULL
or	NULL
alert	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
group	NULL
,	NULL
passing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
with	NULL
unconcealed	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
Anthony	NULL
were	NULL
made	NULL
plain	NULL
the	NULL
different	NULL
values	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
profile	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
wonderfully	NULL
alive	NULL
expressions	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
authentic	NULL
distinction	NULL
of	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
form	NULL
and	NULL
manner	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
flower	NULL
amidst	NULL
a	NULL
collection	NULL
of	NULL
cheap	NULL
bric-à-brac	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
her	NULL
happiness	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
gorgeous	NULL
sentiment	NULL
welled	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
choked	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
set	NULL
his	NULL
nerves	NULL
a-tingle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
filled	NULL
his	NULL
throat	NULL
with	NULL
husky	NULL
and	NULL
vibrant	NULL
emotion	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
hush	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
careless	NULL
violins	NULL
and	NULL
saxophones	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
shrill	NULL
rasping	NULL
complaint	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
near	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
violet-hatted	NULL
girl	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
moved	NULL
slowly	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
receded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
away	NULL
like	NULL
shadowy	NULL
reflections	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
shining	NULL
floor	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
alone	NULL
and	NULL
infinitely	NULL
remote	NULL
,	NULL
quiet	NULL
.	NULL

Surely	NULL
the	NULL
freshness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
gossamer	NULL
projection	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
land	NULL
of	NULL
delicate	NULL
and	NULL
undiscovered	NULL
shades	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
gleaming	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stained	NULL
table-cloth	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
shell	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
far	NULL
and	NULL
wildly	NULL
virginal	NULL
sea	NULL

.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
illusion	NULL
snapped	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
nest	NULL
of	NULL
threads	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
grouped	NULL
itself	NULL
around	NULL
him	NULL

movement	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
garish	NULL
shimmer	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lights	NULL
overhead	NULL
became	NULL
real	NULL

became	NULL
portentous	NULL
;	NULL
breath	NULL
began	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
slow	NULL
respiration	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
docile	NULL
hundred	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
rise	NULL
and	NULL
fall	NULL
of	NULL
bosoms	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
eternal	NULL
meaningless	NULL
play	NULL
and	NULL
interplay	NULL
and	NULL
tossing	NULL
and	NULL
reiterating	NULL
of	NULL
word	NULL
and	NULL
phrase	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
wrenched	NULL
his	NULL
senses	NULL
open	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
suffocating	NULL
pressure	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
came	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
cool	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
suspended	NULL
dream	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
behind	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
murmured	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL

"	NULL

For	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
this	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
sardonic	NULL
and	NULL
unnecessary	NULL
paradox	NULL
hurled	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
across	NULL

Again	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
pervasive	NULL
illusion	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
amazed	NULL
him	NULL

hesitated	NULL

her	NULL

came	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

rested	NULL
abruptly	NULL
on	NULL

an	NULL
instant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
exhalation	NULL
her	NULL
words	NULL
flowed	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
torrent	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
cried	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
whisper	NULL
;	NULL
oh	NULL
,	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
mothers	NULL
see	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
what	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
Gloria	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
'd	NULL
seen	NULL
enough	NULL
of	NULL
Gloria	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
hopeless	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
deal	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Gloria	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
spoiled	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
complete	NULL
and	NULL
unusual	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
suckled	NULL
until	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
three	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
instance	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
probably	NULL
have	NULL
chewed	NULL
sticks	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
--	NULL
one	NULL
never	NULL
knew	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
that	NULL
health	NULL
and	NULL
_	NULL
hardiness	NULL
_	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
whole	NULL
personality	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
ever	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
twelve	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
she	NULL
'd	NULL
had	NULL
boys	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
thick	NULL
--	NULL
oh	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
thick	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
_	NULL
move	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
sixteen	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
dances	NULL
at	NULL
preparatory	NULL
schools	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
colleges	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
everywhere	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
boys	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
oh	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
eighteen	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
never	NULL
seemed	NULL
one	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
single	NULL
them	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
string	NULL
of	NULL
affairs	NULL
spread	NULL
over	NULL
about	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
altogether	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
undergraduates	NULL
,	NULL
sometimes	NULL
just	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
college	NULL
--	NULL
they	NULL
lasted	NULL
on	NULL
an	NULL
average	NULL
of	NULL
several	NULL
months	NULL
each	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
short	NULL
attractions	NULL
in	NULL
between	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
endured	NULL
longer	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
had	NULL
hoped	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
engaged	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
always	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
one	NULL
came	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
one	NULL
--	NULL
The	NULL
men	NULL
?	NULL

Oh	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
them	NULL
miserable	NULL
,	NULL
literally	NULL
!	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
kept	NULL
any	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
dignity	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
young	NULL
Carter	NULL
Kirby	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
Kansas	NULL
City	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
conceited	NULL
anyway	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
just	NULL
sailed	NULL
out	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
vanity	NULL
one	NULL
afternoon	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
for	NULL
Europe	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
others	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
--	NULL
wretched	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
never	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Gloria	NULL
had	NULL
seldom	NULL
been	NULL
deliberately	NULL
unkind	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
keep	NULL
phoning	NULL
,	NULL
writing	NULL
letters	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
long	NULL
trips	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
around	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
had	NULL
confided	NULL
in	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Gilbert	NULL
,	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
tears	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
eyes	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
get	NULL
over	NULL
Gloria	NULL
...	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
had	NULL
since	NULL
married	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
,	NULL
struck	NULL
to	NULL
kill	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
day	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carstairs	NULL
called	NULL
up	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sent	NULL
her	NULL
flowers	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
bothered	NULL
to	NULL
refuse	NULL
.	NULL

Several	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
twice	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Gilbert	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
private	NULL
engagement	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
Tudor	NULL
Baird	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
Holcome	NULL
boy	NULL
at	NULL
Pasadena	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
--	NULL
this	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
unexpectedly	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
Gloria	NULL
acting	NULL
,	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
engaged	NULL
indeed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
daughter	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
delicacy	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
an	NULL
announcement	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
announcement	NULL
never	NULL
came	NULL
;	NULL
instead	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
man	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL

Scenes	NULL

Young	NULL
men	NULL
walking	NULL
up	NULL

down	NULL

(	NULL
She	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
effect	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Dick	NULL
fancied	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Gilbert	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
letters	NULL

...	NULL
And	NULL
Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
between	NULL
tears	NULL
and	NULL
laughter	NULL
,	NULL
sorry	NULL
,	NULL
glad	NULL
,	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
miserable	NULL
,	NULL
nervous	NULL

cool	NULL

amidst	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
returning	NULL
of	NULL

substitution	NULL
of	NULL
pictures	NULL
in	NULL
immemorial	NULL
frames	NULL

and	NULL
taking	NULL
of	NULL
hot	NULL
baths	NULL
and	NULL
beginning	NULL
again	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
continued	NULL
,	NULL
assumed	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
permanency	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
harmed	NULL
Gloria	NULL
or	NULL
changed	NULL
her	NULL
or	NULL
moved	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
clear	NULL
sky	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
she	NULL
informed	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
that	NULL
undergraduates	NULL
wearied	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
absolutely	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
college	NULL
dances	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
actual	NULL
habits	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
danced	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
as	NULL
many	NULL
"	NULL
dates	NULL
"	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
dates	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
spirit	NULL
.	NULL

Previously	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
pride	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
vainglory	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
probably	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
celebrated	NULL
and	NULL
sought-after	NULL
young	NULL
beauty	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

Gloria	NULL
Gilbert	NULL
of	NULL
Kansas	NULL
City	NULL
!	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
fed	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
ruthlessly	NULL
--	NULL
enjoying	NULL
the	NULL
crowds	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
manner	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
desirable	NULL
men	NULL
singled	NULL
her	NULL
out	NULL
;	NULL
enjoying	NULL
the	NULL
fierce	NULL
jealousy	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
girls	NULL
;	NULL
enjoying	NULL
the	NULL
fabulous	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
scandalous	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
entirely	NULL
unfounded	NULL
rumors	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
instance	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Yale	NULL
swimming-pool	NULL
one	NULL
night	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
chiffon	NULL
evening	NULL
dress	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
from	NULL
loving	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
vanity	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
masculine	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
triumphant	NULL
and	NULL
dazzling	NULL
career	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
became	NULL
suddenly	NULL
anaesthetic	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
retired	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
dominated	NULL
countless	NULL
parties	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
blown	NULL
fragrantly	NULL
through	NULL
many	NULL
ballrooms	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tender	NULL
tribute	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
care	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
who	NULL
fell	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
now	NULL
was	NULL
dismissed	NULL
utterly	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
angrily	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
listlessly	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
indifferent	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
continually	NULL
broke	NULL
engagements	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
cool	NULL
assurance	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
irreproachable	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
she	NULL
insulted	NULL
would	NULL
return	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
domestic	NULL
animal	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
indifferently	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
contempt	NULL
or	NULL
pride	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
rarely	NULL
stormed	NULL
at	NULL
men	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
yawned	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
seemed	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
strange	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
growing	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

Richard	NULL
Caramel	NULL
listened	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
remained	NULL
standing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
aunt	NULL
's	NULL

drew	NULL
a	NULL

down	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
began	NULL

slowly	NULL

then	NULL
faster	NULL
and	NULL
faster	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
finished	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
staccato	NULL
note	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
bobbing	NULL
briskly	NULL
up	NULL

down	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
past	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
story	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
some	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
interests	NULL

just	NULL
at	NULL

were	NULL
family	NULL

wanted	NULL

the	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Gilbert	NULL
having	NULL
climbed	NULL
the	NULL

exposition	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
glide	NULL
swiftly	NULL
down	NULL

in	NULL

with	NULL
her	NULL
handsome	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
bovine	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
over-red	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
combined	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
resemble	NULL
Theda	NULL
Bara	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
prominent	NULL
motion	NULL
picture	NULL
actress	NULL
.	NULL

People	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
constantly	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
vampire	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
believed	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
suspected	NULL
hopefully	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
her	NULL
utmost	NULL
under	NULL
all	NULL
circumstances	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
of	NULL
danger	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
imaginative	NULL
man	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
red	NULL
flag	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
constantly	NULL
carried	NULL
,	NULL
waving	NULL
it	NULL
wildly	NULL
,	NULL
beseechingly	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
alas	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
little	NULL
spectacular	NULL
avail	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
tremendously	NULL
timely	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
latest	NULL
songs	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
latest	NULL
songs	NULL
--	NULL
when	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
was	NULL
played	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
phonograph	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
rise	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
and	NULL
rock	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
forth	NULL
and	NULL
snap	NULL
her	NULL
fingers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
music	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
accompany	NULL
herself	NULL
by	NULL
humming	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
conversation	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
timely	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
care	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
worry	NULL

lose	NULL
my	NULL
figure	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL

I	NULL
hear	NULL
that	NULL

.	NULL

Oh	NULL
,	NULL
baby	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

Her	NULL
finger-nails	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
ornate	NULL
,	NULL
polished	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
pink	NULL
and	NULL
unnatural	NULL
fever	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
clothes	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
tight	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
stylish	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
vivid	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
too	NULL
roguish	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
smile	NULL
too	NULL
coy	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
pitifully	NULL
overemphasized	NULL
from	NULL
head	NULL
to	NULL
foot	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
other	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
obviously	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
subtle	NULL
personality	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
exquisitely	NULL
dressed	NULL
Jewess	NULL
with	NULL
dark	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
lovely	NULL
milky	NULL
pallor	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
seemed	NULL
shy	NULL
and	NULL
vague	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
qualities	NULL
accentuated	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
delicate	NULL
charm	NULL
that	NULL
floated	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
family	NULL
were	NULL
"	NULL
Episcopalians	NULL

"	NULL
owned	NULL
three	NULL
smart	NULL
women	NULL
's	NULL
shops	NULL

Fifth	NULL

and	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
magnificent	NULL
apartment	NULL
on	NULL
Riverside	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Dick	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
moments	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
attempting	NULL
to	NULL
imitate	NULL
Gloria	NULL

he	NULL
wondered	NULL

properly	NULL

emerged	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
bedroom	NULL

in	NULL

every	NULL
eye	NULL
turned	NULL
on	NULL

Richard	NULL

slew	NULL

At	NULL
five	NULL

So	NULL

he	NULL
climbed	NULL
the	NULL

his	NULL
cell	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

paused	NULL

looked	NULL
down	NULL

It	NULL

Being	NULL

stopped	NULL

That	NULL

nine	NULL

up	NULL

now	NULL
he	NULL

watched	NULL
her	NULL

knew	NULL
that	NULL
presently	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
cease	NULL
dancing	NULL
and	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
left	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hoped	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
hurry	NULL

The	NULL
oysters	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
standing	NULL
some	NULL
minutes	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
Anthony	NULL

on	NULL
Gloria	NULL

dancing	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL

always	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL

fourth	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL

would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
delicate	NULL
tribute	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

meaning	NULL
"	NULL
Damn	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
consciously	NULL
intimate	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

he	NULL
began	NULL

looking	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
you	NULL
look	NULL
mighty	NULL
sweet	NULL
to-night	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
met	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
horizontal	NULL
half	NULL
foot	NULL
that	NULL
separated	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
In	NULL

he	NULL
added	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL

he	NULL
laughed	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
caught	NULL
quickly	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
remark	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
always	NULL
did	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
unexplained	NULL
allusion	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
faint	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
lowered	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
wisp	NULL
of	NULL
badinage	NULL

He	NULL
glanced	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
shoulder	NULL

Muriel	NULL
was	NULL
resting	NULL
her	NULL
brilliant	NULL
cheek	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
lapel	NULL
of	NULL
Maury	NULL
Noble	NULL
's	NULL

coat	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
powdered	NULL
left	NULL
arm	NULL
was	NULL
apparently	NULL
twisted	NULL
around	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
was	NULL
impelled	NULL
to	NULL
wonder	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
failed	NULL
to	NULL
seize	NULL
the	NULL
nape	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
eyes	NULL

turned	NULL
ceiling-ward	NULL

rolled	NULL
largely	NULL
back	NULL

forth	NULL

her	NULL
hips	NULL
swayed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
danced	NULL
she	NULL
kept	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
constant	NULL
low	NULL
singing	NULL

This	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
translation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
song	NULL
into	NULL
some	NULL
foreign	NULL
tongue	NULL
but	NULL
became	NULL
eventually	NULL
apparent	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
fill	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
metre	NULL

the	NULL

and	NULL
so	NULL
on	NULL

into	NULL
phrases	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
caught	NULL
the	NULL

Anthony	NULL

Gloria	NULL
she	NULL
acknowledged	NULL
them	NULL
only	NULL

a	NULL

a	NULL
half-closing	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL

thought	NULL

her	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
suddenly	NULL
cleared	NULL
his	NULL

said	NULL
in	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL

followed	NULL

Anthony	NULL
choked	NULL
suddenly	NULL
on	NULL

fixed	NULL

Bloeckman	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
uncertainly	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
sure	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
intention	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
recovered	NULL
his	NULL
poise	NULL

assumed	NULL
the	NULL

consciously	NULL
tolerant	NULL
smile	NULL

an	NULL

The	NULL

came	NULL
up	NULL

simultaneously	NULL
the	NULL
orchestra	NULL

came	NULL
up	NULL

had	NULL
absorbed	NULL

the	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL

assumed	NULL

Anthony	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL

telling	NULL
her	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
chewing	NULL
a	NULL

back	NULL

had	NULL
expanded	NULL

the	NULL

Ten	NULL
o'clock	NULL
found	NULL
Gloria	NULL

Anthony	NULL
beginning	NULL

Just	NULL
as	NULL

out	NULL

descended	NULL

an	NULL

on	NULL

A	NULL
cab	NULL
yawned	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
curb	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
it	NULL
moved	NULL
off	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
boat	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
labyrinthine	NULL
ocean	NULL
and	NULL
lost	NULL
itself	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
inchoate	NULL
night	NULL
masses	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
buildings	NULL

among	NULL
the	NULL
now	NULL
stilled	NULL

now	NULL
strident	NULL

cries	NULL

Anthony	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
around	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
drew	NULL
her	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
damp	NULL
,	NULL
childish	NULL
mouth	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
pale	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
wisps	NULL
and	NULL
patches	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
that	NULL
trailed	NULL
in	NULL
like	NULL
moonshine	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
foliage	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
gleaming	NULL
ripples	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
lake	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
shadows	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
bordered	NULL
the	NULL
brow	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
persuasive	NULL
unintimate	NULL
dusk	NULL

No	NULL
love	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
surely	NULL
;	NULL
nor	NULL
the	NULL
imprint	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
love	NULL

Her	NULL
beauty	NULL
was	NULL
cool	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
damp	NULL
breeze	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
moist	NULL
softness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
lips	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
swan	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
light	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
whispered	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
silences	NULL
as	NULL
murmurous	NULL
as	NULL
sound	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
pauses	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
shatter	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
snatched	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
oblivion	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
tightening	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
resting	NULL
there	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
caught	NULL
,	NULL
gossamer	NULL
feather	NULL
,	NULL
drifted	NULL
in	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
laughed	NULL
,	NULL
noiselessly	NULL
and	NULL
exultantly	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
overpowering	NULL
rush	NULL
of	NULL
triumph	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
lest	NULL
her	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
should	NULL
spoil	NULL
the	NULL
splendid	NULL
immobility	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
expression	NULL

Such	NULL
a	NULL
kiss	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
flower	NULL
held	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL

described	NULL

scarcely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
remembered	NULL

as	NULL
though	NULL
her	NULL
beauty	NULL
were	NULL
giving	NULL
off	NULL
emanations	NULL
of	NULL
itself	NULL

settled	NULL
transiently	NULL

already	NULL
dissolving	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL

the	NULL

Her	NULL
eyes	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
regard	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL

many	NULL

all	NULL

all	NULL

"	NULL

Up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
supper	NULL
room	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
was	NULL
hot	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
littered	NULL
with	NULL
napkins	NULL
and	NULL
ash-trays	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
old	NULL
and	NULL
stale	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
between	NULL
dances	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
entered	NULL

and	NULL
Muriel	NULL
Kane	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
roguishness	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
followed	NULL
an	NULL
incident	NULL
that	NULL
though	NULL
slight	NULL
in	NULL
itself	NULL
Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
cause	NULL
to	NULL
reflect	NULL
on	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
afterward	NULL

Joseph	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
,	NULL
leaning	NULL
well	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL

fixed	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
glance	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
several	NULL
emotions	NULL
were	NULL
curiously	NULL
and	NULL
inextricably	NULL
mingled	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
greet	NULL
Gloria	NULL
except	NULL
by	NULL
rising	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
immediately	NULL
resumed	NULL
a	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
Richard	NULL

about	NULL
the	NULL
influence	NULL

literature	NULL

the	NULL

The	NULL

out	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

Along	NULL
the	NULL
shelves	NULL

Anthony	NULL
's	NULL

,	NULL
filling	NULL
a	NULL
wall	NULL
amply	NULL
,	NULL
crept	NULL
a	NULL

Thérèse	NULL

then	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL

into	NULL
the	NULL

Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
shaved	NULL
and	NULL
bathed	NULL
,	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
most	NULL
deeply	NULL
cushioned	NULL
chair	NULL
and	NULL
watched	NULL
it	NULL
until	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
steady	NULL
rising	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
it	NULL
lay	NULL
glinting	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
silk	NULL
ends	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rug	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
ten	NULL
o'clock	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Sunday	NULL
Times	NULL
,	NULL
scattered	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
proclaimed	NULL
by	NULL
rotogravure	NULL
and	NULL
editorial	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
social	NULL
revelation	NULL
and	NULL
sporting	NULL
sheet	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
tremendously	NULL
engrossed	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
week	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
business	NULL
of	NULL
moving	NULL
toward	NULL
some	NULL
splendid	NULL
if	NULL
somewhat	NULL
indeterminate	NULL
goal	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
his	NULL
part	NULL
Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
once	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
grandfather	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
twice	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
broker	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
tailor	NULL
's	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
hour	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
's	NULL
last	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
kissed	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
beautiful	NULL
and	NULL
charming	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
reached	NULL
home	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
teeming	NULL
with	NULL
high	NULL
pitched	NULL
,	NULL
unfamiliar	NULL
dreams	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
suddenly	NULL
no	NULL
question	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
eternal	NULL
problem	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
solution	NULL
and	NULL
resolution	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
experienced	NULL
an	NULL
emotion	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
neither	NULL
mental	NULL
nor	NULL
physical	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
merely	NULL
a	NULL
mixture	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
love	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
absorbed	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
exclusion	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
content	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
experiment	NULL
remain	NULL
isolated	NULL
and	NULL
unique	NULL
.	NULL

Almost	NULL
impersonally	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
woman	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
met	NULL
compared	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
way	NULL
with	NULL
Gloria	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
deeply	NULL
herself	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
immeasurably	NULL
sincere	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
certain	NULL
.	NULL

Beside	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
dozen	NULL
schoolgirls	NULL
and	NULL
debutantes	NULL
,	NULL
young	NULL
married	NULL
women	NULL
and	NULL
waifs	NULL
and	NULL
strays	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
females	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
's	NULL
most	NULL
contemptuous	NULL
sense	NULL
,	NULL
breeders	NULL
and	NULL
bearers	NULL
,	NULL
exuding	NULL
still	NULL
that	NULL
faintly	NULL
odorous	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cave	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
nursery	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
neither	NULL
submitted	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
will	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
nor	NULL
caressed	NULL
his	NULL
vanity	NULL
--	NULL
except	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
company	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
caress	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
thinking	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
aught	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
give	NULL
to	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
entanglement	NULL
growing	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
remote	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
repugnant	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
disclaimed	NULL
and	NULL
buried	NULL
the	NULL
incident	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
decisive	NULL
untruth	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
young	NULL
people	NULL
with	NULL
fancy	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
distinguish	NULL
a	NULL
game	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
reality	NULL
--	NULL
who	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
casualness	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
met	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
on	NULL
would	NULL
proclaim	NULL
themselves	NULL
unharmed	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
decided	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
phone	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
Plaza	NULL
Hotel	NULL
.	NULL

Gloria	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
mother	NULL
knew	NULL
neither	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
nor	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
return	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
somehow	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
point	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
wrongness	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
asserted	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
element	NULL
of	NULL
callousness	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
of	NULL
indecency	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
absence	NULL
from	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
suspected	NULL
that	NULL
by	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
intrigued	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
disadvantage	NULL
.	NULL

Returning	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
find	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

Most	NULL
discreetly	NULL
!	NULL

He	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
waited	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
hours	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
home	NULL
the	NULL
utter	NULL
inconsequence	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
regarded	NULL
the	NULL
incident	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
an	NULL
asinine	NULL
blunder	NULL
!	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
considered	NULL
himself	NULL
particularly	NULL
favored	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
reacting	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
inept	NULL
intimacy	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
quite	NULL
trivial	NULL
episode	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
previous	NULL
month	NULL
his	NULL
janitor	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
delivered	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
muddled	NULL
lecture	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
brother-hoove	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
up	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
basis	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
seated	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
seat	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
cordial	NULL
and	NULL
chatty	NULL
half-hour	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
wondered	NULL
in	NULL
horror	NULL
if	NULL
Gloria	NULL
would	NULL
regard	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
regarded	NULL
that	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

Him	NULL

Anthony	NULL
Patch	NULL

Horror	NULL

It	NULL
never	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
passive	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
acted	NULL
upon	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
influence	NULL
above	NULL

beyond	NULL
Gloria	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
merely	NULL
the	NULL
sensitive	NULL
plate	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
photograph	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
gargantuan	NULL
photographer	NULL
had	NULL
focussed	NULL
the	NULL
camera	NULL
on	NULL
Gloria	NULL
and	NULL
_	NULL
snap	NULL

!	NULL

--	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
plate	NULL
could	NULL
but	NULL
develop	NULL
,	NULL
confined	NULL

all	NULL
things	NULL

its	NULL
nature	NULL

But	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
lying	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
couch	NULL
and	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
orange	NULL
lamp	NULL

passed	NULL
his	NULL
thin	NULL
fingers	NULL
incessantly	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
dark	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
new	NULL
symbols	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
hours	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
shop	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL

moving	NULL
lithely	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
velvets	NULL

the	NULL

her	NULL

Noon	NULL

the	NULL

of	NULL
many	NULL

comic	NULL
women	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
o'clock	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
her	NULL
fork	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
tantalize	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
adoring	NULL
artichoke	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
her	NULL

up	NULL

Four	NULL
o'clock	NULL

her	NULL
little	NULL

moving	NULL

melody	NULL

her	NULL
face	NULL
distinct	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
crowd	NULL

her	NULL
partner	NULL
happy	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
petted	NULL
puppy	NULL
and	NULL
mad	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
immemorial	NULL
hatter	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
night	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
drifting	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
another	NULL
damp	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
signs	NULL
would	NULL
spill	NULL
their	NULL
light	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
knew	NULL
?	NULL

No	NULL
wiser	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
haply	NULL
sought	NULL
to	NULL
recapture	NULL
that	NULL
picture	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
cream	NULL
and	NULL
shadow	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
hushed	NULL
Avenue	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
,	NULL
ah	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
!	NULL

A	NULL
thousand	NULL
taxis	NULL
would	NULL
yawn	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
thousand	NULL
corners	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
kiss	NULL
forever	NULL
lost	NULL
and	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
thousand	NULL
guises	NULL
Thaïs	NULL
would	NULL
hail	NULL
a	NULL
cab	NULL
and	NULL
turn	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
for	NULL
loving	NULL

And	NULL
her	NULL
pallor	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
virginal	NULL
and	NULL
lovely	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
kiss	NULL
chaste	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL

He	NULL
sprang	NULL
excitedly	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
inappropriate	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
out	NULL
!	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
realized	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL

to	NULL
kiss	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
rest	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
great	NULL
immobility	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
restlessness	NULL

all	NULL
malcontent	NULL

Anthony	NULL
dressed	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
long	NULL
before	NULL

and	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Richard	NULL

The	NULL
Demon	NULL
Lover	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
call	NULL
Gloria	NULL
again	NULL
until	NULL
six	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
until	NULL
eight	NULL
and	NULL
--	NULL
oh	NULL
,	NULL
climax	NULL
of	NULL
anticlimaxes	NULL
!	NULL

--	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
engagement	NULL
until	NULL
Tuesday	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
broken	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
gutta-percha	NULL
clattered	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
banged	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
phone	NULL
.	NULL

BLACK	NULL
MAGIC	NULL
Tuesday	NULL
was	NULL
freezing	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
called	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
bleak	NULL
two	NULL
o'clock	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
confusedly	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
unbelievable	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
seriously	NULL
doubted	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
remembered	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
called	NULL
you	NULL
four	NULL
times	NULL
on	NULL
Sunday	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Did	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
surprise	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
and	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
expression	NULL
.	NULL

Silently	NULL
he	NULL
cursed	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
having	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
her	NULL
pride	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
deal	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
petty	NULL
triumphs	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
guessed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
never	NULL
having	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
worry	NULL
about	NULL
men	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seldom	NULL
used	NULL
the	NULL
wary	NULL
subterfuges	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
playings	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
haulings	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
stock	NULL
in	NULL
trade	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
sisterhood	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
trick	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

Did	NULL
she	NULL
think	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
ultimate	NULL
and	NULL
fatal	NULL
thrust	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
charm	NULL
endlessly	NULL
preserved	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
simply	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL

May	NULL
I	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
mean	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
swallowed	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
lump	NULL
of	NULL
panic	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL

not	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
tea	NULL
table	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

all	NULL
right	NULL

but	NULL
not	NULL
to-day	NULL

I	NULL

get	NULL
some	NULL
exercise	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
's	NULL
walk	NULL

"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
bitter	NULL
and	NULL
raw	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
evil	NULL
hate	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mad	NULL
heart	NULL
of	NULL
February	NULL
was	NULL
wrought	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
forlorn	NULL
and	NULL
icy	NULL
wind	NULL
that	NULL
cut	NULL
its	NULL
way	NULL
cruelly	NULL
across	NULL
Central	NULL
Park	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
along	NULL
Fifth	NULL
Avenue	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
discomfort	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
distracted	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
at	NULL
Sixty-first	NULL
Street	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
around	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
forty	NULL
feet	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rear	NULL
standing	NULL
motionless	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
half	NULL
hidden	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
fur	NULL
coat	NULL
collar	NULL
,	NULL
moved	NULL
either	NULL
by	NULL
anger	NULL
or	NULL
laughter	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
determine	NULL
which	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
started	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL

she	NULL
called	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
answered	NULL
in	NULL
confusion	NULL

Side	NULL
by	NULL
side	NULL
they	NULL
started	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Plaza	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL

"	NULL
Men	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

briskly	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
his	NULL
annoyance	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
answer	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
dismiss	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL
entrance	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
walked	NULL
in	NULL
without	NULL
speaking	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
elevator	NULL
,	NULL
throwing	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
remark	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
entered	NULL
it	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
'd	NULL
better	NULL
come	NULL
up	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
hesitated	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
fraction	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Perhaps	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
better	NULL
call	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Just	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Her	NULL
words	NULL
were	NULL
murmured	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
aside	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
main	NULL
concern	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
adjusting	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
stray	NULL
wisps	NULL
of	NULL
hair	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
elevator	NULL
mirror	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
were	NULL
brilliant	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
sparkled	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
lovely	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
exquisitely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
desired	NULL
.	NULL

Despising	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
walking	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
tenth-floor	NULL
corridor	NULL
a	NULL
subservient	NULL
foot	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sitting	NULL
room	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
disappeared	NULL
to	NULL
shed	NULL
her	NULL
furs	NULL
.	NULL

Something	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
wrong	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
eyes	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
a	NULL
shred	NULL
of	NULL
dignity	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
unpremeditated	NULL
yet	NULL
significant	NULL
encounter	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
completely	NULL
defeated	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
reappeared	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
explained	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
sophistic	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
the	NULL
strongest	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
wanted	NULL

up	NULL

Yet	NULL
what	NULL
happened	NULL
later	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
traced	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
indignity	NULL

experienced	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
elevator	NULL

the	NULL
girl	NULL

worrying	NULL

intolerably	NULL

that	NULL
when	NULL

came	NULL
out	NULL

she	NULL

ungraciously	NULL

He	NULL
glared	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
growing	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
was	NULL
ripped	NULL
to	NULL
shreds	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
irritable	NULL
and	NULL
vindictive	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
her	NULL
hard	NULL
selfishness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stared	NULL
morosely	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
thing	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
smiled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
smile	NULL
every	NULL
rag	NULL
of	NULL
anger	NULL
and	NULL
hurt	NULL
vanity	NULL
dropped	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
his	NULL
very	NULL
moods	NULL
were	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
outer	NULL
ripples	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
emotion	NULL
rose	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
breast	NULL
unless	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
fit	NULL
to	NULL
pull	NULL
an	NULL
omnipotent	NULL
controlling	NULL
thread	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
moved	NULL
closer	NULL
and	NULL
taking	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
pulled	NULL
her	NULL
ever	NULL
so	NULL
gently	NULL
toward	NULL
him	NULL
until	NULL
she	NULL
half	NULL
lay	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
shoulder	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
smiled	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
whispered	NULL
very	NULL
softly	NULL
.	NULL

Again	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
magic	NULL
,	NULL
subtle	NULL
and	NULL
pervading	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
spilt	NULL
perfume	NULL
,	NULL
irresistible	NULL
and	NULL
sweet	NULL
.	NULL

Afterward	NULL
,	NULL
neither	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
nor	NULL
after	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
remember	NULL
the	NULL
important	NULL
things	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
she	NULL
been	NULL
moved	NULL
?	NULL

In	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
spoken	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
measure	NULL
of	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
taken	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
kisses	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
time	NULL
lost	NULL
herself	NULL
ever	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
?	NULL

Oh	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
and	NULL
paced	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
in	NULL
sheer	NULL
ecstasy	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
;	NULL
should	NULL
poise	NULL
curled	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
couch	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
swallow	NULL
newly	NULL
landed	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
clean	NULL
swift	NULL
flight	NULL
,	NULL
watching	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
inscrutable	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
stop	NULL
his	NULL
pacing	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
shy	NULL
each	NULL
time	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
drop	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
find	NULL
her	NULL
kiss	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
fascinating	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
met	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
like	NULL
her	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
besought	NULL
her	NULL
jauntily	NULL
but	NULL
earnestly	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
him	NULL
away	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
fall	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
--	NULL
already	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
haunted	NULL
too	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
ways	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
delicious	NULL
romance	NULL
!	NULL

His	NULL
true	NULL
reaction	NULL
was	NULL
neither	NULL
fear	NULL
nor	NULL
sorrow	NULL
--	NULL
only	NULL
this	NULL
deep	NULL
delight	NULL
in	NULL
being	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
colored	NULL
the	NULL
banality	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
mawkish	NULL
seem	NULL
sad	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
posturing	NULL
seem	NULL
wise	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
_	NULL
would	NULL
_	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
--	NULL
eternally	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
!	NULL

"	NULL
This	NULL
is	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
rare	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
strange	NULL

wonderful	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
do	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
last	NULL

"	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
that	NULL
tremulousness	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
take	NULL
for	NULL
sincerity	NULL
in	NULL
ourselves	NULL
.	NULL

Afterward	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
one	NULL
reply	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
to	NULL
something	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
form	NULL
--	NULL
perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
arranged	NULL
and	NULL
polished	NULL
it	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
A	NULL
woman	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL

man	NULL
beautifully	NULL

romantically	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
either	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
or	NULL
his	NULL
mistress	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

As	NULL
always	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
gradually	NULL
older	NULL
until	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
ruminations	NULL
too	NULL
deep	NULL
for	NULL
words	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
wintering	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
hour	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
leaped	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
little	NULL
ecstasies	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
its	NULL
fading	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
sweet	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
five	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
clock	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
mantel	NULL
became	NULL
articulate	NULL
in	NULL
sound	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
brutish	NULL
sensibility	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
reminded	NULL
by	NULL
those	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
tinny	NULL
beats	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
petals	NULL
were	NULL
falling	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
flowered	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
pulled	NULL
her	NULL
quickly	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
and	NULL
held	NULL
her	NULL
helpless	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
breath	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
kiss	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
neither	NULL
a	NULL
game	NULL
nor	NULL
a	NULL
tribute	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
arms	NULL
fell	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
free	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
quietly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
far	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lounge	NULL
and	NULL
gazed	NULL
straight	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
frown	NULL
had	NULL
gathered	NULL
between	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
sank	NULL
down	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
closed	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
over	NULL
hers	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
lifeless	NULL
and	NULL
unresponsive	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
motion	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL

put	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
drew	NULL
away	NULL

"	NULL

repeated	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
very	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

a	NULL
little	NULL
impatiently	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

his	NULL
voice	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL

She	NULL
appeared	NULL
uninterested	NULL

was	NULL
almost	NULL

looking	NULL

No	NULL

He	NULL
rose	NULL
and	NULL
regarded	NULL
her	NULL
angrily	NULL

uncertainly	NULL
.	NULL

Again	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

Her	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
parting	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL

had	NULL
just	NULL
faintly	NULL
stirred	NULL
.	NULL

Again	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
with	NULL
less	NULL
decision	NULL

less	NULL
confidence	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL

"	NULL

Silence	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
irremediable	NULL
lack	NULL
of	NULL
originality	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
remarks	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
oppressive	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
speak	NULL

rail	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
cry	NULL
out	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL

anything	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
pervasive	NULL
and	NULL
chilling	NULL
silence	NULL

He	NULL
cursed	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
weak	NULL
fool	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
clearest	NULL
desire	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL

Helplessly	NULL

he	NULL
erred	NULL
again	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
curl	NULL
slightly	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
dignity	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL

She	NULL
spoke	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
immediately	NULL

saw	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
coat	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
chair	NULL

blundered	NULL
into	NULL
them	NULL

during	NULL
an	NULL

Looking	NULL
again	NULL

he	NULL
perceived	NULL
that	NULL

turned	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
shaken	NULL

immediately	NULL
regretted	NULL

went	NULL
quickly	NULL

without	NULL

from	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL

For	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
Gloria	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL

Her	NULL
lips	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
curled	NULL

her	NULL
glance	NULL

Then	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
blurred	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
murmured	NULL
three	NULL
words	NULL
half	NULL
aloud	NULL

the	NULL
death-bound	NULL
fire	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Good-by	NULL

said	NULL

PANIC	NULL
The	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
hardest	NULL
blow	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
at	NULL

what	NULL

in	NULL
finding	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
forever	NULL
beyond	NULL
his	NULL
grasp	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
reached	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
misery	NULL

dropped	NULL
into	NULL
an	NULL
armchair	NULL
without	NULL
even	NULL
removing	NULL
his	NULL
overcoat	NULL

sat	NULL
there	NULL

his	NULL

strength	NULL
until	NULL
she	NULL
became	NULL
passive	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
desire	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
beating	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
will	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
walked	NULL
,	NULL
defeated	NULL
and	NULL
powerless	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
corners	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
drooping	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
force	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
grief	NULL
and	NULL
rage	NULL
hidden	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
whipped	NULL
schoolboy	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
one	NULL
minute	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
tremendously	NULL
--	NULL
ah	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
nearly	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
of	NULL
indifference	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
insolent	NULL
and	NULL
efficiently	NULL
humiliated	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
great	NULL
self-reproach	NULL
--	NULL
some	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL
dominant	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
far	NULL
more	NULL
urgent	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
Gloria	NULL
as	NULL
mad	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Unless	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
her	NULL
near	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
kiss	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
hold	NULL
her	NULL
close	NULL
and	NULL
acquiescent	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
from	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
her	NULL
three	NULL
minutes	NULL
of	NULL
utter	NULL
unwavering	NULL
indifference	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
had	NULL
lifted	NULL
herself	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
high	NULL
but	NULL
somehow	NULL
casual	NULL
position	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
instead	NULL
his	NULL
complete	NULL
preoccupation	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
much	NULL
his	NULL
wild	NULL
thoughts	NULL
varied	NULL
between	NULL
a	NULL
passionate	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
kisses	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
equally	NULL
passionate	NULL
craving	NULL
to	NULL
hurt	NULL
and	NULL
mar	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
residue	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
craved	NULL
in	NULL
finer	NULL
fashion	NULL
to	NULL
possess	NULL
the	NULL
triumphant	NULL
soul	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
shone	NULL
through	NULL
those	NULL
three	NULL
minutes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
beautiful	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
especially	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
without	NULL
mercy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
own	NULL
that	NULL
strength	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
send	NULL
him	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
present	NULL
no	NULL
such	NULL
analysis	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
Anthony	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
clarity	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
endless	NULL
resources	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
his	NULL
irony	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
were	NULL
swept	NULL
aside	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
only	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
and	NULL
weeks	NULL
that	NULL
followed	NULL
his	NULL
books	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
but	NULL
furniture	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
only	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
nebulous	NULL
outer	NULL
world	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
escape	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
bleak	NULL
wind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
warm	NULL
house	NULL
where	NULL
fires	NULL
shone	NULL
.	NULL

About	NULL
midnight	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
realize	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
hungry	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
Fifty-second	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
cold	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
scarcely	NULL
see	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
moisture	NULL
froze	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
lashes	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corners	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

Everywhere	NULL
dreariness	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
north	NULL
,	NULL
settling	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
thin	NULL
and	NULL
cheerless	NULL
street	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
black	NULL
bundled	NULL
figures	NULL
blacker	NULL
still	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
moved	NULL
stumbling	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
sidewalk	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
shrieking	NULL
wind	NULL
,	NULL
sliding	NULL
their	NULL
feet	NULL
cautiously	NULL
ahead	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
skis	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
turned	NULL
over	NULL
toward	NULL
Sixth	NULL
Avenue	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
absorbed	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
as	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
notice	NULL
that	NULL
several	NULL
passers-by	NULL
had	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
overcoat	NULL
was	NULL
wide	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
was	NULL
biting	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
hard	NULL
and	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
merciless	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

...	NULL
After	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
a	NULL
waitress	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
fat	NULL
waitress	NULL
with	NULL
black-rimmed	NULL
eye-glasses	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
dangled	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
black	NULL
cord	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Order	NULL
,	NULL
please	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

Her	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
considered	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
unnecessarily	NULL
loud	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
resentfully	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
wan	NULL
na	NULL
order	NULL
or	NULL
doncha	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Of	NULL
course	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
protested	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

He	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
clock	NULL
and	NULL
discovered	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
start	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
after	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
down	NULL
around	NULL
Thirtieth	NULL
Street	NULL
somewhere	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
and	NULL
translated	NULL
the	NULL

]	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
semicircle	NULL
of	NULL
letters	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
glass	NULL
front	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
place	NULL
was	NULL
inhabited	NULL
sparsely	NULL
by	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
bleak	NULL
and	NULL
half-frozen	NULL
night-hawks	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
waitress	NULL
bent	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
last	NULL
disgusted	NULL
glance	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
ludicrously	NULL
intellectual	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
corded	NULL
glasses	NULL
,	NULL
hurried	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

God	NULL
!	NULL

Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
kisses	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
such	NULL
flowers	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
the	NULL
low	NULL
freshness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
lines	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
body	NULL
shining	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
lily-colored	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
lamps	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
--	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
lamps	NULL
.	NULL

Misery	NULL
struck	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
piling	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
terror	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
ache	NULL
and	NULL
yearning	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
--	NULL
no	NULL
denying	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
softening	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
idea	NULL
had	NULL
seared	NULL
his	NULL
sky	NULL
--	NULL
what	NULL
of	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
!	NULL

What	NULL
would	NULL
happen	NULL
now	NULL
?	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
wealthy	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
middle-aged	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
tolerant	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
beautiful	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
baby	NULL
her	NULL
whims	NULL
and	NULL
indulge	NULL
her	NULL
unreason	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
wear	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
perhaps	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
worn	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
bright	NULL
flower	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
button-hole	NULL
,	NULL
safe	NULL
and	NULL
secure	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
she	NULL
feared	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
playing	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
marrying	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
disappointment	NULL
in	NULL
Anthony	NULL
might	NULL
throw	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
sudden	NULL
impulse	NULL
into	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
's	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
idea	NULL
drove	NULL
him	NULL
childishly	NULL
frantic	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
kill	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
suffer	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
hideous	NULL
presumption	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
saying	NULL
this	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
teeth	NULL
tight	NULL
shut	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL
orgy	NULL
of	NULL
hate	NULL
and	NULL
fright	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
behind	NULL
this	NULL
obscene	NULL
jealousy	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
profoundly	NULL
and	NULL
truly	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
goes	NULL
between	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
coffee	NULL
appeared	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
elbow	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
off	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
time	NULL
a	NULL
gradually	NULL
diminishing	NULL
wisp	NULL
of	NULL
steam	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
night	NULL
manager	NULL
,	NULL
seated	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
desk	NULL
,	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
motionless	NULL
figure	NULL
alone	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
moved	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
hand	NULL
crossed	NULL
the	NULL
figure	NULL
three	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
clock	NULL
.	NULL

WISDOM	NULL
After	NULL
another	NULL
day	NULL
the	NULL
turmoil	NULL
subsided	NULL
and	NULL
Anthony	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
exercise	NULL
a	NULL
measure	NULL
of	NULL
reason	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
cried	NULL
it	NULL
passionately	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
before	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
seemed	NULL
insuperable	NULL
obstacles	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
limited	NULL
income	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
irresponsible	NULL
and	NULL
independent	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
forty	NULL
hours	NULL
become	NULL
the	NULL
merest	NULL
chaff	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
infatuation	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
marry	NULL
her	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
feeble	NULL
parody	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
adolescence	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
people	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
endure	NULL
the	NULL
constant	NULL
reminder	NULL
of	NULL
Gloria	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
existence	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
hope	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
built	NULL
hope	NULL
desperately	NULL
and	NULL
tenaciously	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stuff	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
dream	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
hope	NULL
flimsy	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
cracked	NULL
and	NULL
dissipated	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
times	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
hope	NULL
mothered	NULL
by	NULL
mockery	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
brawn	NULL
and	NULL
sinew	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
self-respect	NULL
.	NULL

Out	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
developed	NULL
a	NULL
spark	NULL
of	NULL
wisdom	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
true	NULL
perception	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
from	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
effortless	NULL
past	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Memory	NULL
is	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
very	NULL
short	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
crucial	NULL
point	NULL
the	NULL
Trust	NULL
President	NULL
is	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stand	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
potential	NULL
criminal	NULL
needing	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
push	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
jailbird	NULL
,	NULL
scorned	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
upright	NULL
for	NULL
leagues	NULL
around	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
him	NULL
be	NULL
acquitted	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
all	NULL
is	NULL
forgotten	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
have	NULL
some	NULL
trouble	NULL
once	NULL

technicality	NULL

I	NULL

"	NULL

Oh	NULL
,	NULL
memory	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
short	NULL
!	NULL

Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
Gloria	NULL
altogether	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
say	NULL
two	NULL
dozen	NULL
hours	NULL
.	NULL

Supposing	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
alone	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
or	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
avoided	NULL
every	NULL
place	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
possibly	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
possible	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
rush	NULL
of	NULL
events	NULL
would	NULL
efface	NULL
his	NULL
personality	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
conscious	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
personality	NULL
his	NULL
offense	NULL
and	NULL
humiliation	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
forget	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
other	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
winced	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
implication	NULL
struck	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
other	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
months	NULL

God	NULL
!	NULL

Better	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
weeks	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
this	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
evening	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
catastrophe	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
undressing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
point	NULL
he	NULL
threw	NULL
himself	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
lay	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
trembling	NULL
very	NULL
slightly	NULL
and	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
canopy	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
weeks	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
worse	NULL
than	NULL
no	NULL
time	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
two	NULL
weeks	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
approach	NULL
her	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
personality	NULL
or	NULL
confidence	NULL
--	NULL
remaining	NULL
still	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
too	NULL
far	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
period	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL

was	NULL

a	NULL
moment	NULL

in	NULL

an	NULL
eternity	NULL

whined	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
weeks	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
short	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL

Whatever	NULL
poignancy	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
period	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
incident	NULL
should	NULL
fade	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
a	NULL

period	NULL
when	NULL

him	NULL

six	NULL

and	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
desk	NULL
calendar	NULL
he	NULL
marked	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
finding	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
fall	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ninth	NULL
of	NULL
April	NULL
.	NULL

Very	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
phone	NULL
and	NULL
ask	NULL
her	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
call	NULL
.	NULL

Until	NULL
then	NULL
--	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
his	NULL
decision	NULL
a	NULL
gradual	NULL
improvement	NULL
was	NULL
manifest	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
hope	NULL
pointed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
realized	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
he	NULL
brooded	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
desired	NULL
impression	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
met	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
another	NULL
hour	NULL
he	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

THE	NULL
INTERVAL	NULL
Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
glory	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
dimmed	NULL
perceptibly	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
of	NULL
separation	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
departed	NULL
completely	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
six	NULL
weeks	NULL
held	NULL
many	NULL
abominable	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
dreaded	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
Dick	NULL
and	NULL
Maury	NULL
,	NULL
imagining	NULL
wildly	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
all	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
met	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Richard	NULL
Caramel	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
Anthony	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
attention	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
Demon	NULL
Lover	NULL
"	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
accepted	NULL
for	NULL
immediate	NULL
publication	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
from	NULL
now	NULL
on	NULL
he	NULL
moved	NULL
apart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
craved	NULL
the	NULL
warmth	NULL
and	NULL
security	NULL
of	NULL
Maury	NULL
's	NULL
society	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
cheered	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
back	NULL
than	NULL
November	NULL
.	NULL

Only	NULL
Gloria	NULL
could	NULL
give	NULL
that	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
ever	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
Dick	NULL
's	NULL
success	NULL
rejoiced	NULL
him	NULL
only	NULL
casually	NULL
and	NULL
worried	NULL
him	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
meant	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
ahead	NULL
--	NULL
writing	NULL
and	NULL
reading	NULL
and	NULL
publishing	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
living	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
motionless	NULL
and	NULL
breathless	NULL
for	NULL
six	NULL
weeks	NULL
--	NULL
while	NULL
Gloria	NULL
forgot	NULL
.	NULL

TWO	NULL
ENCOUNTERS	NULL
His	NULL
greatest	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
Geraldine	NULL
's	NULL
company	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
once	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
theatre	NULL
and	NULL
entertained	NULL
her	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
apartment	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
she	NULL
absorbed	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
Gloria	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
quieting	NULL
those	NULL
erotic	NULL
sensibilities	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
worried	NULL
over	NULL
Gloria	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
matter	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
Geraldine	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
kiss	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
kiss	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL
short	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
Geraldine	NULL
things	NULL
belonged	NULL
in	NULL
definite	NULL
pigeonholes	NULL
:	NULL
a	NULL
kiss	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
anything	NULL
further	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
another	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
kiss	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
"	NULL
bad	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

When	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
interval	NULL
was	NULL
up	NULL
two	NULL
incidents	NULL
occurred	NULL
on	NULL
successive	NULL
days	NULL
that	NULL
upset	NULL
his	NULL
increasing	NULL
calm	NULL
and	NULL
caused	NULL
a	NULL
temporary	NULL
relapse	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
was	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
Gloria	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
meeting	NULL
.	NULL

Both	NULL
bowed	NULL
.	NULL

Both	NULL
spoke	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
neither	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
Anthony	NULL
read	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
column	NULL
of	NULL
The	NULL
Sun	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
in	NULL
succession	NULL
without	NULL
understanding	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
sentence	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL
Sixth	NULL
Avenue	NULL
a	NULL
safe	NULL
street	NULL
!	NULL

Having	NULL
forsworn	NULL
his	NULL
barber	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Plaza	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
around	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
one	NULL
morning	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
shaved	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
waiting	NULL
his	NULL
turn	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
coat	NULL
and	NULL
vest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
soft	NULL
collar	NULL
open	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
neck	NULL
stood	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shop	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
day	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
oasis	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cold	NULL
desert	NULL
of	NULL
March	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sidewalk	NULL
was	NULL
cheerful	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
population	NULL
of	NULL
strolling	NULL
sun-worshippers	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
stout	NULL
woman	NULL
upholstered	NULL
in	NULL
velvet	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
flabby	NULL
cheeks	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
massaged	NULL
,	NULL
swirled	NULL
by	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
poodle	NULL
straining	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
leash	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
being	NULL
given	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
tug	NULL
bringing	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
ocean	NULL
liner	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
behind	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
striped	NULL
blue	NULL
suit	NULL
,	NULL
walking	NULL
slue-footed	NULL
in	NULL
white-spatted	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
grinned	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
and	NULL
catching	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
eye	NULL
,	NULL
winked	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
glass	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
laughed	NULL
,	NULL
thrown	NULL
immediately	NULL
into	NULL
that	NULL
humor	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
women	NULL
were	NULL
graceless	NULL
and	NULL
absurd	NULL
phantasms	NULL
,	NULL
grotesquely	NULL
curved	NULL
and	NULL
rounded	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
rectangular	NULL
world	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
building	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
inspired	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
sensations	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
did	NULL
those	NULL
strange	NULL
and	NULL
monstrous	NULL
fish	NULL
who	NULL
inhabit	NULL
the	NULL
esoteric	NULL
world	NULL
of	NULL
green	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
aquarium	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
more	NULL
strollers	NULL
caught	NULL
his	NULL
eye	NULL
casually	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
horrified	NULL
instant	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
resolved	NULL
herself	NULL
into	NULL
Gloria	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
here	NULL
powerless	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
nearer	NULL
and	NULL
Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
glancing	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
eyes	NULL
widened	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
smiled	NULL
politely	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
lips	NULL
moved	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
five	NULL
feet	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
muttered	NULL
inanely	NULL
.	NULL

Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
beautiful	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
young	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
before	NULL
!	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
barber	NULL
's	NULL
chair	NULL
was	NULL
vacated	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
newspaper	NULL
column	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
in	NULL
succession	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
second	NULL
incident	NULL
took	NULL
place	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Going	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
Manhattan	NULL
bar	NULL
about	NULL
seven	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
confronted	NULL
with	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
deserted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
mutual	NULL
recognition	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
stationed	NULL
himself	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
foot	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
older	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
ordered	NULL
his	NULL
drink	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
inevitable	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
converse	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Hello	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Patch	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
amiably	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
proffered	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
exchanged	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
aphorisms	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
fluctuations	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mercury	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
you	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
here	NULL
much	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

inquired	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
seldom	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
omitted	NULL
to	NULL
add	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Plaza	NULL
bar	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
lately	NULL
,	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
favorite	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Nice	NULL
bar	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
bars	NULL
in	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Anthony	NULL
nodded	NULL
.	NULL

Bloeckman	NULL
emptied	NULL
his	NULL
glass	NULL
and	NULL
picked	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
cane	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
evening	NULL
dress	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
be	NULL
hurrying	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
with	NULL
Miss	NULL
Gilbert	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Death	NULL
looked	NULL
suddenly	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
two	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
he	NULL
announced	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
vis-à-vis	NULL
's	NULL
prospective	NULL
murderer	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
struck	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
vital	NULL
blow	NULL
at	NULL
Anthony	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
younger	NULL
man	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
reddened	NULL
visibly	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
every	NULL
nerve	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
instant	NULL
clamor	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
tremendous	NULL
effort	NULL
he	NULL
mustered	NULL
a	NULL
rigid	NULL
--	NULL
oh	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
rigid	NULL
--	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
a	NULL
conventional	NULL
good-by	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
he	NULL
lay	NULL
awake	NULL
until	NULL
after	NULL
four	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
wild	NULL
with	NULL
grief	NULL
and	NULL
fear	NULL
and	NULL
abominable	NULL
imaginings	NULL
.	NULL

WEAKNESS	NULL
And	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fifth	NULL
week	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
apartment	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
"	NULL
L'Education	NULL
Sentimental	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
book	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
racing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
set	NULL
free	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
always	NULL
took	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
horses	NULL
racing	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
home	NULL
stable	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
suddenly	NULL
quickened	NULL
breath	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
telephone	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
number	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
faltered	NULL
and	NULL
broke	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
schoolboy	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Central	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
pounding	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
receiver	NULL
being	NULL
taken	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
end	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
crack	NULL
of	NULL
doom	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Gilbert	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
soft	NULL
as	NULL
maple	NULL
syrup	NULL
running	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL
container	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
quality	NULL
of	NULL
horror	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
single	NULL
"	NULL
Hello-o-ah	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Miss	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL

She	NULL
's	NULL
lying	NULL
down	NULL

Who	NULL
shall	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
called	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Nobody	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
shouted	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
wild	NULL
panic	NULL
he	NULL
slammed	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
receiver	NULL
;	NULL
collapsed	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
armchair	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cold	NULL
sweat	NULL
of	NULL
breathless	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

SERENADE	NULL
The	NULL
first	NULL
thing	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
was	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Why	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
've	NULL
bobbed	NULL
your	NULL
hair	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL
gorgeous	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
fashionable	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
fashionable	NULL
in	NULL
five	NULL
or	NULL
six	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
considered	NULL
extremely	NULL
daring	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL
sunshine	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
gravely	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
walk	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
coat	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
quaintly	NULL
piquant	NULL
Napoleon	NULL
hat	NULL
of	NULL
Alice	NULL
Blue	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
Avenue	NULL
and	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
Zoo	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
properly	NULL
admired	NULL
the	NULL
grandeur	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
elephant	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
collar-height	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
giraffe	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
visit	NULL
the	NULL
monkey	NULL
house	NULL
because	NULL
Gloria	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
monkeys	NULL
smelt	NULL
so	NULL
bad	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
returned	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
Plaza	NULL
,	NULL
talking	NULL
about	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
glad	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
singing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
warm	NULL
balm	NULL
that	NULL
lay	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
suddenly	NULL
golden	NULL
city	NULL

To	NULL

Park	NULL

while	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL

Anthony	NULL
remembered	NULL

always	NULL
looked	NULL

then	NULL

were	NULL

him	NULL

preserved	NULL

Later	NULL

Anthony	NULL
asked	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
even	NULL
figured	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
nicety	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
happen	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
hours	NULL

come	NULL

how	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL

going	NULL
also	NULL

there	NULL

how	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
clusters	NULL
of	NULL
flowers	NULL
about	NULL

bowls	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
buy	NULL
for	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
sit	NULL
on	NULL

when	NULL
the	NULL

came	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
sit	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
lounge	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
Anthony	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
about	NULL
quite	NULL
naturally	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
sweetness	NULL
sleeping	NULL
still	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fire	NULL
was	NULL
bright	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
breeze	NULL
sighing	NULL
in	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
curtains	NULL
brought	NULL
a	NULL
mellow	NULL
damp	NULL
,	NULL
promising	NULL
May	NULL
and	NULL
world	NULL
of	NULL
summer	NULL

His	NULL
soul	NULL
thrilled	NULL

he	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL

waters	NULL
lapping	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
warm	NULL
Mediterranean	NULL

for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
young	NULL
now	NULL

again	NULL

more	NULL
triumphant	NULL

Six	NULL

down	NULL

the	NULL

on	NULL

In	NULL

out	NULL

Anthony	NULL
lay	NULL
awake	NULL

played	NULL
with	NULL
every	NULL

the	NULL
day	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
gently	NULL

almost	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
kiss	NULL

that	NULL

a	NULL

the	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
nearer	NULL

it	NULL

that	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
part	NULL
their	NULL
love	NULL
expressed	NULL
Gloria	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
Anthony	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
often	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
scarcely	NULL
tolerated	NULL
guest	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
party	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
giving	NULL
.	NULL

Telling	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Gilbert	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
an	NULL
embarrassed	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
stuffed	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
chair	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
intense	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
blinky	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
concentration	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL

it	NULL

for	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
Gloria	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
no	NULL

she	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
authentic	NULL
difference	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
daughter	NULL
's	NULL
attitude	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
given	NULL
special	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
heeded	NULL

heed	NULL

the	NULL
hither	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
telephone	NULL
conversations	NULL

disguised	NULL

still	NULL
rather	NULL
warm	NULL
--	NULL
--	NULL
Yet	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
delicately	NULL
professed	NULL
surprise	NULL
and	NULL
declared	NULL
herself	NULL
immensely	NULL
pleased	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
doubtless	NULL
was	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
geranium	NULL
plants	NULL
blossoming	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
window-boxes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
cabbies	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
lovers	NULL
sought	NULL
the	NULL
romantic	NULL
privacy	NULL
of	NULL
hansom	NULL
cabs	NULL
--	NULL
quaint	NULL
device	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
staid	NULL
bill	NULL
of	NULL
fares	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
scribbled	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
pushing	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL

But	NULL
between	NULL
kisses	NULL
Anthony	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
golden	NULL
girl	NULL
quarrelled	NULL
incessantly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL

it	NULL

wonderful	NULL

"	NULL

At	NULL
one	NULL
time	NULL
some	NULL
gossamer	NULL
difference	NULL
attained	NULL
such	NULL
bulk	NULL
that	NULL
Anthony	NULL
arose	NULL
and	NULL
punched	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
overcoat	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
it	NULL
appeared	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
preceding	NULL
February	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
repeated	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
knowing	NULL
how	NULL
deeply	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
moved	NULL
he	NULL
retained	NULL
his	NULL
dignity	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
pride	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
Gloria	NULL
was	NULL
sobbing	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
lovely	NULL
face	NULL
miserable	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
frightened	NULL
little	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
they	NULL
kept	NULL
unfolding	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
unwillingly	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
curious	NULL
reactions	NULL
and	NULL
evasions	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
distastes	NULL
and	NULL
prejudices	NULL
and	NULL
unintended	NULL
hints	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
proudly	NULL
incapable	NULL
of	NULL
jealousy	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
extremely	NULL
jealous	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
virtue	NULL
piqued	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
recondite	NULL
incidents	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
life	NULL
on	NULL
purpose	NULL
to	NULL
arouse	NULL
some	NULL
spark	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
no	NULL
avail	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
possessed	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
--	NULL
nor	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
desire	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL

always	NULL

"	NULL

And	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
instant	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
brimming	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
voicing	NULL
an	NULL
illusion	NULL

Yet	NULL
Anthony	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
days	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
hurt	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
purposely	NULL
--	NULL
taking	NULL
almost	NULL
a	NULL
delight	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
thrust	NULL
.	NULL

Incessantly	NULL
she	NULL
puzzled	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
one	NULL
hour	NULL
so	NULL
intimate	NULL
and	NULL
charming	NULL
,	NULL
striving	NULL
desperately	NULL
toward	NULL
an	NULL
unguessed	NULL

transcendent	NULL
union	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL

silent	NULL

cold	NULL

apparently	NULL
unmoved	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
consideration	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
love	NULL
or	NULL
anything	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

Often	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
eventually	NULL
trace	NULL
these	NULL
portentous	NULL
reticences	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
physical	NULL
discomfort	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
complained	NULL
until	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
over	NULL

to	NULL
some	NULL
carelessness	NULL

presumption	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL

to	NULL
an	NULL

even	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL
created	NULL

pride	NULL

Later	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
beginnings	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
friendship	NULL
with	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
Delmonico	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
Gloria	NULL
and	NULL
Rachael	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
upon	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Gilbert	NULL
having	NULL
luncheon	NULL
and	NULL
curiosity	NULL
had	NULL
impelled	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
party	NULL
of	NULL
four	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
rather	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
relief	NULL
from	NULL
younger	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
satisfied	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
humored	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
laughed	NULL
,	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
understood	NULL
her	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
met	NULL
him	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
despite	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
disapproval	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
parents	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
tendering	NULL
her	NULL
everything	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
villa	NULL
in	NULL
Italy	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
brilliant	NULL
career	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
screen	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
laughed	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
laughed	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
arrival	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
arena	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
making	NULL
steady	NULL
progress	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
treated	NULL
him	NULL
rather	NULL
well	NULL
--	NULL
except	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
called	NULL
him	NULL
always	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
invidious	NULL
nickname	NULL
--	NULL
perceiving	NULL
,	NULL
meanwhile	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
figuratively	NULL
following	NULL
along	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
the	NULL
fence	NULL
,	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
her	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
fall	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
engagement	NULL
was	NULL
announced	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
blow	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
enlighten	NULL
Anthony	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
details	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
implied	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
hesitated	NULL
to	NULL
argue	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
gathered	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
interview	NULL
had	NULL
terminated	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
stormy	NULL
note	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
Gloria	NULL
very	NULL
cool	NULL
and	NULL
unmoved	NULL
lying	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
and	NULL
Joseph	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
Films	NULL
Par	NULL
Excellence	NULL
"	NULL
pacing	NULL
the	NULL
carpet	NULL
with	NULL
eyes	NULL
narrowed	NULL
and	NULL
head	NULL
bowed	NULL
.	NULL

Gloria	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sorry	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
judged	NULL
it	NULL
best	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
final	NULL
burst	NULL
of	NULL
kindness	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
hate	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
understanding	NULL
that	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
indifference	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
strongest	NULL
appeal	NULL
,	NULL
judged	NULL
how	NULL
futile	NULL
this	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
,	NULL
often	NULL
but	NULL
quite	NULL
casually	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
--	NULL
finally	NULL
he	NULL
forgot	NULL
him	NULL
entirely	NULL
.	NULL

HEYDAY	NULL
One	NULL
afternoon	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
front	NULL
seats	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sunny	NULL
roof	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bus	NULL
and	NULL
rode	NULL
for	NULL
hours	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
fading	NULL
Square	NULL
up	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
sullied	NULL
river	NULL

then	NULL

gripped	NULL

she	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
misty	NULL

faded	NULL
as	NULL
its	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
crying	NULL

she	NULL
told	NULL
herself	NULL

because	NULL

only	NULL
the	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
beyond	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL

note	NULL
separated	NULL
itself	NULL
jarringly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

crying	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL

noise	NULL
from	NULL

areaway	NULL

then	NULL
it	NULL
grew	NULL

reminded	NULL

Then	NULL
it	NULL
sank	NULL

rise	NULL
again	NULL

include	NULL
words	NULL

some	NULL
bit	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
break	NULL
off	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
just	NULL
catch	NULL

low	NULL
rumble	NULL

begin	NULL
again	NULL

shivered	NULL

getting	NULL
up	NULL
out	NULL

bed	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
reached	NULL

high	NULL
point	NULL

tensed	NULL

stifled	NULL

almost	NULL

quality	NULL

scream	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
ceased	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
behind	NULL
it	NULL

silence	NULL
empty	NULL

menacing	NULL
as	NULL

by	NULL

he	NULL
returned	NULL

found	NULL

strangle	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL

sharply	NULL

many	NULL

emotions	NULL

that	NULL
no	NULL

them	NULL

She	NULL

for	NULL
her	NULL

who	NULL

crying	NULL
quietly	NULL
back	NULL
there	NULL
ten	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL
loveliness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
June	NULL
sunlight	NULL
flooding	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
beyond	NULL
all	NULL
conscious	NULL
perceptions	NULL
.	NULL

Only	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
,	NULL
colored	NULL
with	NULL
delirious	NULL
wild	NULL
excitement	NULL

that	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL
trust	NULL

fierce	NULL

passionate	NULL

burning	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
prayer	NULL

that	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
forever	NULL

Late	NULL
one	NULL

arrived	NULL
in	NULL
Santa	NULL

where	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
clerk	NULL
at	NULL

refused	NULL

them	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL
clerk	NULL
thought	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL

--	NULL
those	NULL

The	NULL

the	NULL

The	NULL

left	NULL
them	NULL

fled	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
other	NULL

around	NULL
one	NULL

it	NULL

But	NULL

The	NULL

passed	NULL

bearing	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
its	NULL
extortion	NULL
of	NULL
youth	NULL

Came	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
Gloria	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
other	NULL
men	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
bored	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
Anthony	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
sit	NULL
again	NULL
late	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
talking	NULL
with	NULL
Dick	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
tremendous	NULL
abstractions	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
occupied	NULL
his	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
clung	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
remained	NULL
.	NULL

Love	NULL
lingered	NULL
--	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
long	NULL
conversations	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
into	NULL
those	NULL
stark	NULL
hours	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
thins	NULL
and	NULL
sharpens	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
borrowings	NULL
from	NULL
dreams	NULL
become	NULL
the	NULL
stuff	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
deep	NULL
and	NULL
intimate	NULL
kindnesses	NULL
they	NULL
developed	NULL
toward	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
laughing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
absurdities	NULL
and	NULL
thinking	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
things	NULL
noble	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
things	NULL
sad	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
first	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
discovery	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
things	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
in	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
diverse	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
intermixed	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
moreover	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
sugared	NULL
with	NULL
love	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
seem	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
discoveries	NULL
as	NULL
isolated	NULL
phenomena	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
allowed	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
forgotten	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
living	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
of	NULL
tremendous	NULL
nervous	NULL
tension	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
high-handed	NULL
selfishness	NULL
.	NULL

Gloria	NULL
knew	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
utter	NULL
coward	NULL
toward	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
million	NULL
phantasms	NULL
created	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
perception	NULL
was	NULL
intermittent	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
cowardice	NULL
sprang	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
became	NULL
almost	NULL
obscenely	NULL
evident	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
faded	NULL
and	NULL
vanished	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
creation	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
reactions	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
those	NULL
attributed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
sex	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
roused	NULL
her	NULL
neither	NULL
to	NULL
disgust	NULL
nor	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
premature	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
motherhood	NULL
.	NULL

Herself	NULL
almost	NULL
completely	NULL
without	NULL
physical	NULL
fear	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
fear	NULL
's	NULL
redeeming	NULL
feature	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
coward	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
shock	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
coward	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
strain	NULL
--	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
was	NULL
given	NULL
play	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
yet	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
dashing	NULL
recklessness	NULL
that	NULL
moved	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL
brief	NULL
occasions	NULL
almost	NULL
to	NULL
admiration	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
pride	NULL
that	NULL
usually	NULL
steadied	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
observed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
trait	NULL
first	NULL
showed	NULL
itself	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
incidents	NULL
of	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
nervousness	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
warning	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
taxi-driver	NULL
against	NULL
fast	NULL
driving	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Chicago	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
refusal	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
tough	NULL
café	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
visit	NULL
;	NULL
these	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
admitted	NULL
the	NULL
conventional	NULL
interpretation	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
thinking	NULL
;	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
culminative	NULL
weight	NULL
disturbed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
occurred	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
San	NULL
Francisco	NULL
hotel	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
married	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
certainty	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
after	NULL
midnight	NULL
and	NULL
pitch	NULL
dark	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Gloria	NULL
was	NULL
dozing	NULL
off	NULL
and	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
even	NULL
breathing	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
asleep	NULL

when	NULL
suddenly	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
raise	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
elbow	NULL
and	NULL
stare	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
dearest	NULL

"	NULL

she	NULL
murmured	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Nothing	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
relaxed	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
pillow	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
toward	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
nothing	NULL

"	NULL

a	NULL

"	NULL

Coming	NULL
into	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
arms	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
quite	NULL
definite	NULL
meaning	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
required	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
slide	NULL
one	NULL
arm	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
shoulder	NULL
,	NULL
lock	NULL
both	NULL
arms	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
arrange	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
nearly	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
three-sided	NULL
crib	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
luxurious	NULL
ease	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
tossed	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
arms	NULL
went	NULL
tinglingly	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
after	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
wait	NULL
until	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
asleep	NULL
and	NULL
roll	NULL
her	NULL
gently	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
devices	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
curl	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
knots	NULL
.	NULL

Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
attained	NULL
sentimental	NULL
comfort	NULL
,	NULL
retired	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
doze	NULL
.	NULL

Five	NULL
minutes	NULL
ticked	NULL
away	NULL
on	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
's	NULL
travelling	NULL

silence	NULL
lay	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
unfamiliar	NULL

impersonal	NULL
furniture	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
half-oppressive	NULL
ceiling	NULL
that	NULL
melted	NULL
imperceptibly	NULL
into	NULL
invisible	NULL
walls	NULL
on	NULL
both	NULL
sides	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
suddenly	NULL
a	NULL
rattling	NULL
flutter	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
staccato	NULL
and	NULL
loud	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
hushed	NULL
,	NULL
pent	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
leap	NULL
Anthony	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
standing	NULL
tense	NULL
beside	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Who	NULL
's	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
cried	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
awful	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

Gloria	NULL
lay	NULL
very	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
wide	NULL
awake	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
engrossed	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

figure	NULL
whose	NULL

had	NULL
reached	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

into	NULL
that	NULL

The	NULL
sound	NULL
stopped	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
quiet	NULL
as	NULL
before	NULL

then	NULL
Anthony	NULL
pouring	NULL
words	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
telephone	NULL

hung	NULL
up	NULL

motionless	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
rush	NULL

commotion	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL

a	NULL
knocking	NULL
--	NULL
Anthony	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
open	NULL
it	NULL
upon	NULL
an	NULL
excited	NULL
night	NULL
clerk	NULL
with	NULL
three	NULL
bell-boys	NULL
grouped	NULL
staring	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Between	NULL
thumb	NULL
and	NULL
finger	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
clerk	NULL
held	NULL
a	NULL
wet	NULL
pen	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
threat	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
weapon	NULL
;	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bell-boys	NULL
had	NULL
seized	NULL
a	NULL
telephone	NULL
directory	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
sheepishly	NULL
.	NULL

Simultaneously	NULL
the	NULL
group	NULL
was	NULL
joined	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
hastily	NULL
summoned	NULL
house-detective	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
man	NULL
they	NULL
surged	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Lights	NULL
sprang	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
click	NULL
.	NULL

Gathering	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
sheet	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
Gloria	NULL
dove	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
sight	NULL

shutting	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
horror	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
unpremeditated	NULL
visitation	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL

of	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
stricken	NULL
sensibilities	NULL
save	NULL
that	NULL

...	NULL
The	NULL
night	NULL
clerk	NULL
was	NULL
speaking	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
tone	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
servant	NULL

half	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
teacher	NULL
reproving	NULL

schoolboy	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sorry	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL

Yet	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL

She	NULL
heard	NULL

Catching	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL
gave	NULL
an	NULL

not	NULL
gone	NULL

the	NULL

He	NULL

sent	NULL

his	NULL
call	NULL

said	NULL

For	NULL

they	NULL

awake	NULL

Gloria	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL

Anthony	NULL
staring	NULL
blindly	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
overhead	NULL

After	NULL

it	NULL
came	NULL
gradually	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
laughed	NULL
and	NULL
joked	NULL
at	NULL

They	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
tradition	NULL
to	NULL
fit	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
whenever	NULL
that	NULL
overpowering	NULL
terror	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
laugh	NULL

played	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL

to	NULL
Gloria	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL

a	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
keen	NULL
disappointment	NULL

later	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
times	NULL

The	NULL

almost	NULL
the	NULL

duty	NULL
of	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
day	NULL

It	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL

by	NULL
this	NULL

silence	NULL

by	NULL

by	NULL
this	NULL

by	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL

with	NULL
their	NULL

that	NULL
her	NULL

itself	NULL

Because	NULL
she	NULL

because	NULL

her	NULL
outrageous	NULL

commendable	NULL
independence	NULL

and	NULL
finally	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
arrogant	NULL
consciousness	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL

never	NULL
seen	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
as	NULL

herself	NULL

Gloria	NULL
had	NULL
developed	NULL

a	NULL

This	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL

with	NULL
overtones	NULL

sentiment	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
example	NULL

her	NULL
stomach	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
certain	NULL
dishes	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL

anything	NULL

There	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
lemonade	NULL

a	NULL
tomato	NULL

late	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL

then	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
lunch	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
stuffed	NULL
tomato	NULL

Not	NULL

did	NULL
she	NULL
require	NULL
food	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
selection	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL

in	NULL

this	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
annoying	NULL
half	NULL
hours	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
fortnight	NULL
occurred	NULL
in	NULL
Los	NULL

when	NULL
an	NULL
unhappy	NULL

brought	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
quavered	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL

regarded	NULL

wrathfully	NULL

Gloria	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL

when	NULL
the	NULL
waiter	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
discreetly	NULL
away	NULL
she	NULL
banged	NULL
both	NULL

the	NULL
china	NULL

rattled	NULL

insisted	NULL
Gloria	NULL
with	NULL
ready	NULL
sophistry	NULL

Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
bewildered	NULL

tried	NULL
another	NULL
tack	NULL

She	NULL
picked	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
fork	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
poking	NULL
contemptuously	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
tomato	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Anthony	NULL
expected	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
flinging	NULL
the	NULL
stuffings	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
directions	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
approximately	NULL
as	NULL
angry	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
detected	NULL
a	NULL
spark	NULL
of	NULL
hate	NULL
directed	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
toward	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
toward	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL

--	NULL
and	NULL
Gloria	NULL
angry	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
,	NULL
unapproachable	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
surprisingly	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
tentatively	NULL
raised	NULL
the	NULL
fork	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
and	NULL
tasted	NULL
the	NULL
chicken	NULL
salad	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
frown	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
abated	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
anxiously	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
no	NULL
comment	NULL
and	NULL
daring	NULL
scarcely	NULL
to	NULL
breathe	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
tasted	NULL
another	NULL
forkful	NULL

in	NULL
another	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
eating	NULL

With	NULL
difficulty	NULL
Anthony	NULL
restrained	NULL
a	NULL
chuckle	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
possible	NULL
connection	NULL
with	NULL
chicken	NULL
salad	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
incident	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
variations	NULL
,	NULL
ran	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
lugubrious	NULL
fugue	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
year	NULL
of	NULL
marriage	NULL
;	NULL
always	NULL
it	NULL
left	NULL
Anthony	NULL
baffled	NULL
,	NULL
irritated	NULL

and	NULL
depressed	NULL

But	NULL
another	NULL
rough	NULL
brushing	NULL
of	NULL
temperaments	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
laundry-bags	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
even	NULL
more	NULL
annoying	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
ended	NULL
inevitably	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
decisive	NULL
defeat	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
afternoon	NULL
in	NULL
Coronado	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
longest	NULL
stay	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
trip	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
,	NULL
Gloria	NULL
was	NULL
arraying	NULL
herself	NULL
brilliantly	NULL
for	NULL
tea	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
down-stairs	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
latest	NULL
rumor	NULL

Europe	NULL

entered	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL

kissed	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL

her	NULL
powdered	NULL

went	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
dresser	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
pulling	NULL
out	NULL

pushing	NULL
in	NULL
of	NULL
drawers	NULL
,	NULL
evidently	NULL
unsatisfactory	NULL

he	NULL
turned	NULL
around	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Unfinished	NULL
Masterpiece	NULL

"	NULL
Got	NULL
any	NULL
handkerchiefs	NULL

asked	NULL

shook	NULL

Anthony	NULL
hesitated	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
sudden	NULL
discernment	NULL
,	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
closet	NULL
door	NULL

His	NULL
suspicions	NULL
were	NULL
verified	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
hook	NULL
provided	NULL
hung	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
bag	NULL
furnished	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
clothes	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
them	NULL
there	NULL
himself	NULL

The	NULL
floor	NULL
beneath	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
littered	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
astonishing	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
finery	NULL
--	NULL
lingerie	NULL

most	NULL

indubitably	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL

open	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL

Gloria	NULL

The	NULL

What	NULL
could	NULL
Anthony	NULL
do	NULL
then	NULL
but	NULL
draw	NULL
her	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
knee	NULL

They	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL

They	NULL
bought	NULL
some	NULL

But	NULL
two	NULL

Anthony	NULL
looked	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

and	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
bag	NULL
still	NULL
hung	NULL
limp	NULL
upon	NULL
its	NULL

that	NULL

Gloria	NULL

he	NULL
cried	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

"	NULL
Her	NULL
voice	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
real	NULL
distress	NULL

Despairingly	NULL
Anthony	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
phone	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
chambermaid	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
seems	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL

Gloria	NULL
laughed	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
infectiously	NULL
that	NULL
Anthony	NULL
was	NULL
unwise	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

Unfortunate	NULL
man	NULL
!	NULL

In	NULL
some	NULL
intangible	NULL
manner	NULL
his	NULL
smile	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
mistress	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
injured	NULL
righteousness	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
emphatically	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
closet	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
pushing	NULL
her	NULL
laundry	NULL
violently	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bag	NULL

Anthony	NULL
watched	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

implying	NULL
that	NULL

fingers	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
worked	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bone	NULL
by	NULL

He	NULL
considered	NULL

nevertheless	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
an	NULL
object-lesson	NULL

that	NULL
the	NULL

closed	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL

Anthony	NULL
found	NULL
at	NULL

that	NULL
either	NULL

send	NULL

GLORIA	NULL
AND	NULL
GENERAL	NULL
LEE	NULL
On	NULL
their	NULL
way	NULL
East	NULL
they	NULL
stopped	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
in	NULL
Washington	NULL
,	NULL
strolling	NULL
about	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
hostility	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
of	NULL
harsh	NULL
repellent	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
distance	NULL
without	NULL
freedom	NULL

of	NULL
pomp	NULL
without	NULL
splendor	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
pasty-pale	NULL
and	NULL
self-conscious	NULL
city	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
second	NULL
day	NULL
they	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
ill-advised	NULL
trip	NULL
to	NULL
General	NULL
Lee	NULL
's	NULL
old	NULL
home	NULL
at	NULL
Arlington	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bus	NULL
which	NULL
bore	NULL
them	NULL
was	NULL
crowded	NULL
with	NULL
hot	NULL
,	NULL
unprosperous	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
intimate	NULL
to	NULL
Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
storm	NULL
brewing	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
broke	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Zoo	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
party	NULL
stopped	NULL
for	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Zoo	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
,	NULL
smelt	NULL
of	NULL
monkeys	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
laughed	NULL
;	NULL
Gloria	NULL
called	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
curse	NULL
of	NULL
Heaven	NULL
upon	NULL
monkeys	NULL

including	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
malevolence	NULL

the	NULL
bus	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
perspiring	NULL
offspring	NULL
who	NULL

hied	NULL
themselves	NULL
monkey-ward	NULL

Eventually	NULL
the	NULL
bus	NULL
moved	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
Arlington	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
it	NULL
met	NULL
other	NULL
busses	NULL

immediately	NULL
a	NULL
swarm	NULL

women	NULL

leaving	NULL
a	NULL
trail	NULL

through	NULL
the	NULL
halls	NULL

crowding	NULL
at	NULL

the	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL

SENTIMENT	NULL
Simultaneously	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
fall	NULL
of	NULL
Liège	NULL

Anthony	NULL
and	NULL
Gloria	NULL
arrived	NULL
in	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
retrospect	NULL
the	NULL
six	NULL
weeks	NULL
seemed	NULL
miraculously	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL

extent	NULL

as	NULL

they	NULL
were	NULL
essentially	NULL
companionable	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
struggle	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
conversations	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
level	NULL
of	NULL
discussions	NULL
.	NULL

Arguments	NULL
were	NULL
fatal	NULL
to	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
disposition	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
been	NULL
associated	NULL
either	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
mental	NULL
inferiors	NULL

with	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
almost	NULL
hostile	NULL
intimidation	NULL

her	NULL
beauty	NULL

had	NULL
not	NULL
dared	NULL
to	NULL
contradict	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
naturally	NULL

then	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
irritated	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
Anthony	NULL
emerged	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
state	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
pronouncements	NULL
were	NULL
an	NULL
infallible	NULL
and	NULL
ultimate	NULL
decision	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
failed	NULL
to	NULL
realize	NULL

first	NULL

that	NULL
this	NULL

the	NULL
result	NULL

her	NULL

female	NULL

education	NULL

partly	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
beauty	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
inclined	NULL

include	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
entire	NULL
sex	NULL
as	NULL
curiously	NULL

definitely	NULL
limited	NULL

It	NULL
maddened	NULL
him	NULL

find	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
sense	NULL

justice	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
subject	NULL
did	NULL
interest	NULL
her	NULL

her	NULL
brain	NULL
tired	NULL
less	NULL
quickly	NULL

his	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
he	NULL
chiefly	NULL
missed	NULL

her	NULL

the	NULL
pedantic	NULL

the	NULL
sense	NULL

order	NULL

the	NULL

he	NULL
understood	NULL

went	NULL
away	NULL

thanking	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

They	NULL

and	NULL
Gloria	NULL
rushed	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL

in	NULL

So	NULL

concerned	NULL
both	NULL

limping	NULL

them	NULL

them	NULL
through	NULL

over	NULL
a	NULL

alternated	NULL

They	NULL
left	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL

past	NULL
a	NULL

rakishly	NULL
through	NULL

Anthony	NULL

He	NULL
stopped	NULL
the	NULL
car	NULL
cautiously	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL

they	NULL
changed	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL

noise	NULL
the	NULL

was	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
gear	NULL

Gloria	NULL
adding	NULL
an	NULL
accompaniment	NULL
of	NULL
laughter	NULL

seemed	NULL

disquieting	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

Here	NULL

she	NULL
yelled	NULL

Their	NULL
heads	NULL
snapped	NULL
back	NULL
like	NULL
marionettes	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
wire	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
car	NULL
leaped	NULL
ahead	NULL

curved	NULL
retchingly	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
standing	NULL
milk-wagon	NULL

whose	NULL
driver	NULL
stood	NULL
up	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL

bellowed	NULL
after	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
immemorial	NULL
tradition	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
Anthony	NULL
retorted	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
brief	NULL
epigrams	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
grossness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

He	NULL
cut	NULL
his	NULL
remarks	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
Gloria	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
growing	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
grave	NULL
mistake	NULL
in	NULL
relinquishing	NULL

that	NULL

That	NULL
afternoon	NULL
the	NULL
car	NULL
joined	NULL
the	NULL
laundry-bags	NULL
and	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
appetite	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
trinity	NULL
of	NULL

He	NULL
warned	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
railroad	NULL

he	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
approaching	NULL

sat	NULL
silently	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL
between	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL

of	NULL
hers	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
house	NULL
materialized	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
abstraction	NULL

for	NULL

he	NULL
surrendered	NULL
gloomily	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL

re-relinquished	NULL
the	NULL

Mutely	NULL
he	NULL
beseeched	NULL
her	NULL

Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
instantly	NULL
cheered	NULL

vowed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL

But	NULL
because	NULL

persisted	NULL
callously	NULL
in	NULL
remaining	NULL
upon	NULL

Gloria	NULL
ducked	NULL
down	NULL

thereafter	NULL

was	NULL
never	NULL

way	NULL
became	NULL
scarred	NULL
with	NULL

shoulders	NULL
of	NULL
stone	NULL
.	NULL

Three	NULL
farmhouses	NULL
faced	NULL

momentarily	NULL

slid	NULL

up	NULL
in	NULL

around	NULL

Gloria	NULL

hesitating	NULL
between	NULL
two	NULL

making	NULL
her	NULL
choice	NULL
too	NULL

drove	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
fire-hydrant	NULL

ripped	NULL
the	NULL

from	NULL

when	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

west	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL

where	NULL
it	NULL
rested	NULL
against	NULL

sky	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
warm	NULL
blue	NULL
cloak	NULL
buttoned	NULL
with	NULL
tiny	NULL

The	NULL

house	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
there	NULL
when	NULL

were	NULL
probably	NULL
witches	NULL

when	NULL
Paul	NULL

considerably	NULL

follow	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL

Between	NULL

Anthony	NULL

kiss	NULL
her	NULL

And	NULL

had	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL

both	NULL

Anthony	NULL
claimed	NULL

This	NULL
provoked	NULL
an	NULL

extremely	NULL
sentimental	NULL
conversation	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
whether	NULL
Anthony	NULL
did	NULL

Though	NULL

assured	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL

she	NULL
insisted	NULL
upon	NULL
doubting	NULL
him	NULL

Eventually	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
assumed	NULL
its	NULL
eternal	NULL
monotone	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
What	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
thoroughly	NULL

with	NULL
great	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
history	NULL

tastes	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL

Anthony	NULL

neither	NULL

who	NULL

curtain	NULL
across	NULL

And	NULL

Having	NULL
danced	NULL

splashed	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
lavish	NULL
spring	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
and	NULL
Gloria	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL

had	NULL
spent	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL

watching	NULL

This	NULL
emphatically	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL

Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
unfailing	NULL

her	NULL
happier	NULL

She	NULL
definitely	NULL
enjoyed	NULL

she	NULL
loved	NULL

So	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
began	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
radical	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
ménage	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
icy-hearted	NULL
Scandinavian	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL

cooking	NULL
and	NULL
sardonic	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
waiting	NULL
on	NULL

had	NULL
so	NULL
depressed	NULL
Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
efficient	NULL
Japanese	NULL
whose	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
Tanalahaka	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
who	NULL
confessed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
heeded	NULL
any	NULL
summons	NULL
which	NULL
included	NULL
the	NULL
dissyllable	NULL
"	NULL
Tana	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Tana	NULL
was	NULL
unusually	NULL
small	NULL
even	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
Japanese	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
displayed	NULL
a	NULL
somewhat	NULL
naïve	NULL
conception	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
arrival	NULL
from	NULL
"	NULL
R.	NULL
Gugimoniki	NULL
,	NULL
Japanese	NULL
Reliable	NULL
Employment	NULL
Agency	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
Anthony	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
treasures	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
trunk	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
included	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
collection	NULL
of	NULL
Japanese	NULL
post	NULL
cards	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
for	NULL
explaining	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
employer	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
individually	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
great	NULL
length	NULL
.	NULL

Among	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
of	NULL
pornographic	NULL
intent	NULL
and	NULL
plainly	NULL
of	NULL
American	NULL
origin	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
makers	NULL
had	NULL
modestly	NULL
omitted	NULL
both	NULL
their	NULL
names	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
form	NULL
for	NULL
mailing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
next	NULL
brought	NULL
out	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
handiwork	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
American	NULL
pants	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
suits	NULL
of	NULL
solid	NULL
silk	NULL
underwear	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
informed	NULL
Anthony	NULL
confidentially	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
purpose	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
these	NULL
latter	NULL
were	NULL
reserved	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
next	NULL
exhibit	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
good	NULL
copy	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
etching	NULL
of	NULL
Abraham	NULL
Lincoln	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
whose	NULL
face	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
an	NULL
unmistakable	NULL
Japanese	NULL
cast	NULL
.	NULL

Last	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
flute	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
himself	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
broken	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
fix	NULL
it	NULL
soon	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
these	NULL
polite	NULL
formalities	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Anthony	NULL
conjectured	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
native	NULL
to	NULL
Japan	NULL
,	NULL
Tana	NULL
delivered	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
harangue	NULL
in	NULL
splintered	NULL
English	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
relation	NULL
of	NULL
master	NULL
and	NULL
servant	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
Anthony	NULL
gathered	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
worked	NULL
on	NULL
large	NULL
estates	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
quarrelled	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
servants	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
honest	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
time	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
"	NULL
honest	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
became	NULL
rather	NULL
irritated	NULL
with	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
Anthony	NULL
persisted	NULL
stubbornly	NULL
that	NULL
Tana	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
"	NULL
hornets	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
extent	NULL
of	NULL
buzzing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bee	NULL
and	NULL
flapping	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
to	NULL
imitate	NULL
wings	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
three-quarters	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
Anthony	NULL
was	NULL
released	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
warm	NULL
assurance	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
other	NULL
nice	NULL
chats	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Tana	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
"	NULL
how	NULL
we	NULL
do	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
countree	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Such	NULL
was	NULL
Tana	NULL
's	NULL
garrulous	NULL
première	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
house	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
fulfilled	NULL
its	NULL
promise	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
conscientious	NULL
and	NULL
honorable	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
unquestionably	NULL
a	NULL
terrific	NULL
bore	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
control	NULL
his	NULL
tongue	NULL
,	NULL
sometimes	NULL
continuing	NULL
from	NULL
paragraph	NULL
to	NULL
paragraph	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
akin	NULL
to	NULL
pain	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
small	NULL
brown	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Sunday	NULL
and	NULL
Monday	NULL
afternoons	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
comic	NULL
sections	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
newspapers	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
cartoon	NULL
which	NULL
contained	NULL
a	NULL
facetious	NULL
Japanese	NULL
butler	NULL
diverted	NULL
him	NULL
enormously	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
claimed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
protagonist	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
to	NULL
Anthony	NULL
appeared	NULL
clearly	NULL
Oriental	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
really	NULL
an	NULL
American	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
difficulty	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
funny	NULL
paper	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
aided	NULL
by	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
spelled	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
three	NULL
pictures	NULL
and	NULL
assimilated	NULL
their	NULL
context	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
concentration	NULL
surely	NULL
adequate	NULL
for	NULL
Kant	NULL
's	NULL
"	NULL
Critique	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
entirely	NULL
forgotten	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
pictures	NULL
were	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
June	NULL
Anthony	NULL
and	NULL
Gloria	NULL
celebrated	NULL
their	NULL
first	NULL
anniversary	NULL
by	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
date	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Anthony	NULL
knocked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
ran	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
sat	NULL
together	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
couch	NULL
calling	NULL
over	NULL
those	NULL
names	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
for	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
new	NULL
combinations	NULL
of	NULL
endearments	NULL
ages	NULL
old	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
"	NULL
date	NULL
"	NULL
was	NULL
appended	NULL
no	NULL
attenuated	NULL
good-night	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
ecstasy	NULL
of	NULL
regret	NULL
.	NULL

Later	NULL
in	NULL
June	NULL
horror	NULL
leered	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
struck	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
frightened	NULL
her	NULL
bright	NULL
soul	NULL
back	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
generation	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
slowly	NULL
it	NULL
faded	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
faded	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
that	NULL
impenetrable	NULL
darkness	NULL
whence	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
--	NULL
taking	NULL
relentlessly	NULL
its	NULL
modicum	NULL
of	NULL
youth	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
an	NULL
infallible	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dramatic	NULL
it	NULL
chose	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
railroad	NULL
station	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
wretched	NULL
village	NULL
near	NULL
Portchester	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
station	NULL
platform	NULL
lay	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
bare	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
prairie	NULL
,	NULL
exposed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dusty	NULL
yellow	NULL
sun	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
glance	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
most	NULL
obnoxious	NULL
type	NULL
of	NULL
countryman	NULL
who	NULL
lives	NULL
near	NULL
a	NULL
metropolis	NULL
and	NULL
has	NULL
attained	NULL
its	NULL
cheap	NULL
smartness	NULL
without	NULL
its	NULL
urbanity	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
dozen	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
yokels	NULL
,	NULL
red-eyed	NULL
,	NULL
cheerless	NULL
as	NULL
scarecrows	NULL
,	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
incident	NULL
.	NULL

Dimly	NULL
it	NULL
passed	NULL
across	NULL
their	NULL
confused	NULL
and	NULL
uncomprehending	NULL
minds	NULL
,	NULL
taken	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
broadest	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
coarse	NULL
joke	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
subtlest	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
shame	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
there	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
platform	NULL
a	NULL
measure	NULL
of	NULL
brightness	NULL
faded	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
Eric	NULL
Merriam	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sitting	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
decanter	NULL
of	NULL
Scotch	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
hot	NULL
summer	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Gloria	NULL
and	NULL
Constance	NULL
Merriam	NULL
swam	NULL
and	NULL
sunned	NULL
themselves	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Beach	NULL
Club	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
striped	NULL
parasol-awning	NULL
,	NULL
Gloria	NULL
stretched	NULL
sensuously	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
soft	NULL
hot	NULL
sand	NULL
,	NULL
tanning	NULL
her	NULL
inevitable	NULL
legs	NULL
.	NULL

Later	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
four	NULL
played	NULL
with	NULL
inconsequential	NULL
sandwiches	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
Gloria	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
,	NULL
tapping	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
knee	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
parasol	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
his	NULL
attention	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
dear	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
unwillingly	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
nothing	NULL
seemed	NULL
of	NULL
more	NULL
importance	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
idle	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
shady	NULL
porch	NULL
drinking	NULL
mellowed	NULL
Scotch	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
his	NULL
host	NULL
reminisced	NULL
interminably	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
byplay	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
forgotten	NULL
political	NULL
campaign	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
've	NULL
really	NULL
got	NULL

repeated	NULL
Gloria	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

station	NULL

Come	NULL
on	NULL

Anthony	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
commanded	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
more	NULL
imperiously	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
see	NULL
here	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Merriam	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
yarn	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
conventional	NULL
objections	NULL
,	NULL
meanwhile	NULL
provocatively	NULL
filling	NULL
his	NULL
guest	NULL
's	NULL
glass	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
high-ball	NULL
that	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
sipped	NULL
through	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
annoyed	NULL
"	NULL
We	NULL
really	NULL
_	NULL
must	NULL
!	NULL

_	NULL
"	NULL
Anthony	NULL
drank	NULL
it	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
elaborate	NULL
bow	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
hostess	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
seems	NULL
we	NULL
'	NULL
must	NULL
,	NULL
'	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
little	NULL
grace	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
following	NULL
Gloria	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
garden-walk	NULL
between	NULL
tall	NULL
rose-bushes	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
parasol	NULL
brushing	NULL
gently	NULL
the	NULL
June-blooming	NULL
leaves	NULL
.	NULL

Most	NULL
inconsiderate	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
with	NULL
injured	NULL
naïvete	NULL
that	NULL
Gloria	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
interrupted	NULL
such	NULL
innocent	NULL
and	NULL
harmless	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
whiskey	NULL
had	NULL
both	NULL
soothed	NULL
and	NULL
clarified	NULL
the	NULL
restless	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
this	NULL
same	NULL
attitude	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
to	NULL
retreat	NULL
from	NULL
pleasant	NULL
episodes	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
parasol	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
flicker	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
eye	NULL
?	NULL

His	NULL
unwillingness	NULL
blurred	NULL
to	NULL
ill	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
rose	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
resistless	NULL
bubble	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
kept	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
perversely	NULL
inhibiting	NULL
a	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
reproach	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
taxi	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Inn	NULL
;	NULL
rode	NULL
silently	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
station	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Anthony	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
assert	NULL
his	NULL
will	NULL
against	NULL
this	NULL
cool	NULL
and	NULL
impervious	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
obtain	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
magnificent	NULL
effort	NULL
a	NULL
mastery	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
infinitely	NULL
desirable	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

's	NULL

over	NULL
to	NULL

the	NULL
Barneses	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
without	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Barnes	NULL

a	NULL

place	NULL
several	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
went	NULL

she	NULL
answered	NULL
shortly	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL
sure	NULL

'd	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
enough	NULL
note	NULL
,	NULL
braced	NULL
himself	NULL
stubbornly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
added	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
had	NULL
slipped	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL

she	NULL
knew	NULL
with	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL

him	NULL
that	NULL

In	NULL
his	NULL

one	NULL
idea	NULL

that	NULL

unless	NULL
here	NULL

now	NULL
he	NULL
asserted	NULL
himself	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL

since	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
whim	NULL
she	NULL

His	NULL

approached	NULL
momentarily	NULL
a	NULL

hate	NULL

a	NULL

Without	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
ticket	NULL
office	NULL

simultaneously	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL

took	NULL

This	NULL

she	NULL
tried	NULL

away	NULL

him	NULL

he	NULL
only	NULL
tightened	NULL
his	NULL

her	NULL

She	NULL

only	NULL

At	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
fury	NULL
his	NULL
uncertainty	NULL
returned	NULL

he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL

give	NULL
in	NULL

that	NULL

her	NULL

Ah	NULL

him	NULL
now	NULL

afterward	NULL
she	NULL

him	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

it	NULL

Anthony	NULL

silent	NULL

trembling	NULL
himself	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

decreasing	NULL

off	NULL

He	NULL
dropped	NULL

had	NULL
won	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
with	NULL
fine	NULL

For	NULL
answer	NULL
Gloria	NULL
seized	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
with	NULL
both	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL

raising	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
bit	NULL
deeply	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
thumb	NULL

He	NULL
scarcely	NULL
noticed	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL

seeing	NULL
the	NULL
blood	NULL
spurt	NULL
he	NULL
absent-mindedly	NULL
drew	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
handkerchief	NULL

wrapped	NULL
the	NULL
wound	NULL

That	NULL
too	NULL

part	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
subdued	NULL
cry	NULL

despair	NULL
she	NULL
yielded	NULL
herself	NULL
up	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL
car	NULL

her	NULL
silence	NULL
broken	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL

Anthony	NULL
stared	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL

his	NULL
mind	NULL
working	NULL
dully	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
slowly	NULL
changing	NULL
significance	NULL

what	NULL

occurred	NULL

Something	NULL
was	NULL
wrong	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
last	NULL
cry	NULL

Gloria	NULL
's	NULL

struck	NULL
a	NULL
chord	NULL
which	NULL
echoed	NULL
posthumously	NULL

with	NULL
incongruous	NULL
disquiet	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
right	NULL
--	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
pathetic	NULL
little	NULL
thing	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
broken	NULL
and	NULL
dispirited	NULL
,	NULL
humiliated	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
measure	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
lot	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sleeves	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
dress	NULL
were	NULL
torn	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
parasol	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
forgotten	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
platform	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
costume	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL
morning	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
wondering	NULL
if	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
the	NULL
incident	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
persistently	NULL
there	NULL
recurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
her	NULL
cry	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
All	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL

This	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
confused	NULL

increasing	NULL
worry	NULL

It	NULL
fitted	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Gloria	NULL

lay	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
--	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
a	NULL
proud	NULL
Gloria	NULL

nor	NULL
any	NULL
Gloria	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
cease	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL

was	NULL
unthinkable	NULL

it	NULL

problematical	NULL

Gloria	NULL

her	NULL
arrogance	NULL

her	NULL
independence	NULL

her	NULL
virginal	NULL
confidence	NULL

would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
glory	NULL

the	NULL
radiant	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
precious	NULL

charming	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
ineffably	NULL

triumphantly	NULL
herself	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
drunk	NULL
even	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
drunk	NULL
as	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
realize	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
drunkenness	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
house	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
still	NULL
wrestling	NULL
helplessly	NULL
and	NULL
sombrely	NULL
with	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
stupor	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
after	NULL
one	NULL
o'clock	NULL

the	NULL
hall	NULL
seemed	NULL
extraordinarily	NULL
quiet	NULL
when	NULL
Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
wide-eyed	NULL

sleepless	NULL
,	NULL
traversed	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
pushed	NULL
open	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL
befuddled	NULL
to	NULL
open	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
was	NULL
stale	NULL
and	NULL
thick	NULL
with	NULL
whiskey	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stood	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
slender	NULL
,	NULL
exquisitely	NULL
graceful	NULL
figure	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
boyish	NULL
silk	NULL
pajamas	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
abandon	NULL
she	NULL
flung	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
journey	NULL
to	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
sudden	NULL
flashes	NULL
of	NULL
illumination	NULL
vouchsafed	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
are	NULL
dominated	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
and	NULL
beloved	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
show	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
world	NULL
of	NULL
harder	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
fiercely	NULL
trained	NULL
and	NULL
grappling	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
abstractions	NULL
of	NULL
thought	NULL
and	NULL
war	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
that	NULL
world	NULL
the	NULL
arms	NULL
of	NULL
Gloria	NULL
would	NULL
exist	NULL
only	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
hot	NULL
embrace	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
mistress	NULL
,	NULL
coolly	NULL
sought	NULL
and	NULL
quickly	NULL
forgotten	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
unfamiliar	NULL
phantoms	NULL
were	NULL
crowding	NULL
closely	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
boarded	NULL
his	NULL
train	NULL
for	NULL
Marietta	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Grand	NULL
Central	NULL
Station	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
car	NULL
was	NULL
crowded	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
secured	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
vacant	NULL
seat	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
after	NULL
several	NULL
minutes	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
even	NULL
a	NULL
casual	NULL
glance	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
lay	NULL
of	NULL
jaw	NULL
and	NULL
nose	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
curved	NULL
chin	NULL
and	NULL
small	NULL
,	NULL
puffed-under	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
recognized	NULL
Joseph	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
.	NULL

Simultaneously	NULL
they	NULL
both	NULL
half	NULL
rose	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
half	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
exchanged	NULL
what	NULL
amounted	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
handshake	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
to	NULL
complete	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
both	NULL
half	NULL
laughed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
remarked	NULL
Anthony	NULL
without	NULL
inspiration	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL
seen	NULL
you	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Immediately	NULL
he	NULL
regretted	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
and	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
add	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
you	NULL
lived	NULL
out	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
anticipated	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
asking	NULL
pleasantly	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
How	NULL
's	NULL
your	NULL
wife	NULL
?	NULL

...	NULL
"	NULL
"	NULL
She	NULL
's	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
've	NULL
you	NULL
been	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Excellent	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

His	NULL
tone	NULL
amplified	NULL
the	NULL
grandeur	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Anthony	NULL
that	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
year	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
tremendously	NULL
in	NULL
dignity	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boiled	NULL
look	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
"	NULL
done	NULL
"	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
addition	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
overdressed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
inappropriate	NULL
facetiousness	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
affected	NULL
in	NULL
ties	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
sturdy	NULL
dark	NULL
pattern	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
right	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
formerly	NULL
displayed	NULL
two	NULL
heavy	NULL
rings	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
innocent	NULL
of	NULL
ornament	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
raw	NULL
glow	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
manicure	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
dignity	NULL
appeared	NULL
also	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
personality	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
last	NULL
aura	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
successful	NULL
travelling-man	NULL
had	NULL
faded	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
deliberate	NULL
ingratiation	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
lowest	NULL
form	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
bawdy	NULL
joke	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Pullman	NULL
smoker	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
fawned	NULL
upon	NULL
financially	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
attained	NULL
aloofness	NULL
;	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
snubbed	NULL
socially	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
acquired	NULL
reticence	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
whatever	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
weight	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
bulk	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
correct	NULL
superiority	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
presence	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
D'you	NULL

So	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
excitement	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
God	NULL
!	NULL

His	NULL
fists	NULL
were	NULL
clenched	NULL
;	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
worked	NULL
himself	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
tremendous	NULL
pitch	NULL
of	NULL
indignation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
out	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
car	NULL
in	NULL
sight	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
watch	NULL
stood	NULL
at	NULL
four	NULL
minutes	NULL
of	NULL
five	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
furious	NULL
energy	NULL
he	NULL
dashed	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
path	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
bend	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL

farmer	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
undignified	NULL
pursuit	NULL
of	NULL
dignity	NULL

he	NULL
rushed	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
shelter	NULL

the	NULL
house	NULL
as	NULL
quickly	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
rushed	NULL
out	NULL

Pacing	NULL
up	NULL

down	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
began	NULL
an	NULL

rehearsal	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL

would	NULL

no	NULL

it	NULL
sounded	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL

the	NULL

phrase	NULL

So	NULL
this	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
dignified	NULL

hurt	NULL

grieved	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
So	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
what	NULL
_	NULL
you	NULL

do	NULL
when	NULL

have	NULL

go	NULL
up	NULL

He	NULL
paused	NULL

Anthony	NULL
neither	NULL

rose	NULL

up	NULL

Listlessly	NULL
Anthony	NULL
dropped	NULL

Yet	NULL
it	NULL

WINTER	NULL
She	NULL
rolled	NULL
over	NULL

lay	NULL

refinement	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
passage	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL

into	NULL
the	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL

then	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL

releasing	NULL

burdened	NULL
quota	NULL

her	NULL

back	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
sharply	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
climbed	NULL
into	NULL
bed	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
closed	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Almost	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
thing	NULL
she	NULL
remembered	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Lacy	NULL
had	NULL

Anthony	NULL

guessed	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
both	NULL
attempted	NULL

bow	NULL

collapsed	NULL
absurdly	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
battalion	NULL
of	NULL
empty	NULL
milk	NULL
bottles	NULL
just	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL

There	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
two	NULL
dozen	NULL
milk	NULL
bottles	NULL
standing	NULL
open-mouthed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
conceive	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
plausible	NULL
explanation	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
milk	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
attracted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
singing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Lacy	NULL

had	NULL
hurried	NULL

spontaneously	NULL

with	NULL
some	NULL

lying	NULL
there	NULL

They	NULL

almost	NULL
four	NULL
months	NULL

since	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL

grown	NULL
too	NULL
cool	NULL
in	NULL
late	NULL
October	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
California	NULL
this	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
partly	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
lack	NULL
of	NULL

partly	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL

during	NULL

Of	NULL

no	NULL

it	NULL
stretch	NULL

Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
many	NULL

unsatisfactory	NULL
hours	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
densely	NULL

and	NULL
trying	NULL

even	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
a	NULL

party	NULL
"	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
two	NULL

he	NULL

Maury	NULL
had	NULL
invariably	NULL
paid	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
their	NULL
share	NULL

the	NULL
expenses	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
buy	NULL

Dick	NULL

his	NULL
astonishing	NULL

about	NULL

told	NULL

In	NULL

years	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
publication	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
Demon	NULL
Lover	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Dick	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
over	NULL
twenty-five	NULL
thousand	NULL
dollars	NULL

most	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
lately	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
reward	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
swell	NULL
unprecedentedly	NULL

result	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
voracious	NULL
hunger	NULL

the	NULL
motion	NULL

He	NULL
received	NULL
seven	NULL

there	NULL

a	NULL

none	NULL

the	NULL

,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
several	NULL
that	NULL
Anthony	NULL
considered	NULL
downright	NULL
cheap	NULL

These	NULL
,	NULL
Dick	NULL
explained	NULL
severely	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
widen	NULL
his	NULL
audience	NULL

Was	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
attained	NULL
real	NULL
permanence	NULL
from	NULL
Shakespeare	NULL

had	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
many	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
elect	NULL
?	NULL

Though	NULL
Anthony	NULL
and	NULL
Maury	NULL
disagreed	NULL
,	NULL
Gloria	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
ahead	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
money	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
counted	NULL
anyhow	NULL

Maury	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
stouter	NULL
,	NULL
faintly	NULL
mellower	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
complaisant	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
in	NULL
Philadelphia	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
such	NULL
occasions	NULL
the	NULL
four	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
travelled	NULL
the	NULL
popular	NULL
routes	NULL
from	NULL
dinner	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
theatre	NULL
,	NULL
thence	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Frolic	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
urging	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ever-curious	NULL
Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cellars	NULL
of	NULL
Greenwich	NULL
Village	NULL
,	NULL
notorious	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
furious	NULL
but	NULL
short-lived	NULL
vogue	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
new	NULL
poetry	NULL
movement	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

In	NULL
January	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
many	NULL
monologues	NULL
directed	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
reticent	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
"	NULL
get	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
please	NULL
his	NULL
grandfather	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
measure	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
it	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
discovered	NULL
during	NULL
several	NULL
tentative	NULL
semi-social	NULL
calls	NULL
that	NULL
employers	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
"	NULL
try	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
months	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
grandson	NULL
of	NULL
Adam	NULL
Patch	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
received	NULL
everywhere	NULL
with	NULL
marked	NULL
courtesy	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
back	NULL
number	NULL
now	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
heyday	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fame	NULL
as	NULL
first	NULL
an	NULL
"	NULL
oppressor	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
an	NULL
uplifter	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
preceding	NULL
his	NULL
retirement	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
even	NULL
found	NULL
several	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
younger	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
Adam	NULL
Patch	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
dead	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

Eventually	NULL
Anthony	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
grandfather	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
his	NULL
advice	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
enter	NULL
the	NULL
bond	NULL
business	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
salesman	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
tedious	NULL
suggestion	NULL
to	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
he	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
.	NULL

Sheer	NULL
money	NULL
in	NULL
deft	NULL
manipulation	NULL
had	NULL
fascinations	NULL
under	NULL
all	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
almost	NULL
any	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
manufacturing	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
insufferably	NULL
dull	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
considered	NULL
newspaper	NULL
work	NULL
but	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
hours	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
ordered	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
married	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
lingered	NULL
over	NULL
pleasant	NULL
fancies	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
either	NULL
as	NULL
editor	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
brilliant	NULL
weekly	NULL
of	NULL
opinion	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
American	NULL
Mercure	NULL
de	NULL
France	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
as	NULL
scintillant	NULL
producer	NULL
of	NULL
satiric	NULL
comedy	NULL
and	NULL
Parisian	NULL
musical	NULL
revue	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
approaches	NULL
to	NULL
these	NULL
latter	NULL
guilds	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
guarded	NULL
by	NULL
professional	NULL
secrets	NULL
.	NULL

Men	NULL
drifted	NULL
into	NULL
them	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
devious	NULL
highways	NULL
of	NULL
writing	NULL
and	NULL
acting	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
palpably	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
magazine	NULL
unless	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
he	NULL
entered	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
grandfather	NULL
's	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Sanctum	NULL
Americanum	NULL
where	NULL
sat	NULL
the	NULL
president	NULL
of	NULL
Wilson	NULL

Hiemer	NULL
and	NULL
Hardy	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
"	NULL
cleared	NULL
desk	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
issued	NULL
therefrom	NULL
employed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
work	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
twenty-third	NULL
of	NULL
February	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
tribute	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
momentous	NULL
occasion	NULL
this	NULL
two-day	NULL
revel	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
planned	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
working	NULL
he	NULL
'd	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
early	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

Maury	NULL
Noble	NULL
had	NULL
arrived	NULL
from	NULL
Philadelphia	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
trip	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
seeing	NULL
some	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
Wall	NULL
Street	NULL
(	NULL
whom	NULL
,	NULL
incidentally	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
failed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Richard	NULL
Caramel	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
half	NULL
persuaded	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
tricked	NULL
into	NULL
joining	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
condescended	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
wet	NULL
and	NULL
fashionable	NULL
wedding	NULL
on	NULL
Monday	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
had	NULL
occurred	NULL
the	NULL
dénouement	NULL
:	NULL
Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
going	NULL
beyond	NULL
her	NULL
accustomed	NULL
limit	NULL
of	NULL
four	NULL
precisely	NULL
timed	NULL
cocktails	NULL
,	NULL
led	NULL
them	NULL
on	NULL
as	NULL
gay	NULL
and	NULL
joyous	NULL
a	NULL
bacchanal	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
known	NULL
,	NULL
disclosing	NULL
an	NULL
astonishing	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
ballet	NULL
steps	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
singing	NULL
songs	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
confessed	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
taught	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
cook	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
innocent	NULL
and	NULL
seventeen	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
repeated	NULL
these	NULL
by	NULL
request	NULL
at	NULL
intervals	NULL
throughout	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
frank	NULL
conviviality	NULL
that	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
being	NULL
annoyed	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
gratified	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
fresh	NULL
source	NULL
of	NULL
entertainment	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
occasion	NULL
was	NULL
memorable	NULL
in	NULL
other	NULL
ways	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
conversation	NULL
between	NULL
Maury	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
defunct	NULL
crab	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dragging	NULL
around	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
string	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
whether	NULL
the	NULL
crab	NULL
was	NULL
fully	NULL
conversant	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
applications	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
binomial	NULL
theorem	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
aforementioned	NULL
race	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
sedate	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL

escape	NULL

darkness	NULL

Central	NULL
Park	NULL

Finally	NULL
Anthony	NULL

paid	NULL
a	NULL
call	NULL
on	NULL
some	NULL

Gloria	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
mirror	NULL
was	NULL
wondering	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
splendid	NULL
color	NULL
and	NULL
freshness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
looked	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
her	NULL
stomach	NULL
hurt	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
was	NULL
aching	NULL
furiously	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
day	NULL
passed	NULL
slowly	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
riding	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
taxi	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
broker	NULL
's	NULL
to	NULL
borrow	NULL
money	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
bond	NULL
,	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
two	NULL
dollars	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fare	NULL
would	NULL
cost	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
particular	NULL
afternoon	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
endured	NULL
the	NULL
subway	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
taximetre	NULL
reached	NULL
his	NULL
limit	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
walk	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
this	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
drifted	NULL
off	NULL
into	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
characteristic	NULL
day-dreams	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
dream	NULL
he	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
metre	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
too	NULL
fast	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
driver	NULL
had	NULL
dishonestly	NULL
adjusted	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Calmly	NULL
he	NULL
reached	NULL
his	NULL
destination	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
nonchalantly	NULL
handed	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
justly	NULL
owed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
man	NULL
showed	NULL
fight	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
almost	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
were	NULL
up	NULL
Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
knocked	NULL
him	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
terrific	NULL
blow	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
rose	NULL
Anthony	NULL
quickly	NULL
sidestepped	NULL
and	NULL
floored	NULL
him	NULL
definitely	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
crack	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
temple	NULL
.	NULL

...	NULL
He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
court	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
judge	NULL
had	NULL
fined	NULL
him	NULL
five	NULL
dollars	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

Would	NULL
the	NULL
court	NULL
take	NULL
his	NULL
check	NULL
?	NULL

Ah	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
court	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
identify	NULL
himself	NULL
by	NULL
having	NULL
them	NULL
call	NULL
his	NULL
apartment	NULL
.	NULL

...	NULL
They	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Anthony	NULL
Patch	NULL
speaking	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
how	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
?	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
know	NULL
?	NULL

Let	NULL
the	NULL
police	NULL
sergeant	NULL
ask	NULL
her	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
milk	NULL
bottles	NULL
...	NULL
He	NULL
leaned	NULL
forward	NULL
hurriedly	NULL
and	NULL
tapped	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
glass	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
taxi	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
at	NULL
Brooklyn	NULL
Bridge	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
metre	NULL
showed	NULL
a	NULL
dollar	NULL
and	NULL
eighty	NULL
cents	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Anthony	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
omitted	NULL
the	NULL
ten	NULL
per	NULL
cent	NULL
tip	NULL
.	NULL

Later	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
he	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
apartment	NULL
.	NULL

Gloria	NULL
had	NULL
also	NULL
been	NULL
out	NULL
--	NULL
shopping	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
asleep	NULL
,	NULL
curled	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
purchase	NULL
locked	NULL
securely	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
untroubled	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
bundle	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
pressed	NULL
tightly	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
bosom	NULL

a	NULL
child	NULL

a	NULL

was	NULL

The	NULL

interwove	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL

work	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
discussed	NULL

what	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
one	NULL
talked	NULL

whether	NULL
it	NULL

The	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
spectacular	NULL

of	NULL
his	NULL
haughty	NULL
resignation	NULL
in	NULL
January	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL

palace	NULL

was	NULL

did	NULL
the	NULL

all	NULL

Anecdotes	NULL
were	NULL
told	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL

how	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

had	NULL
advised	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
sell	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
hung	NULL

now	NULL

he	NULL
is	NULL

Such	NULL
,	NULL
obviously	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
stuff	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
dizzy	NULL
triumph	NULL
dazzling	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
gypsy	NULL
siren	NULL
to	NULL
content	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
meagre	NULL
wage	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
arithmetical	NULL
improbability	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
eventual	NULL
success	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
Anthony	NULL
the	NULL
notion	NULL
became	NULL
appalling	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
succeed	NULL
here	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
success	NULL
must	NULL
grasp	NULL
and	NULL
limit	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
essential	NULL
element	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
men	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
was	NULL
their	NULL
faith	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
affairs	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
core	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL
being	NULL
equal	NULL
,	NULL
self-assurance	NULL
and	NULL
opportunism	NULL
won	NULL
out	NULL
over	NULL
technical	NULL
knowledge	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
obvious	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
expert	NULL
work	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
appropriate	NULL
efficiency	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
technical	NULL
experts	NULL
were	NULL
kept	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
determination	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
survive	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
splitting	NULL
,	NULL
sickish	NULL
headache	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
crowded	NULL
horror	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
subway	NULL
ringing	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
ears	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
echo	NULL
of	NULL
hell	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
abruptly	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
quit	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
all	NULL
one	NULL
Monday	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
late	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
overcome	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
attacks	NULL
of	NULL
moody	NULL
despair	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
periodically	NULL
succumbed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wrote	NULL
and	NULL
mailed	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Wilson	NULL
,	NULL
confessing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
considered	NULL
himself	NULL
ill	NULL
adapted	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL

Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
coming	NULL
in	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
theatre	NULL
with	NULL
Richard	NULL
Caramel	NULL
,	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
lounge	NULL
,	NULL
silently	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
ceiling	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
depressed	NULL
and	NULL
discouraged	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
time	NULL
since	NULL
their	NULL
marriage	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
whine	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
reproached	NULL
him	NULL
bitterly	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
annoyed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
lay	NULL
there	NULL
so	NULL
utterly	NULL
miserable	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
sorry	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
kneeling	NULL
down	NULL
she	NULL
stroked	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
how	NULL
little	NULL
it	NULL
mattered	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
little	NULL
anything	NULL
mattered	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
loved	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
their	NULL
first	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
reacting	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
cool	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
soft	NULL
as	NULL
breath	NULL
itself	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
ear	NULL
,	NULL
became	NULL
almost	NULL
cheerful	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
talked	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
future	NULL
plans	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
even	NULL
regretted	NULL
,	NULL
silently	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
hastily	NULL
mailed	NULL
his	NULL
resignation	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Even	NULL
when	NULL
everything	NULL
seems	NULL
rotten	NULL
you	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
trust	NULL
that	NULL
judgment	NULL

Gloria	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

In	NULL
mid-April	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
real-estate	NULL
agent	NULL
in	NULL
Marietta	NULL
,	NULL
encouraging	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
house	NULL
for	NULL
another	NULL
year	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
slightly	NULL
increased	NULL
rental	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
enclosing	NULL
a	NULL
lease	NULL
made	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
signatures	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
lease	NULL
and	NULL
letter	NULL
lay	NULL
carelessly	NULL
neglected	NULL
on	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
desk	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
returning	NULL
to	NULL
Marietta	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
weary	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
bored	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
preceding	NULL
summer	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
car	NULL
had	NULL
deteriorated	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
rattling	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
hypochondriacal	NULL
metal	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
financially	NULL
inadvisable	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
another	NULL
wild	NULL
revel	NULL
,	NULL
enduring	NULL
through	NULL
four	NULL
days	NULL
and	NULL
participated	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
time	NULL
or	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
sign	NULL
the	NULL
lease	NULL
;	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
utter	NULL
horror	NULL
they	NULL
signed	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
sent	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
immediately	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
drably	NULL
malevolent	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
licking	NULL
its	NULL
white	NULL
chops	NULL
and	NULL
waiting	NULL
to	NULL
devour	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
's	NULL
that	NULL
lease	NULL

"	NULL

she	NULL
called	NULL
in	NULL
high	NULL
alarm	NULL
one	NULL
Sunday	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
sick	NULL
and	NULL
sober	NULL
to	NULL
reality	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Where	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL
leave	NULL

?	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
here	NULL

"	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
party	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
planned	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
crest	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
exuberance	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
remembered	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
to	NULL
whose	NULL
less	NULL
exhilarated	NULL
moments	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
Anthony	NULL
were	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
importance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
boast	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
transcendent	NULL
merit	NULL
and	NULL
seclusion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
isolated	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
matter	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
noise	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Dick	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
visited	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
cried	NULL
enthusiastically	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
little	NULL
house	NULL
imaginable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
idiotic	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
another	NULL
summer	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
themselves	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
hot	NULL

deserted	NULL
the	NULL

,	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
cool	NULL
and	NULL
ambrosial	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
charms	NULL
of	NULL
Marietta	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
picked	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
lease	NULL
and	NULL
waved	NULL
it	NULL
wildly	NULL
,	NULL
found	NULL
Gloria	NULL
happily	NULL
acquiescent	NULL

and	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
last	NULL
burst	NULL
of	NULL
garrulous	NULL
decision	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
agreed	NULL
with	NULL
solemn	NULL
handshakes	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL

Anthony	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
cried	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
utter	NULL
misery	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
eternity	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
built	NULL
themselves	NULL
a	NULL
prison	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
strike	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
roots	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
stability	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
thought	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
arrange	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
real-estate	NULL
agent	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
could	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
afford	NULL
the	NULL
double	NULL
rent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
Marietta	NULL
meant	NULL
giving	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
apartment	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
reproachless	NULL
apartment	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
exquisite	NULL
bath	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
his	NULL
furniture	NULL

hangings	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
closest	NULL
to	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
had	NULL
--	NULL
familiar	NULL
with	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL

they	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL

THE	NULL
SINISTER	NULL
SUMMER	NULL
There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
horror	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
that	NULL
summer	NULL

It	NULL
came	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL

settled	NULL
itself	NULL

climbing	NULL
up	NULL

until	NULL
it	NULL
oppressed	NULL
their	NULL
very	NULL
sleep	NULL

Anthony	NULL

grew	NULL

Gloria	NULL
finally	NULL
tumbled	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
clothes	NULL
and	NULL
unguents	NULL
ingloriously	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
declaring	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
with	NULL
Anthony	NULL

and	NULL
making	NULL
the	NULL
excuse	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
screens	NULL
was	NULL
rotten	NULL

admitted	NULL
bugs	NULL

So	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
abandoned	NULL
to	NULL
insensitive	NULL
guests	NULL

they	NULL
dressed	NULL

slept	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL

Gloria	NULL
considered	NULL

Anthony	NULL

ordered	NULL
early	NULL

reinstated	NULL

Gloria	NULL
insisted	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
invited	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
house	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL

good	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL

either	NULL
simple	NULL

,	NULL
if	NULL
otherwise	NULL

must	NULL
possess	NULL
a	NULL

strength	NULL

Always	NULL
intensely	NULL
sceptical	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
sex	NULL

her	NULL
judgments	NULL
were	NULL
now	NULL
concerned	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
whether	NULL
women	NULL
were	NULL

were	NULL
not	NULL
clean	NULL

By	NULL
uncleanliness	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
a	NULL
variety	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL

a	NULL
lack	NULL

pride	NULL

a	NULL
slackness	NULL

most	NULL

the	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
like	NULL
many	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
preferably	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
frank	NULL
homage	NULL
and	NULL
unfailing	NULL
entertainment	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
often	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
flash	NULL
of	NULL
insight	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
Anthony	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
was	NULL
merely	NULL
using	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
consequently	NULL
had	NULL
best	NULL
be	NULL
left	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
customarily	NULL
demurred	NULL
,	NULL
insisting	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
accused	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
good	NULL
one	NULL

"	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
judgment	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
fallible	NULL
than	NULL
hers	NULL
,	NULL
memorably	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
on	NULL
several	NULL
occasions	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
succession	NULL
of	NULL
restaurant	NULL
checks	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
render	NULL
a	NULL
solitary	NULL
account	NULL
.	NULL

More	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
solitude	NULL
than	NULL
from	NULL
any	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
fuss	NULL
and	NULL
bother	NULL
of	NULL
entertaining	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
filled	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
with	NULL
guests	NULL
every	NULL
week-end	NULL

and	NULL
often	NULL
on	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
week-end	NULL
parties	NULL
were	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL

four	NULL

arrived	NULL

more	NULL

a	NULL
ride	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Cradle	NULL
Beach	NULL
Country	NULL
Club	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
joined	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
inexpensive	NULL

lively	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
fashionable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
almost	NULL
a	NULL
necessity	NULL
for	NULL
just	NULL
such	NULL
occasions	NULL
as	NULL
these	NULL

Moreover	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
great	NULL
moment	NULL
what	NULL

did	NULL
there	NULL

and	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL

it	NULL

Saturday	NULL
ended	NULL

generally	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
glamourous	NULL
confusion	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
proving	NULL
often	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
assist	NULL
a	NULL
muddled	NULL
guest	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL

Sunday	NULL
brought	NULL
the	NULL

papers	NULL

a	NULL
quiet	NULL
morning	NULL
of	NULL
recuperating	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
porch	NULL

Sunday	NULL
afternoon	NULL
meant	NULL
good-by	NULL

revival	NULL

one	NULL

two	NULL
who	NULL
remained	NULL
until	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL

concluding	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL

evening	NULL

had	NULL
returned	NULL
with	NULL

Among	NULL
their	NULL
more	NULL
frequent	NULL
guests	NULL
a	NULL
tradition	NULL
had	NULL
sprung	NULL
up	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Maury	NULL
Noble	NULL
remarked	NULL
one	NULL
afternoon	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
real	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
Tannenbaum	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
German	NULL
agent	NULL
kept	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
country	NULL
to	NULL
disseminate	NULL
Teutonic	NULL
propaganda	NULL
through	NULL
Westchester	NULL
County	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
mysterious	NULL
letters	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
arrive	NULL
from	NULL
Philadelphia	NULL
addressed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bewildered	NULL
Oriental	NULL
as	NULL
"	NULL
Lt.	NULL
Emile	NULL
Tannenbaum	NULL

"	NULL
containing	NULL
a	NULL

cryptic	NULL
messages	NULL
signed	NULL

General	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
adorned	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
atmospheric	NULL
double	NULL
column	NULL
of	NULL
facetious	NULL
Japanese	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
always	NULL
handed	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
Tana	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
;	NULL
hours	NULL
afterward	NULL
the	NULL
recipient	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
puzzling	NULL
over	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
and	NULL
declaring	NULL
earnestly	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
perpendicular	NULL
symbols	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
Japanese	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
anything	NULL
resembling	NULL
Japanese	NULL
.	NULL

Gloria	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
dislike	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
ever	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
returning	NULL
unexpectedly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
discovered	NULL
him	NULL
reclining	NULL
on	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
puzzling	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
newspaper	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
instinct	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
servants	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
Anthony	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
detest	NULL
Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Tana	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
exception	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rule	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
plain	NULL
his	NULL
aversion	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
moodier	NULL
moments	NULL
by	NULL
subtly	NULL
addressing	NULL
Anthony	NULL
with	NULL
remarks	NULL
intended	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
ear	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
What	NULL
Miz	NULL
Pats	NULL
want	NULL
dinner	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
master	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
else	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
comment	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
bitter	NULL
selfishness	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
'	NULL
Merican	NULL
peoples	NULL
"	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL

who	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
peoples	NULL
"	NULL
referred	NULL
to	NULL

But	NULL
they	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
dismiss	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
abhorrent	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
inertia	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
endured	NULL
Tana	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
endured	NULL
ill	NULL
weather	NULL
and	NULL
sickness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
estimable	NULL
Will	NULL
of	NULL

endured	NULL
all	NULL

IN	NULL
DARKNESS	NULL
One	NULL
sultry	NULL
afternoon	NULL
late	NULL
in	NULL
July	NULL
Richard	NULL
Caramel	NULL
telephoned	NULL
from	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
that	NULL

Maury	NULL
were	NULL
coming	NULL
out	NULL

bringing	NULL
a	NULL

arrived	NULL
about	NULL
five	NULL

a	NULL
little	NULL
drunk	NULL

accompanied	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL

stocky	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
thirty-five	NULL

whom	NULL
they	NULL
introduced	NULL
as	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Joe	NULL
Hull	NULL

one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
fellows	NULL
that	NULL
Anthony	NULL
and	NULL
Gloria	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
met	NULL
.	NULL

Joe	NULL
Hull	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
yellow	NULL
beard	NULL
continually	NULL
fighting	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
skin	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
voice	NULL
which	NULL
varied	NULL
between	NULL
basso	NULL
profundo	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
husky	NULL
whisper	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
carrying	NULL
Maury	NULL
's	NULL
suitcase	NULL
up-stairs	NULL
,	NULL
followed	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
carefully	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

laughter	NULL
redoubled	NULL

culminating	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
succession	NULL
of	NULL
pleasant	NULL
catlike	NULL
grins	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
hesitated	NULL
between	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
frown	NULL

he	NULL
capped	NULL
this	NULL
statement	NULL
with	NULL
another	NULL
series	NULL
of	NULL
chuckles	NULL

Anthony	NULL
was	NULL
impelled	NULL
to	NULL
remark	NULL

Later	NULL

just	NULL
before	NULL

Dick	NULL
were	NULL
conversing	NULL
uproariously	NULL

Joe	NULL

he	NULL
sipped	NULL

Gloria	NULL
shook	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
angrily	NULL

and	NULL
saying	NULL
no	NULL

returned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
porch	NULL

Anthony	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL

trying	NULL
to	NULL
forget	NULL
her	NULL

devote	NULL
herself	NULL

no	NULL

heeded	NULL
her	NULL

down	NULL

Up-stairs	NULL
she	NULL
fumbled	NULL

missed	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL

shut	NULL

it	NULL
again	NULL
eluded	NULL
her	NULL
fumbling	NULL
fingers	NULL

she	NULL
slipped	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
dress	NULL

threw	NULL

shut	NULL

eyes	NULL

broken	NULL

another	NULL

by	NULL
a	NULL
soaring	NULL
fragment	NULL

song	NULL

She	NULL
lay	NULL
there	NULL
for	NULL
something	NULL
over	NULL
two	NULL
hours	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
she	NULL
calculated	NULL
afterward	NULL
,	NULL
sheerly	NULL
by	NULL
piecing	NULL
together	NULL
the	NULL
bits	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL

even	NULL
aware	NULL

after	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
while	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
noise	NULL
down-stairs	NULL
had	NULL
lessened	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
storm	NULL
was	NULL
moving	NULL
off	NULL
westward	NULL

throwing	NULL
back	NULL
lingering	NULL
showers	NULL

fell	NULL

heavy	NULL
and	NULL
lifeless	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL

fields	NULL

the	NULL
rain	NULL

until	NULL
there	NULL

nothing	NULL

swishing	NULL
play	NULL

cluster	NULL

was	NULL
in	NULL

state	NULL
half-way	NULL
between	NULL
sleeping	NULL

waking	NULL

with	NULL
neither	NULL

desire	NULL

rid	NULL

down	NULL

felt	NULL
that	NULL

cry	NULL

be	NULL
lifted	NULL

and	NULL
forcing	NULL
the	NULL
lids	NULL

her	NULL
eyes	NULL
together	NULL

tried	NULL

raise	NULL

throat	NULL

watered	NULL

down	NULL

on	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL

Yet	NULL
her	NULL

beating	NULL
until	NULL
it	NULL
shook	NULL
her	NULL

made	NULL
her	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL

desperately	NULL
shaken	NULL

The	NULL
minute	NULL
or	NULL
succession	NULL
of	NULL
minutes	NULL
prolonged	NULL
itself	NULL
interminably	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
swimming	NULL
blur	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
form	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL

which	NULL
tried	NULL
with	NULL
childish	NULL
persistence	NULL
to	NULL
pierce	NULL
the	NULL
gloom	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL

the	NULL
door	NULL

In	NULL
another	NULL

it	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
unimaginable	NULL
force	NULL
would	NULL
shatter	NULL
her	NULL
out	NULL

then	NULL
the	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
doorway	NULL

Hull	NULL

turned	NULL
deliberately	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
slightly	NULL
swaying	NULL
,	NULL
moved	NULL
back	NULL

off	NULL

as	NULL
if	NULL
absorbed	NULL
into	NULL
that	NULL
incomprehensible	NULL

Blood	NULL
rushed	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
limbs	NULL

blood	NULL
and	NULL
life	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
start	NULL
of	NULL
energy	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
upright	NULL
,	NULL
shifting	NULL
her	NULL
body	NULL
until	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
touched	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL

must	NULL
do	NULL
--	NULL
now	NULL

now	NULL

before	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
this	NULL
cool	NULL

out	NULL

away	NULL

to	NULL
feel	NULL
the	NULL
wet	NULL
swish	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fresh	NULL
moisture	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
forehead	NULL

Mechanically	NULL
she	NULL
struggled	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
groping	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
closet	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
hat	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
house	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
hovered	NULL
that	NULL
pressed	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL

or	NULL

made	NULL
itself	NULL
into	NULL
stray	NULL

swaying	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
gloom	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
panic	NULL
she	NULL
fumbled	NULL
clumsily	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
coat	NULL
,	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
sleeve	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
Anthony	NULL

her	NULL
go	NULL

even	NULL
Anthony	NULL

the	NULL

down	NULL

plaintive	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL

She	NULL
rounded	NULL
the	NULL

started	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL

toward	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL

almost	NULL
exultant	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL

followed	NULL
the	NULL
carpet	NULL

the	NULL

broke	NULL
into	NULL

stumbled	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
segment	NULL

a	NULL

twisted	NULL
off	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL

was	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
now	NULL

Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
finding	NULL
the	NULL
bedroom	NULL
deserted	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
onto	NULL
the	NULL
porch	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
driving	NULL
her	NULL
forward	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
back	NULL
there	NULL
with	NULL
Anthony	NULL

she	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
flight	NULL
under	NULL
this	NULL

oppressive	NULL
heaven	NULL

forcing	NULL
herself	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
ahead	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
tangible	NULL
barrier	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
some	NULL
distance	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
barely	NULL
discernible	NULL
road	NULL
,	NULL
probably	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
,	NULL
passed	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
deserted	NULL
barn	NULL
that	NULL
loomed	NULL
up	NULL

black	NULL

foreboding	NULL

the	NULL
only	NULL
building	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL

gray	NULL

Marietta	NULL

then	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
the	NULL
fork	NULL

where	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
wood	NULL

ran	NULL
between	NULL
two	NULL
high	NULL
walls	NULL
of	NULL
leaves	NULL

branches	NULL
that	NULL
nearly	NULL

She	NULL
noticed	NULL
suddenly	NULL
a	NULL
thin	NULL

longitudinal	NULL
gleam	NULL
of	NULL
silver	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
bright	NULL
sword	NULL
half	NULL
embedded	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
closer	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
cry	NULL
of	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
wagon-rut	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL

and	NULL
glancing	NULL
heavenward	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL

knew	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

out	NULL

She	NULL
shut	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
tightly	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
from	NULL
screaming	NULL

and	NULL
increased	NULL
her	NULL
gait	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
another	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
the	NULL
woods	NULL
disappeared	NULL
,	NULL
rolling	NULL
back	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
stocking	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
leg	NULL

the	NULL

Three	NULL

suspended	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

rose	NULL
high	NULL
over	NULL

with	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL

began	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
,	NULL
keeping	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL

leaping	NULL
the	NULL

Turning	NULL
sharply	NULL

the	NULL

she	NULL
followed	NULL
a	NULL

serving	NULL

looked	NULL
up	NULL

from	NULL

ahead	NULL

the	NULL

across	NULL

at	NULL
having	NULL
eluded	NULL
him	NULL

she	NULL
could	NULL
spare	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL

the	NULL

went	NULL
by	NULL

The	NULL
siren	NULL
soared	NULL
again	NULL

closer	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
anticipatory	NULL
roar	NULL

clamor	NULL

a	NULL
dark	NULL

down	NULL
the	NULL

with	NULL
no	NULL

the	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
clocklike	NULL
tick	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rails	NULL

moved	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
bridge	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
electric	NULL

Above	NULL
the	NULL
engine	NULL
two	NULL
vivid	NULL
blurs	NULL
of	NULL
blue	NULL
light	NULL
formed	NULL
incessantly	NULL
a	NULL
radiant	NULL

bar	NULL
between	NULL

like	NULL
a	NULL
spluttering	NULL
flame	NULL

lit	NULL

Gloria	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
back	NULL

the	NULL

The	NULL
light	NULL
was	NULL
tepid	NULL

the	NULL
temperature	NULL

The	NULL

itself	NULL

then	NULL
,	NULL
elongating	NULL

the	NULL

it	NULL

sucking	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL

until	NULL
it	NULL

suddenly	NULL
a	NULL

The	NULL
voice	NULL
resumed	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
adept	NULL
at	NULL
fooling	NULL

I	NULL
prayed	NULL
immediately	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
crimes	NULL
until	NULL
eventually	NULL
prayer	NULL
and	NULL
crime	NULL
became	NULL
indistinguishable	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL

I	NULL
believed	NULL
that	NULL
because	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
cried	NULL
out	NULL
'	NULL
My	NULL
God	NULL

'	NULL

when	NULL
a	NULL
safe	NULL
fell	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
proved	NULL
that	NULL
belief	NULL
was	NULL
rooted	NULL
deep	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
human	NULL
breast	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
fourteen	NULL
years	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
earnest	NULL
men	NULL
pointed	NULL
to	NULL
ancient	NULL

cried	NULL

me	NULL
:	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
turned	NULL
,	NULL
canny	NULL
for	NULL
my	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
professors	NULL

did	NULL
me	NULL
no	NULL

learned	NULL
a	NULL

I	NULL
grew	NULL
up	NULL

the	NULL
beauty	NULL

fell	NULL
away	NULL

my	NULL

coarsened	NULL

my	NULL

around	NULL

over	NULL

with	NULL

plodded	NULL

but	NULL
Smith	NULL
himself	NULL
replaced	NULL

as	NULL
an	NULL

I	NULL
read	NULL

neatly	NULL

Jones	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
reached	NULL
maturity	NULL

gathering	NULL
the	NULL
experience	NULL

order	NULL

Indeed	NULL

I	NULL
accomplished	NULL

my	NULL

itself	NULL

RETROSPECT	NULL
In	NULL

they	NULL
were	NULL
like	NULL

Gloria	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
twenty-six	NULL
in	NULL
May	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
young	NULL
and	NULL
beautiful	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
gay	NULL
and	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
what	NULL
most	NULL
women	NULL
want	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
it	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
fiercely	NULL
and	NULL
passionately	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
married	NULL
over	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
serene	NULL
understanding	NULL
,	NULL
rising	NULL
to	NULL
ecstasies	NULL
of	NULL
proprietorship	NULL
and	NULL
pride	NULL
.	NULL

Alternating	NULL
with	NULL
these	NULL
periods	NULL
had	NULL
occurred	NULL
sporadic	NULL
hates	NULL
,	NULL
enduring	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
forgetfulnesses	NULL
lasting	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
than	NULL
an	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
serenity	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
content	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
less	NULL
jubilant	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
,	NULL
gray	NULL
--	NULL
very	NULL
rarely	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
spur	NULL
of	NULL
jealousy	NULL
or	NULL
forced	NULL
separation	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
ancient	NULL
ecstasies	NULL
returned	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
apparent	NULL
communion	NULL
of	NULL
soul	NULL
and	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
emotional	NULL
excitement	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
hate	NULL
Anthony	NULL
for	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
full	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
carelessly	NULL
incensed	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

Recrimination	NULL
had	NULL
displaced	NULL
affection	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
indulgence	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
entertainment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
nights	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
reserved	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
year	NULL
waned	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
entered	NULL
two	NULL
new	NULL
elements	NULL
.	NULL

Gloria	NULL
realized	NULL
that	NULL
Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
utter	NULL
indifference	NULL
toward	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
temporary	NULL
indifference	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
half	NULL
lethargic	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
stir	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
whispered	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
intimate	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
days	NULL
when	NULL
her	NULL
caresses	NULL
affected	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
suffocation	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
entirely	NULL
admitted	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
recently	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
perceived	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
adoration	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
jealousy	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
servitude	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
pride	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
fundamentally	NULL
despised	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
contempt	NULL
blended	NULL
indistinguishably	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
other	NULL
emotions	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
love	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
vital	NULL
and	NULL
feminine	NULL
illusion	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
directed	NULL
itself	NULL
toward	NULL
him	NULL
one	NULL
April	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
many	NULL
months	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
part	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
qualifications	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
sole	NULL
preoccupation	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
he	NULL
lost	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
broken	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
wretchedly	NULL
and	NULL
sentimentally	NULL
absorbed	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
memory	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
remainder	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seldom	NULL
took	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
entire	NULL
day	NULL
spent	NULL
alone	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
except	NULL
on	NULL
occasions	NULL
he	NULL
preferred	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
third	NULL
person	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
times	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
left	NULL
absolutely	NULL
alone	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
mad	NULL
--	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
times	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
definitely	NULL
hated	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
his	NULL
cups	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
short	NULL
attractions	NULL
toward	NULL
other	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
hitherto-suppressed	NULL
outcroppings	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL

was	NULL
the	NULL

increasingly	NULL

increasingly	NULL
ominous	NULL

there	NULL

a	NULL
somewhat	NULL

one	NULL
in	NULL

civilization	NULL
steadily	NULL

unmistakable	NULL

up	NULL

reply	NULL

begin	NULL

by	NULL
the	NULL
suggestion	NULL
that	NULL
life	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
significant	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
his	NULL
early	NULL
twenties	NULL
the	NULL
conviction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
futility	NULL
of	NULL
effort	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wisdom	NULL

abnegation	NULL

had	NULL
been	NULL
confirmed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL

had	NULL
admired	NULL

well	NULL
as	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
association	NULL
with	NULL
Maury	NULL
Noble	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
later	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
occasions	NULL
--	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
meeting	NULL
with	NULL
Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
example	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
grandfather	NULL
had	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
abroad	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
war	NULL
correspondent	NULL
--	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
dissatisfaction	NULL
had	NULL
driven	NULL
him	NULL
almost	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
positive	NULL
step	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
left	NULL
Marietta	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
carelessly	NULL
turning	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
pages	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Harvard	NULL
Alumni	NULL
Bulletin	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
column	NULL
which	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
his	NULL
contemporaries	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
six	NULL
years	NULL
since	NULL
graduation	NULL
.	NULL

Most	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
several	NULL
were	NULL
converting	NULL
the	NULL
heathen	NULL
of	NULL
China	NULL
or	NULL
America	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
nebulous	NULL
protestantism	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
working	NULL
constructively	NULL
at	NULL
jobs	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
neither	NULL
sinecures	NULL
nor	NULL
routines	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
Calvin	NULL
Boyd	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
instance	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
barely	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
medical	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
discovered	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
treatment	NULL
for	NULL
typhus	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
shipped	NULL
abroad	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
mitigating	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
civilization	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Great	NULL
Powers	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
Servia	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
Eugene	NULL
Bronson	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
articles	NULL
in	NULL
The	NULL
New	NULL
Democracy	NULL
were	NULL
stamping	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
ideas	NULL
transcending	NULL
both	NULL
vulgar	NULL
timeliness	NULL
and	NULL
popular	NULL
hysteria	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
named	NULL
Daly	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
suspended	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
faculty	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
righteous	NULL
university	NULL
for	NULL
preaching	NULL
Marxian	NULL
doctrines	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
classroom	NULL
:	NULL
in	NULL
art	NULL
,	NULL
science	NULL
,	NULL
politics	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
authentic	NULL
personalities	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
emerging	NULL
--	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
even	NULL
Severance	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
quarter-back	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
rather	NULL
neatly	NULL
and	NULL
gracefully	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Foreign	NULL
Legion	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Aisne	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
laid	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
magazine	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
about	NULL
these	NULL
diverse	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
integrity	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
defended	NULL
his	NULL
attitude	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
Epicurus	NULL
in	NULL
Nirvana	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
cried	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
struggle	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
limit	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
have	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
churchgoer	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
immortality	NULL
gratified	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
considered	NULL
entering	NULL
the	NULL
leather	NULL
business	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
intensity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
competition	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
kept	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
unhappiness	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
such	NULL
delicate	NULL
scruples	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
autumn	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
twenty-ninth	NULL
year	NULL
began	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
close	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
prying	NULL
deeply	NULL
into	NULL
motive	NULL
and	NULL
first	NULL
causes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
mostly	NULL
to	NULL
long	NULL
passionately	NULL
for	NULL
security	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hated	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
often	NULL
dreaded	NULL
being	NULL
alone	NULL
with	NULL
Gloria	NULL
.	NULL

Because	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chasm	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
grandfather	NULL
's	NULL
visit	NULL
had	NULL
opened	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
consequent	NULL
revulsion	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
late	NULL
mode	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
inevitable	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
look	NULL
around	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
suddenly	NULL
hostile	NULL
city	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
friends	NULL
and	NULL
environments	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
seemed	NULL
the	NULL
warmest	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
secure	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
first	NULL
step	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
desperate	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
back	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
apartment	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
of	NULL
1912	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
signed	NULL
a	NULL
four-year	NULL
lease	NULL
at	NULL
seventeen	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
option	NULL
of	NULL
renewal	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
lease	NULL
had	NULL
expired	NULL
the	NULL
previous	NULL
May	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
first	NULL
rented	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
mere	NULL
potentialities	NULL
,	NULL
scarcely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
discerned	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
into	NULL
these	NULL
potentialities	NULL
and	NULL
arranged	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lease	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
landlord	NULL
should	NULL
each	NULL
spend	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
amount	NULL
in	NULL
improvements	NULL
.	NULL

Rents	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
four	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
last	NULL
spring	NULL
when	NULL
Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
waived	NULL
his	NULL
option	NULL
the	NULL
landlord	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Sohenberg	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
realized	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
bigger	NULL
price	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
a	NULL
prepossessing	NULL
apartment	NULL
.	NULL

Accordingly	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Anthony	NULL
approached	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
in	NULL
September	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
Sohenberg	NULL
's	NULL
offer	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
three-year	NULL
lease	NULL
at	NULL
twenty-five	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
outrageous	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
meant	NULL
that	NULL
well	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
third	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
income	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
consumed	NULL
in	NULL
rent	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
vain	NULL
he	NULL
argued	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
ideas	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
repartitioning	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL
attractive	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
vain	NULL
he	NULL
offered	NULL
two	NULL
thousand	NULL
dollars	NULL
--	NULL
twenty-two	NULL
hundred	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
ill	NULL
afford	NULL
it	NULL
:	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Sohenberg	NULL
was	NULL
obdurate	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
two	NULL
other	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
were	NULL
considering	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
just	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
apartment	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
demand	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
scarcely	NULL
be	NULL
business	NULL
to	NULL
_	NULL
give	NULL
_	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Patch	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
mentioned	NULL
it	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
several	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
tenants	NULL
had	NULL
complained	NULL
of	NULL
noise	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
previous	NULL
winter	NULL
--	NULL
singing	NULL
and	NULL
dancing	NULL
late	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

Internally	NULL
raging	NULL
Anthony	NULL
hurried	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Ritz	NULL
to	NULL
report	NULL
his	NULL
discomfiture	NULL
to	NULL
Gloria	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

This	NULL
eventuality	NULL
occurred	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
later	NULL

They	NULL
rented	NULL
a	NULL

apartment	NULL
on	NULL
Fifty-seventh	NULL
Street	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
hundred	NULL
and	NULL
fifty	NULL
a	NULL

included	NULL

a	NULL

small	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
blonde	NULL

sanitary	NULL
way	NULL

not	NULL

in	NULL
his	NULL

THE	NULL
WINTER	NULL
OF	NULL
DISCONTENT	NULL
Before	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
two	NULL
months	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
apartment	NULL
on	NULL
Fifty-seventh	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
assumed	NULL
for	NULL
both	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
indefinable	NULL
but	NULL
almost	NULL
material	NULL
taint	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
impregnated	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
Marietta	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
odor	NULL
of	NULL
tobacco	NULL
always	NULL
--	NULL
both	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
smoked	NULL
incessantly	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
blankets	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
curtains	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
ash-littered	NULL
carpets	NULL
.	NULL

Added	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
wretched	NULL
aura	NULL
of	NULL
stale	NULL
wine	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
inevitable	NULL
suggestion	NULL
of	NULL
beauty	NULL
gone	NULL
foul	NULL
and	NULL
revelry	NULL
remembered	NULL
in	NULL
disgust	NULL

About	NULL
a	NULL
particular	NULL

glass	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
sideboard	NULL
the	NULL
odor	NULL
was	NULL
particularly	NULL
noticeable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
main	NULL
room	NULL
the	NULL
mahogany	NULL
table	NULL
was	NULL
ringed	NULL
with	NULL
white	NULL
circles	NULL
where	NULL
glasses	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
set	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
many	NULL
parties	NULL

people	NULL
broke	NULL
things	NULL

became	NULL
sick	NULL
in	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL

;	NULL
people	NULL
spilled	NULL
wine	NULL
;	NULL
people	NULL
made	NULL
unbelievable	NULL
messes	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kitchenette	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
regular	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
existence	NULL
.	NULL

Despite	NULL
the	NULL
resolutions	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
Mondays	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
tacitly	NULL
understood	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
end	NULL
approached	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
observed	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
unholy	NULL
excitement	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Saturday	NULL
came	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
discuss	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
would	NULL
call	NULL
up	NULL
this	NULL
person	NULL
or	NULL
that	NULL
from	NULL
among	NULL
their	NULL
circle	NULL
of	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
irresponsible	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL

a	NULL
rendezvous	NULL

Only	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
friends	NULL
had	NULL
gathered	NULL

Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
set	NULL
out	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
off	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
--	NULL
realizing	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
wintry	NULL
dawn	NULL

began	NULL

they	NULL
showed	NULL
no	NULL
signs	NULL

said	NULL
Muriel	NULL
triumphantly	NULL

Anthony	NULL

Gloria	NULL
exchanged	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL

but	NULL
this	NULL
visit	NULL
of	NULL
Muriel	NULL

drew	NULL
them	NULL
temporarily	NULL
together	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
discomfort	NULL
under	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
living	NULL
was	NULL
remarked	NULL
upon	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL

it	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
the	NULL
impetus	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
this	NULL
hostile	NULL
world	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
seldom	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
impulse	NULL
toward	NULL

sprang	NULL
from	NULL
within	NULL

Anthony	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
associating	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
existence	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
apartment	NULL

night	NULL
elevator	NULL
man	NULL

a	NULL
pale	NULL

scraggly	NULL
bearded	NULL
person	NULL
of	NULL
about	NULL
sixty	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
somewhat	NULL
above	NULL
his	NULL
station	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
probably	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
quality	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
secured	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
pathetic	NULL
and	NULL
memorable	NULL
figure	NULL
of	NULL
failure	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
recollected	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
humor	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
hoary	NULL
jest	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
elevator	NULL
man	NULL

career	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL

,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL

an	NULL
enclosed	NULL
life	NULL

Each	NULL
time	NULL
Anthony	NULL
stepped	NULL
into	NULL

waited	NULL
breathlessly	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL

"	NULL

I	NULL
guess	NULL
we	NULL
're	NULL
going	NULL

some	NULL
sunshine	NULL

"	NULL

Anthony	NULL
thought	NULL
how	NULL
little	NULL
rain	NULL
or	NULL
sunshine	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
enjoy	NULL
shut	NULL
into	NULL
that	NULL
close	NULL
little	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
smoke-colored	NULL
,	NULL
windowless	NULL
hall	NULL

A	NULL
darkling	NULL
figure	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
attained	NULL
tragedy	NULL
in	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
used	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
shabbily	NULL
.	NULL

Three	NULL
young	NULL
gunmen	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
tied	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
pile	NULL
of	NULL
coal	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cellar	NULL
while	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
trunk	NULL
room	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
janitor	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
collapsed	NULL
from	NULL
chill	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
died	NULL
of	NULL
pneumonia	NULL
four	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
replaced	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
glib	NULL
Martinique	NULL
negro	NULL

with	NULL
an	NULL
incongruous	NULL
British	NULL
accent	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
tendency	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
surly	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
Anthony	NULL
detested	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
passing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

man	NULL
had	NULL
approximately	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
effect	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
kitten	NULL

had	NULL
on	NULL
Gloria	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL

in	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL

Anthony	NULL
gave	NULL
an	NULL
interior	NULL
start	NULL
,	NULL
realizing	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
remark	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
Richard	NULL
Caramel	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

Did	NULL
he	NULL
actually	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
these	NULL
amazing	NULL
latter	NULL
productions	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
good	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
novel	NULL
?	NULL

Anthony	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
apartment	NULL
and	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
business	NULL
of	NULL
optimism	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
mean	NULL
task	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
futile	NULL
starts	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
library	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
investigated	NULL
the	NULL
files	NULL
of	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
better	NULL
equipped	NULL

he	NULL
accomplished	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
story	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
Dictaphone	NULL

"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
founded	NULL
upon	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL

remaining	NULL
impressions	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
six	NULL
weeks	NULL
in	NULL

the	NULL

before	NULL

It	NULL
purported	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
sunny	NULL
tale	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
office	NULL
boy	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
by	NULL
accident	NULL
,	NULL
hummed	NULL
a	NULL
wonderful	NULL

the	NULL

then	NULL

lost	NULL

The	NULL
body	NULL

the	NULL
story	NULL

concerned	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
pursuit	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

offered	NULL
for	NULL
probate	NULL

upon	NULL
the	NULL
contestation	NULL
was	NULL
assigned	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
surrogate	NULL
to	NULL
trial	NULL
term	NULL
for	NULL
trial	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
matter	NULL
was	NULL
prolonged	NULL
into	NULL
September	NULL
--	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
empanelling	NULL
an	NULL
unbiassed	NULL
jury	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
moral	NULL
sentiments	NULL
involved	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
disappointment	NULL
a	NULL
verdict	NULL
was	NULL
finally	NULL
returned	NULL
in	NULL
favor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
testator	NULL
,	NULL
whereupon	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Haight	NULL
caused	NULL
a	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
appeal	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
served	NULL
upon	NULL
Edward	NULL
Shuttleworth	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
waned	NULL
Anthony	NULL
and	NULL
Gloria	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
was	NULL
theirs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
places	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
"	NULL
agree	NULL
on	NULL
things	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
for	NULL
both	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
springing	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
phoenix	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
ashes	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
born	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
mysterious	NULL
and	NULL
unfathomable	NULL
haunts	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
drafted	NULL
early	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fall	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
examining	NULL
doctor	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
mention	NULL
of	NULL
low	NULL
blood-pressure	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
purposeless	NULL
and	NULL
sad	NULL
when	NULL
Anthony	NULL
told	NULL
Gloria	NULL
one	NULL
night	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
,	NULL
above	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
killed	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
always	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
sorry	NULL
for	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
things	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
times	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Southern	NULL
camp	NULL
where	NULL
his	NULL
contingent	NULL
was	NULL
ordered	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
remain	NULL
in	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
to	NULL
"	NULL
use	NULL
the	NULL
apartment	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
watch	NULL
the	NULL
progress	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
pending	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Appellate	NULL
Division	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
calendar	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Haight	NULL
told	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
far	NULL
behind	NULL
.	NULL

Almost	NULL
their	NULL
last	NULL
conversation	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
senseless	NULL
quarrel	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
proper	NULL
division	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
income	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
either	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
typical	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
muddle	NULL
and	NULL
confusion	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
lives	NULL
that	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
October	NULL
night	NULL
when	NULL
Anthony	NULL
reported	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Grand	NULL
Central	NULL
Station	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
journey	NULL
to	NULL
camp	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
arrived	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
his	NULL
eye	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
anxious	NULL
heads	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
gathered	NULL
crowd	NULL
.	NULL

Through	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
enclosed	NULL
train-sheds	NULL
their	NULL
glances	NULL
stretched	NULL
across	NULL
a	NULL
hysterical	NULL
area	NULL
,	NULL
foul	NULL
with	NULL
yellow	NULL
sobbing	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
smells	NULL
of	NULL
poor	NULL
women	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
pondered	NULL
upon	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
each	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
accused	NULL
himself	NULL
of	NULL
drawing	NULL
this	NULL
sombre	NULL
pattern	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
tracing	NULL
tragically	NULL
and	NULL
obscurely	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL

BOOK	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
I	NULL
A	NULL
MATTER	NULL
OF	NULL
CIVILIZATION	NULL
At	NULL
a	NULL
frantic	NULL
command	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
invisible	NULL
source	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
groped	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
inside	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
remain	NULL
longer	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
night	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
Gloria	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
finality	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
drearily	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
clean	NULL
and	NULL
lovely	NULL
girl	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
leaving	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
arrived	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
practical	NULL
financial	NULL
settlement	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
three	NULL
hundred	NULL
and	NULL
seventy-five	NULL
dollars	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
considering	NULL
that	NULL
over	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
in	NULL
rent	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
taking	NULL
fifty	NULL
to	NULL
supplement	NULL
his	NULL
pay	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
need	NULL
for	NULL
more	NULL
:	NULL
food	NULL
,	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
quarters	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
provided	NULL
--	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
social	NULL
obligations	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
private	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
car	NULL
was	NULL
crowded	NULL
and	NULL
already	NULL
thick	NULL
with	NULL
breath	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
type	NULL
known	NULL
as	NULL
"	NULL
tourist	NULL
"	NULL
cars	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
brummagem	NULL
Pullman	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
bare	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
straw	NULL
seats	NULL
that	NULL
needed	NULL
cleaning	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
greeted	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
vaguely	NULL
expected	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
trip	NULL
South	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
freight-car	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
stand	NULL
eight	NULL
horses	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
forty	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
hommes	NULL
40	NULL
,	NULL
chevaux	NULL
8	NULL
"	NULL
story	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
confused	NULL
and	NULL
ominous	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
rocked	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
aisle	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
barrack-bag	NULL
slung	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
shoulder	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
monstrous	NULL
blue	NULL
sausage	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
vacant	NULL
seats	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
his	NULL
eye	NULL
fell	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
space	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
occupied	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
feet	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
swarthy	NULL
Sicilian	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
drawn	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
hunched	NULL
defiantly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
Anthony	NULL
stopped	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL
he	NULL
stared	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
scowl	NULL
,	NULL
evidently	NULL
intended	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
intimidating	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
adopted	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
defense	NULL
against	NULL
this	NULL
entire	NULL
gigantic	NULL
equation	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
sharp	NULL
"	NULL
That	NULL
seat	NULL
taken	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
very	NULL
slowly	NULL
lifted	NULL
the	NULL
feet	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
breakable	NULL
package	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
placed	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
care	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
eyes	NULL
remained	NULL
on	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
meanwhile	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
unbuttoned	NULL
the	NULL
uniform	NULL
coat	NULL
issued	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
Camp	NULL
Upton	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
chafed	NULL
him	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
Anthony	NULL
could	NULL
scrutinize	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
occupants	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
section	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
second	NULL
lieutenant	NULL
blew	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
upper	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
car	NULL
and	NULL
wafted	NULL
airily	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
aisle	NULL
,	NULL
announcing	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
voice	NULL
of	NULL
appalling	NULL
acerbity	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
There	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL

Do	NULL
n't	NULL
smoke	NULL
,	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL

"	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
sailed	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
end	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
little	NULL
clouds	NULL
of	NULL
expostulation	NULL
arose	NULL
on	NULL
all	NULL
sides	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

"	NULL

Two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
cigarettes	NULL
were	NULL
shot	NULL
out	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
windows	NULL
.	NULL

Others	NULL
were	NULL
retained	NULL
inside	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
kept	NULL
sketchily	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
view	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
accents	NULL
of	NULL
bravado	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
mockery	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
submissive	NULL
humor	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
remarks	NULL
were	NULL
dropped	NULL
that	NULL
soon	NULL
melted	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
listless	NULL
and	NULL
pervasive	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fourth	NULL
occupant	NULL
of	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
section	NULL
spoke	NULL
up	NULL
suddenly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
G'by	NULL
,	NULL
liberty	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
sullenly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
G'by	NULL
,	NULL
everything	NULL
except	NULL
bein	NULL
'	NULL
an	NULL
officer	NULL
's	NULL
dog	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Anthony	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
Irishman	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
expression	NULL
moulded	NULL
of	NULL
indifference	NULL
and	NULL
utter	NULL
disdain	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
eyes	NULL
fell	NULL
on	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
expected	NULL
an	NULL
answer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

Receiving	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
defiant	NULL
stare	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Italian	NULL
he	NULL
groaned	NULL
and	NULL
spat	NULL
noisily	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
dignified	NULL
transition	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
taciturnity	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
later	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
opened	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
lieutenant	NULL
was	NULL
borne	NULL
in	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
customary	NULL
official	NULL
zephyr	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
singing	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL

This	NULL
time	NULL
Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
already	NULL
faded	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
mustache	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
shiny	NULL
straw	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
chin	NULL
receded	NULL
,	NULL
faintly	NULL
;	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
offset	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
magnificent	NULL
and	NULL
unconvincing	NULL
scowl	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
scowl	NULL
that	NULL
Anthony	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
connect	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
faces	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
young	NULL
officers	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
ensuing	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

Immediately	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
smoked	NULL
--	NULL
whether	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
previously	NULL
desired	NULL
to	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
cigarette	NULL
contributed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hazy	NULL
oxidation	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
roll	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
forth	NULL
in	NULL
opalescent	NULL
clouds	NULL
with	NULL
every	NULL
motion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
conversation	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
lapsed	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
impressive	NULL
visits	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
officer	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
revived	NULL
tepidly	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
aisle	NULL
began	NULL
making	NULL
clumsy	NULL
experiments	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
straw	NULL
seats	NULL
'	NULL
capacity	NULL
for	NULL
comparative	NULL
comfort	NULL
;	NULL
two	NULL
card	NULL
games	NULL
,	NULL
half-heartedly	NULL
begun	NULL
,	NULL
soon	NULL
drew	NULL
several	NULL
spectators	NULL
to	NULL
sitting	NULL
positions	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
arms	NULL
of	NULL
seats	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
Anthony	NULL
became	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
persistently	NULL
obnoxious	NULL
sound	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
,	NULL
defiant	NULL
Sicilian	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
audibly	NULL
asleep	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
wearisome	NULL
to	NULL
contemplate	NULL
that	NULL
animate	NULL
protoplasm	NULL
,	NULL
reasonable	NULL
by	NULL
courtesy	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
shut	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
car	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
incomprehensible	NULL
civilization	NULL
,	NULL
taken	NULL
somewhere	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
a	NULL
vague	NULL
something	NULL
without	NULL
aim	NULL
or	NULL
significance	NULL
or	NULL
consequence	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
sighed	NULL
,	NULL
opened	NULL
a	NULL
newspaper	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
recollection	NULL
of	NULL
buying	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
dim	NULL
yellow	NULL
light	NULL
.	NULL

Ten	NULL
o'clock	NULL
bumped	NULL
stuffily	NULL
into	NULL
eleven	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
hours	NULL
clogged	NULL
and	NULL
caught	NULL
and	NULL
slowed	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

Amazingly	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
halted	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
countryside	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
time	NULL
indulging	NULL
in	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
deceitful	NULL
movements	NULL
backward	NULL
or	NULL
forward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whistling	NULL
harsh	NULL
paeans	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
October	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
read	NULL
his	NULL
newspaper	NULL
through	NULL
,	NULL
editorials	NULL
,	NULL
cartoons	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
war-poems	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
eye	NULL
fell	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
half-column	NULL
headed	NULL
_	NULL
Shakespeareville	NULL
,	NULL
Kansas	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Shakespeareville	NULL
Chamber	NULL
of	NULL
Commerce	NULL
had	NULL
recently	NULL
held	NULL
an	NULL
enthusiastic	NULL
debate	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
whether	NULL
the	NULL
American	NULL
soldiers	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
known	NULL
as	NULL
"	NULL
Sammies	NULL
"	NULL
or	NULL
"	NULL
Battling	NULL
Christians	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
thought	NULL
gagged	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
dropped	NULL
the	NULL
newspaper	NULL
,	NULL
yawned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
drift	NULL
off	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
tangent	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
why	NULL
Gloria	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
late	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
already	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
pang	NULL
of	NULL
illusive	NULL
loneliness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
from	NULL
what	NULL
angle	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
regard	NULL
her	NULL
new	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
considerations	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
continue	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL

The	NULL

acted	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
further	NULL

The	NULL
members	NULL

For	NULL
two	NULL
nights	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
they	NULL
rattled	NULL
southward	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
mysterious	NULL
inexplicable	NULL
stops	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
were	NULL
apparently	NULL
arid	NULL
wastes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
rushing	NULL
through	NULL
large	NULL
cities	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pompous	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
hurry	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
whimsicalities	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
train	NULL
foreshadowed	NULL
for	NULL
Anthony	NULL
the	NULL
whimsicalities	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
army	NULL

.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
arid	NULL
wastes	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
served	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
baggage-car	NULL
with	NULL
beans	NULL
and	NULL
bacon	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL

he	NULL
dined	NULL
scantily	NULL
on	NULL
some	NULL
milk	NULL

distributed	NULL
by	NULL

village	NULL

But	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
day	NULL
the	NULL
baggage-car	NULL
's	NULL
output	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
appear	NULL
surprisingly	NULL
palatable	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
morning	NULL
the	NULL
rumor	NULL
was	NULL
passed	NULL
along	NULL
that	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
arrive	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
destination	NULL
,	NULL
Camp	NULL
Hooker	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
intolerably	NULL
hot	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
car	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
shirt	NULL
sleeves	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
tired	NULL
and	NULL
ancient	NULL
sun	NULL
,	NULL
yellow	NULL
as	NULL
parchment	NULL
and	NULL
stretched	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
shape	NULL
in	NULL
transit	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
in	NULL
triumphant	NULL
squares	NULL
and	NULL
produced	NULL
only	NULL
warped	NULL
splotches	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
appallingly	NULL
steady	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
disturbed	NULL
Anthony	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
pivot	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
inconsequential	NULL
sawmills	NULL
and	NULL
trees	NULL
and	NULL
telegraph	NULL
poles	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
turning	NULL
around	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
fast	NULL
.	NULL

Outside	NULL
it	NULL
played	NULL
its	NULL
heavy	NULL
tremolo	NULL
over	NULL
olive	NULL
roads	NULL
and	NULL
fallow	NULL
cotton-fields	NULL
,	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
ran	NULL
a	NULL
ragged	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
woods	NULL
broken	NULL
with	NULL
eminences	NULL
of	NULL
gray	NULL
rock	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
foreground	NULL
was	NULL
dotted	NULL
sparsely	NULL
with	NULL
wretched	NULL
,	NULL
ill-patched	NULL
shanties	NULL
,	NULL
among	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
flash	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
specimen	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
languid	NULL
yokelry	NULL
of	NULL
South	NULL
Carolina	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
else	NULL
a	NULL
strolling	NULL
darky	NULL
with	NULL
sullen	NULL
and	NULL
bewildered	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
woods	NULL
moved	NULL
off	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
rolled	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
broad	NULL
space	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
baked	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
gigantic	NULL
cake	NULL
,	NULL
sugared	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
infinity	NULL
of	NULL
tents	NULL
arranged	NULL
in	NULL
geometric	NULL
figures	NULL
over	NULL
its	NULL
surface	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
train	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
uncertain	NULL
stop	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
poles	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
faded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
universe	NULL
rocked	NULL
itself	NULL
slowly	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
old	NULL
usualness	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
Anthony	NULL
Patch	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
weary	NULL
and	NULL
perspiring	NULL
,	NULL
crowded	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
car	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
smelt	NULL
that	NULL
unforgetable	NULL
aroma	NULL
that	NULL
impregnates	NULL
all	NULL

the	NULL
odor	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

connected	NULL

stood	NULL
green	NULL

an	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL

usually	NULL
managed	NULL

his	NULL

Up	NULL

drove	NULL

to	NULL

heavily	NULL
upon	NULL

the	NULL

in	NULL

game	NULL
of	NULL
showing	NULL
off	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
taking	NULL
place	NULL
triumphantly	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
entire	NULL
area	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
week	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
arrival	NULL
of	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
draft	NULL
was	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
series	NULL
of	NULL
interminable	NULL
inoculations	NULL
and	NULL
physical	NULL
examinations	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
preliminary	NULL
drilling	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
days	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
desperately	NULL
tired	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
issued	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
size	NULL
shoes	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
popular	NULL
,	NULL
easy-going	NULL
supply-sergeant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
consequence	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
swollen	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
hours	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
were	NULL
an	NULL
acute	NULL
torture	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
throw	NULL
himself	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
cot	NULL
between	NULL
dinner	NULL
and	NULL
afternoon	NULL
drill-call	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seeming	NULL
to	NULL
sink	NULL
with	NULL
each	NULL
moment	NULL
deeper	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
bottomless	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
drop	NULL
off	NULL
immediately	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
noise	NULL
and	NULL
laughter	NULL
around	NULL
him	NULL
faded	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
drone	NULL
of	NULL
drowsy	NULL
summer	NULL
sound	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
awoke	NULL
stiff	NULL
and	NULL
aching	NULL
,	NULL
hollow	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
ghost	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hurried	NULL
forth	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
ghostly	NULL
figures	NULL
who	NULL
swarmed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wan	NULL
company	NULL
streets	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
a	NULL
harsh	NULL
bugle	NULL
shrieked	NULL
and	NULL
spluttered	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
heavens	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
skeleton	NULL
infantry	NULL
company	NULL
of	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
the	NULL
invariable	NULL
breakfast	NULL
of	NULL
fatty	NULL
bacon	NULL
,	NULL
cold	NULL
toast	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cereal	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
entire	NULL
hundred	NULL
would	NULL
rush	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
latrines	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
well-policed	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
always	NULL
intolerable	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
lavatories	NULL
in	NULL
cheap	NULL
hotels	NULL
.	NULL

Out	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
ragged	NULL
order	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
lame	NULL
man	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
left	NULL
grotesquely	NULL
marring	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
listless	NULL
efforts	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
in	NULL
step	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
platoon	NULL
sergeants	NULL
either	NULL
showing	NULL
off	NULL
violently	NULL
to	NULL
impress	NULL
the	NULL
officers	NULL
and	NULL
recruits	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
else	NULL
quietly	NULL
lurking	NULL
in	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
march	NULL
,	NULL
avoiding	NULL
both	NULL
labor	NULL
and	NULL
unnecessary	NULL
visibility	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
,	NULL
work	NULL
began	NULL
immediately	NULL
--	NULL
they	NULL
peeled	NULL
off	NULL
their	NULL
shirts	NULL
for	NULL
calisthenics	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
that	NULL
Anthony	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
.	NULL

Lieutenant	NULL
Kretching	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
presided	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
antics	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
sinewy	NULL
and	NULL
muscular	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
followed	NULL
his	NULL
movements	NULL
faithfully	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
positive	NULL
value	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
other	NULL
officers	NULL
and	NULL
sergeants	NULL
walked	NULL
about	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
malice	NULL
of	NULL
schoolboys	NULL
,	NULL
grouping	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
around	NULL
some	NULL
unfortunate	NULL
who	NULL
lacked	NULL
muscular	NULL
control	NULL
,	NULL
giving	NULL
him	NULL
confused	NULL
instructions	NULL
and	NULL
commands	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
discovered	NULL
a	NULL
particularly	NULL
forlorn	NULL
,	NULL
ill-nourished	NULL
specimen	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
linger	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL
half-hour	NULL
making	NULL
cutting	NULL
remarks	NULL
and	NULL
snickering	NULL
among	NULL
themselves	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
little	NULL
officer	NULL
named	NULL
Hopkins	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
sergeant	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
regular	NULL
army	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
particularly	NULL
annoying	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
gift	NULL
of	NULL
revenge	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
gods	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
constant	NULL
burden	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
harangues	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
these	NULL
rookies	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
appreciate	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL
gravity	NULL
and	NULL
responsibility	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
service	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
considered	NULL
that	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
combination	NULL
of	NULL
foresight	NULL
and	NULL
dauntless	NULL
efficiency	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
raised	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
current	NULL
magnificence	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
aped	NULL
the	NULL
particular	NULL
tyrannies	NULL
of	NULL
every	NULL
officer	NULL
under	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
served	NULL
in	NULL
times	NULL
gone	NULL
by	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
frown	NULL
was	NULL
frozen	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
brow	NULL
--	NULL
before	NULL
giving	NULL
a	NULL
private	NULL
a	NULL
pass	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
ponderously	NULL
weigh	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
absence	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
army	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
welfare	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
military	NULL
profession	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

Lieutenant	NULL
Kretching	NULL
,	NULL
blond	NULL
,	NULL
dull	NULL
and	NULL
phlegmatic	NULL
,	NULL
introduced	NULL
Anthony	NULL
ponderously	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
problems	NULL
of	NULL
attention	NULL
,	NULL
right	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
ease	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
principal	NULL
defect	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
forgetfulness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
often	NULL
kept	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL
straining	NULL
and	NULL
aching	NULL
at	NULL
attention	NULL
for	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
and	NULL
explained	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
movement	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
result	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
--	NULL
those	NULL
on	NULL
both	NULL
flanks	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL
emphatically	NULL
impressed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
necessity	NULL
of	NULL
staring	NULL
straight	NULL
ahead	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
drill	NULL
continued	NULL
until	NULL
noon	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
consisted	NULL
of	NULL
stressing	NULL
a	NULL
succession	NULL
of	NULL
infinitely	NULL
remote	NULL
details	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
Anthony	NULL
perceived	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
consistent	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
logic	NULL
of	NULL
war	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
none	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
irritated	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
faulty	NULL
blood-pressure	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
indecent	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
officer	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
interfere	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
duties	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
private	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
preposterous	NULL
incongruity	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
sustained	NULL
invective	NULL
concerned	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
dull	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
absurd	NULL
subject	NULL
known	NULL
as	NULL
military	NULL
"	NULL
courtesy	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
suspected	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
dim	NULL
purpose	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
regular	NULL
army	NULL
officers	NULL

men	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
mentality	NULL
and	NULL
aspirations	NULL
of	NULL
schoolboys	NULL
--	NULL
have	NULL
their	NULL
fling	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
real	NULL
slaughter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
grotesquely	NULL
sacrificed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
twenty-year	NULL
patience	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Hopkins	NULL
!	NULL

Of	NULL
his	NULL
three	NULL
tent-mates	NULL

sat	NULL
beside	NULL
on	NULL

evenings	NULL
in	NULL

while	NULL
the	NULL

sat	NULL
in	NULL

whistling	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
shrill	NULL
and	NULL
monotonous	NULL
bird-calls	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
of	NULL

company	NULL

with	NULL

went	NULL

caught	NULL

overran	NULL
the	NULL

felt	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
years	NULL
the	NULL
slow	NULL

erotic	NULL
breath	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
South	NULL
,	NULL
imminent	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pervasive	NULL
lull	NULL

of	NULL
thought	NULL
and	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
block	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
arrested	NULL
suddenly	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
harsh	NULL
command	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
elbow	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Have	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
been	NULL
taught	NULL
to	NULL
salute	NULL
officers	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
dumbly	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
addressed	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
stout	NULL
,	NULL
black-haired	NULL
captain	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
fixed	NULL
him	NULL
menacingly	NULL
with	NULL
brown	NULL
pop-eyes	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

_	NULL
Come	NULL
to	NULL
attention	NULL
!	NULL

_	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
words	NULL
were	NULL
literally	NULL
thundered	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
pedestrians	NULL
near	NULL
by	NULL
stopped	NULL
and	NULL
stared	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
soft-eyed	NULL
girl	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
lilac	NULL
dress	NULL
tittered	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
companion	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
attention	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
's	NULL
your	NULL
regiment	NULL
and	NULL
company	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Anthony	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
After	NULL
this	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
pass	NULL
an	NULL
officer	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
you	NULL
straighten	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
salute	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
right	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Say	NULL
'	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL
!	NULL
'	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
stout	NULL
officer	NULL
grunted	NULL
,	NULL
turned	NULL
sharply	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
marched	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
Anthony	NULL
moved	NULL
on	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
indolent	NULL
and	NULL
exotic	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
magic	NULL
was	NULL
suddenly	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dusk	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
turned	NULL
precipitately	NULL
inward	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
indignity	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hated	NULL
that	NULL
officer	NULL
,	NULL
every	NULL
officer	NULL
--	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
unendurable	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
block	NULL
he	NULL
realized	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lilac	NULL
dress	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
giggled	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
discomfiture	NULL
was	NULL
walking	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
friend	NULL
about	NULL
ten	NULL
paces	NULL
ahead	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Several	NULL
times	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
and	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
cheerful	NULL
laughter	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
eyes	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
color	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
gown	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
companion	NULL
visibly	NULL
slackened	NULL
their	NULL
pace	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
make	NULL
his	NULL
choice	NULL
between	NULL
joining	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
passing	NULL
obliviously	NULL
by	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
hesitated	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
slowed	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
were	NULL
abreast	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
dissolved	NULL
in	NULL
laughter	NULL
now	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
such	NULL
strident	NULL
mirth	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
expected	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
North	NULL
from	NULL
actresses	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
familiar	NULL
comedy	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
soft	NULL
,	NULL
low	NULL
rippling	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
overflow	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
subtle	NULL
joke	NULL
,	NULL
into	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
inadvertently	NULL
blundered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
soft	NULL
as	NULL
shadows	NULL
.	NULL

Were	NULL
they	NULL
violet	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
their	NULL
blue	NULL
darkness	NULL
mingling	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
hues	NULL
of	NULL
dusk	NULL
?	NULL

"	NULL
Pleasant	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
ventured	NULL
Anthony	NULL
uncertainly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Sure	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Has	NULL
n't	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
pleasant	NULL
evening	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
sighed	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
in	NULL
lilac	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
voice	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
drowsy	NULL
breeze	NULL
stirring	NULL
the	NULL
wide	NULL
brim	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
hat	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Anthony	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
scornful	NULL
laugh	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Reckon	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
agreed	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
turned	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
and	NULL
moved	NULL
lackadaisically	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
side	NULL
street	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
following	NULL
a	NULL
drifting	NULL
cable	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
attached	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
town	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
entirely	NULL
natural	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
corners	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
natural	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
bound	NULL
nowhere	NULL
in	NULL
particular	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
thinking	NULL
nothing	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
side	NULL
street	NULL
was	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
offshoot	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
district	NULL
of	NULL
wild	NULL
rose	NULL
hedges	NULL
and	NULL
little	NULL
quiet	NULL
houses	NULL
set	NULL
far	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Where	NULL
're	NULL
you	NULL
going	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
inquired	NULL
politely	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Just	NULL
goin	NULL
'	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
answer	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
apology	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
explanation	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Can	NULL
I	NULL
stroll	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Reckon	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
advantage	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
accent	NULL
was	NULL
different	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
determined	NULL
the	NULL
social	NULL
status	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Southerner	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
talk	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
lower	NULL
class	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
raucous	NULL
,	NULL
unendurable	NULL
--	NULL
except	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
rosy	NULL
spectacles	NULL
of	NULL
intoxication	NULL
.	NULL

Dark	NULL
was	NULL
creeping	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

Talking	NULL
little	NULL
--	NULL
Anthony	NULL
in	NULL
careless	NULL
,	NULL
casual	NULL
questions	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
two	NULL
with	NULL
provincial	NULL
economy	NULL
of	NULL
phrase	NULL
and	NULL
burden	NULL
--	NULL
they	NULL
sauntered	NULL
past	NULL
another	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
block	NULL
they	NULL
stopped	NULL
beneath	NULL
a	NULL
lamp-post	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
live	NULL
near	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
explained	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
live	NULL
around	NULL
the	NULL
block	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
in	NULL
lilac	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Can	NULL
I	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
home	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
To	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
other	NULL
girl	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
steps	NULL
backward	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
removed	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
salute	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
in	NULL
lilac	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
laugh	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL

soldiers	NULL
salute	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
responded	NULL
soberly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
other	NULL
girl	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Well	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
hesitated	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
added	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
call	NULL
me	NULL
up	NULL
to-morrow	NULL

,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
retreated	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
yellow	NULL
circle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
street-lamp	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
in	NULL
lilac	NULL
walked	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
blocks	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
rickety	NULL
house	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

Outside	NULL
the	NULL
wooden	NULL
gate	NULL
she	NULL
hesitated	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
--	NULL
thanks	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Must	NULL
you	NULL
go	NULL
in	NULL

"	NULL
Ca	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL

around	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL

She	NULL
regarded	NULL
him	NULL
dispassionately	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
even	NULL
know	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

Anthony	NULL
laughed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

not	NULL
too	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
reckon	NULL
I	NULL
better	NULL
go	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
we	NULL

down	NULL

see	NULL
a	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL

I	NULL
'd	NULL

I	NULL
've	NULL

"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
dark	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
scarcely	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dress	NULL
swayed	NULL
infinitesimally	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
limpid	NULL
,	NULL
reckless	NULL
eyes	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL

She	NULL
shook	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
ought	NULL
n't	NULL
to	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
liked	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
realizing	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
temporizing	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
closer	NULL

took	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

I	NULL

--	NULL
"	NULL
Hand	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
back	NULL
toward	NULL
down-town	NULL
,	NULL
along	NULL
a	NULL
hazy	NULL
,	NULL
dusky	NULL
street	NULL
where	NULL
a	NULL
negro	NULL
newsboy	NULL
was	NULL
calling	NULL
an	NULL
extra	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cadence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
local	NULL
venders	NULL
'	NULL
tradition	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
cadence	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
musical	NULL
as	NULL
song	NULL
.	NULL

Dot	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
affair	NULL
with	NULL
Dorothy	NULL
Raycroft	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
inevitable	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
increasing	NULL
carelessness	NULL
about	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
desiring	NULL
to	NULL
possess	NULL
the	NULL
desirable	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
fall	NULL
before	NULL
a	NULL
personality	NULL
more	NULL
vital	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
compelling	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
with	NULL
Gloria	NULL
four	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
merely	NULL
slid	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
inability	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
definite	NULL
judgments	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
say	NULL
"	NULL
No	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

neither	NULL
to	NULL
man	NULL
nor	NULL
woman	NULL
;	NULL
borrower	NULL
and	NULL
temptress	NULL
alike	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
tender-minded	NULL
and	NULL
pliable	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
he	NULL
seldom	NULL
made	NULL
decisions	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
but	NULL
half-hysterical	NULL
resolves	NULL
formed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
panic	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
aghast	NULL
and	NULL
irreparable	NULL
awakening	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
particular	NULL
weakness	NULL
he	NULL
indulged	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
occasion	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
excitement	NULL
and	NULL
stimulus	NULL
from	NULL
without	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
four	NULL
years	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
express	NULL
and	NULL
interpret	NULL
himself	NULL
anew	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
promised	NULL
rest	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
hours	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
company	NULL
each	NULL
evening	NULL
alleviated	NULL
the	NULL
morbid	NULL
and	NULL
inevitably	NULL
futile	NULL
poundings	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
coward	NULL
in	NULL
earnest	NULL
--	NULL
completely	NULL
the	NULL
slave	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
disordered	NULL
and	NULL
prowling	NULL
thoughts	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
released	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
collapse	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
authentic	NULL
devotion	NULL
to	NULL
Gloria	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
chief	NULL
jailer	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
insufficiency	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
that	NULL
first	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
stood	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
Dorothy	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
engagement	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
Saturday	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
camp	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
burning	NULL
lawlessly	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
tent	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wrote	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
glowing	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sentimental	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
remembered	NULL
breath	NULL
of	NULL
flowers	NULL
,	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
true	NULL
and	NULL
exceeding	NULL
tenderness	NULL
--	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
again	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
kiss	NULL
given	NULL
and	NULL
taken	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
rich	NULL
warm	NULL
moonlight	NULL
just	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Saturday	NULL
night	NULL
came	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
Dot	NULL
waiting	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
entrance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Bijou	NULL
Moving	NULL
Picture	NULL
Theatre	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
dressed	NULL
as	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
preceding	NULL
Wednesday	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
lilac	NULL
gown	NULL
of	NULL
frailest	NULL
organdy	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
evidently	NULL
been	NULL
washed	NULL
and	NULL
starched	NULL
since	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
fresh	NULL
and	NULL
unrumpled	NULL
.	NULL

Daylight	NULL
confirmed	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
received	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sketchy	NULL
,	NULL
faulty	NULL
way	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
lovely	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
clean	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
features	NULL
were	NULL
small	NULL
,	NULL
irregular	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
eloquent	NULL
and	NULL
appropriate	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
unenduring	NULL
little	NULL
flower	NULL
--	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
detected	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
some	NULL
quality	NULL
of	NULL
spiritual	NULL
reticence	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
strength	NULL
drawn	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
passive	NULL
acceptance	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
mistaken	NULL

Dorothy	NULL

nineteen	NULL

father	NULL
had	NULL
kept	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
,	NULL
unprosperous	NULL
corner	NULL
store	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
graduated	NULL
from	NULL
high	NULL
school	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lowest	NULL
fourth	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
class	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
died	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
high	NULL
school	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
unsavory	NULL
reputation	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
her	NULL
behavior	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
class	NULL
picnic	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
rumors	NULL
started	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
merely	NULL
indiscreet	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
retained	NULL
her	NULL
technical	NULL
purity	NULL
until	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
later	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
clerk	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
store	NULL
on	NULL
Jackson	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
incident	NULL
he	NULL
departed	NULL
unexpectedly	NULL
to	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
intending	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
tarried	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
consummation	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
amorous	NULL
enterprise	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
confided	NULL
the	NULL
adventure	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
friend	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
watched	NULL
her	NULL
friend	NULL
disappear	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
sleepy	NULL
street	NULL
of	NULL
dusty	NULL
sunshine	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
flash	NULL
of	NULL
intuition	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
story	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
after	NULL
telling	NULL
it	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
bitter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
as	NULL
near	NULL
an	NULL
approach	NULL
to	NULL
character	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
by	NULL
walking	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
direction	NULL
and	NULL
meeting	NULL
another	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
honest	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
gratifying	NULL
herself	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
a	NULL
rule	NULL
things	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
Dot	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
weak	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
weak	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
strong	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
were	NULL
brave	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
neither	NULL
defied	NULL
nor	NULL
conformed	NULL
nor	NULL
compromised	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
humor	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
its	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
happy	NULL
disposition	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
laugh	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
proper	NULL
times	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
definite	NULL
intentions	NULL
--	NULL
sometimes	NULL
she	NULL
regretted	NULL
vaguely	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
reputation	NULL
precluded	NULL
what	NULL
chance	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
security	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
no	NULL
open	NULL
discovery	NULL
:	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
was	NULL
interested	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
starting	NULL
her	NULL
off	NULL
on	NULL
time	NULL
each	NULL
morning	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
jewelry	NULL
store	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
earned	NULL
fourteen	NULL
dollars	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
in	NULL
high	NULL
school	NULL
now	NULL
looked	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
way	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
walking	NULL
with	NULL
"	NULL
nice	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
these	NULL
incidents	NULL
hurt	NULL
her	NULL
feelings	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
occurred	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
cried	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
the	NULL
Jackson	NULL
Street	NULL
clerk	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
two	NULL
other	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
naval	NULL
officer	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
town	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
stayed	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
night	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
connection	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
leaning	NULL
idly	NULL
against	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pillars	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Stonewall	NULL
Hotel	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
passed	NULL
by	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
town	NULL
four	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
lavished	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
first	NULL
hysteria	NULL
of	NULL
passion	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
pusillanimous	NULL
clerk	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
naval	NULL
officer	NULL
's	NULL
uniform	NULL
--	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
few	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
days	NULL
--	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
magic	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
left	NULL
with	NULL
vague	NULL
promises	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
once	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
,	NULL
rejoiced	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
his	NULL
real	NULL
name	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
resultant	NULL
depression	NULL
had	NULL
thrown	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
arms	NULL
of	NULL
Cyrus	NULL
Fielding	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
son	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
local	NULL
clothier	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
hailed	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
roadster	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
passed	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
sidewalk	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
known	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
name	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
she	NULL
been	NULL
born	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
higher	NULL
stratum	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
her	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
descended	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
lower	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
her	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
training-camp	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
intimacy	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
relieved	NULL
in	NULL
perceiving	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
cared	NULL
deeply	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
ever	NULL
make	NULL
trouble	NULL
.	NULL

Dot	NULL
romanticized	NULL
this	NULL
affair	NULL
and	NULL
conceded	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
vanity	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
these	NULL
men	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
married	NULL
the	NULL
naval	NULL
officer	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
worried	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
within	NULL
eight	NULL
months	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
three	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
fear	NULL
than	NULL
wonder	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
soon	NULL
be	NULL
like	NULL
those	NULL
"	NULL
bad	NULL
girls	NULL
"	NULL
on	NULL
Jackson	NULL
Street	NULL
at	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
gum-chewing	NULL
,	NULL
giggling	NULL
friends	NULL
had	NULL
stared	NULL
with	NULL
fascinated	NULL
glances	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
attempted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
careful	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
let	NULL
men	NULL
"	NULL
pick	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
"	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
let	NULL
them	NULL
kiss	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
allowed	NULL
certain	NULL
other	NULL
liberties	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
forced	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
add	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
trio	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
several	NULL
months	NULL
the	NULL
strength	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
resolution	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
the	NULL
poignant	NULL
expediency	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
fears	NULL
--	NULL
was	NULL
worn	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
grew	NULL
restless	NULL
drowsing	NULL
there	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
time	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
months	NULL
faded	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
soldiers	NULL
she	NULL
met	NULL
were	NULL
either	NULL
obviously	NULL
below	NULL
her	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
less	NULL
obviously	NULL
,	NULL
above	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
case	NULL
they	NULL
desired	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
Yankees	NULL
,	NULL
harsh	NULL
and	NULL
ungracious	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
swarmed	NULL
in	NULL
large	NULL
crowds	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
met	NULL
Anthony	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
that	NULL
first	NULL
evening	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
pleasantly	NULL
unhappy	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
means	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
kept	NULL
her	NULL
engagement	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
Saturday	NULL
she	NULL
regarded	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
consideration	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Unknowingly	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
tragedies	NULL
mirrored	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

Again	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
movies	NULL
,	NULL
again	NULL
they	NULL
wandered	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
shadowy	NULL
,	NULL
scented	NULL
streets	NULL
,	NULL
hand	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
speaking	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
in	NULL
hushed	NULL
voices	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
--	NULL
up	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
porch	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
stay	NULL

Sh	NULL

she	NULL
whispered	NULL

"	NULL

Mother	NULL

"	NULL

In	NULL
confirmation	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
faint	NULL
crackling	NULL
inside	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
page	NULL
was	NULL
turned	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
open-shutter	NULL
slits	NULL
emitted	NULL
horizontal	NULL

of	NULL
light	NULL
that	NULL
fell	NULL
in	NULL
thin	NULL
parallels	NULL
across	NULL
Dorothy	NULL
's	NULL

.	NULL

The	NULL
street	NULL
was	NULL

a	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
waiting	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
near-by	NULL
roof	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
arrival	NULL

the	NULL
moon	NULL
came	NULL
slanting	NULL
suddenly	NULL
through	NULL

turned	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
color	NULL
of	NULL
white	NULL

.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
start	NULL
of	NULL
memory	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
vivid	NULL
that	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
closed	NULL
eyes	NULL
there	NULL
formed	NULL
a	NULL
picture	NULL

distinct	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL

But	NULL
those	NULL

were	NULL

a	NULL

a	NULL

THE	NULL
MAN-AT-ARMS	NULL
As	NULL
the	NULL

dried	NULL
up	NULL

blew	NULL
away	NULL

the	NULL
range	NULL
of	NULL
Anthony	NULL

travels	NULL
extended	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
to	NULL
comprehend	NULL
the	NULL
camp	NULL

its	NULL
environment	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL

given	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

During	NULL
his	NULL

he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

a	NULL
white	NULL
mask	NULL
of	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
nursed	NULL
the	NULL
astounding	NULL
delusion	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
astutely	NULL
"	NULL
slipping	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
"	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
government	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
eighteen	NULL
years	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
service	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
wage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
soon	NULL
to	NULL
retire	NULL
(	NULL
here	NULL
he	NULL
usually	NULL
winked	NULL
)	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
impressive	NULL
income	NULL
of	NULL
fifty-five	NULL
dollars	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
gorgeous	NULL
joke	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
played	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
dozens	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
bullied	NULL
and	NULL
scorned	NULL
him	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Georgia	NULL
country	NULL
boy	NULL
of	NULL
nineteen	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
present	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
but	NULL
two	NULL
lieutenants	NULL
--	NULL
Hopkins	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
popular	NULL
Kretching	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
latter	NULL
was	NULL
considered	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
fellow	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
leader	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
disappeared	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
mess	NULL
fund	NULL
of	NULL
eleven	NULL
hundred	NULL
dollars	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
leaders	NULL
,	NULL
proved	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
.	NULL

Eventually	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
Captain	NULL
Dunning	NULL
,	NULL
god	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
brief	NULL
but	NULL
self-sufficing	NULL
microcosm	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
reserve	NULL
officer	NULL
,	NULL
nervous	NULL
,	NULL
energetic	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
enthusiastic	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
latter	NULL
quality	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
often	NULL
took	NULL
material	NULL
form	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
visible	NULL
as	NULL
fine	NULL
froth	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corners	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
.	NULL

Like	NULL
most	NULL
executives	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
his	NULL
charges	NULL
strictly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
hopeful	NULL
eyes	NULL
his	NULL
command	NULL
seemed	NULL
just	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
unit	NULL
as	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
war	NULL
deserved	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
anxiety	NULL
and	NULL
absorption	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
having	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Baptiste	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
Sicilian	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
,	NULL
fell	NULL
foul	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
week	NULL
of	NULL
drill	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
captain	NULL
had	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL
ordered	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
clean-shaven	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
fell	NULL
in	NULL
each	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
disclosed	NULL
an	NULL
alarming	NULL
breech	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
rule	NULL
,	NULL
surely	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
Teutonic	NULL
connivance	NULL
--	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
four	NULL
men	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
hair	NULL
upon	NULL
their	NULL
faces	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
three	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
four	NULL
understood	NULL
a	NULL
minimum	NULL
of	NULL
English	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
practical	NULL
object-lesson	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
necessary	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
Captain	NULL
Dunning	NULL
resolutely	NULL
sent	NULL
a	NULL
volunteer	NULL
barber	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL
street	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
razor	NULL
.	NULL

Whereupon	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
safety	NULL
of	NULL
democracy	NULL
a	NULL
half-ounce	NULL
of	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
scraped	NULL
dry	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
cheeks	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
Italians	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
Pole	NULL
.	NULL

Outside	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL
there	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
colonel	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
snarling	NULL
teeth	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
circumnavigated	NULL
the	NULL
battalion	NULL
drill-field	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
handsome	NULL
black	NULL
horse	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
West	NULL
Pointer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
mimetically	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
dowdy	NULL
wife	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
dowdy	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
spent	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
town	NULL
taking	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
army	NULL
's	NULL
lately	NULL
exalted	NULL
social	NULL
position	NULL
.	NULL

Last	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
traversed	NULL
the	NULL
roads	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
camp	NULL
preceded	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
flag	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
figure	NULL
so	NULL
austere	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
removed	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
magnificent	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
scarcely	NULL
comprehensible	NULL
.	NULL

December	NULL
.	NULL

Cool	NULL
winds	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
damp	NULL
,	NULL
chilly	NULL
mornings	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
drill-grounds	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
heat	NULL
faded	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
increasingly	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
alive	NULL
.	NULL

Renewed	NULL
strangely	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
body	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
worried	NULL
little	NULL
and	NULL
existed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
animal	NULL
content	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
that	NULL
Gloria	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
that	NULL
Gloria	NULL
represented	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
often	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
simply	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
became	NULL
,	NULL
day	NULL
by	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
less	NULL
real	NULL
,	NULL
less	NULL
vivid	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
corresponded	NULL
passionately	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
hysterically	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
unwritten	NULL
agreement	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
twice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
bored	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
brigade	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
there	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
join	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Haight	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
submit	NULL
a	NULL
stronger	NULL
brief	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
doubted	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
appealed	NULL
case	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
up	NULL
until	NULL
late	NULL
spring	NULL
.	NULL

Muriel	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
doing	NULL
Red	NULL
Cross	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
together	NULL
rather	NULL
often	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
would	NULL
Anthony	NULL
think	NULL
if	NULL
_	NULL
she	NULL
_	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
Red	NULL
Cross	NULL
?	NULL

Trouble	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
bathe	NULL
negroes	NULL
in	NULL
alcohol	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
felt	NULL
so	NULL
patriotic	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
city	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
soldiers	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
'd	NULL
seen	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
boys	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
laid	NULL
eyes	NULL
on	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
South	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
reasons	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
needed	NULL
a	NULL
rest	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
bored	NULL
beyond	NULL
measure	NULL
in	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Anthony	NULL
for	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
hours	NULL
each	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
he	NULL
feared	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
attracted	NULL
to	NULL
Dorothy	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
he	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
terror	NULL
that	NULL
Gloria	NULL
should	NULL
learn	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
chance	NULL
or	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
relation	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
formed	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
the	NULL
entanglement	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
moments	NULL
of	NULL
misery	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
faithlessness	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
each	NULL
day	NULL
ended	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
withstand	NULL
the	NULL
lure	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
draw	NULL
him	NULL
irresistibly	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
tent	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
telephone	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Y.M.C.A.	NULL
"	NULL
Dot	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
in	NULL
to-night	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
so	NULL
glad	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
you	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
splendid	NULL
eloquence	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
starry	NULL
hours	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
funny	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
For	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
memory	NULL
of	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
Geraldine	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
arrive	NULL
about	NULL
eight	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

At	NULL
seven	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
jitney	NULL
bound	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
hundreds	NULL
of	NULL
little	NULL
Southern	NULL
girls	NULL
were	NULL
waiting	NULL
on	NULL
moonlit	NULL
porches	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
lovers	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
excited	NULL
already	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
warm	NULL
retarded	NULL
kisses	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
amazed	NULL
quietude	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
glances	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
glances	NULL
nearer	NULL
to	NULL
worship	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
inspired	NULL
.	NULL

Gloria	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
equals	NULL
,	NULL
giving	NULL
without	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
thanks	NULL
or	NULL
obligation	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
this	NULL
girl	NULL
his	NULL
very	NULL
caresses	NULL
were	NULL
an	NULL
inestimable	NULL
boon	NULL
.	NULL

Crying	NULL
quietly	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
confessed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
one	NULL
other	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
gathered	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
sooner	NULL
commenced	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL
the	NULL
clerk	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
naval	NULL
officer	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
clothier	NULL
's	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL
forgotten	NULL
her	NULL
vividness	NULL
of	NULL
emotion	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
forgetting	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
opaque	NULL
and	NULL
shadowy	NULL
existence	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
occurred	NULL
in	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

Almost	NULL
every	NULL
night	NULL
Anthony	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
cool	NULL
now	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
porch	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
surrendered	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
the	NULL
tiny	NULL
sitting	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
dozens	NULL
of	NULL
cheaply	NULL
framed	NULL
chromos	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
yard	NULL
upon	NULL
yard	NULL
of	NULL
decorative	NULL
fringe	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
thick	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
of	NULL
several	NULL
decades	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
proximity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
build	NULL
a	NULL
fire	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
happily	NULL
,	NULL
inexhaustibly	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
business	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

Each	NULL
evening	NULL
at	NULL
ten	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
walk	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
black	NULL
hair	NULL
in	NULL
disarray	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
pale	NULL
without	NULL
cosmetics	NULL
,	NULL
paler	NULL
still	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
whiteness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
a	NULL
rule	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
bright	NULL
and	NULL
silver	NULL
outside	NULL
;	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
slow	NULL
warm	NULL
rain	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
indolent	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
reach	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Say	NULL
you	NULL
love	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
whisper	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
sweet	NULL
baby	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Am	NULL
I	NULL
a	NULL
baby	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

This	NULL
almost	NULL
wistfully	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Just	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
baby	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
vaguely	NULL
of	NULL
Gloria	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
pain	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
she	NULL
imagined	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
haughty	NULL
and	NULL
proud	NULL
and	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
Gloria	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
love	NULL
between	NULL
husband	NULL
and	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
she	NULL
let	NULL
herself	NULL
dream	NULL
that	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
Anthony	NULL
would	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
divorce	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
married	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
mentioned	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
scarcely	NULL
knew	NULL
why	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
shared	NULL
his	NULL
company	NULL
's	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
bank	NULL
clerk	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
respectable	NULL
and	NULL
poor	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
If	NULL
I	NULL

some	NULL
money	NULL

Anthony	NULL

In	NULL
her	NULL
letter	NULL
that	NULL

Half	NULL
an	NULL

he	NULL

Anthony	NULL
stood	NULL

think	NULL
you	NULL
've	NULL

He	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
warm	NULL
glow	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
this	NULL
would	NULL
naturally	NULL
arouse	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

narrowing	NULL

Anthony	NULL
agreed	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
melancholy	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL

At	NULL
this	NULL
point	NULL
Anthony	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
staggered	NULL
slightly	NULL
backward	NULL
,	NULL
overwhelmed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
quarter	NULL
million	NULL
selected	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
consummate	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL

phrase	NULL

With	NULL
these	NULL
parting	NULL
words	NULL
lingering	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
ears	NULL
,	NULL
Corporal	NULL
Patch	NULL
saluted	NULL
,	NULL
executed	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
about	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
tent	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
amused	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
generate	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
life	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
amusing	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
sergeant	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
he	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
less	NULL
exacting	NULL
medical	NULL
examiner	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
officer	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
belie	NULL
the	NULL
army	NULL
's	NULL
boasted	NULL
gallantry	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
inspections	NULL
one	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
dress	NULL
up	NULL

look	NULL
well	NULL

one	NULL
dressed	NULL
up	NULL

keep	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
winter	NULL
wore	NULL
away	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
snowless	NULL
winter	NULL
marked	NULL
by	NULL
damp	NULL
nights	NULL
and	NULL
cool	NULL

rainy	NULL
days	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
marvelled	NULL
at	NULL
how	NULL
quickly	NULL
the	NULL
system	NULL
had	NULL
grasped	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
soldier	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
soldiers	NULL
were	NULL
civilians	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
divided	NULL
primarily	NULL
into	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
classifications	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
strongly	NULL
accentuated	NULL
classes	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
military	NULL
,	NULL
divided	NULL
men	NULL
into	NULL
two	NULL
kinds	NULL
:	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
kind	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
those	NULL
without	NULL

To	NULL
the	NULL
clergyman	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
clergy	NULL

laity	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL
Catholic	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
Catholics	NULL

non-Catholics	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL

there	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL
prisoner	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL

the	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL
sick	NULL
man	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
sick	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
well	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
once	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
lifetime	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
American	NULL
troops	NULL
were	NULL
poured	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
French	NULL
and	NULL
British	NULL
trenches	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
names	NULL

many	NULL
Harvard	NULL
men	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
casualties	NULL
recorded	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

Navy	NULL
Journal	NULL

But	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
sweat	NULL
and	NULL
blood	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
appeared	NULL
unchanged	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL

ending	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

After	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

fled	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
simple	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
days	NULL

almost	NULL
as	NULL

Gloria	NULL

What	NULL
a	NULL
mess	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
spent	NULL
her	NULL
time	NULL
imagining	NULL
how	NULL
differently	NULL

Her	NULL

a	NULL

all	NULL

In	NULL
June	NULL
her	NULL
letters	NULL
grew	NULL
hurried	NULL

She	NULL
suddenly	NULL

basked	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

violets	NULL

dogwood	NULL

here	NULL
the	NULL

shone	NULL

oblivious	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

July	NULL
came	NULL
scorching	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

Captain	NULL
Dunning	NULL
was	NULL
ordered	NULL
to	NULL
detail	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
men	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
blacksmithing	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
regiment	NULL
was	NULL
filling	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
war	NULL
strength	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
needed	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
veterans	NULL
for	NULL
drill-masters	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
selected	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
Italian	NULL
,	NULL
Baptiste	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
most	NULL
easily	NULL
spare	NULL
.	NULL

Little	NULL
Baptiste	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
horses	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
fear	NULL
made	NULL
matters	NULL
worse	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
reappeared	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
orderly	NULL
room	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
Captain	NULL
Dunning	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
relieved	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
horses	NULL
kicked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

Finally	NULL
he	NULL
fell	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
and	NULL
besought	NULL
Captain	NULL
Dunning	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
mixture	NULL
of	NULL
broken	NULL
English	NULL
and	NULL
scriptural	NULL
Italian	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
slept	NULL
for	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
;	NULL
monstrous	NULL
stallions	NULL
reared	NULL
and	NULL
cavorted	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
dreams	NULL
.	NULL

Captain	NULL
Dunning	NULL
reproved	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL
clerk	NULL
(	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
burst	NULL
out	NULL
laughing	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
Baptiste	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
he	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
spare	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

Little	NULL
Baptiste	NULL
went	NULL
from	NULL
bad	NULL
to	NULL
worse	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
horses	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
divine	NULL
his	NULL
fear	NULL
and	NULL
take	NULL
every	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL

Two	NULL
weeks	NULL
later	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
black	NULL
mare	NULL
crushed	NULL
his	NULL
skull	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
hoofs	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
lead	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
stall	NULL

In	NULL
mid-July	NULL
came	NULL
rumors	NULL

then	NULL
orders	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
concerned	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
camp	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
brigade	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
empty	NULL
cantonment	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
miles	NULL
farther	NULL
south	NULL

there	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
expanded	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
division	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
thought	NULL

were	NULL
departing	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
trenches	NULL

and	NULL
all	NULL
evening	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL

leaked	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
rejected	NULL
indignantly	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL

conceal	NULL
their	NULL
real	NULL
destination	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
revelled	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
importance	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
night	NULL
they	NULL
told	NULL
their	NULL
girls	NULL
in	NULL

that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
"	NULL
going	NULL

--	NULL

stopping	NULL

For	NULL

against	NULL
him	NULL

THE	NULL
CATASTROPHE	NULL
Early	NULL

The	NULL
darkness	NULL

alive	NULL

beat	NULL
in	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
mosquito-netting	NULL

beneath	NULL
the	NULL
shelter	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL

An	NULL
intermittent	NULL
chatter	NULL
over	NULL

was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

and	NULL
outside	NULL

With	NULL
an	NULL

Anthony	NULL
hoisted	NULL
himself	NULL

pencil	NULL
in	NULL

looked	NULL
down	NULL

it	NULL

_	NULL
He	NULL
threw	NULL
this	NULL

began	NULL
again	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
only	NULL
natural	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
wonder	NULL

If	NULL
your	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL

is	NULL
n't	NULL
absolutely	NULL
dead	NULL
it	NULL

that	NULL
you	NULL

_	NULL
Again	NULL
he	NULL
crumpled	NULL
the	NULL
page	NULL
and	NULL
tossed	NULL
it	NULL
angrily	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
tear	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tent	NULL
wall	NULL
,	NULL
realizing	NULL
simultaneously	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
pick	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
disinclined	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
no	NULL
warmth	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
lines	NULL
--	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
persistent	NULL
jealousy	NULL
and	NULL
suspicion	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
midsummer	NULL
these	NULL
discrepancies	NULL
in	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
correspondence	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
noticeable	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
scarcely	NULL
perceived	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
inured	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
perfunctory	NULL
"	NULL
dearest	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
"	NULL
darlings	NULL
"	NULL
scattered	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
letters	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
oblivious	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
presence	NULL
or	NULL
absence	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
last	NULL
fortnight	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
increasingly	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
amiss	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
night-letter	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
his	NULL
examinations	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
officers	NULL
'	NULL
training-camp	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
for	NULL
Georgia	NULL
shortly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
wired	NULL
again	NULL
--	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
received	NULL
no	NULL
word	NULL
he	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
and	NULL
recurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
series	NULL
of	NULL
distraught	NULL
imaginings	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
plague	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Supposing	NULL
Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
bored	NULL
and	NULL
restless	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
thought	NULL
terrified	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
possibility	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
chiefly	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
sure	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
personal	NULL
integrity	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
considered	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
sparingly	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
doubt	NULL
was	NULL
born	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
angers	NULL

the	NULL
rages	NULL
of	NULL
possession	NULL
,	NULL
swarmed	NULL
back	NULL

thousandfold	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
more	NULL
natural	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
again	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
Gloria	NULL
who	NULL
promised	NULL
that	NULL
should	NULL
she	NULL
ever	NULL
want	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
insisting	NULL
that	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
act	NULL
entirely	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
through	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
affair	NULL
unsmirched	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
counted	NULL
,	NULL
anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
reaction	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
masculine	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
satiation	NULL
and	NULL
faint	NULL
dislike	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
first	NULL
married	NULL
.	NULL

Later	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
discovery	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
jealous	NULL
of	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
outwardly	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
changed	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
only	NULL
too	NULL
surely	NULL
.	NULL

Perceiving	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
fastidiousness	NULL
would	NULL
restrain	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
lax	NULL
in	NULL
preserving	NULL
the	NULL
completeness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
love	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
keystone	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
entire	NULL
structure	NULL
.	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
all	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
maintaining	NULL
Dot	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
boarding-house	NULL
down-town	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
broker	NULL
for	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

Dot	NULL
had	NULL
covered	NULL
her	NULL
journey	NULL
south	NULL
by	NULL
leaving	NULL
her	NULL
house	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
brigade	NULL
broke	NULL
camp	NULL
,	NULL
informing	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
note	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
following	NULL
Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
called	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Raycroft	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
collapse	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
policeman	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
parlor	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
questionnaire	NULL
had	NULL
ensued	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
extricated	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
difficulty	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
September	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
suspicions	NULL
of	NULL
Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL
of	NULL
Dot	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
tedious	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
almost	NULL
intolerable	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
nervous	NULL
and	NULL
irritable	NULL
from	NULL
lack	NULL
of	NULL
sleep	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
sick	NULL
and	NULL
afraid	NULL
.	NULL

Three	NULL
days	NULL
ago	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
Captain	NULL
Dunning	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
furlough	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
benignant	NULL
procrastination	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
division	NULL
was	NULL
starting	NULL
overseas	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Anthony	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
officers	NULL
'	NULL
training-camp	NULL
;	NULL
what	NULL
furloughs	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
given	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

Upon	NULL
this	NULL
refusal	NULL
Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
telegraph	NULL
office	NULL
intending	NULL
to	NULL
wire	NULL
Gloria	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
South	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
receded	NULL
despairingly	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
the	NULL
utter	NULL
impracticability	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
move	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
quarrelling	NULL
irritably	NULL
with	NULL
Dot	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
camp	NULL
morose	NULL
and	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
scene	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
precipitately	NULL
departed	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
concern	NULL
him	NULL
vitally	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
completely	NULL
absorbed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
disheartening	NULL
silence	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
flap	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tent	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
triangle	NULL
back	NULL
upon	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
head	NULL
appeared	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Sergeant	NULL
Patch	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
accent	NULL
was	NULL
Italian	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Anthony	NULL
saw	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
belt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
headquarters	NULL
orderly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Want	NULL
me	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Lady	NULL
call	NULL
up	NULL
headquarters	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL

.	NULL

Say	NULL
she	NULL
have	NULL

with	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

Ver	NULL
'	NULL
important	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Anthony	NULL
swept	NULL
aside	NULL
the	NULL
mosquito-netting	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
wire	NULL
from	NULL
Gloria	NULL
telephoned	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
say	NULL

you	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
call	NULL
again	NULL
ten	NULL
o'clock	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
thanks	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
picked	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
was	NULL
striding	NULL
beside	NULL
the	NULL
orderly	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
hot	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
suffocating	NULL
,	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

Over	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
headquarters	NULL
shack	NULL
he	NULL
saluted	NULL
a	NULL
dozing	NULL
night-service	NULL
officer	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Sit	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
wait	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
suggested	NULL
the	NULL
lieutenant	NULL
nonchalantly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Girl	NULL
seemed	NULL
awful	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
hopes	NULL
fell	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Thank	NULL
you	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
phone	NULL
squeaked	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
side-wall	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
calling	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
This	NULL
is	NULL
Dot	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
came	NULL
an	NULL
unsteady	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Dot	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
told	NULL
you	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
get	NULL
down	NULL
for	NULL
several	NULL
days	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
too	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
coldly	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL

o'clock	NULL

I	NULL

.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
wretchedness	NULL
compressed	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
words	NULL
that	NULL
Anthony	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
measure	NULL
of	NULL
compunction	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
's	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
idiot	NULL

he	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
spirits	NULL
rose	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
luck	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
leave	NULL
town	NULL
this	NULL
very	NULL
night	NULL
!	NULL

What	NULL
a	NULL
burden	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
possibly	NULL
leave	NULL
before	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
eye	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
night-service	NULL
officer	NULL
regarding	NULL
him	NULL
quizzically	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
startlingly	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
Dot	NULL
's	NULL
next	NULL
words	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL

"	NULL

Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
hand	NULL
clutched	NULL
the	NULL
receiver	NULL
fiercely	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
nerves	NULL
turning	NULL
cold	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
heat	NULL
was	NULL
leaving	NULL
his	NULL
body	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
quickly	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
wild	NULL
broken	NULL
voice	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Good-by	NULL
--	NULL
oh	NULL

"	NULL

Cul	NULL
-	NULL
_	NULL
lup	NULL
!	NULL

_	NULL
She	NULL
had	NULL
hung	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
receiver	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
sound	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
gasp	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
cry	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
hurried	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
headquarters	NULL
building	NULL
.	NULL

Outside	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
stars	NULL
that	NULL
dripped	NULL
like	NULL
silver	NULL
tassels	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
grove	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
motionless	NULL
,	NULL
hesitating	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
kill	NULL
herself	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
oh	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
fool	NULL
!	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
bitter	NULL
hate	NULL
toward	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
dénouement	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
realize	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
begun	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
entanglement	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
mess	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sordid	NULL
mélange	NULL
of	NULL
worry	NULL
and	NULL
pain	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
walking	NULL
slowly	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
repeating	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
futile	NULL
to	NULL
worry	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
best	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
tent	NULL
and	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
needed	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

God	NULL
!	NULL

Would	NULL
he	NULL
ever	NULL
sleep	NULL
again	NULL

His	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
vast	NULL
clamor	NULL
and	NULL
confusion	NULL
;	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
around	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
panic	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
running	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
toward	NULL
his	NULL
company	NULL

away	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL

Men	NULL
were	NULL
returning	NULL
now	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
taxicab	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
two	NULL
yellow	NULL
eyes	NULL
appeared	NULL
around	NULL
a	NULL
bend	NULL

Desperately	NULL
he	NULL
ran	NULL
toward	NULL
them	NULL

After	NULL
an	NULL

time	NULL
he	NULL
ran	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
ramshackle	NULL
little	NULL
house	NULL

and	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL

almost	NULL
knocking	NULL
over	NULL

cried	NULL
wildly	NULL

the	NULL
stairs	NULL
three	NULL
at	NULL

down	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
dark	NULL

silent	NULL

and	NULL
with	NULL
trembling	NULL
fingers	NULL
he	NULL
struck	NULL
a	NULL
match	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
wide	NULL
eyes	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
wretched	NULL
ball	NULL
of	NULL
clothes	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL

"	NULL
Ah	NULL

murmured	NULL
brokenly	NULL

grew	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

slowly	NULL
shook	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

Whatever	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

said	NULL
Anthony	NULL
hopelessly	NULL

As	NULL

along	NULL
its	NULL

wave	NULL
his	NULL
anger	NULL
subsided	NULL

receded	NULL

He	NULL
collapsed	NULL

took	NULL

soothed	NULL
him	NULL

mingled	NULL
her	NULL

warm	NULL
wind	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
rise	NULL
and	NULL
fall	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
bosom	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
breath	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
Gloria	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
rest	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
sweeter	NULL
and	NULL
safer	NULL
home	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
known	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
hour	NULL
passed	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
clock	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
chime	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
jumped	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
phosphorescent	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wrist	NULL
watch	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
twelve	NULL
o'clock	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
trouble	NULL
in	NULL
finding	NULL
a	NULL
taxi	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
hour	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
urged	NULL
the	NULL
driver	NULL
faster	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
he	NULL
speculated	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
method	NULL
of	NULL
entering	NULL
camp	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
late	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL
recently	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
he	NULL
caught	NULL
again	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
be	NULL
stricken	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
list	NULL
of	NULL
officer	NULL
candidates	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
better	NULL
dismiss	NULL
the	NULL
taxi	NULL
and	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
on	NULL
passing	NULL
the	NULL
sentry	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
officers	NULL
often	NULL
rode	NULL
past	NULL
the	NULL
sentries	NULL
after	NULL
midnight	NULL
....	NULL
"	NULL
Halt	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
monosyllable	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
yellow	NULL
glare	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
headlights	NULL
dropped	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
changing	NULL
road	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
taxi-driver	NULL
threw	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
clutch	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
sentry	NULL
walked	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
carrying	NULL
his	NULL
rifle	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
port	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
ill	NULL
chance	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
officer	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
guard	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Out	NULL
late	NULL
,	NULL
sergeant	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL

.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Too	NULL
bad	NULL
.	NULL

Have	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
your	NULL
name	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
officer	NULL
waited	NULL
,	NULL
note-book	NULL
and	NULL
pencil	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
not	NULL
fully	NULL
intended	NULL
crowded	NULL
to	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
born	NULL
of	NULL
panic	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
muddle	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Sergeant	NULL
R.A.	NULL
Foley	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
breathlessly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL

All	NULL

You	NULL
'll	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
from	NULL

,	NULL
sergeant	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Anthony	NULL
saluted	NULL
,	NULL
quickly	NULL
paid	NULL
his	NULL
taxi-driver	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
set	NULL
off	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
run	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
regiment	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
named	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
sight	NULL
he	NULL
changed	NULL
his	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
beating	NULL
wildly	NULL
,	NULL
hurried	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
company	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
fatal	NULL
error	NULL
of	NULL
judgment	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL
the	NULL
officer	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
command	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
guard	NULL
recognized	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
barber	NULL
shop	NULL
down-town	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
charge	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
military	NULL
policeman	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
camp	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
reduced	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ranks	NULL
without	NULL
trial	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
confined	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
limits	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
company	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
this	NULL
blow	NULL
a	NULL
spell	NULL
of	NULL
utter	NULL
depression	NULL
overtook	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
again	NULL
caught	NULL
down-town	NULL
,	NULL
wandering	NULL
around	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
drunken	NULL
daze	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pint	NULL
of	NULL
bootleg	NULL
whiskey	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hip	NULL
pocket	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
craziness	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
behavior	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
trial	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
sentence	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
guard-house	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
only	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
.	NULL

NIGHTMARE	NULL
Early	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
confinement	NULL
the	NULL
conviction	NULL
took	NULL
root	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
mad	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
quantity	NULL
of	NULL
dark	NULL
yet	NULL
vivid	NULL
personalities	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
familiar	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
strange	NULL
and	NULL
terrible	NULL
,	NULL
held	NULL
in	NULL
check	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
monitor	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
sat	NULL
aloft	NULL
somewhere	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
worried	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
monitor	NULL
was	NULL
sick	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
holding	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
difficulty	NULL
.	NULL

Should	NULL
he	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
he	NULL
falter	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
out	NULL
would	NULL
rush	NULL
these	NULL
intolerable	NULL
things	NULL
--	NULL
only	NULL
Anthony	NULL
could	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
blackness	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
could	NULL
roam	NULL
his	NULL
consciousness	NULL
unchecked	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
heat	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
had	NULL
changed	NULL
,	NULL
somehow	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
burnished	NULL
darkness	NULL
crushing	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
devastated	NULL
land	NULL
.	NULL

Over	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
circles	NULL
of	NULL
ominous	NULL
uncharted	NULL
suns	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
unnumbered	NULL
centres	NULL
of	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
revolved	NULL
interminably	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
lying	NULL
constantly	NULL
exposed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hot	NULL
light	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
feverish	NULL
coma	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
seven	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
something	NULL
phantasmal	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
almost	NULL
absurdly	NULL
unreal	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
mortal	NULL
body	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
seven	NULL
other	NULL
prisoners	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
guards	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
camp	NULL
roads	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
they	NULL
loaded	NULL
and	NULL
unloaded	NULL
quantities	NULL
of	NULL
gravel	NULL
,	NULL
spread	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
raked	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
they	NULL
worked	NULL
with	NULL
huge	NULL
barrels	NULL
of	NULL
red-hot	NULL
tar	NULL
,	NULL
flooding	NULL
the	NULL
gravel	NULL
with	NULL
black	NULL
,	NULL
shining	NULL
pools	NULL
of	NULL
molten	NULL
heat	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
locked	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
guard-house	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
lie	NULL
without	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
courage	NULL
to	NULL
compass	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
irregular	NULL
beams	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ceiling	NULL
overhead	NULL
until	NULL
about	NULL
three	NULL
o'clock	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
slip	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
broken	NULL
,	NULL
troubled	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
hours	NULL
he	NULL
labored	NULL
with	NULL
uneasy	NULL
haste	NULL
,	NULL
attempting	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
bore	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
sultry	NULL
Mississippi	NULL
sunset	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
tire	NULL
himself	NULL
physically	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
sleep	NULL
deeply	NULL
from	NULL
utter	NULL
exhaustion	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
one	NULL
afternoon	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
week	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
two	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
watching	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
feet	NULL
beyond	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
guards	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
aroused	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
terror	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
shovelled	NULL
feverishly	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
it	NULL
became	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
about	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
for	NULL
more	NULL
gravel	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
entered	NULL
his	NULL
vision	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
already	NULL
taut	NULL
nerves	NULL
tightened	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
breaking-point	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
leering	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Out	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hot	NULL
silence	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
called	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
tragic	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
tipped	NULL
absurdly	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
forth	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
babel	NULL
of	NULL
shouting	NULL
and	NULL
confusion	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
next	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
conscious	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
guard-house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
prisoners	NULL
were	NULL
throwing	NULL
him	NULL
curious	NULL
glances	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
eyes	NULL
returned	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
many	NULL
days	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
realized	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
Dot	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
called	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
some	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
disturbance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
decided	NULL
this	NULL
just	NULL
previous	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
expiration	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
sentence	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
cloud	NULL
that	NULL
oppressed	NULL
him	NULL
had	NULL
lifted	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
,	NULL
dispirited	NULL
lethargy	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
conscious	NULL
mediator	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
monitor	NULL
who	NULL
kept	NULL
that	NULL
fearsome	NULL
ménage	NULL
of	NULL
horror	NULL
,	NULL
grew	NULL
stronger	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
became	NULL
physically	NULL
weaker	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
scarcely	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
toil	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
released	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
rainy	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
company	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
reached	NULL
his	NULL
tent	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
fall	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
doze	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
awoke	NULL
before	NULL
dawn	NULL
,	NULL
aching	NULL
and	NULL
unrefreshed	NULL
.	NULL

Beside	NULL
his	NULL
cot	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
letters	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
awaiting	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
orderly	NULL
tent	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
was	NULL

cool	NULL

_	NULL

I	NULL
've	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
you	NULL
again	NULL

again	NULL

it	NULL
just	NULL
seems	NULL

make	NULL
things	NULL
worse	NULL

I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
about	NULL
several	NULL

you	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL

In	NULL

we	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
tired	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
care	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
phrases	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
intentions	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
far	NULL
away	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
incomprehensible	NULL
past	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
letter	NULL
he	NULL
scarcely	NULL
glanced	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
from	NULL
Dot	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
incoherent	NULL
,	NULL
tear-swollen	NULL
scrawl	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
flood	NULL
of	NULL
protest	NULL
,	NULL
endearment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
grief	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
page	NULL
he	NULL
let	NULL
it	NULL
slip	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
inert	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
drowsed	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
nebulous	NULL
hinterland	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
drill-call	NULL
he	NULL
awoke	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
high	NULL
fever	NULL
and	NULL
fainted	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
his	NULL
tent	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
noon	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sent	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
base	NULL
hospital	NULL
with	NULL
influenza	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
sickness	NULL
was	NULL
providential	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
saved	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
hysterical	NULL
relapse	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
recovered	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
entrain	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
damp	NULL
November	NULL
day	NULL
for	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL
interminable	NULL
massacre	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
regiment	NULL
reached	NULL
Camp	NULL
Mills	NULL

Long	NULL
Island	NULL

Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
single	NULL
idea	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
Gloria	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
evident	NULL
that	NULL
an	NULL
armistice	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
signed	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL

rumor	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL

troops	NULL
would	NULL
continue	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
shipped	NULL
to	NULL
France	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL

Anthony	NULL
was	NULL
appalled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
notion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
voyage	NULL

of	NULL
a	NULL
tedious	NULL
debarkation	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
French	NULL

of	NULL
being	NULL
kept	NULL
abroad	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL

possibly	NULL

to	NULL
replace	NULL
the	NULL
troops	NULL

had	NULL

fighting	NULL

His	NULL
intention	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
obtain	NULL
a	NULL
two-day	NULL
furlough	NULL

Camp	NULL

proved	NULL

was	NULL
impossible	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL

It	NULL

due	NULL

the	NULL

Anthony	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
impracticability	NULL
of	NULL
trudging	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
telephone	NULL

night	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
call	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

Aroused	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

bitter	NULL
dawn	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
at	NULL
reveille	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
passionate	NULL
harangue	NULL
from	NULL
Captain	NULL
Dunning	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL

It	NULL

He	NULL
paused	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
pronouncement	NULL

then	NULL

Doubly	NULL
stressing	NULL
this	NULL

he	NULL
ordered	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL
dismissed	NULL

noon	NULL
Anthony	NULL
set	NULL
off	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL

for	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
approached	NULL
what	NULL
corresponded	NULL

the	NULL
down-town	NULL

he	NULL
noticed	NULL

him	NULL
had	NULL
suddenly	NULL
leaped	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL

clicked	NULL
his	NULL
heels	NULL
together	NULL

The	NULL
tendency	NULL

run	NULL
became	NULL
general	NULL

from	NULL
little	NULL
excited	NULL

here	NULL

there	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
sounds	NULL

stopped	NULL

Anthony	NULL

again	NULL

The	NULL

six	NULL

Anthony	NULL
slipped	NULL
between	NULL
two	NULL

once	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL

followed	NULL
the	NULL

where	NULL
he	NULL
caught	NULL
an	NULL
electric	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
some	NULL
chance	NULL

knew	NULL

were	NULL
often	NULL

ask	NULL

he	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
to-night	NULL

be	NULL
relaxed	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL

another	NULL

After	NULL
inexplicable	NULL
stops	NULL

that	NULL
reminded	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL

night	NULL

left	NULL

over	NULL
a	NULL

he	NULL
followed	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

finding	NULL
it	NULL
grotesque	NULL
and	NULL
oddly	NULL
stimulating	NULL

give	NULL
his	NULL

Broadway	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
riot	NULL

thronged	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL

Here	NULL

Anthony	NULL
hung	NULL
up	NULL
sharply	NULL
and	NULL
rose	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
was	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Crawford	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
taking	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ball	NULL
?	NULL

How	NULL
long	NULL
had	NULL
this	NULL
been	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
?	NULL

All	NULL
these	NULL
questions	NULL
asked	NULL
and	NULL
answered	NULL
themselves	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
ways	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
very	NULL
proximity	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
drove	NULL
him	NULL
half	NULL
frantic	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
frenzy	NULL
of	NULL
suspicion	NULL
he	NULL
rushed	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
apartment	NULL
,	NULL
hunting	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
masculine	NULL
occupation	NULL
,	NULL
opening	NULL
the	NULL
bathroom	NULL
cupboard	NULL
,	NULL
searching	NULL
feverishly	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
bureau	NULL
drawers	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
stop	NULL
suddenly	NULL
and	NULL
sit	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
twin	NULL
beds	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
corners	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
drooping	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
weep	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
drawer	NULL
,	NULL
tied	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
frail	NULL
blue	NULL
ribbon	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
letters	NULL
and	NULL
telegrams	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
her	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
past	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
suffused	NULL
with	NULL
happy	NULL
and	NULL
sentimental	NULL
shame	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
fit	NULL
to	NULL

her	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
cried	NULL
aloud	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
four	NULL
walls	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
fit	NULL
to	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
Astor	NULL
lobby	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
engulfed	NULL
immediately	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
crowd	NULL
so	NULL
thick	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
progress	NULL
almost	NULL
impossible	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ballroom	NULL
from	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
people	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL

Eventually	NULL

after	NULL

he	NULL
checked	NULL
his	NULL
military	NULL

was	NULL

Anthony	NULL
scanned	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
II	NULL
A	NULL
MATTER	NULL
OF	NULL
AESTHETICS	NULL
On	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
when	NULL
Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
for	NULL
Camp	NULL
Hooker	NULL
one	NULL
year	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
Gloria	NULL
Gilbert	NULL
--	NULL
her	NULL
shell	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
young	NULL
and	NULL
lovely	NULL
body	NULL
--	NULL
moved	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
broad	NULL
marble	NULL
steps	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Grand	NULL
Central	NULL
Station	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
rhythm	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
engine	NULL
beating	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
ears	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
onto	NULL
Vanderbilt	NULL
Avenue	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
huge	NULL
bulk	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Biltmore	NULL
overhung	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
low	NULL
,	NULL
gleaming	NULL
entrance	NULL
,	NULL
sucked	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
many-colored	NULL
opera-cloaks	NULL
of	NULL
gorgeously	NULL
dressed	NULL
girls	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
paused	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
taxi-stand	NULL
and	NULL
watched	NULL
them	NULL
--	NULL
wondering	NULL
that	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
number	NULL
,	NULL
ever	NULL
setting	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
radiant	NULL
Somewhere	NULL
,	NULL
always	NULL
just	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
that	NULL
ultimate	NULL
passionate	NULL
adventure	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
'	NULL
cloaks	NULL
were	NULL
delicate	NULL
and	NULL
beautifully	NULL
furred	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
their	NULL
cheeks	NULL
were	NULL
painted	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
hearts	NULL
higher	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
transitory	NULL
dome	NULL
of	NULL
pleasure	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
engulf	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
coiffure	NULL
,	NULL
cloak	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
growing	NULL
colder	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
passing	NULL
had	NULL
flipped	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
collars	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
overcoats	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
change	NULL
was	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
kinder	NULL
still	NULL
had	NULL
everything	NULL
changed	NULL
,	NULL
weather	NULL
,	NULL
streets	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
been	NULL
whisked	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
wake	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
high	NULL
,	NULL
fresh-scented	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
statuesque	NULL
within	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
virginal	NULL
and	NULL
colorful	NULL
past	NULL
.	NULL

Inside	NULL
the	NULL
taxicab	NULL
she	NULL
wept	NULL
impotent	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
happy	NULL
with	NULL
Anthony	NULL
for	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
mattered	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

Recently	NULL
his	NULL
presence	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
awake	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
memorable	NULL
June	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Anthony	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
,	NULL
irritable	NULL
,	NULL
weak	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
no	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
irritable	NULL
in	NULL
turn	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
bored	NULL
with	NULL
everything	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
highly	NULL
imaginative	NULL
and	NULL
eloquent	NULL
youth	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
ecstatic	NULL
revel	NULL
of	NULL
emotion	NULL
.	NULL

Because	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
mutually	NULL
vivid	NULL
memory	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
more	NULL
for	NULL
Anthony	NULL
than	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
human	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
taxicab	NULL
she	NULL
wept	NULL
passionately	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
aloud	NULL
.	NULL

Miserable	NULL
,	NULL
lonesome	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
forgotten	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
quiet	NULL
apartment	NULL
and	NULL
wrote	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
full	NULL

confused	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
addressed	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
twin	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
clasping	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
pillow	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
by	NULL
sheer	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
emotion	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
metamorphize	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
warm	NULL
and	NULL
living	NULL
body	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
o'clock	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
dry-eyed	NULL
,	NULL
staring	NULL
with	NULL
steady	NULL
persistent	NULL
grief	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
,	NULL
remembering	NULL
,	NULL
remembering	NULL
unmercifully	NULL
,	NULL
blaming	NULL
herself	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
fancied	NULL
unkindnesses	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
likeness	NULL
of	NULL
Anthony	NULL
akin	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
martyred	NULL
and	NULL
transfigured	NULL
Christ	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
more	NULL
sentimental	NULL
moments	NULL
,	NULL
probably	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
five	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
awake	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
mysterious	NULL
grinding	NULL
noise	NULL
that	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
every	NULL
morning	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
areaway	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
heard	NULL
an	NULL
alarm	NULL
clock	NULL
ring	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
yellow	NULL
square	NULL
on	NULL
an	NULL
illusory	NULL
blank	NULL
wall	NULL
opposite	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
the	NULL
half-formed	NULL
resolution	NULL
of	NULL
following	NULL
him	NULL
South	NULL
immediately	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
sorrow	NULL
grew	NULL
remote	NULL
and	NULL
unreal	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
moved	NULL
off	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
moved	NULL
westward	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
fell	NULL
asleep	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
awoke	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
empty	NULL
bed	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
brought	NULL
a	NULL
renewal	NULL
of	NULL
misery	NULL
,	NULL
dispelled	NULL
shortly	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
inevitable	NULL
callousness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bright	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
relief	NULL
in	NULL
eating	NULL
breakfast	NULL
without	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
tired	NULL
and	NULL
worried	NULL
face	NULL
opposite	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
alone	NULL
she	NULL
lost	NULL
all	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
complain	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
food	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
change	NULL
her	NULL
breakfasts	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
--	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
lemonade	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
tomato	NULL
sandwich	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sempiternal	NULL
bacon	NULL
and	NULL
eggs	NULL
and	NULL
toast	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
noon	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
called	NULL
up	NULL
several	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
acquaintances	NULL
,	NULL
including	NULL
the	NULL
martial	NULL
Muriel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
each	NULL
one	NULL
engaged	NULL
for	NULL
lunch	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
pity	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
loneliness	NULL
.	NULL

Curled	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
with	NULL
pencil	NULL
and	NULL
paper	NULL
she	NULL
wrote	NULL
Anthony	NULL
another	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

Late	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
arrived	NULL
a	NULL
special	NULL
delivery	NULL
,	NULL
mailed	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
small	NULL
New	NULL
Jersey	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
familiarity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
phrasing	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
almost	NULL
audible	NULL
undertone	NULL
of	NULL
worry	NULL
and	NULL
discontent	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
familiar	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
comforted	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
knew	NULL
?	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
army	NULL
discipline	NULL
would	NULL
harden	NULL
Anthony	NULL
and	NULL
accustom	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
immutable	NULL
faith	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
over	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL

and	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
begin	NULL
again	NULL

this	NULL
time	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
basis	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
thing	NULL
different	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
unbearable	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
utterly	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
stay	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
apartment	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
probability	NULL
of	NULL
remaining	NULL
dry-eyed	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
seemed	NULL
little	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
amusing	NULL
.	NULL

Muriel	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
shifted	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
hospital	NULL
in	NULL
New	NULL
Jersey	NULL

from	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
metropolitan	NULL
holiday	NULL
only	NULL
every	NULL

and	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
defection	NULL
Gloria	NULL
grew	NULL
to	NULL
realize	NULL
how	NULL
few	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
friends	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
New	NULL

The	NULL
men	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
army	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Men	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
"	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
conceded	NULL
vaguely	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
were	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
.	NULL

Each	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
considerable	NULL
time	NULL
professed	NULL
to	NULL
value	NULL
her	NULL
favor	NULL
above	NULL
anything	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
--	NULL
where	NULL
were	NULL
they	NULL
?	NULL

At	NULL
least	NULL
two	NULL
were	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
were	NULL
married	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
scattered	NULL
from	NULL
France	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Philippines	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
often	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
respect	NULL
.	NULL

Most	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
must	NULL
still	NULL
picture	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
girl	NULL
of	NULL
seventeen	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
adolescent	NULL
siren	NULL
of	NULL
nine	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL

were	NULL
gone	NULL
far	NULL
afield	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
popular	NULL
in	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL
beautiful	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
lazy	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
Farmover	NULL
girl	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
Future	NULL

in	NULL

And	NULL
girls	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL

with	NULL
shocked	NULL
expressions	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
plain	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
particularly	NULL
wholesome	NULL
faces	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Gloria	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
these	NULL
girls	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
east	NULL

west	NULL
or	NULL
south	NULL
,	NULL
married	NULL
and	NULL
become	NULL

people	NULL

prophesying	NULL

if	NULL
they	NULL
prophesied	NULL
about	NULL
Gloria	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL

not	NULL
knowing	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL

that	NULL

were	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL

mistresses	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL

Gloria	NULL
told	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
visited	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
house	NULL
at	NULL
Marietta	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
always	NULL
having	NULL
company	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
indulged	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
unspoken	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
each	NULL
guest	NULL
was	NULL
ever	NULL
afterward	NULL
slightly	NULL
indebted	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
owed	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
moral	NULL
ten	NULL
dollars	NULL
apiece	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
should	NULL
she	NULL
ever	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
need	NULL

might	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
,	NULL
borrow	NULL
from	NULL
them	NULL
this	NULL
visionary	NULL
currency	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
scattered	NULL
like	NULL
chaff	NULL
,	NULL
mysteriously	NULL
and	NULL
subtly	NULL
vanished	NULL
in	NULL

Gloria	NULL

no	NULL
longer	NULL

as	NULL

decided	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL

but	NULL
postponed	NULL
the	NULL

who	NULL
expected	NULL
almost	NULL

THE	NULL
WILES	NULL
OF	NULL
CAPTAIN	NULL

The	NULL
two	NULL

were	NULL
captains	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
popular	NULL
craft	NULL

machine	NULL
gunnery	NULL

At	NULL
dinner	NULL

of	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL

horsy	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
thirty	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
mustache	NULL
and	NULL
ugly	NULL
teeth	NULL

The	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
Captain	NULL
Collins	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
chubby	NULL
,	NULL
pink-faced	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
laugh	NULL
with	NULL
abandon	NULL
every	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
caught	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
eye	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
an	NULL
immediate	NULL
fancy	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
throughout	NULL
dinner	NULL
showered	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
inane	NULL
compliments	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
her	NULL
second	NULL
glass	NULL
of	NULL
champagne	NULL
Gloria	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
months	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
enjoying	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
dinner	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
go	NULL
somewhere	NULL
and	NULL
dance	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
two	NULL
officers	NULL
supplied	NULL
themselves	NULL
with	NULL
bottles	NULL
of	NULL
liquor	NULL
from	NULL
Rachael	NULL

sideboard	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
law	NULL
forbade	NULL
service	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
military	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
equipped	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
through	NULL
innumerable	NULL
fox	NULL
trots	NULL
in	NULL
several	NULL
glittering	NULL
caravanseries	NULL
along	NULL
Broadway	NULL
,	NULL
faithfully	NULL
alternating	NULL
partners	NULL
--	NULL
while	NULL
Gloria	NULL
became	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
uproarious	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
amusing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
pink-faced	NULL
captain	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
seldom	NULL
bothered	NULL
to	NULL
remove	NULL
his	NULL
genial	NULL
smile	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
eleven	NULL
o'clock	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
great	NULL
surprise	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
minority	NULL
for	NULL
staying	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
others	NULL
wanted	NULL

return	NULL

apartment	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
some	NULL
more	NULL
liquor	NULL

they	NULL
said	NULL

Gloria	NULL
argued	NULL
persistently	NULL
that	NULL
Captain	NULL

's	NULL
flask	NULL
was	NULL
half	NULL
full	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL

--	NULL
then	NULL
catching	NULL
Rachael	NULL
's	NULL
eye	NULL
she	NULL
received	NULL
an	NULL
unmistakable	NULL
wink	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
deduced	NULL
,	NULL
confusedly	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
hostess	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
officers	NULL
and	NULL
assented	NULL
to	NULL
being	NULL
bundled	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
taxicab	NULL
outside	NULL
.	NULL

Captain	NULL
Wolf	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
with	NULL
Rachael	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
.	NULL

Captain	NULL
Collins	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
settled	NULL
himself	NULL
he	NULL
slipped	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
about	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
shoulder	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
rested	NULL
there	NULL
lifelessly	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
tightened	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
vise	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
leaned	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
awfully	NULL
pretty	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
whispered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Thank	NULL
you	NULL
kindly	NULL

sir	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
neither	NULL
pleased	NULL
nor	NULL
annoyed	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
Anthony	NULL
came	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
arms	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
likewise	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
gesture	NULL
,	NULL
sentimental	NULL
but	NULL
without	NULL
significance	NULL
.	NULL

Up	NULL
in	NULL
Rachael	NULL
's	NULL
long	NULL
front	NULL
room	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
fire	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
lamps	NULL
shaded	NULL
with	NULL
orange	NULL
silk	NULL
gave	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
corners	NULL
were	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
deep	NULL
and	NULL
somnolent	NULL
shadows	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hostess	NULL
,	NULL
moving	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dark-figured	NULL
gown	NULL
of	NULL
loose	NULL
chiffon	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
accentuate	NULL
the	NULL
already	NULL
sensuous	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
four	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
tasting	NULL
the	NULL
sandwiches	NULL
that	NULL
waited	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
tea	NULL
table	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
Gloria	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
alone	NULL
with	NULL
Captain	NULL
Collins	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
fireside	NULL
lounge	NULL
;	NULL
Rachael	NULL
and	NULL
Captain	NULL
Wolf	NULL
had	NULL
withdrawn	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
conversing	NULL
in	NULL
subdued	NULL
voices	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
n't	NULL
married	NULL

said	NULL
Collins	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
a	NULL
ludicrous	NULL
travesty	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
seriousness	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
held	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
glass	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
high-ball	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
drink	NULL

he	NULL
urged	NULL
her	NULL

frowning	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
not	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
'd	NULL

Gloria	NULL
caught	NULL
suddenly	NULL
the	NULL
intended	NULL
suggestion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
remark	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
attempting	NULL
to	NULL
create	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
laugh	NULL
--	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
realized	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
laugh	NULL
at	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
enjoying	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
home	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
it	NULL
hurt	NULL
her	NULL
pride	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
flirted	NULL
with	NULL
on	NULL
just	NULL
that	NULL
level	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Pour	NULL
me	NULL
another	NULL
drink	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
insisted	NULL

"	NULL
Please	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

do	NULL
n't	NULL

she	NULL
cried	NULL
in	NULL
exasperation	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Very	NULL
well	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
yielded	NULL
with	NULL
ill	NULL
grace	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL

again	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
're	NULL
awfully	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
aimless	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
sing	NULL
softly	NULL
,	NULL
wishing	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
her	NULL
eye	NULL
fell	NULL
on	NULL
an	NULL
intimate	NULL
scene	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
--	NULL
Rachael	NULL
and	NULL
Captain	NULL
Wolf	NULL
were	NULL
engrossed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
kiss	NULL
.	NULL

Gloria	NULL
shivered	NULL
slightly	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
why	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

Pink	NULL
face	NULL
approached	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
should	NULL
n't	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
whispered	NULL
.	NULL

Almost	NULL
immediately	NULL
his	NULL
other	NULL
arm	NULL
was	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
...	NULL
his	NULL
breath	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
cheek	NULL
.	NULL

Again	NULL
absurdity	NULL
triumphed	NULL
over	NULL
disgust	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
laugh	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
weapon	NULL
that	NULL
needed	NULL
no	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
sport	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
saying	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL

a	NULL

.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
kissing	NULL
you	NULL
generally	NULL
considered	NULL
a	NULL
joyful	NULL
affair	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
interrupted	NULL
as	NULL
Rachael	NULL
and	NULL
Captain	NULL
Wolf	NULL
appeared	NULL
suddenly	NULL
before	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

said	NULL
Rachael	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
flushed	NULL

her	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
dishevelled	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
'd	NULL
better	NULL
stay	NULL
here	NULL
all	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

For	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
Gloria	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
officers	NULL
were	NULL
being	NULL
dismissed	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
understood	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
understanding	NULL
,	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
as	NULL
casually	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
.	NULL

Uncomprehendingly	NULL
Rachael	NULL
continued	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
can	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
just	NULL
off	NULL

Collins	NULL

implored	NULL
her	NULL

GALLANTRY	NULL
In	NULL
February	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
experience	NULL
of	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
sort	NULL
.	NULL

Tudor	NULL
Baird	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
ancient	NULL
flame	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
whom	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
fully	NULL
intended	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Aviation	NULL
Corps	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
went	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
theatre	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
great	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

Quite	NULL
deliberately	NULL
she	NULL
brought	NULL
it	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
realizing	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
a	NULL
mischief	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
sitting	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
miserable	NULL
silence	NULL
whenever	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
Scroll	NULL
and	NULL
Keys	NULL
man	NULL
at	NULL
Yale	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
possessed	NULL
the	NULL
correct	NULL
reticences	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
good	NULL
egg	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
correct	NULL
notions	NULL
of	NULL
chivalry	NULL
and	NULL
_	NULL
noblesse	NULL
oblige	NULL
_	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
but	NULL
unfortunately	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
correct	NULL
biases	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
correct	NULL
lack	NULL
of	NULL
ideas	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
traits	NULL
which	NULL
Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
taught	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
despise	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
rather	NULL
admired	NULL
.	NULL

Unlike	NULL
the	NULL
majority	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
type	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
bore	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
handsome	NULL
,	NULL
witty	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
quality	NULL
he	NULL
possessed	NULL
--	NULL
call	NULL
it	NULL
stupidity	NULL
,	NULL
loyalty	NULL
,	NULL
sentimentality	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
something	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
as	NULL
definite	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
anything	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
power	NULL
to	NULL
please	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
this	NULL
among	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
correctly	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
ponderous	NULL
manliness	NULL
that	NULL
masked	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
suffering	NULL
.	NULL

Loving	NULL
him	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
grew	NULL
sorry	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
him	NULL
sentimentally	NULL
one	NULL
night	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
charming	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
relic	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
vanishing	NULL
generation	NULL
which	NULL
lived	NULL
a	NULL
priggish	NULL
and	NULL
graceful	NULL
illusion	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
replaced	NULL
by	NULL
less	NULL
gallant	NULL
fools	NULL
.	NULL

Afterward	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
kissed	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
plane	NULL
fell	NULL
fifteen	NULL
hundred	NULL
feet	NULL
at	NULL
Mineola	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
gasolene	NULL
engine	NULL
smashed	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL

GLORIA	NULL
ALONE	NULL
When	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Haight	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
trial	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
place	NULL
until	NULL
autumn	NULL
she	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
without	NULL
telling	NULL
Anthony	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
movies	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
successful	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
histrionically	NULL
and	NULL
financially	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
her	NULL
will	NULL
of	NULL
Joseph	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
,	NULL
yielding	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
return	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
lose	NULL
his	NULL
silly	NULL
prejudices	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
lay	NULL
awake	NULL
half	NULL
one	NULL
night	NULL
planning	NULL
her	NULL
career	NULL
and	NULL
enjoying	NULL
her	NULL
successes	NULL
in	NULL
anticipation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
she	NULL
called	NULL
up	NULL
"	NULL
Films	NULL
Par	NULL
Excellence	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
Europe	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
had	NULL
gripped	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
strongly	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
decided	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
the	NULL
rounds	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
moving	NULL
picture	NULL
employment	NULL
agencies	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
smell	NULL
worked	NULL
against	NULL
her	NULL
good	NULL
intentions	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
employment	NULL
agency	NULL
smelt	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
dead	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
waited	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
inspecting	NULL
her	NULL
unprepossessing	NULL
competitors	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
briskly	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
farthest	NULL
recesses	NULL
of	NULL
Central	NULL
Park	NULL
and	NULL
remained	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
caught	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
air	NULL
the	NULL
employment	NULL
agency	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
walking	NULL
suit	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
gather	NULL
from	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
letters	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
from	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
particular	NULL
but	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
culminative	NULL
effect	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
South	NULL
.	NULL

Curiously	NULL
repeated	NULL
excuses	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
haunt	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
very	NULL
insufficiency	NULL
occurred	NULL
with	NULL
Freudian	NULL
regularity	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
set	NULL
them	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
each	NULL
letter	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
feared	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL
them	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
desperately	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
impress	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
dilutions	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
letters	NULL
with	NULL
affectionate	NULL
diminutives	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
mechanical	NULL
and	NULL
unspontaneous	NULL
--	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
completed	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
literally	NULL
stuck	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
epigrams	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
Oscar	NULL
Wilde	NULL
play	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
jumped	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
solution	NULL
,	NULL
rejected	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL
and	NULL
depressed	NULL
by	NULL
turns	NULL
--	NULL
finally	NULL
she	NULL
shut	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
proudly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
allowed	NULL
an	NULL
increasing	NULL
coolness	NULL
to	NULL
creep	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
correspondence	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
late	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
to	NULL
occupy	NULL
her	NULL
attention	NULL
.	NULL

Several	NULL
aviators	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
through	NULL
Tudor	NULL
Baird	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
other	NULL
ancient	NULL
beaux	NULL
turned	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
stationed	NULL
at	NULL
Camp	NULL
Dix	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
these	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
ordered	NULL
overseas	NULL
they	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
,	NULL
handed	NULL
her	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
friends	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
after	NULL
another	NULL
rather	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
experience	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
potential	NULL
Captain	NULL
Collins	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
plain	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
introduced	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
under	NULL
no	NULL
misapprehensions	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
status	NULL
and	NULL
personal	NULL
intentions	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
summer	NULL
came	NULL
she	NULL
learned	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
watch	NULL
the	NULL
officers	NULL
'	NULL
casualty	NULL
list	NULL
,	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
melancholy	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
hearing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
danced	NULL
a	NULL
german	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
identifying	NULL
by	NULL
name	NULL
the	NULL
younger	NULL
brothers	NULL
of	NULL
former	NULL
suitors	NULL
--	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
drive	NULL
toward	NULL
Paris	NULL
progressed	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
here	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
went	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
to	NULL
inevitable	NULL
and	NULL
well-merited	NULL
destruction	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
twenty-seven	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
birthday	NULL
fled	NULL
by	NULL
scarcely	NULL
noticed	NULL
.	NULL

Years	NULL
before	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
frightened	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
became	NULL
twenty	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
extent	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
reached	NULL
twenty-six	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
glass	NULL
with	NULL
calm	NULL
self-approval	NULL
seeing	NULL
the	NULL
British	NULL
freshness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
complexion	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
figure	NULL
boyish	NULL
and	NULL
slim	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
tried	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
Anthony	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
writing	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
stranger	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
corporal	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
annoyed	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
politely	NULL
unimpressed	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
night	NULL
she	NULL
wept	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sorry	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
been	NULL
even	NULL
slightly	NULL
responsive	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
without	NULL
hesitation	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
train	NULL
--	NULL
whatever	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
he	NULL
needed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
care	NULL
of	NULL
spiritually	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
even	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

Recently	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
his	NULL
continual	NULL
drain	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
moral	NULL
strength	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
wonderfully	NULL
revived	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
inclined	NULL
through	NULL
sheer	NULL
association	NULL
to	NULL
brood	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
wasted	NULL
opportunities	NULL
--	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
normal	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
strong	NULL
,	NULL
disdainful	NULL
,	NULL
existing	NULL
each	NULL
day	NULL
for	NULL
each	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
worth	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
bought	NULL
a	NULL
doll	NULL
and	NULL
dressed	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
one	NULL
week	NULL
she	NULL
wept	NULL
over	NULL
"	NULL
Ethan	NULL
Frome	NULL
"	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
she	NULL
revelled	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
novels	NULL
of	NULL
Galsworthy	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
recreating	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
spring	NULL
in	NULL
darkness	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
illusion	NULL
of	NULL
young	NULL
romantic	NULL
love	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
women	NULL
look	NULL
forever	NULL
forward	NULL
and	NULL
forever	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
October	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
letters	NULL
multiplied	NULL
,	NULL
became	NULL
almost	NULL
frantic	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
suddenly	NULL
ceased	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
worried	NULL
month	NULL
it	NULL
needed	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
powers	NULL
of	NULL
control	NULL
to	NULL
refrain	NULL
from	NULL
leaving	NULL
immediately	NULL
for	NULL
Mississippi	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
a	NULL
telegram	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
expect	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
New	NULL

within	NULL
ten	NULL

Like	NULL
a	NULL
figure	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
ballroom	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
November	NULL
evening	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
through	NULL
long	NULL
hours	NULL
that	NULL
held	NULL
familiar	NULL
gladness	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
breast	NULL
,	NULL
nursing	NULL
an	NULL
illusion	NULL
of	NULL
happiness	NULL
and	NULL
security	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL

DISCOMFITURE	NULL
OF	NULL
THE	NULL
GENERALS	NULL
After	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
regiment	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Mississippi	NULL
camp	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
discharged	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
officers	NULL
shut	NULL
themselves	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
compartments	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Pullman	NULL
cars	NULL
and	NULL
drank	NULL
the	NULL
whiskey	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
in	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
coaches	NULL
the	NULL
soldiers	NULL
got	NULL
as	NULL
drunk	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
also	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
pretended	NULL
whenever	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
stopped	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
village	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
just	NULL
returned	NULL
from	NULL
France	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
practically	NULL
put	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
German	NULL
army	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
wore	NULL
overseas	NULL
caps	NULL
and	NULL
claimed	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
had	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
their	NULL
gold	NULL
service	NULL
stripes	NULL
sewed	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
yokelry	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
seaboard	NULL
were	NULL
much	NULL
impressed	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
them	NULL
how	NULL
they	NULL
liked	NULL
the	NULL
trenches	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
replied	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
_	NULL
boy	NULL
!	NULL

_	NULL
"	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
smacking	NULL
of	NULL
tongues	NULL
and	NULL
shaking	NULL
of	NULL
heads	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
one	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
chalk	NULL
and	NULL
scrawled	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
We	NULL
won	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
--	NULL
now	NULL
we	NULL
're	NULL
going	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
officers	NULL
laughed	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
it	NULL
stay	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
getting	NULL
what	NULL
swagger	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
ignominious	NULL
return	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
they	NULL
rumbled	NULL
on	NULL
toward	NULL
camp	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
was	NULL
uneasy	NULL
lest	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
find	NULL
Dot	NULL
awaiting	NULL
him	NULL
patiently	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
his	NULL
relief	NULL
he	NULL
neither	NULL
saw	NULL
nor	NULL
heard	NULL
anything	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
she	NULL
still	NULL
in	NULL
town	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
certainly	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
communicate	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
concluded	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
--	NULL
whither	NULL
he	NULL
neither	NULL
knew	NULL
nor	NULL
cared	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
Gloria	NULL
--	NULL
Gloria	NULL
reborn	NULL
and	NULL
wonderfully	NULL
alive	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
eventually	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
discharged	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
his	NULL
company	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
rear	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
truck	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
crowd	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
tolerant	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
sentimental	NULL
,	NULL
cheers	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
officers	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
for	NULL
Captain	NULL
Dunning	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
captain	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
addressed	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
tears	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
pleasure	NULL
,	NULL
etc.	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
etc.	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
time	NULL
not	NULL
wasted	NULL
,	NULL
etc.	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
etc	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
dull	NULL
and	NULL
human	NULL
;	NULL
having	NULL
given	NULL
ear	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
freshened	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
week	NULL
in	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
,	NULL
renewed	NULL
his	NULL
deep	NULL
loathing	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
military	NULL
profession	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
it	NULL
connoted	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
their	NULL
childish	NULL
hearts	NULL
two	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
every	NULL
three	NULL
professional	NULL
officers	NULL
considered	NULL
that	NULL
wars	NULL
were	NULL
made	NULL
for	NULL
armies	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
armies	NULL
for	NULL
wars	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
rejoiced	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
general	NULL
and	NULL
field-officers	NULL
riding	NULL
desolately	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
barren	NULL
camp	NULL
deprived	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
commands	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
rejoiced	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
company	NULL
laugh	NULL
scornfully	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
inducements	NULL
tendered	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
remain	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
army	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
attend	NULL
"	NULL
schools	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
these	NULL
"	NULL
schools	NULL
"	NULL
were	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
Gloria	NULL
in	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
.	NULL

ANOTHER	NULL
WINTER	NULL
Late	NULL
one	NULL
February	NULL
afternoon	NULL
Anthony	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
apartment	NULL
and	NULL
groping	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
pitch-dark	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
dusk	NULL
,	NULL
found	NULL
Gloria	NULL
sitting	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
did	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Haight	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
listlessly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Nothing	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
usual	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
month	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
closely	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
ear	NULL
attuned	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
caught	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
thickness	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dissyllable	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
've	NULL
been	NULL
drinking	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
remarked	NULL
dispassionately	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Couple	NULL
glasses	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
yawned	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
armchair	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
's	NULL
silence	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
demanded	NULL
suddenly	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Did	NULL
you	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Haight	NULL
?	NULL

Tell	NULL
me	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
smiled	NULL
weakly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
As	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
time	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
go	NULL

.	NULL

He	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
damn	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL
sick	NULL
of	NULL
waiting	NULL
around	NULL
his	NULL
office	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
'd	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
_	NULL
me	NULL
_	NULL
a	NULL
favor	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
Gloria	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
expecting	NULL
moral	NULL
support	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
contemplation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dubious	NULL
and	NULL
unprepossessing	NULL
out-of-doors	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
feel	NULL
rather	NULL
weary	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
to-day	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
offered	NULL
tentatively	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
met	NULL
a	NULL
fellow	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
talked	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Biltmore	NULL
bar	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
dusk	NULL
had	NULL
suddenly	NULL
deepened	NULL
but	NULL
neither	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
made	NULL
any	NULL
move	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
lights	NULL
.	NULL

Lost	NULL
in	NULL
heaven	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
contemplation	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
sat	NULL
there	NULL
until	NULL
a	NULL
flurry	NULL
of	NULL
snow	NULL
drew	NULL
a	NULL
languid	NULL
sigh	NULL
from	NULL
Gloria	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
've	NULL
you	NULL
been	NULL
doing	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
,	NULL
finding	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
oppressive	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Reading	NULL
a	NULL
magazine	NULL

And	NULL
while	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
reading	NULL
it	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL

nothing	NULL

how	NULL

Her	NULL
voice	NULL
coming	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
held	NULL

implication	NULL

in	NULL

"	NULL
Because	NULL

In	NULL
an	NULL

They	NULL
faced	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
idiotically	NULL

each	NULL

them	NULL

them	NULL
tremendously	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bedroom	NULL

shut	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
return	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
foreground	NULL
all	NULL
their	NULL
pre-bellum	NULL
exasperations	NULL

Prices	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
alarmingly	NULL

in	NULL
perverse	NULL
ratio	NULL

income	NULL
had	NULL
shrunk	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
over	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL

the	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
signed	NULL
it	NULL

Inevitably	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
necessity	NULL

increased	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
themselves	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL

The	NULL

resorted	NULL

down	NULL

engagement	NULL
every	NULL

the	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
doorway	NULL

After	NULL
that	NULL

each	NULL

returned	NULL

Anthony	NULL
had	NULL
again	NULL

the	NULL

again	NULL

At	NULL
her	NULL

he	NULL
went	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
o'clock	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
appointed	NULL
address	NULL

where	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
one	NULL

a	NULL
dense	NULL
miscellany	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
waiting	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
ranged	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
messenger-boy	NULL
evidently	NULL
misusing	NULL
his	NULL
company	NULL
's	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
immemorial	NULL
individual	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
gnarled	NULL
body	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
gnarled	NULL
cane	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
seedy	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
sunken	NULL
cheeks	NULL
and	NULL
puffy	NULL
pink	NULL
eyes	NULL
--	NULL
others	NULL
were	NULL
young	NULL
;	NULL
possibly	NULL
still	NULL
in	NULL
high	NULL
school	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
jostled	NULL
fifteen	NULL
minutes	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
eyed	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
with	NULL
apathetic	NULL
suspicion	NULL
there	NULL
appeared	NULL
a	NULL
smart	NULL
young	NULL
shepherd	NULL
clad	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
waist-line	NULL
"	NULL
suit	NULL
and	NULL
wearing	NULL
the	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
assistant	NULL
rector	NULL
who	NULL
herded	NULL
them	NULL
up-stairs	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
resembled	NULL
a	NULL
school-room	NULL
and	NULL
contained	NULL
innumerable	NULL
desks	NULL

Here	NULL
the	NULL
prospective	NULL

sat	NULL
down	NULL

again	NULL

After	NULL
an	NULL
interval	NULL
a	NULL
platform	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
was	NULL
clouded	NULL
with	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL

sober	NULL

sprightly	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
exception	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
seats	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
semicircle	NULL
facing	NULL
the	NULL
audience	NULL

The	NULL
exception	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
seemed	NULL
the	NULL
soberest	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
sprightly	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
youngest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lot	NULL

and	NULL
who	NULL
advanced	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
platform	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
audience	NULL
scrutinized	NULL
him	NULL
hopefully	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
small	NULL
and	NULL
rather	NULL
pretty	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
commercial	NULL
rather	NULL

the	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
straight	NULL
blond	NULL

eyes	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
almost	NULL
preposterously	NULL

and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL

his	NULL
rostrum	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
these	NULL
eyes	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
audience	NULL
,	NULL
simultaneously	NULL
extending	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
fingers	NULL
outstretched	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
rocked	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
balance	NULL
an	NULL
expectant	NULL
silence	NULL
settled	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
perfect	NULL
assurance	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
his	NULL
listeners	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
were	NULL
steady	NULL

began	NULL

and	NULL
paused	NULL

The	NULL
word	NULL
died	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
prolonged	NULL
echo	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL

the	NULL

hopefully	NULL

cynically	NULL

alike	NULL
arrested	NULL

engrossed	NULL

Six	NULL
hundred	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
turned	NULL
slightly	NULL
upward	NULL

With	NULL
an	NULL
even	NULL
graceless	NULL
flow	NULL
that	NULL
reminded	NULL
Anthony	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rolling	NULL

bowling	NULL

launched	NULL

As	NULL
Mr.	NULL

piled	NULL

assertion	NULL
Anthony	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
disgusted	NULL
confidence	NULL

him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
man	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
about	NULL

Obviously	NULL
prosperous	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
of	NULL
instructing	NULL

It	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
occur	NULL

Anthony	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

generally	NULL

Anthony	NULL
noted	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

old	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
answered	NULL
the	NULL

that	NULL
among	NULL

assembled	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

get	NULL

from	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carleton	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
gray	NULL

was	NULL
in	NULL
evidence	NULL

These	NULL
thirty	NULL
were	NULL
eager	NULL
converts	NULL

with	NULL
their	NULL

they	NULL
followed	NULL
the	NULL
working	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Carleton	NULL
's	NULL

;	NULL
they	NULL
swayed	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL

with	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
intervals	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL

they	NULL
spoke	NULL

each	NULL

.	NULL

Yet	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chosen	NULL

who	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carleton	NULL

"	NULL
were	NULL
determined	NULL

"	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL

combined	NULL
even	NULL
a	NULL
modicum	NULL

with	NULL
that	NULL
great	NULL
gift	NULL

being	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL

But	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
told	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
natural	NULL
pushers	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
merely	NULL
necessary	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
believe	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
savage	NULL
passion	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
selling	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
even	NULL
urged	NULL
each	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
some	NULL
stock	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
increase	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
sincerity	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
fifth	NULL
day	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
sallied	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
sensations	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
wanted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
police	NULL
.	NULL

Acting	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
instructions	NULL
he	NULL
selected	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
office	NULL
building	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
ride	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
story	NULL
and	NULL
work	NULL
downward	NULL
,	NULL
stopping	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
office	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
name	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
minute	NULL
he	NULL
hesitated	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
practicable	NULL
to	NULL
acclimate	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
chilly	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
was	NULL
awaiting	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
trying	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
offices	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
Madison	NULL
Avenue	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
an	NULL
arcade	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
only	NULL
semi-prosperous	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seeing	NULL
a	NULL
sign	NULL
which	NULL
read	NULL
Percy	NULL
B.	NULL
Weatherbee	NULL
,	NULL
Architect	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
heroically	NULL
and	NULL
entered	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
starchy	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
questioningly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Can	NULL

Weatherbee	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
sounded	NULL
tremulous	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
laid	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
tentatively	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
telephone-receiver	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL

should	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
sounded	NULL
so	NULL
simple	NULL
when	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Carleton	NULL
had	NULL
enjoined	NULL
his	NULL
flock	NULL

The	NULL

succumbed	NULL

in	NULL

admitted	NULL

approached	NULL

with	NULL
ill-concealed	NULL
impatience	NULL

harassed	NULL

contemptuous	NULL
stare	NULL

For	NULL

he	NULL
struggled	NULL
on	NULL

increasingly	NULL
sensitive	NULL

entangled	NULL

retching	NULL

He	NULL
whipped	NULL
about	NULL

strode	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
private	NULL
office	NULL
,	NULL
banging	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL

Not	NULL
daring	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
stenographer	NULL

Anthony	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
shameful	NULL
and	NULL
mysterious	NULL
way	NULL
got	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Perspiring	NULL
profusely	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
wondering	NULL
why	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
arrest	NULL
him	NULL

in	NULL
every	NULL
hurried	NULL

he	NULL
discerned	NULL
infallibly	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
of	NULL
scorn	NULL

After	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
help	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
strong	NULL
whiskies	NULL
he	NULL
brought	NULL
himself	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
another	NULL
attempt	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
plumber	NULL
's	NULL
shop	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
mentioned	NULL
his	NULL
business	NULL
the	NULL
plumber	NULL
began	NULL
pulling	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
coat	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
hurry	NULL
,	NULL
gruffly	NULL
announcing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
lunch	NULL

Anthony	NULL
remarked	NULL
politely	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
futile	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL

sell	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
anything	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
hungry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
plumber	NULL
heartily	NULL
agreed	NULL

This	NULL
episode	NULL
encouraged	NULL
Anthony	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL

the	NULL
plumber	NULL
not	NULL

bound	NULL
for	NULL

would	NULL

Passing	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL

formidable	NULL
bazaars	NULL
he	NULL
entered	NULL
a	NULL
grocery	NULL
store	NULL

A	NULL

told	NULL
him	NULL

in	NULL
that	NULL
state	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
ludicrously	NULL
easy	NULL
game	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
brought	NULL
down	NULL
merely	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
judicious	NULL
application	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
correct	NULL
selling	NULL
points	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
these	NULL
men	NULL
--	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
actually	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
n't	NULL
considering	NULL
buying	NULL
anything	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
took	NULL
several	NULL
more	NULL
drinks	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
approached	NULL
his	NULL
fourth	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
real-estate	NULL
agent	NULL
;	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
floored	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
coup	NULL
as	NULL
decisive	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
syllogism	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
real-estate	NULL
agent	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
three	NULL
brothers	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
investment	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL

Viewing	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
breaker-up	NULL
of	NULL
homes	NULL
Anthony	NULL
apologized	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
another	NULL
drink	NULL
he	NULL
conceived	NULL
the	NULL
brilliant	NULL
plan	NULL
of	NULL
selling	NULL
the	NULL
stock	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bartenders	NULL
along	NULL
Lexington	NULL
Avenue	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
occupied	NULL
several	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
drinks	NULL
in	NULL
each	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
proprietor	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
proper	NULL
frame	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
bartenders	NULL
one	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
contended	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
bonds	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
bartenders	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
convened	NULL
and	NULL
decided	NULL
upon	NULL
that	NULL
rejoinder	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
approached	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
soggy	NULL
five	NULL
o'clock	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
developing	NULL
a	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
annoying	NULL
tendency	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
him	NULL
off	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
jest	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
five	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
tremendous	NULL
effort	NULL
at	NULL
concentration	NULL
he	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
put	NULL
more	NULL
variety	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
canvassing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
selected	NULL
a	NULL
medium-sized	NULL
delicatessen	NULL
store	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
,	NULL
illuminatingly	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
cast	NULL
a	NULL
spell	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
storekeeper	NULL
but	NULL
over	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
customers	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
psychology	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
herd	NULL
instinct	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
buy	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
astounded	NULL
and	NULL
immediately	NULL
convinced	NULL
whole	NULL
.	NULL

loud	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
wanted	NULL

he	NULL
obtained	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
awe	NULL
descended	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
half-dozen	NULL
women	NULL
marketing	NULL
and	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
gray-haired	NULL
ancient	NULL
who	NULL
in	NULL
cap	NULL
and	NULL
apron	NULL
was	NULL
slicing	NULL

Anthony	NULL
pulled	NULL
a	NULL
batch	NULL
of	NULL
papers	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
flapping	NULL
briefcase	NULL
and	NULL
waved	NULL
them	NULL
cheerfully	NULL

suggested	NULL

His	NULL

made	NULL
a	NULL

skipped	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL

he	NULL

With	NULL
this	NULL
Anthony	NULL
turned	NULL

bowed	NULL
gravely	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
late	NULL
auditors	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wabbled	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
taxicab	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
and	NULL
rode	NULL
home	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
apartment	NULL

There	NULL
he	NULL
fell	NULL
sound	NULL
asleep	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL

and	NULL
so	NULL
Gloria	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
breath	NULL
filling	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
pungency	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
still	NULL
clutching	NULL
his	NULL
open	NULL
brief	NULL
case	NULL

Except	NULL
when	NULL
Anthony	NULL
was	NULL
drinking	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
range	NULL
of	NULL
sensation	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
healthy	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
prohibition	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
July	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
among	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
afford	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
drinking	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
's	NULL
host	NULL
now	NULL
brought	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
bottle	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
pretext	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
tendency	NULL
to	NULL
display	NULL
liquor	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
manifestation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
instinct	NULL
that	NULL
led	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
deck	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
with	NULL
jewels	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
have	NULL
liquor	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
boast	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
a	NULL
badge	NULL
of	NULL
respectability	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
mornings	NULL
Anthony	NULL
awoke	NULL
tired	NULL
,	NULL
nervous	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
worried	NULL
.	NULL

Halcyon	NULL
summer	NULL
twilights	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
purple	NULL
chill	NULL
of	NULL
morning	NULL
alike	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
unresponsive	NULL
.	NULL

Only	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
brief	NULL
moment	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
warmth	NULL
and	NULL
renewed	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
first	NULL
high-ball	NULL
did	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
turn	NULL
to	NULL
those	NULL
opalescent	NULL
dreams	NULL
of	NULL
future	NULL
pleasure	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
mutual	NULL
heritage	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
happy	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
damned	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
drunker	NULL
the	NULL
dreams	NULL
faded	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
confused	NULL
spectre	NULL
,	NULL
moving	NULL
in	NULL
odd	NULL
crannies	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
unexpected	NULL
devices	NULL
,	NULL
harshly	NULL
contemptuous	NULL
at	NULL
best	NULL
and	NULL
reaching	NULL
sodden	NULL
and	NULL
dispirited	NULL
depths	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
night	NULL
in	NULL
June	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
quarrelled	NULL
violently	NULL
with	NULL
Maury	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
triviality	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
dimly	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
broken	NULL
pint	NULL
bottle	NULL
of	NULL
champagne	NULL
.	NULL

Maury	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
sober	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
feelings	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
hurt	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
attempted	NULL
gesture	NULL
of	NULL
dignity	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
and	NULL
seizing	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
arm	NULL
half	NULL
led	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
shamed	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
taxicab	NULL
outside	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
Maury	NULL
with	NULL
three	NULL
dinners	NULL
ordered	NULL
and	NULL
tickets	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
opera	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
semi-tragic	NULL
fiasco	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
so	NULL
usual	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
occurred	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
stirred	NULL
into	NULL
making	NULL
amends	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Gloria	NULL
protested	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
sink	NULL
into	NULL
contemptuous	NULL
silence	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
either	NULL
engage	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
bitter	NULL
defense	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
or	NULL
else	NULL
stalk	NULL
dismally	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
apartment	NULL
.	NULL

Never	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
incident	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
platform	NULL
at	NULL
Redgate	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
laid	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
anger	NULL
--	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
withheld	NULL
often	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
instinct	NULL
that	NULL
itself	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
tremble	NULL
with	NULL
rage	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
still	NULL
cared	NULL
more	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
than	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
creature	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
more	NULL
intensely	NULL
and	NULL
frequently	NULL
hate	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
judges	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Appellate	NULL
Division	NULL
had	NULL
failed	NULL
to	NULL
hand	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
decision	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
after	NULL
another	NULL
postponement	NULL
they	NULL
finally	NULL
affirmed	NULL
the	NULL
decree	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
court	NULL
--	NULL
two	NULL
justices	NULL
dissenting	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
appeal	NULL
was	NULL
served	NULL
upon	NULL
Edward	NULL
Shuttleworth	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
case	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
court	NULL
of	NULL
last	NULL
resort	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
for	NULL
another	NULL
interminable	NULL
wait	NULL
.	NULL

Six	NULL
months	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
enormously	NULL
unreal	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
remote	NULL
and	NULL
uncertain	NULL
as	NULL
heaven	NULL
.	NULL

Throughout	NULL
the	NULL
previous	NULL
winter	NULL
one	NULL
small	NULL
matter	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
subtle	NULL
and	NULL
omnipresent	NULL
irritant	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
gray	NULL
fur	NULL
coat	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
women	NULL
enveloped	NULL
in	NULL
long	NULL
squirrel	NULL
wraps	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
every	NULL
few	NULL
yards	NULL
along	NULL
Fifth	NULL
Avenue	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
women	NULL
were	NULL
converted	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
shape	NULL
of	NULL
tops	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
seemed	NULL
porcine	NULL
and	NULL
obscene	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
resembled	NULL
kept	NULL
women	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
concealing	NULL
richness	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
feminine	NULL
animality	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
garment	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
--	NULL
Gloria	NULL
wanted	NULL
a	NULL
gray	NULL
squirrel	NULL
coat	NULL
.	NULL

Discussing	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
,	NULL
arguing	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
even	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
year	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
marriage	NULL
did	NULL
every	NULL
discussion	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
bitter	NULL
debate	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
phrases	NULL
as	NULL
"	NULL
most	NULL
certainly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
"	NULL
utterly	NULL
outrageous	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
"	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
ultra-emphatic	NULL
"	NULL
regardless	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
they	NULL
concluded	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
afford	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
so	NULL
gradually	NULL
it	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
symbol	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
growing	NULL
financial	NULL
anxiety	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
Gloria	NULL
the	NULL
shrinkage	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
income	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
remarkable	NULL
phenomenon	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
explanation	NULL
or	NULL
precedent	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
happen	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
space	NULL
of	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
seemed	NULL
almost	NULL
an	NULL
intended	NULL
cruelty	NULL
,	NULL
conceived	NULL
and	NULL
executed	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
sardonic	NULL
God	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
married	NULL
seventy-five	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
ample	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
couple	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
when	NULL
augmented	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
expectation	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
millions	NULL

had	NULL
failed	NULL
to	NULL
realize	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
decreasing	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
amount	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
purchasing	NULL
power	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
payment	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Haight	NULL
's	NULL
retaining	NULL
fee	NULL
of	NULL
fifteen	NULL
thousand	NULL
dollars	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
suddenly	NULL
and	NULL
startlingly	NULL
obvious	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Anthony	NULL
was	NULL
drafted	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
calculated	NULL
their	NULL
income	NULL
at	NULL
over	NULL
four	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
dollar	NULL
even	NULL
then	NULL
decreasing	NULL
in	NULL
value	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
they	NULL
discovered	NULL
an	NULL
even	NULL
more	NULL
alarming	NULL
condition	NULL
of	NULL
affairs	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
receiving	NULL
only	NULL
forty-five	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
investments	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
suit	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
will	NULL
moved	NULL
ahead	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
persistent	NULL
mirage	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
financial	NULL
danger-mark	NULL
loomed	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
near	NULL
distance	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
,	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
living	NULL
within	NULL
their	NULL
income	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
Gloria	NULL
went	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
squirrel	NULL
coat	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
upon	NULL
Fifth	NULL
Avenue	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
well-worn	NULL
,	NULL
half-length	NULL
leopard	NULL
skin	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
hopelessly	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
other	NULL
month	NULL
they	NULL
sold	NULL
a	NULL
bond	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
bills	NULL
were	NULL
paid	NULL
it	NULL
left	NULL
only	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
gulped	NULL
down	NULL
hungrily	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
current	NULL
expenses	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
calculations	NULL
showed	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
capital	NULL
would	NULL
last	NULL
about	NULL
seven	NULL
years	NULL
longer	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
bitter	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
prolonged	NULL
hysterical	NULL
party	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
Anthony	NULL
whimsically	NULL
divested	NULL
himself	NULL
of	NULL
coat	NULL
,	NULL
vest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shirt	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
theatre	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
assisted	NULL
out	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
posse	NULL
of	NULL
ushers	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
spent	NULL
twice	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
squirrel	NULL
coat	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
cost	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
November	NULL
,	NULL
Indian	NULL
summer	NULL
rather	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
warm	NULL
,	NULL
warm	NULL
night	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
unnecessary	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

Babe	NULL
Ruth	NULL
had	NULL
smashed	NULL
the	NULL
home-run	NULL
record	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
Jack	NULL
Dempsey	NULL
had	NULL
broken	NULL
Jess	NULL
Willard	NULL
's	NULL
cheek-bone	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
Ohio	NULL
.	NULL

Over	NULL
in	NULL
Europe	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
children	NULL
had	NULL
swollen	NULL
stomachs	NULL
from	NULL
starvation	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
diplomats	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
customary	NULL
business	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
safe	NULL
for	NULL
new	NULL

In	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
odds	NULL
on	NULL
Harvard	NULL
were	NULL
generally	NULL
quoted	NULL
at	NULL
five	NULL
to	NULL

Peace	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
earnest	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
new	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

Up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bedroom	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
apartment	NULL
on	NULL
Fifty-seventh	NULL
Street	NULL
Gloria	NULL
lay	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
tossed	NULL
from	NULL
side	NULL
to	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
intervals	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
off	NULL
a	NULL
superfluous	NULL
cover	NULL
and	NULL
once	NULL
asking	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
awake	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL

ice-water	NULL

"	NULL
Be	NULL
sure	NULL

she	NULL

Looking	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL

moon	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL

watching	NULL
the	NULL

her	NULL
mind	NULL
worked	NULL
over	NULL
an	NULL
emotion	NULL

rather	NULL
an	NULL
interwoven	NULL

emotions	NULL

back	NULL

the	NULL

remember	NULL

anything	NULL

Anthony	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
army	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
twenty-nine	NULL
in	NULL
February	NULL

The	NULL
month	NULL
assumed	NULL
an	NULL
ominous	NULL
and	NULL
inescapable	NULL
significance	NULL
--	NULL
making	NULL
her	NULL
wonder	NULL

through	NULL
these	NULL
nebulous	NULL
half-fevered	NULL
hours	NULL
whether	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL

not	NULL

Years	NULL
before	NULL

when	NULL
she	NULL

twenty-one	NULL

now	NULL

all	NULL
this	NULL
November	NULL

this	NULL
desolate	NULL
day	NULL

under	NULL

white	NULL
,	NULL
Gloria	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
wrong	NULL

To	NULL
preserve	NULL
the	NULL
integrity	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
gift	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
for	NULL
love	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
flame	NULL
and	NULL
ecstasy	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
dim	NULL
,	NULL
sunk	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
departed	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL

preserving	NULL
--	NULL
what	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
puzzled	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
knew	NULL
just	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
preserving	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
sentimental	NULL
memory	NULL
or	NULL
some	NULL
profound	NULL
and	NULL
fundamental	NULL
concept	NULL
of	NULL
honor	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
doubting	NULL
now	NULL
whether	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
any	NULL
moral	NULL
issue	NULL
involved	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL

walk	NULL
unworried	NULL

unregretful	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
gayest	NULL

all	NULL

keep	NULL
her	NULL
pride	NULL
by	NULL
being	NULL
always	NULL
herself	NULL

doing	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
beautiful	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
do	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
little	NULL
boy	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
Eton	NULL
collar	NULL
whose	NULL
"	NULL
girl	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL

down	NULL

the	NULL

casual	NULL
man	NULL

grown	NULL
alert	NULL

appreciative	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
rested	NULL
upon	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
needed	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
matchless	NULL
candor	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
throw	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL

clothe	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
inconsequent	NULL
clause	NULL

weave	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
immeasurable	NULL

To	NULL
create	NULL
souls	NULL
in	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
create	NULL
fine	NULL
happiness	NULL

fine	NULL
despair	NULL

remain	NULL
deeply	NULL

proud	NULL
also	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
melting	NULL

to	NULL
be	NULL
passionate	NULL
and	NULL
possessed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
breast	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
wanted	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
reality	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
earthiness	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
intolerable	NULL
sentiment	NULL
of	NULL
child-bearing	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
menace	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
beauty	NULL
--	NULL
had	NULL
appalled	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
exist	NULL
only	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
conscious	NULL
flower	NULL
,	NULL
prolonging	NULL
and	NULL
preserving	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
sentimentality	NULL
could	NULL
cling	NULL
fiercely	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
illusions	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
ironic	NULL
soul	NULL
whispered	NULL
that	NULL
motherhood	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
the	NULL
privilege	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
female	NULL
baboon	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
her	NULL
dreams	NULL
were	NULL
of	NULL
ghostly	NULL
children	NULL
only	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
perfect	NULL
symbols	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
early	NULL
and	NULL
perfect	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
Anthony	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
beauty	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
never	NULL
failed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
beauty	NULL
like	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
it	NULL
meant	NULL
ethically	NULL
or	NULL
aesthetically	NULL
faded	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
gorgeous	NULL
concreteness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
pink-and-white	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
clean	NULL
perfectness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
body	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
mouth	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
material	NULL
symbol	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
kiss	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
twenty-nine	NULL
in	NULL
February	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
night	NULL
waned	NULL
she	NULL
grew	NULL
supremely	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
beauty	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
next	NULL
three	NULL
months	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sure	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
problem	NULL
resolved	NULL
itself	NULL
gradually	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lure	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
screen	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
earnest	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
material	NULL
want	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
moved	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
fear	NULL
moved	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
matter	NULL
for	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
in	NULL
spirit	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
weak	NULL
and	NULL
broken	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
bloodshot	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
still	NULL
had	NULL
moments	NULL
of	NULL
tenderness	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
twenty-nine	NULL
in	NULL
February	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
days	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
the	NULL
decision	NULL
came	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
cheered	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
manner	NULL
the	NULL
illusion	NULL
of	NULL
beauty	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
sustained	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
preserved	NULL
perhaps	NULL
in	NULL
celluloid	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
reality	NULL
had	NULL
vanished	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
--	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
weak	NULL
and	NULL
ill	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saved	NULL
herself	NULL
from	NULL
collapse	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
clinging	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
mail	NULL
box	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Martinique	NULL
elevator	NULL
boy	NULL
helped	NULL
her	NULL
up-stairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
waited	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
for	NULL
Anthony	NULL
's	NULL
return	NULL
without	NULL
energy	NULL
to	NULL
unhook	NULL
her	NULL
brassiere	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
five	NULL
days	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
influenza	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
month	NULL
turned	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
into	NULL
winter	NULL
,	NULL
ripened	NULL
into	NULL
double	NULL
pneumonia	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
feverish	NULL
perambulations	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
she	NULL
prowled	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
of	NULL
bleak	NULL
unlighted	NULL
rooms	NULL
hunting	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
efficiently	NULL
taken	NULL
care	NULL
of	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
yielding	NULL
yet	NULL
superior	NULL
power	NULL
,	NULL
stupider	NULL
and	NULL
steadier	NULL
than	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
lover	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
wanted	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lover	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL

One	NULL

the	NULL

of	NULL

been	NULL
three	NULL

he	NULL

she	NULL
demanded	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
arrogance	NULL
peculiar	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
beautiful	NULL
women	NULL

to	NULL
all	NULL
women	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
ever	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL

considered	NULL
themselves	NULL

He	NULL
assured	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
merely	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
the	NULL

Well	NULL

he	NULL
'd	NULL
phone	NULL
later	NULL

let	NULL
her	NULL
know	NULL
a	NULL

The	NULL
conversation	NULL
closed	NULL
with	NULL

on	NULL
both	NULL

Then	NULL
from	NULL
three	NULL

five	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
close	NULL

with	NULL

that	NULL

THE	NULL
TEST	NULL
As	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
set	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
wooden	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
closed	NULL
it	NULL
carefully	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
inconveniently	NULL
dissatisfied	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
clothes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
bought	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
misses	NULL
'	NULL
"	NULL
dress	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
still	NULL
wear	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
investment	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
accentuated	NULL
her	NULL
airy	NULL
youth	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
mind	NULL
snapped	NULL
sharply	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
momentous	NULL
present	NULL
as	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Debris	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
glare	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
lights	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
look	NULL
around	NULL

you	NULL

curious	NULL

....	NULL
"	NULL
She	NULL
became	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
regular	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
camera	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
worried	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
glanced	NULL
toward	NULL
it	NULL
involuntarily	NULL
and	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
correctly	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
definite	NULL
effort	NULL
she	NULL
forced	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
act	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
gestures	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
body	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
banal	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
awkward	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
bereft	NULL
of	NULL
grace	NULL
or	NULL
distinction	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
strolled	NULL
around	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
,	NULL
picking	NULL
up	NULL
articles	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
and	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
inanely	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
scrutinized	NULL
the	NULL
ceiling	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
inspected	NULL
an	NULL
inconsequential	NULL
lead	NULL
pencil	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
desk	NULL
.	NULL

Finally	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
else	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
express	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
forced	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL

She	NULL
hesitated	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
picked	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
receiver	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Hello	NULL

Her	NULL
voice	NULL
was	NULL
hollow	NULL
and	NULL
unreal	NULL

The	NULL
words	NULL
rang	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
empty	NULL

like	NULL
the	NULL
ineffectualities	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
ghost	NULL

The	NULL

Gloria	NULL

She	NULL
obeyed	NULL

clung	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
wide	NULL

staring	NULL

At	NULL

her	NULL
confidence	NULL
increased	NULL

Now	NULL

She	NULL
collapsed	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
knees	NULL
and	NULL
throwing	NULL
her	NULL
body	NULL
outward	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL

Gloria	NULL
arose	NULL

mustering	NULL
her	NULL
dignity	NULL
and	NULL
brushing	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
skirt	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Awful	NULL

"	NULL

she	NULL
remarked	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
cool	NULL
laugh	NULL

her	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
bumping	NULL
tumultuously	NULL

Mr.	NULL

"	NULL
Of	NULL
course	NULL

she	NULL
agreed	NULL

trying	NULL
to	NULL
attach	NULL
some	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
meaning	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
remark	NULL

and	NULL
failing	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
been	NULL
trying	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
encourage	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
moments	NULL
later	NULL
she	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
studio	NULL
.	NULL

Bloeckman	NULL
had	NULL
promised	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
test	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

Too	NULL
proud	NULL
to	NULL
force	NULL
any	NULL
definite	NULL
comment	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
baffling	NULL
uncertainty	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
now	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
step	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
been	NULL
taken	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
realize	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
successful	NULL
screen	NULL
career	NULL
had	NULL
played	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
night	NULL
she	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
the	NULL
elements	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
decide	NULL
for	NULL
or	NULL
against	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Whether	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
used	NULL
enough	NULL
make-up	NULL
worried	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
of	NULL
twenty	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
too	NULL
grave	NULL
.	NULL

About	NULL
her	NULL
acting	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
least	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
satisfied	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
entrance	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
abominable	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
not	NULL
until	NULL
she	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
phone	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
displayed	NULL
a	NULL
shred	NULL
of	NULL
poise	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
test	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
realized	NULL
!	NULL

She	NULL
wished	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
try	NULL
it	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
mad	NULL
plan	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
and	NULL
ask	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
trial	NULL
took	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
suddenly	NULL
faded	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
neither	NULL
politic	NULL
nor	NULL
polite	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
another	NULL
favor	NULL
of	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
third	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
waiting	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
highly	NULL
nervous	NULL
condition	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
bitten	NULL
the	NULL
insides	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
until	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
raw	NULL
and	NULL
smarting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
burnt	NULL
unbearably	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
washed	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
listerine	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
quarrelled	NULL
so	NULL
persistently	NULL
with	NULL
Anthony	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
apartment	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
fury	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
intimidated	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
exceptional	NULL
frigidity	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
up	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
afterward	NULL
,	NULL
apologized	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
having	NULL
dinner	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Amsterdam	NULL
Club	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
still	NULL
retained	NULL
membership	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
after	NULL
one	NULL
o'clock	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
breakfasted	NULL
at	NULL
eleven	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
deciding	NULL
to	NULL
forego	NULL
luncheon	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
started	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
walk	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Park	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
three	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
mail	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
back	NULL
by	NULL
three	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
afternoon	NULL
of	NULL
premature	NULL
spring	NULL

Water	NULL
was	NULL
drying	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
walks	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Park	NULL
little	NULL
girls	NULL
were	NULL
gravely	NULL
wheeling	NULL
white	NULL
doll-buggies	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
thin	NULL
trees	NULL
while	NULL
behind	NULL
them	NULL
followed	NULL
bored	NULL
nursery-maids	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL

Two	NULL
o'clock	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
should	NULL

a	NULL
platinum	NULL

The	NULL
nursery-maids	NULL
chattering	NULL
in	NULL
pairs	NULL
about	NULL
their	NULL
inscrutable	NULL

Here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
a	NULL
raggedy	NULL
man	NULL
seated	NULL
upon	NULL
newspapers	NULL
spread	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
drying	NULL
bench	NULL

related	NULL
not	NULL

the	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL

that	NULL
slept	NULL

in	NULL
obscure	NULL
corners	NULL

Ages	NULL
later	NULL

coming	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL

hall	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL

"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL

The	NULL
switchboard	NULL
squawked	NULL
abominably	NULL
and	NULL
Gloria	NULL
waited	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
ministered	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
telephone	NULL

She	NULL
sickened	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
elevator	NULL
groaned	NULL
its	NULL
way	NULL
up	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
floors	NULL
passed	NULL

Desolately	NULL
Gloria	NULL
raised	NULL
her	NULL
glance	NULL
until	NULL
it	NULL
fell	NULL
out	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
areaway	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
opposite	NULL
wall	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
gray	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
walked	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bedroom	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
crinkled	NULL
tightly	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sank	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
knees	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
mirror	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
wardrobe	NULL
floor	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
twenty-ninth	NULL
birthday	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
melting	NULL
away	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
make-up	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
emotions	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
profound	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
overwhelming	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
consolation	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
conveyed	NULL

She	NULL
strained	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
until	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
feel	NULL
the	NULL
flesh	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
temples	NULL
pull	NULL
forward	NULL

Yes	NULL

the	NULL
cheeks	NULL
were	NULL
ever	NULL
so	NULL
faintly	NULL
thin	NULL

the	NULL
corners	NULL

lined	NULL

suddenly	NULL

it	NULL

The	NULL
last	NULL

he	NULL

recollected	NULL

that	NULL

this	NULL
quickly	NULL

That	NULL

what	NULL

you	NULL

she	NULL

triumphantly	NULL

Of	NULL

it	NULL

The	NULL

sat	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

looked	NULL
at	NULL

She	NULL

back	NULL

out	NULL
the	NULL
lamp	NULL

leaning	NULL
her	NULL
elbows	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL

looked	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
Palisades	NULL
Park	NULL

where	NULL
the	NULL
brilliant	NULL
revolving	NULL
circle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Ferris	NULL

was	NULL
like	NULL

trembling	NULL
mirror	NULL
catching	NULL
the	NULL

over	NULL

at	NULL
dinner	NULL

Pointlessly	NULL
,	NULL
ridiculously	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
rose	NULL

walked	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
;	NULL
seen	NULL
thus	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
appeared	NULL
incongruous	NULL

carelessly	NULL

to	NULL
no	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
eight	NULL
o'clock	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
pleased	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
afternoon	NULL

in	NULL
walking	NULL
along	NULL
that	NULL
Broadway	NULL

One	NULL

Twenty-fifth	NULL
Street	NULL

with	NULL
her	NULL

her	NULL
mind	NULL
excited	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL

beauty	NULL

some	NULL
Italian	NULL
children	NULL

It	NULL
affected	NULL
her	NULL
curiously	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
Fifth	NULL
Avenue	NULL

affected	NULL
her	NULL
once	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
when	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL

Twenty-fifth	NULL
Street	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
Salvation	NULL

ladies	NULL
on	NULL
door-steps	NULL

sugary	NULL

sticky	NULL
candy	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
grimy	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
shiny-haired	NULL
children	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
late	NULL
sun	NULL
striking	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sides	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tall	NULL
tenements	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
very	NULL
rich	NULL
and	NULL
racy	NULL
and	NULL
savory	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
dish	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
provident	NULL
French	NULL
chef	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL

even	NULL
though	NULL
one	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
ingredients	NULL
were	NULL
probably	NULL
left-overs	NULL

Gloria	NULL
shuddered	NULL
suddenly	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
river	NULL
siren	NULL
came	NULL
moaning	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
dusky	NULL
roofs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
leaning	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
ghostly	NULL
curtains	NULL
fell	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
shoulder	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
electric	NULL
lamp	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
growing	NULL
late	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
some	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
purse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
considered	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
some	NULL
coffee	NULL
and	NULL
rolls	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
liberated	NULL
subway	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
roaring	NULL
cave	NULL
of	NULL
Manhattan	NULL
Street	NULL
or	NULL
eat	NULL
the	NULL
devilled	NULL
ham	NULL
and	NULL
bread	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
purse	NULL
decided	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
contained	NULL
a	NULL
nickel	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
pennies	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
unbearable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
wandering	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
magazine	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ceiling	NULL
,	NULL
toward	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
stared	NULL
without	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
hesitated	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
biting	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
finger	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
pantry	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
bottle	NULL
of	NULL
whiskey	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
shelf	NULL
and	NULL
poured	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL
drink	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
filled	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
glass	NULL
with	NULL
ginger	NULL
ale	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
returning	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
chair	NULL
finished	NULL
an	NULL
article	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
magazine	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
concerned	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
revolutionary	NULL
widow	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
an	NULL
ancient	NULL
veteran	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Continental	NULL
Army	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
in	NULL
1906	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
strange	NULL
and	NULL
oddly	NULL
romantic	NULL
to	NULL
Gloria	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
woman	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
contemporaries	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
a	NULL
page	NULL
and	NULL
learned	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
candidate	NULL
for	NULL
Congress	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
accused	NULL
of	NULL
atheism	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
opponent	NULL
.	NULL

Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
surprise	NULL
vanished	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
charges	NULL
were	NULL
false	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
candidate	NULL
had	NULL
merely	NULL
denied	NULL
the	NULL
miracle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
loaves	NULL
and	NULL
fishes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
admitted	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
pressure	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
full	NULL
credence	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
stroll	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

Finishing	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
drink	NULL
,	NULL
Gloria	NULL
got	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
slipping	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
negligée	NULL
and	NULL
making	NULL
herself	NULL
comfortable	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
lounge	NULL

RICHARD	NULL
CARAMEL	NULL
Early	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
Anthony	NULL
resigned	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
club	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Amsterdam	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
visit	NULL
it	NULL
hardly	NULL
twice	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
dues	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
recurrent	NULL
burden	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
joined	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
return	NULL
from	NULL
Italy	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
grandfather	NULL
's	NULL
club	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
club	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
given	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
indisputably	NULL
joined	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
preferred	NULL
the	NULL
Harvard	NULL
Club	NULL
,	NULL
largely	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
Dick	NULL
and	NULL
Maury	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
decline	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fortunes	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
an	NULL
increasingly	NULL
desirable	NULL
bauble	NULL
to	NULL
cling	NULL
to	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
relinquished	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
regret	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
companions	NULL
numbered	NULL
now	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
dozen	NULL
.	NULL

Several	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
called	NULL
"	NULL
Sammy	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
on	NULL
Forty-third	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
one	NULL
knocked	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
favorably	NULL
passed	NULL
on	NULL
from	NULL
behind	NULL
a	NULL
grating	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
sit	NULL
around	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
round	NULL
table	NULL
drinking	NULL
fairly	NULL
good	NULL
whiskey	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
here	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
encountered	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
named	NULL
Parker	NULL
Allison	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
exactly	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
rounder	NULL
at	NULL
Harvard	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
running	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
"	NULL
yeast	NULL
"	NULL
fortune	NULL
as	NULL
rapidly	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

Parker	NULL
Allison	NULL
's	NULL
notion	NULL
of	NULL
distinction	NULL
consisted	NULL
in	NULL
driving	NULL
a	NULL
noisy	NULL
red-and-yellow	NULL
racing-car	NULL
up	NULL
Broadway	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
glittering	NULL
,	NULL
hard-eyed	NULL
girls	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
who	NULL
dined	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
girls	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
incapable	NULL
of	NULL
sustaining	NULL
a	NULL
dialogue	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
Allison	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
Pete	NULL
Lytell	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
gray	NULL
derby	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
always	NULL
had	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
customarily	NULL
cheerful	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
Anthony	NULL
held	NULL
aimless	NULL
,	NULL
long-winded	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
through	NULL
many	NULL
afternoons	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
and	NULL
fall	NULL
.	NULL

Lytell	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
talked	NULL
but	NULL
reasoned	NULL
in	NULL
phrases	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
philosophy	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
series	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
assimilated	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
through	NULL
an	NULL
active	NULL
,	NULL
thoughtless	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
phrases	NULL
about	NULL
Socialism	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
immemorial	NULL
ones	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
phrases	NULL
pertaining	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
existence	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
personal	NULL
deity	NULL
--	NULL
something	NULL
about	NULL
one	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
railroad	NULL
accident	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
phrases	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
Irish	NULL
problem	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
woman	NULL
he	NULL
respected	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
futility	NULL
of	NULL
prohibition	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
time	NULL
his	NULL
conversation	NULL
ever	NULL
rose	NULL
superior	NULL
to	NULL
these	NULL
muddled	NULL
clauses	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
interpreted	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
rococo	NULL
happenings	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
life	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
usually	NULL
eventful	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
detailed	NULL
discussion	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
most	NULL
animal	NULL
existence	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
subtlety	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
foods	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
liquor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
preferred	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
the	NULL
commonest	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
remarkable	NULL
product	NULL
of	NULL
civilization	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
nine	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
ten	NULL
people	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
passes	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
city	NULL
street	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
hairless	NULL
ape	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
dozen	NULL
tricks	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
hero	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
thousand	NULL
romances	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
art	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
virtual	NULL
moron	NULL
,	NULL
performing	NULL
staidly	NULL
yet	NULL
absurdly	NULL
a	NULL
series	NULL
of	NULL
complicated	NULL
and	NULL
infinitely	NULL
astounding	NULL
epics	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
span	NULL
of	NULL
threescore	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
such	NULL
men	NULL
as	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
Anthony	NULL
Patch	NULL
drank	NULL
and	NULL
discussed	NULL
and	NULL
drank	NULL
and	NULL
argued	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
liked	NULL
them	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
obvious	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
faintest	NULL
conception	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
inevitable	NULL
continuity	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL
not	NULL
before	NULL
a	NULL
motion	NULL
picture	NULL
with	NULL
consecutive	NULL
reels	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
musty	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
travelogue	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
values	NULL
stark	NULL
and	NULL
hence	NULL
all	NULL
implications	NULL
confused	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
they	NULL
themselves	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
confused	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
confused	NULL
--	NULL
they	NULL
changed	NULL
phrases	NULL
from	NULL
month	NULL
to	NULL
month	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
changed	NULL
neckties	NULL

Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
courteous	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
subtle	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
perspicacious	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
drunk	NULL
each	NULL
day	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
Sammy	NULL
's	NULL
with	NULL
these	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
apartment	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
book	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
rarely	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
develop	NULL
the	NULL
unmistakable	NULL
outlines	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
quarrelsome	NULL
and	NULL
unreasonable	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
Gloria	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
certainly	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
Gloria	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
been	NULL
sick	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
preferred	NULL
to	NULL
inflict	NULL
misery	NULL
upon	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
confess	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
needed	NULL
sympathy	NULL
or	NULL
assistance	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
above	NULL
whining	NULL
now	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
above	NULL
being	NULL
sorry	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Each	NULL
night	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
bed	NULL
she	NULL
smeared	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
new	NULL
unguent	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
hoped	NULL
illogically	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
glow	NULL
and	NULL
freshness	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
vanishing	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Anthony	NULL
was	NULL
drunk	NULL
he	NULL
taunted	NULL
her	NULL
about	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sober	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
polite	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
occasions	NULL
even	NULL
tender	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
for	NULL
short	NULL
hours	NULL
a	NULL
trace	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
old	NULL
quality	NULL
of	NULL
understanding	NULL
too	NULL
well	NULL
to	NULL
blame	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
quality	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
worked	NULL
swiftly	NULL
and	NULL
ceaselessly	NULL
toward	NULL
his	NULL
ruin	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
hated	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sober	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
around	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
struggle	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
greedy	NULL
ambition	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
hope	NULL
more	NULL
sordid	NULL
than	NULL
despair	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
incessant	NULL
passage	NULL
up	NULL
or	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
metropolis	NULL
is	NULL
most	NULL
in	NULL
evidence	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
unstable	NULL
middle	NULL
class	NULL
.	NULL

Unable	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
rich	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
next	NULL
choice	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
poor	NULL
.	NULL

Anything	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
this	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
perspiration	NULL
and	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
enormous	NULL
panorama	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
strong	NULL
in	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
dim	NULL
almost	NULL
to	NULL
extinction	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
long	NULL
intervals	NULL
now	NULL
some	NULL
incident	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
gesture	NULL
of	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
his	NULL
fancy	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
veils	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
earnest	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
older	NULL
those	NULL
things	NULL
faded	NULL
--	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
wine	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
kindliness	NULL
about	NULL
intoxication	NULL
--	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
indescribable	NULL
gloss	NULL
and	NULL
glamour	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
memories	NULL
of	NULL
ephemeral	NULL
and	NULL
faded	NULL
evenings	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
high-balls	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
magic	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tall	NULL
glowing	NULL
Arabian	NULL
night	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Bush	NULL
Terminal	NULL
Building	NULL
--	NULL
its	NULL
summit	NULL
a	NULL
peak	NULL
of	NULL
sheer	NULL
grandeur	NULL
,	NULL
gold	NULL
and	NULL
dreaming	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
inaccessible	NULL
sky	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Wall	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
crass	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
banal	NULL
--	NULL
again	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
triumph	NULL
of	NULL
gold	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
gorgeous	NULL
sentient	NULL
spectacle	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
kings	NULL
kept	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
wars	NULL
....	NULL
...	NULL
The	NULL
fruit	NULL
of	NULL
youth	NULL
or	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
grape	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
transitory	NULL
magic	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
brief	NULL
passage	NULL
from	NULL
darkness	NULL
to	NULL
darkness	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
illusion	NULL
that	NULL
truth	NULL
and	NULL
beauty	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
way	NULL
entwined	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
Delmonico	NULL
's	NULL
lighting	NULL
a	NULL
cigarette	NULL
one	NULL
night	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
two	NULL
hansoms	NULL
drawn	NULL
up	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
curb	NULL
,	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
drunken	NULL
fare	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
outmoded	NULL
cabs	NULL
were	NULL
worn	NULL
and	NULL
dirty	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
cracked	NULL
patent	NULL
leather	NULL
wrinkled	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
cushions	NULL
faded	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
brownish	NULL
lavender	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
horses	NULL
were	NULL
ancient	NULL
and	NULL
weary	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
white-haired	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
sat	NULL
aloft	NULL
,	NULL
cracking	NULL
their	NULL
whips	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
grotesque	NULL
affectation	NULL
of	NULL
gallantry	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
relic	NULL
of	NULL
vanished	NULL
gaiety	NULL

Anthony	NULL
Patch	NULL
walked	NULL
away	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
fit	NULL
of	NULL
depression	NULL
,	NULL
pondering	NULL
the	NULL
bitterness	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
survivals	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
grew	NULL
stale	NULL
so	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
pleasure	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
Forty-second	NULL
Street	NULL
one	NULL
afternoon	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
Richard	NULL
Caramel	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL
prosperous	NULL

whose	NULL

"	NULL
Just	NULL

Richard	NULL

THE	NULL
BEATING	NULL
As	NULL
winter	NULL
approached	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
madness	NULL
seized	NULL
upon	NULL
Anthony	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
awoke	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
so	NULL
nervous	NULL
that	NULL
Gloria	NULL
could	NULL
feel	NULL
him	NULL
trembling	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
muster	NULL
enough	NULL
vitality	NULL
to	NULL
stumble	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
pantry	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
drink	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
intolerable	NULL
now	NULL
except	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
influence	NULL
of	NULL
liquor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
decay	NULL
and	NULL
coarsen	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
soul	NULL
and	NULL
body	NULL
shrank	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
stayed	NULL
out	NULL
all	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
failed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sorry	NULL
but	NULL
even	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
measure	NULL
of	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
faintly	NULL
repentant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
remark	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
gruff	NULL
,	NULL
hang-dog	NULL
fashion	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
guessed	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
drinking	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
hours	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
sit	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
armchair	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
apartment	NULL
,	NULL
lost	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
stupor	NULL
--	NULL
even	NULL
his	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
reading	NULL
his	NULL
favorite	NULL
books	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
departed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
an	NULL
incessant	NULL
bickering	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
between	NULL
husband	NULL
and	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
subject	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
ever	NULL
really	NULL
conversed	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
progress	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
will	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
Gloria	NULL
hoped	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tenebrous	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
expected	NULL
that	NULL
great	NULL
gift	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
bent	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
environment	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
grotesque	NULL
similitude	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
housewife	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
who	NULL
until	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
made	NULL
coffee	NULL
,	NULL
prepared	NULL
sometimes	NULL
three	NULL
meals	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
walked	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoons	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evenings	NULL
she	NULL
read	NULL
--	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
magazines	NULL
,	NULL
anything	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
wished	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Anthony	NULL
who	NULL
sought	NULL
her	NULL
bed	NULL
blind	NULL
drunk	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
neither	NULL
said	NULL
so	NULL
nor	NULL
gave	NULL
any	NULL
show	NULL
or	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
doubtful	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
clear	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
indeed	NULL
what	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
want	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
lonely	NULL
,	NULL
lovely	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
thirty	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
retrenched	NULL
behind	NULL
some	NULL
impregnable	NULL
inhibition	NULL
born	NULL
and	NULL
coexistent	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
afternoon	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
was	NULL
dirty	NULL
again	NULL
along	NULL
Riverside	NULL
Drive	NULL
,	NULL
Gloria	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
grocer	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
apartment	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
Anthony	NULL
pacing	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
aggravated	NULL
nervousness	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
feverish	NULL
eyes	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
were	NULL
traced	NULL
with	NULL
tiny	NULL
pink	NULL
lines	NULL
that	NULL
reminded	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
rivers	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
map	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
received	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
suddenly	NULL
and	NULL
definitely	NULL
old	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Have	NULL
you	NULL
any	NULL
money	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
inquired	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
precipitately	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
mean	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Just	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Money	NULL

Money	NULL
!	NULL

Ca	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
speak	NULL
English	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
paid	NULL
no	NULL
attention	NULL
but	NULL
brushed	NULL
by	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
pantry	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
bacon	NULL
and	NULL
eggs	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ice-box	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
his	NULL
drinking	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
unusually	NULL
excessive	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
invariably	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
whining	NULL
mood	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
followed	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pantry	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
persisted	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
question	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
heard	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Have	NULL
you	NULL
any	NULL
money	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
about	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
ice-box	NULL
and	NULL
faced	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
crazy	NULL

You	NULL
know	NULL

n't	NULL
any	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
executed	NULL
an	NULL
abrupt	NULL
about-face	NULL
and	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
living	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
renewed	NULL
his	NULL
pacing	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
evident	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
something	NULL
portentous	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
quite	NULL
obviously	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
asked	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

Joining	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
later	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
lounge	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
taking	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL

had	NULL
bought	NULL
some	NULL
shampoo	NULL

meant	NULL
to	NULL
wash	NULL
it	NULL
now	NULL
;	NULL

the	NULL
shop	NULL
and	NULL
motioned	NULL
him	NULL
angrily	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
growing	NULL
discouragement	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
growing	NULL
befuddlement	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
crossed	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
back	NULL
toward	NULL
Forty-third	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
near	NULL
Sammy	NULL
's	NULL
he	NULL
paused	NULL
undecided	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
apartment	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
body	NULL
required	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
lay	NULL
himself	NULL
open	NULL
to	NULL
bitter	NULL
reproach	NULL
;	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
pawnshops	NULL
were	NULL
closed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
notion	NULL
where	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
decided	NULL
finally	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
ask	NULL
Parker	NULL
Allison	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
approached	NULL
Sammy	NULL
's	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
locked	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
lights	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
watch	NULL
;	NULL
nine-thirty	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
walking	NULL
.	NULL

Ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
later	NULL
he	NULL
stopped	NULL
aimlessly	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
Forty-third	NULL
Street	NULL
and	NULL
Madison	NULL
Avenue	NULL
,	NULL
diagonally	NULL
across	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
bright	NULL
but	NULL
nearly	NULL
deserted	NULL
entrance	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Biltmore	NULL
Hotel	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
heavily	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
damp	NULL
board	NULL
amid	NULL
some	NULL
debris	NULL
of	NULL
construction	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
rested	NULL
there	NULL
for	NULL
almost	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
a	NULL
shifting	NULL
pattern	NULL
of	NULL
surface	NULL
thoughts	NULL
,	NULL
chiefest	NULL
among	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
obtain	NULL
some	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
home	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
too	NULL
sodden	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
glancing	NULL
over	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
Biltmore	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
standing	NULL
directly	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
overhead	NULL
glow	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
porte-cochère	NULL
lamps	NULL
beside	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
ermine	NULL
coat	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
Anthony	NULL
watched	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
couple	NULL
moved	NULL
forward	NULL
and	NULL
signalled	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
taxi	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
perceived	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
infallible	NULL
identification	NULL
that	NULL
lurks	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
walk	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Maury	NULL
Noble	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
rose	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Maury	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
shouted	NULL
.	NULL

Maury	NULL
looked	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
direction	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
turned	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
taxi	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
into	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
the	NULL
chaotic	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
borrowing	NULL
ten	NULL
dollars	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
as	NULL
fast	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
across	NULL
Madison	NULL
Avenue	NULL
and	NULL
along	NULL
Forty-third	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
Maury	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
beside	NULL
the	NULL
yawning	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
taxicab	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
companion	NULL
turned	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
curiously	NULL
at	NULL
Anthony	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Hello	NULL
,	NULL
Maury	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
holding	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Fine	NULL
,	NULL
thank	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Their	NULL
hands	NULL
dropped	NULL
and	NULL
Anthony	NULL
hesitated	NULL
.	NULL

Maury	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
move	NULL
to	NULL
introduce	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
stood	NULL
there	NULL
regarding	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
inscrutable	NULL
feline	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
began	NULL
Anthony	NULL
uncertainly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
ask	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
loan	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
not	NULL
four	NULL
feet	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
broke	NULL
off	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
perceptible	NULL
motion	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
to	NULL
beckon	NULL
Maury	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
in	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
big	NULL
hurry	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
can	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
can	NULL
you	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Again	NULL
he	NULL
hesitated	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Maury	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
important	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
sorry	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Before	NULL
Anthony	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
blurt	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
request	NULL
,	NULL
Maury	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
coolly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
helped	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
car	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
polite	NULL
"	NULL
good	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
stepped	NULL
in	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
nodded	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Anthony	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
expression	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
changed	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
shade	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
fretful	NULL
clatter	NULL
the	NULL
taxi	NULL
moved	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Anthony	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
standing	NULL
there	NULL
alone	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
lights	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
Biltmore	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
in	NULL
particular	NULL
except	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
entrance	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ascending	NULL
the	NULL
wide	NULL
stair	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
seat	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
alcove	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
furiously	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
snubbed	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
hurt	NULL
and	NULL
angry	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
when	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
condition	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
stubbornly	NULL
preoccupied	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
necessity	NULL
of	NULL
obtaining	NULL
some	NULL
money	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
once	NULL
again	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
over	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
fingers	NULL
the	NULL
acquaintances	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
conceivably	NULL
call	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
emergency	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
eventually	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
approach	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Howland	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
broker	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
wait	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Howland	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
operator	NULL
,	NULL
leaning	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
desk	NULL
and	NULL
fingering	NULL
his	NULL
quarter	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
loath	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
unsatisfied	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Call	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
suddenly	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
own	NULL
words	NULL
surprised	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
name	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
crossing	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
suggestions	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
number	NULL
,	NULL
please	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Scarcely	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
Joseph	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
telephone	NULL
directory	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
no	NULL
such	NULL
person	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
close	NULL
the	NULL
book	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
flashed	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
Gloria	NULL
had	NULL
mentioned	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
name	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
Joseph	NULL
Black	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
booth	NULL
while	NULL
central	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
number	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Hello-o	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

he	NULL
's	NULL
out	NULL
this	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

Is	NULL
there	NULL
any	NULL
message	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
intonation	NULL
was	NULL
cockney	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
reminded	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rich	NULL
vocal	NULL
deferences	NULL
of	NULL
Bounds	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Where	NULL
is	NULL
he	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL

he	NULL
's	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Thanks	NULL

"	NULL

Anthony	NULL
got	NULL
his	NULL
five	NULL
cents	NULL
change	NULL
and	NULL
started	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Boul	NULL
'	NULL
Mich	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
popular	NULL
dancing	NULL
resort	NULL
on	NULL
Forty-fifth	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
ten	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
were	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
sparsely	NULL
peopled	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
theatres	NULL
should	NULL
eject	NULL
their	NULL
spawn	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
later	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
Boul	NULL
'	NULL
Mich	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
there	NULL
with	NULL
Gloria	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
existence	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
rule	NULL
that	NULL
patrons	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
evening	NULL
dress	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
up-stairs	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
send	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
and	NULL
wait	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
hall	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
project	NULL
was	NULL
entirely	NULL
natural	NULL
and	NULL
graceful	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
his	NULL
distorted	NULL
imagination	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
simply	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
friends	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
entrance	NULL
hall	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Boul	NULL
'	NULL
Mich	NULL
'	NULL
was	NULL
warm	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
high	NULL
yellow	NULL
lights	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
thick	NULL
green	NULL
carpet	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
stairway	NULL
rose	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dancing	NULL
floor	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hallboy	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
--	NULL
Mr.	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
's	NULL
up-stairs	NULL
--	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
shook	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

'	NULL
Sagainsa	NULL

"	NULL
Wait	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
interval	NULL
a	NULL
head	NULL
waiter	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
bearing	NULL
a	NULL
card	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
charted	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
reservations	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
darted	NULL
a	NULL
cynical	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
Anthony	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
failed	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
target	NULL
.	NULL

Together	NULL
they	NULL
bent	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
cardboard	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
without	NULL
difficulty	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
party	NULL

Very	NULL

very	NULL

"	NULL

Again	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
,	NULL
leaning	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
banister	NULL
and	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
confused	NULL
harmonies	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
Jazz-mad	NULL
"	NULL
which	NULL
came	NULL
floating	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL

A	NULL

was	NULL
singing	NULL

left	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
and	NULL
shook	NULL
herself	NULL
insane	NULL
,	NULL
So	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
shiver	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
_	NULL
Then	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
descending	NULL
the	NULL
staircase	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
shake	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
wanted	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL
older	NULL

coolly	NULL

Anthony	NULL

you	NULL

Regarding	NULL
him	NULL
narrowly	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
followed	NULL
Anthony	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
bend	NULL
made	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
staircase	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
beyond	NULL

the	NULL

"	NULL

repeated	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL

"	NULL
Wha	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL

lay	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
friendly	NULL
gesture	NULL
upon	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
's	NULL

Then	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
struck	NULL
out	NULL

all	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
arm	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL

forty-five	NULL

struck	NULL
out	NULL

caught	NULL
Anthony	NULL
squarely	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

Anthony	NULL
cracked	NULL
up	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
staircase	NULL

recovered	NULL
himself	NULL

made	NULL
a	NULL
wild	NULL

at	NULL
his	NULL

Bloeckman	NULL

who	NULL

something	NULL

struck	NULL
him	NULL
twice	NULL

two	NULL

Anthony	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
grunt	NULL

toppled	NULL
over	NULL
onto	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
plush	NULL
carpet	NULL

finding	NULL

as	NULL
he	NULL
fell	NULL

that	NULL
his	NULL

was	NULL
full	NULL

seemed	NULL
oddly	NULL

He	NULL
struggled	NULL

then	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
started	NULL

Bloeckman	NULL

who	NULL

Bloeckman	NULL
excitedly	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pockmarked	NULL

Bloeckman	NULL

his	NULL
voice	NULL
rising	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
faintly	NULL
shrill	NULL
note	NULL
of	NULL
pride	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
He	NULL
got	NULL
what	NULL

The	NULL

commanded	NULL

Bloeckman	NULL
quickly	NULL

Ugh	NULL

What	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
conscious	NULL
dignity	NULL
walked	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
wash-room	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
six	NULL
brawny	NULL
hands	NULL
seized	NULL
upon	NULL
Anthony	NULL

dragged	NULL
him	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL

The	NULL
"	NULL

was	NULL
propelled	NULL
violently	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sidewalk	NULL

where	NULL
he	NULL
landed	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL

knees	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
grotesque	NULL
slapping	NULL
sound	NULL
and	NULL
rolled	NULL
over	NULL
slowly	NULL
onto	NULL
his	NULL
side	NULL

The	NULL
shock	NULL
stunned	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
lay	NULL
there	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
in	NULL
acute	NULL
distributed	NULL
pain	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
his	NULL
discomfort	NULL
became	NULL
centralized	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
stomach	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
regained	NULL
consciousness	NULL
to	NULL
discover	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL

Anthony	NULL
explored	NULL

verifying	NULL

Anthony	NULL
made	NULL
out	NULL

Again	NULL
Anthony	NULL
essayed	NULL

his	NULL

the	NULL

to	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
reached	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
watch	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
pocket	NULL
empty	NULL
.	NULL

Involuntarily	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
formed	NULL
an	NULL
immemorial	NULL
phrase	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
What	NULL
a	NULL
night	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

Strangely	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
sober	NULL
.	NULL

Without	NULL
moving	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL
was	NULL
anchored	NULL
in	NULL
mid-sky	NULL
,	NULL
shedding	NULL
light	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
Claremont	NULL
Avenue	NULL
as	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
and	NULL
uncharted	NULL
abyss	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
sign	NULL
or	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
save	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
continuous	NULL
buzzing	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
ears	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
Anthony	NULL
himself	NULL
broke	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
distinct	NULL
and	NULL
peculiar	NULL
murmur	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
consistently	NULL
attempted	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
back	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Boul	NULL
'	NULL
Mich	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
face	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
Bloeckman	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
unmistakable	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
ironic	NULL
laughter	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
torn	NULL
and	NULL
bleeding	NULL
lips	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
pitiful	NULL
retching	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

Three	NULL
weeks	NULL
later	NULL
the	NULL
trial	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
seemingly	NULL
endless	NULL
spool	NULL
of	NULL
legal	NULL
red	NULL
tape	NULL
having	NULL
unrolled	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
period	NULL
of	NULL
four	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
snapped	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
and	NULL
Gloria	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
Shuttleworth	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
platoon	NULL
of	NULL
beneficiaries	NULL
testified	NULL
and	NULL
lied	NULL
and	NULL
ill-behaved	NULL
generally	NULL
in	NULL
varying	NULL
degrees	NULL
of	NULL
greed	NULL
and	NULL
desperation	NULL
.	NULL

Anthony	NULL
awoke	NULL
one	NULL
morning	NULL
in	NULL
March	NULL
realizing	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
verdict	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
given	NULL
at	NULL
four	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
dress	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
his	NULL
extreme	NULL
nervousness	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
mingled	NULL
an	NULL
unjustified	NULL
optimism	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
outcome	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
believed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
decision	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
court	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
reversed	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
only	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
reaction	NULL
,	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
excessive	NULL
prohibition	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
recently	NULL
set	NULL
in	NULL
against	NULL
reforms	NULL
and	NULL
reformers	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
counted	NULL
more	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
personal	NULL
attacks	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
levelled	NULL
at	NULL
Shuttleworth	NULL
than	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
sheerly	NULL
legal	NULL
aspects	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
proceedings	NULL
.	NULL

Dressed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
poured	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
drink	NULL
of	NULL
whiskey	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
Gloria	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
already	NULL
wide	NULL
awake	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
humoring	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
fancied	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
best	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
disturbed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Good	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
murmured	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
smiling	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
eyes	NULL
seemed	NULL
unusually	NULL
large	NULL
and	NULL
dark	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
feel	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
grudgingly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Better	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Much	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
you	NULL
feel	NULL
well	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
court	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
this	NULL
afternoon	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
nodded	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

Dick	NULL
said	NULL
yesterday	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
was	NULL
nice	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
car	NULL
and	NULL
take	NULL
me	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
ride	NULL
in	NULL
Central	NULL
Park	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
sunshine	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Anthony	NULL
glanced	NULL
mechanically	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
nervous	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Please	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
sit	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
not	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
smell	NULL
of	NULL
whiskey	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
stand	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
absent-mindedly	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
little	NULL
later	NULL
she	NULL
called	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
brought	NULL
her	NULL
some	NULL
potato	NULL
salad	NULL
and	NULL
cold	NULL
chicken	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
delicatessen	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
two	NULL
o'clock	NULL
Richard	NULL
Caramel	NULL
's	NULL
car	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
phoned	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
Anthony	NULL
took	NULL
Gloria	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
elevator	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
curb	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
cousin	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
sweet	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
riding	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
simple	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Dick	NULL
replied	NULL
disparagingly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

Richard	NULL
Caramel	NULL
had	NULL
forgiven	NULL
many	NULL
people	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
offenses	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
forgiven	NULL
his	NULL
cousin	NULL
,	NULL
Gloria	NULL
Gilbert	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
statement	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
just	NULL
prior	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
wedding	NULL
,	NULL
seven	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
intend	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
his	NULL
book	NULL
.	NULL

Richard	NULL
Caramel	NULL
remembered	NULL
this	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
remembered	NULL
it	NULL
well	NULL
for	NULL
seven	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
time	NULL
will	NULL
I	NULL
expect	NULL
you	NULL
back	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Anthony	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
we	NULL
'll	NULL
meet	NULL
you	NULL
down	NULL
there	NULL
at	NULL
four	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
muttered	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
meet	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Up-stairs	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mimeographed	NULL
notice	NULL
urging	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
"	NULL
in	NULL
condescendingly	NULL
colloquial	NULL
language	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
the	NULL
dues	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
American	NULL
Legion	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
threw	NULL
it	NULL
impatiently	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
waste-basket	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
elbows	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
sill	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
down	NULL
blindly	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
sunny	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

Italy	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
verdict	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
favor	NULL
it	NULL
meant	NULL
Italy	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
word	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
talisman	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
land	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
intolerable	NULL
anxieties	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
would	NULL
fall	NULL
away	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
garment	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
watering-places	NULL
first	NULL
and	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
bright	NULL
and	NULL
colorful	NULL
crowds	NULL
forget	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
appendages	NULL
of	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

Marvellously	NULL
renewed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
walk	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Piazza	NULL
di	NULL
Spanga	NULL
at	NULL
twilight	NULL
,	NULL
moving	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
drifting	NULL
flotsam	NULL
of	NULL
dark	NULL
women	NULL
and	NULL
ragged	NULL
beggars	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
austere	NULL
,	NULL
barefooted	NULL
friars	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Italian	NULL
women	NULL
stirred	NULL
him	NULL
faintly	NULL
--	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
purse	NULL
hung	NULL
heavy	NULL
again	NULL
even	NULL
romance	NULL
might	NULL
fly	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
perch	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
romance	NULL
of	NULL
blue	NULL
canals	NULL
in	NULL
Venice	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
golden	NULL
green	NULL
hills	NULL
of	NULL
Fiesole	NULL
after	NULL
rain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
women	NULL
who	NULL
changed	NULL
,	NULL
dissolved	NULL
,	NULL
melted	NULL
into	NULL
other	NULL
women	NULL
and	NULL
receded	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
always	NULL
beautiful	NULL
and	NULL
always	NULL
young	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
difference	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
attitude	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
distress	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
known	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sorrow	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
women	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
different	NULL
ways	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
casually	NULL
--	NULL
perhaps	NULL
finding	NULL
him	NULL
tender-minded	NULL
and	NULL
afraid	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
killed	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
menaced	NULL
their	NULL
absolute	NULL
sway	NULL
.	NULL

Turning	NULL
about	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
he	NULL
faced	NULL
his	NULL
reflection	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mirror	NULL
,	NULL
contemplating	NULL
dejectedly	NULL
the	NULL
wan	NULL
,	NULL
pasty	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
crisscross	NULL
of	NULL
lines	NULL
like	NULL
shreds	NULL
of	NULL
dried	NULL
blood	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
stooped	NULL
and	NULL
flabby	NULL
figure	NULL
whose	NULL
very	NULL
sag	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
document	NULL
in	NULL
lethargy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
thirty	NULL
three	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
forty	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
things	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
different	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
door-bell	NULL
rang	NULL
abruptly	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
started	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
dealt	NULL
a	NULL
blow	NULL
.	NULL

Recovering	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
and	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
outer	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Dot	NULL
.	NULL

THE	NULL
ENCOUNTER	NULL
He	NULL
retreated	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
living	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
comprehending	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
slow	NULL
flood	NULL
of	NULL
sentences	NULL
that	NULL
poured	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
steadily	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
persistent	NULL
monotone	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
decently	NULL
and	NULL
shabbily	NULL
dressed	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
somehow	NULL
pitiable	NULL
little	NULL
hat	NULL
adorned	NULL
with	NULL
pink	NULL
and	NULL
blue	NULL
flowers	NULL
covered	NULL
and	NULL
hid	NULL
her	NULL
dark	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
gathered	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
words	NULL
that	NULL
several	NULL
days	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
an	NULL
item	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
concerning	NULL
the	NULL
lawsuit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
obtained	NULL
his	NULL
address	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
clerk	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Appellate	NULL
Division	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
called	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
apartment	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
told	NULL
that	NULL
Anthony	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
name	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
living	NULL
room	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
regarding	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
stupefied	NULL
horror	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
rattled	NULL
on	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
predominant	NULL
sensation	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
civilization	NULL
and	NULL
convention	NULL
around	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
curiously	NULL
unreal	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
milliner	NULL
's	NULL
shop	NULL
on	NULL
Sixth	NULL
Avenue	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lonesome	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sick	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
while	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
for	NULL
Camp	NULL
Mills	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
taken	NULL
her	NULL
home	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
Carolina	NULL
...	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
finding	NULL
Anthony	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
appallingly	NULL
in	NULL
earnest	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
violet	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
red	NULL
with	NULL
tears	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
soft	NULL
intonation	NULL
was	NULL
ragged	NULL
with	NULL
little	NULL
gasping	NULL
sobs	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
changed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
him	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
die	NULL
....	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
'll	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
,	NULL
speaking	NULL
with	NULL
tortuous	NULL
intensity	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

down	NULL
in	NULL

His	NULL
voice	NULL
rose	NULL
until	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
pitched	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
clicking	NULL

changing	NULL

meeting	NULL
his	NULL

took	NULL
a	NULL

Anthony	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
race	NULL
here	NULL

there	NULL
on	NULL

side	NULL

the	NULL

still	NULL
giving	NULL
out	NULL

he	NULL

what	NULL

seeking	NULL

a	NULL

chair	NULL

Uttering	NULL

he	NULL
seized	NULL
it	NULL

swung	NULL
it	NULL
above	NULL

let	NULL
it	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL

strength	NULL
straight	NULL
at	NULL

then	NULL
a	NULL

down	NULL

him	NULL

blotted	NULL
out	NULL
thought	NULL

rage	NULL

with	NULL
almost	NULL

Gloria	NULL

Dick	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
five	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
answer	NULL

they	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
living	NULL
room	NULL

found	NULL
a	NULL
chair	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
back	NULL
smashed	NULL
lying	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
doorway	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
disorder	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
rugs	NULL

the	NULL
pictures	NULL

bric-à-brac	NULL
were	NULL
upset	NULL

the	NULL
centre	NULL

The	NULL
air	NULL
was	NULL
sickly	NULL

They	NULL
found	NULL
Anthony	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
patch	NULL
of	NULL
sunshine	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
bedroom	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
open	NULL

were	NULL
spread	NULL
his	NULL
three	NULL
big	NULL
stamp-books	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
entered	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
running	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
pile	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL

dumped	NULL

Looking	NULL

Dick	NULL

he	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL

critically	NULL

reproachfully	NULL

"	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL

He	NULL
held	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL

let	NULL
them	NULL
come	NULL
drifting	NULL
down	NULL
about	NULL
