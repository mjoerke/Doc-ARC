Miss	B-PER
Brooke	I-PER
had	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
beauty	O
which	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
thrown	O
into	O
relief	O
by	O
poor	O
dress	O

Her	O
hand	O
and	O
wrist	O
were	O
so	O
finely	O
formed	O
that	O
she	O
could	O
wear	O
sleeves	O
not	O
less	O
bare	O
of	O
style	O
than	O
those	O
in	O
which	O
the	B-PER

Virgin	I-PER
appeared	O
to	O
Italian	B-PER
painters	I-PER
;	O
and	O
her	O
profile	O

as	O
her	O
stature	O

bearing	O
seemed	O
to	O
gain	O
the	O
more	O
dignity	O
from	O
her	O
plain	O
garments	O
,	O
which	O
by	O
the	B-FAC
side	I-FAC
of	I-FAC

She	O
was	O
usually	O
spoken	O

with	O
the	O
addition	O
that	O

Nevertheless	O

Celia	B-PER

scarcely	O

it	O
was	O
only	O
to	O

Miss	B-PER

Dorothea	B-PER

Her	O
mind	O
was	O
theoretic	O

yearned	O
by	O
its	O

after	O
some	O

conception	O
of	O
the	B-LOC

which	O
might	O

such	O
elements	O
in	O
the	O

a	B-PER

Mr.	B-PER
Brooke	I-PER

it	O

safe	O

say	O
that	O

In	O
Mr.	B-PER

the	O
hereditary	O
strain	O
of	O

clearly	O

in	O
his	B-PER

Dorothea	B-PER
it	O
glowed	O
alike	O
through	O
faults	O

rather	NULL
falteringly	NULL

some	NULL

said	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
letting	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
fall	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
tone	NULL
--	NULL

She	NULL
paused	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Celia	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL

decidedly	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
pencil	NULL
without	NULL
removing	NULL
the	NULL
jewels	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
often	NULL
having	NULL
them	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
feed	NULL
her	NULL
eye	NULL
at	NULL
these	NULL

"	NULL
Shall	NULL

said	NULL
Celia	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
watching	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
real	NULL
curiosity	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
glanced	NULL
quickly	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
.	NULL

Across	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
imaginative	NULL
adornment	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
darted	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
a	NULL
keen	NULL
discernment	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
scorching	NULL
quality	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Miss	NULL
Brooke	NULL
ever	NULL
attained	NULL
perfect	NULL
meekness	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
for	NULL
lack	NULL
of	NULL
inward	NULL
fire	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
haughtily	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
level	NULL

"	NULL

Celia	NULL
blushed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
unhappy	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
offended	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
even	NULL
anything	NULL
pretty	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
gift	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ornaments	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
box	NULL
and	NULL
carried	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
too	NULL
was	NULL
unhappy	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
plan-drawing	NULL
,	NULL
questioning	NULL
the	NULL
purity	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
feeling	NULL
and	NULL
speech	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
ended	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
little	NULL
explosion	NULL
.	NULL

Celia	NULL
's	NULL
consciousness	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
natural	NULL
and	NULL
justifiable	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
asked	NULL
that	NULL
question	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
repeated	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
inconsistent	NULL
:	NULL
either	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
her	NULL
full	NULL
share	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
jewels	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
renounced	NULL
them	NULL
altogether	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
sure	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL

I	NULL
trust	NULL

"	NULL
thought	NULL
Celia	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
wearing	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
necklace	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
interfere	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL

though	NULL

course	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL

be	NULL
bound	NULL

them	NULL

But	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
consistent	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Thus	NULL
Celia	NULL
,	NULL
mutely	NULL
bending	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
tapestry	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
calling	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Here	NULL

Kitty	NULL

As	NULL
Celia	NULL
bent	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
,	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
cheek	NULL
against	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
arm	NULL
caressingly	NULL
.	NULL

Celia	NULL
understood	NULL
the	NULL
action	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Celia	NULL
pardoned	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
remember	NULL

there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
mixture	NULL
of	NULL
criticism	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
attitude	NULL
of	NULL
Celia	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
elder	NULL

Celia	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pity	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
deceived	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
baronet	NULL
's	NULL
interest	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
reflected	NULL
that	NULL
Dodo	NULL
would	NULL
perhaps	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
husband	NULL
happy	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
things	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
stifled	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
religious	NULL
for	NULL
family	NULL
comfort	NULL
.	NULL

Notions	NULL
and	NULL
scruples	NULL
were	NULL
like	NULL
spilt	NULL
needles	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
one	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
treading	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
sitting	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
eating	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Miss	NULL
Brooke	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
tea-table	NULL
,	NULL
Sir	NULL
James	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
down	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
having	NULL
felt	NULL
her	NULL
mode	NULL
of	NULL
answering	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
offensive	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
should	NULL
he	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
probable	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Brooke	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
manners	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
marked	NULL
indeed	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
cease	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
interpreted	NULL
by	NULL
preconceptions	NULL
either	NULL
confident	NULL
or	NULL
distrustful	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
charming	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
he	NULL
theorized	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
attachment	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
excellent	NULL
human	NULL
dough	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
rare	NULL
merit	NULL
of	NULL
knowing	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
talents	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
let	NULL
loose	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
set	NULL
the	NULL
smallest	NULL
stream	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL
on	NULL
fire	NULL
:	NULL
hence	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
What	NULL
shall	NULL
we	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

about	NULL
this	NULL
or	NULL
that	NULL
;	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
help	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
reasons	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
also	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
property	NULL
qualification	NULL
for	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
excessive	NULL
religiousness	NULL
alleged	NULL
against	NULL
Miss	NULL
Brooke	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
indefinite	NULL
notion	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
consisted	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
die	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
marriage	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
endure	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
predominance	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
could	NULL
always	NULL
put	NULL
down	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
.	NULL

Sir	NULL
James	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
ever	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
predominance	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
handsome	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
whose	NULL
cleverness	NULL
he	NULL
delighted	NULL

Why	NULL

deep	NULL

of	NULL
Mr.	NULL

reflected	NULL
there	NULL

of	NULL

that	NULL
all	NULL

the	NULL

Mr.	NULL

a	NULL
dignified	NULL

somewhat	NULL

audience	NULL

bowed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

avoided	NULL
looking	NULL

anything	NULL
documentary	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL

without	NULL
showing	NULL
disregard	NULL

associated	NULL

that	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
severe	NULL

was	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
an	NULL
amiable	NULL
host	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
landholder	NULL
and	NULL
custos	NULL
rotulorum	NULL

Was	NULL
his	NULL
endurance	NULL
aided	NULL
also	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
reflection	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
uncle	NULL
of	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
?	NULL

Certainly	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
bent	NULL
on	NULL
making	NULL
her	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
drawing	NULL
her	NULL
out	NULL

Celia	NULL
remarked	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL

in	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
often	NULL
lit	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
like	NULL
pale	NULL
wintry	NULL
sunshine	NULL

Before	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL

while	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
walk	NULL
with	NULL
Miss	NULL
Brooke	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
gravelled	NULL
terrace	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
mentioned	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
disadvantage	NULL
of	NULL
loneliness	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
cheerful	NULL
companionship	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
youth	NULL
can	NULL
lighten	NULL
or	NULL
vary	NULL
the	NULL
serious	NULL
toils	NULL
of	NULL
maturity	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
delivered	NULL
this	NULL
statement	NULL
with	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
careful	NULL
precision	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL

attended	NULL

results	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
expect	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
repeat	NULL
or	NULL
revise	NULL
his	NULL
communications	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
practical	NULL

personal	NULL
kind	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
inclinations	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
deliberately	NULL
stated	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
2d	NULL

October	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
enough	NULL

refer	NULL

by	NULL
the	NULL
mention	NULL

that	NULL
date	NULL
;	NULL
judging	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
standard	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
memory	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
volume	NULL
where	NULL
a	NULL
vide	NULL

not	NULL
the	NULL
ordinary	NULL
long-used	NULL
blotting-book	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
case	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
confidence	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
falsified	NULL

for	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
heard	NULL

retained	NULL
what	NULL

the	NULL

fresh	NULL

nature	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL

epoch	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
three	NULL
o'clock	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL

autumn	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
Mr.	NULL

drove	NULL

Lowick	NULL

only	NULL
five	NULL
miles	NULL
from	NULL

;	NULL
and	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
bonnet	NULL
and	NULL
shawl	NULL
,	NULL
hurried	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
shrubbery	NULL
and	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
park	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
wander	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
bordering	NULL

no	NULL

visible	NULL
companionship	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
Monk	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Great	NULL

,	NULL
who	NULL
always	NULL
took	NULL
care	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
walks	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
vision	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
possible	NULL
future	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
with	NULL
trembling	NULL
hope	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
wander	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
visionary	NULL
future	NULL
without	NULL
interruption	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
walked	NULL
briskly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
brisk	NULL
air	NULL

the	NULL
color	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL

her	NULL
straw	NULL

fell	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
backward	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL

brown	NULL

coiled	NULL
behind	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
expose	NULL
the	NULL
outline	NULL

her	NULL
head	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
daring	NULL
manner	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
public	NULL
feeling	NULL
required	NULL
the	NULL
meagreness	NULL

be	NULL
dissimulated	NULL

was	NULL
not	NULL

an	NULL
omission	NULL
which	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
afterwards	NULL
thought	NULL

blamed	NULL
herself	NULL

She	NULL

Sir	NULL

After	NULL
all	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
relief	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
puppy	NULL

Celia	NULL
was	NULL
present	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL

examined	NULL

observed	NULL

thinks	NULL

And	NULL
how	NULL
very	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
Sir	NULL
James	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
notions	NULL

"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Celia	NULL
's	NULL
private	NULL
luxury	NULL
to	NULL
indulge	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
dislike	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
confess	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
direct	NULL
statement	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
laying	NULL
herself	NULL
open	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
demonstration	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
somehow	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
at	NULL
war	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
goodness	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
on	NULL
safe	NULL
opportunities	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
indirect	NULL
mode	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
her	NULL
negative	NULL
wisdom	NULL
tell	NULL
upon	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
calling	NULL
her	NULL
down	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
rhapsodic	NULL
mood	NULL
by	NULL
reminding	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
staring	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
listening	NULL
.	NULL

Celia	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
impulsive	NULL
:	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
could	NULL
wait	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
always	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
quiet	NULL
staccato	NULL
evenness	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
people	NULL
talked	NULL
with	NULL
energy	NULL
and	NULL
emphasis	NULL
she	NULL
watched	NULL
their	NULL
faces	NULL
and	NULL
features	NULL
merely	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
never	NULL
could	NULL
understand	NULL
how	NULL
well-bred	NULL
persons	NULL
consented	NULL
to	NULL
sing	NULL
and	NULL
open	NULL
their	NULL
mouths	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ridiculous	NULL
manner	NULL
requisite	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
vocal	NULL
exercise	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
many	NULL
days	NULL
before	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
paid	NULL
a	NULL
morning	NULL
visit	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
invited	NULL
again	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
week	NULL
to	NULL
dine	NULL
and	NULL
stay	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
had	NULL
three	NULL
more	NULL
conversations	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
impressions	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
just	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
imagined	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
:	NULL
almost	NULL
everything	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
seemed	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
specimen	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
mine	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
inscription	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
museum	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
open	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
treasures	NULL
of	NULL
past	NULL
ages	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
trust	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mental	NULL
wealth	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
deeper	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
effective	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
inclination	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
obvious	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
visits	NULL
were	NULL
made	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
sake	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
accomplished	NULL
man	NULL
condescended	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
pains	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
with	NULL
absurd	NULL
compliment	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
appeal	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
understanding	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
with	NULL
instructive	NULL
correction	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
delightful	NULL
companionship	NULL
!	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
seemed	NULL
even	NULL
unconscious	NULL
that	NULL
trivialities	NULL
existed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
handed	NULL
round	NULL
that	NULL
small-talk	NULL
of	NULL
heavy	NULL
men	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
as	NULL
acceptable	NULL
as	NULL
stale	NULL
bride-cake	NULL
brought	NULL
forth	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
odor	NULL
of	NULL
cupboard	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
else	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
and	NULL
bowed	NULL
with	NULL
sad	NULL
civility	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
adorable	NULL
genuineness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
religious	NULL
abstinence	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
artificiality	NULL
which	NULL
uses	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
efforts	NULL
of	NULL
pretence	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
reverently	NULL
at	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
religious	NULL
elevation	NULL
above	NULL
herself	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
intellect	NULL
and	NULL
learning	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
assented	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
expressions	NULL
of	NULL
devout	NULL
feeling	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
usually	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
appropriate	NULL
quotation	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
allowed	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
through	NULL
some	NULL
spiritual	NULL
conflicts	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
youth	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
here	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
reckon	NULL
on	NULL
understanding	NULL
,	NULL
sympathy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
guidance	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
one	NULL
--	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
favorite	NULL
themes	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
disappointed	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
apparently	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
about	NULL
building	NULL
cottages	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
diverted	NULL
the	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
extremely	NULL
narrow	NULL
accommodation	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dwellings	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ancient	NULL
Egyptians	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
to	NULL
check	NULL
a	NULL
too	NULL
high	NULL
standard	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
dwelt	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
agitation	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
indifference	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
exercised	NULL
with	NULL
arguments	NULL
drawn	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
varying	NULL
conditions	NULL
of	NULL
climate	NULL
which	NULL
modify	NULL
human	NULL
needs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
admitted	NULL
wickedness	NULL
of	NULL
pagan	NULL
despots	NULL
.	NULL

Should	NULL
she	NULL
not	NULL
urge	NULL
these	NULL
arguments	NULL
on	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
again	NULL
?	NULL

But	NULL
further	NULL
reflection	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
presumptuous	NULL
in	NULL
demanding	NULL
his	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
subject	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
disapprove	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
occupying	NULL
herself	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
leisure	NULL
moments	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
other	NULL
women	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
occupy	NULL
themselves	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
dress	NULL
and	NULL
embroidery	NULL
--	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
forbid	NULL
it	NULL
when	NULL
--	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
felt	NULL
rather	NULL
ashamed	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
detected	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
speculations	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
her	NULL
uncle	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
invited	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Lowick	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
days	NULL
:	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
reasonable	NULL
to	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
delighted	NULL
in	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
's	NULL
society	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
sake	NULL
,	NULL
either	NULL
with	NULL
or	NULL
without	NULL
documents	NULL
?	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
that	NULL
little	NULL
disappointment	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
delight	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
in	NULL
Sir	NULL
James	NULL
Chettam	NULL
's	NULL
readiness	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
on	NULL
foot	NULL
the	NULL
desired	NULL
improvements	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
much	NULL
oftener	NULL
than	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
him	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
showed	NULL
himself	NULL
so	NULL
entirely	NULL
in	NULL
earnest	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
entered	NULL
with	NULL
much	NULL
practical	NULL
ability	NULL
into	NULL
Lovegood	NULL
's	NULL
estimates	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
charmingly	NULL
docile	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
proposed	NULL
to	NULL
build	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
cottages	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
transfer	NULL
two	NULL
families	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
old	NULL
cabins	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
then	NULL
be	NULL
pulled	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
new	NULL
ones	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
built	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
sites	NULL
.	NULL

Sir	NULL
James	NULL
said	NULL
"	NULL
Exactly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
bore	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
remarkably	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

Certainly	NULL
these	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
few	NULL
spontaneous	NULL
ideas	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
useful	NULL

feminine	NULL
direction	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
fortunate	NULL
in	NULL
choosing	NULL
their	NULL
sisters-in-law	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
whether	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
or	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
wilfulness	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
continuing	NULL
blind	NULL

the	NULL
possibility	NULL
that	NULL
another	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
choice	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
question	NULL
in	NULL
relation	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
now	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
hope	NULL
and	NULL
action	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
thinking	NULL

her	NULL
plans	NULL

getting	NULL
down	NULL

books	NULL

MY	NULL
DEAR	NULL
MISS	NULL
BROOKE	NULL
,	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
your	NULL
guardian	NULL
's	NULL
permission	NULL
to	NULL
address	NULL
you	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
subject	NULL
than	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
none	NULL
more	NULL
at	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
trust	NULL
,	NULL
mistaken	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
recognition	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
deeper	NULL
correspondence	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
date	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
consciousness	NULL
of	NULL
need	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
own	NULL
life	NULL
had	NULL
arisen	NULL
contemporaneously	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
becoming	NULL
acquainted	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
hour	NULL
of	NULL
meeting	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
impression	NULL
of	NULL
your	NULL
eminent	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
exclusive	NULL
fitness	NULL
to	NULL
supply	NULL
that	NULL
need	NULL
(	NULL
connected	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
activity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
affections	NULL
as	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
preoccupations	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
work	NULL
too	NULL
special	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
abdicated	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
uninterruptedly	NULL
dissimulate	NULL
)	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
each	NULL
succeeding	NULL
opportunity	NULL
for	NULL
observation	NULL
has	NULL
given	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
an	NULL
added	NULL
depth	NULL
by	NULL
convincing	NULL
me	NULL
more	NULL
emphatically	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
fitness	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
preconceived	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
evoking	NULL
more	NULL
decisively	NULL
those	NULL
affections	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
referred	NULL
.	NULL

Our	NULL
conversations	NULL
have	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
clear	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
the	NULL
tenor	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
purposes	NULL
:	NULL
a	NULL
tenor	NULL
unsuited	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
aware	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
commoner	NULL
order	NULL
of	NULL
minds	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
discerned	NULL
in	NULL
you	NULL
an	NULL
elevation	NULL
of	NULL
thought	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
capability	NULL
of	NULL
devotedness	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
hitherto	NULL
not	NULL
conceived	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
compatible	NULL
either	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
bloom	NULL
of	NULL
youth	NULL
or	NULL
with	NULL
those	NULL
graces	NULL
of	NULL
sex	NULL
that	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
to	NULL
win	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
confer	NULL
distinction	NULL
when	NULL
combined	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
notably	NULL
are	NULL
in	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
mental	NULL
qualities	NULL
above	NULL
indicated	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
confess	NULL
,	NULL
beyond	NULL
my	NULL
hope	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
rare	NULL
combination	NULL
of	NULL
elements	NULL
both	NULL
solid	NULL
and	NULL
attractive	NULL
,	NULL
adapted	NULL
to	NULL
supply	NULL
aid	NULL
in	NULL
graver	NULL
labors	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
cast	NULL
a	NULL
charm	NULL
over	NULL
vacant	NULL
hours	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
event	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
introduction	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
(	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
again	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
trust	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
superficially	NULL
coincident	NULL
with	NULL
foreshadowing	NULL
needs	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
providentially	NULL
related	NULL
thereto	NULL
as	NULL
stages	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
completion	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
life	NULL
's	NULL
plan	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
presumably	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
lighten	NULL
my	NULL
solitariness	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
matrimonial	NULL
union	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
Miss	NULL
Brooke	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
accurate	NULL
statement	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
feelings	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
rely	NULL
on	NULL
your	NULL
kind	NULL
indulgence	NULL
in	NULL
venturing	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
you	NULL
how	NULL
far	NULL
your	NULL
own	NULL
are	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
nature	NULL
to	NULL
confirm	NULL
my	NULL
happy	NULL
presentiment	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
accepted	NULL
by	NULL
you	NULL
as	NULL
your	NULL
husband	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
earthly	NULL
guardian	NULL
of	NULL
your	NULL
welfare	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
regard	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
highest	NULL
of	NULL
providential	NULL
gifts	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
return	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
offer	NULL
you	NULL
an	NULL
affection	NULL
hitherto	NULL
unwasted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
faithful	NULL
consecration	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
life	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
short	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sequel	NULL
,	NULL
has	NULL
no	NULL
backward	NULL
pages	NULL
whereon	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
choose	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
find	NULL
records	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
might	NULL
justly	NULL
cause	NULL
you	NULL
either	NULL
bitterness	NULL
or	NULL
shame	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
await	NULL
the	NULL
expression	NULL
of	NULL
your	NULL
sentiments	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
anxiety	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
wisdom	NULL
(	NULL
were	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
)	NULL
to	NULL
divert	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
arduous	NULL
labor	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
order	NULL
of	NULL
experience	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
still	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
looking	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
unfavorable	NULL
possibility	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
but	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
resignation	NULL
to	NULL
solitude	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
difficult	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
temporary	NULL
illumination	NULL
of	NULL
hope	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
any	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
remain	NULL
,	NULL
Yours	NULL
with	NULL
sincere	NULL
devotion	NULL
,	NULL
EDWARD	NULL
CASAUBON	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
trembled	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
read	NULL
this	NULL
letter	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
fell	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
knees	NULL
,	NULL
buried	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sobbed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
pray	NULL
:	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
rush	NULL
of	NULL
solemn	NULL
emotion	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
thoughts	NULL
became	NULL
vague	NULL
and	NULL
images	NULL
floated	NULL
uncertainly	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
but	NULL
cast	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
childlike	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
reclining	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lap	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
divine	NULL
consciousness	NULL
which	NULL
sustained	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
attitude	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
dress	NULL
for	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
it	NULL
occur	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
examine	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
critically	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
profession	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
?	NULL

Her	NULL
whole	NULL
soul	NULL
was	NULL
possessed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
fuller	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
opening	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
neophyte	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
higher	NULL
grade	NULL
of	NULL
initiation	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
room	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
energies	NULL
which	NULL
stirred	NULL
uneasily	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
dimness	NULL
and	NULL
pressure	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
ignorance	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
petty	NULL
peremptoriness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
's	NULL
habits	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
devote	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
large	NULL
yet	NULL
definite	NULL
duties	NULL
;	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
continually	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
reverence	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
hope	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
unmixed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
glow	NULL
of	NULL
proud	NULL
delight	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
joyous	NULL
maiden	NULL
surprise	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
chosen	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
whom	NULL
her	NULL
admiration	NULL
had	NULL
chosen	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
passion	NULL
was	NULL
transfused	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
mind	NULL
struggling	NULL
towards	NULL
an	NULL
ideal	NULL
life	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
radiance	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
transfigured	NULL
girlhood	NULL
fell	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
object	NULL
that	NULL
came	NULL
within	NULL
its	NULL
level	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
impetus	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
inclination	NULL
became	NULL
resolution	NULL
was	NULL
heightened	NULL
by	NULL
those	NULL
little	NULL
events	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
roused	NULL
her	NULL
discontent	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
actual	NULL
conditions	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Celia	NULL
was	NULL
playing	NULL
an	NULL
"	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
variations	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
tinkling	NULL
which	NULL
symbolized	NULL
the	NULL
aesthetic	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
'	NULL

,	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
to	NULL
answer	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
should	NULL
she	NULL
defer	NULL
the	NULL
answer	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
wrote	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
the	NULL
wording	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
because	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
was	NULL
unusually	NULL
uncertain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
should	NULL
think	NULL
her	NULL
handwriting	NULL
bad	NULL
and	NULL
illegible	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
piqued	NULL
herself	NULL
on	NULL
writing	NULL
a	NULL
hand	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
each	NULL
letter	NULL
was	NULL
distinguishable	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
large	NULL
range	NULL
of	NULL
conjecture	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
much	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
accomplishment	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL

Three	NULL
times	NULL
she	NULL
wrote	NULL

--	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
very	NULL
grateful	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL

I	NULL
can	NULL
look	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
no	NULL
better	NULL
happiness	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
one	NULL
with	NULL
yours	NULL

If	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
more	NULL

it	NULL
would	NULL
only	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
thing	NULL
written	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
greater	NULL

can	NULL
not	NULL

DOROTHEA	NULL
BROOKE	NULL

Later	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
she	NULL
followed	NULL
her	NULL
uncle	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL

it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL

his	NULL
surprise	NULL
only	NULL
issued	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
moments	NULL

he	NULL
pushed	NULL
about	NULL
various	NULL

quarrelled	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL

whereupon	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
at	NULL
cat	NULL

with	NULL
them	NULL
whenever	NULL

recovered	NULL
themselves	NULL

And	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
something	NULL
wrong	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
Celia	NULL
inwardly	NULL
protested	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
always	NULL
said	NULL
just	NULL
how	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
nothing	NULL
else	NULL

she	NULL
never	NULL
did	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
could	NULL
put	NULL
words	NULL
together	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
Dodo	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
keep	NULL
angry	NULL
for	NULL
long	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
hardly	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL

yet	NULL
when	NULL
Celia	NULL
put	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL

intending	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL

always	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL

Dorothea	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL
seated	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
stool	NULL
,	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
occupy	NULL
herself	NULL
except	NULL
in	NULL
meditation	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
musical	NULL
intonation	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
moments	NULL
of	NULL
deep	NULL
but	NULL
quiet	NULL
feeling	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
speech	NULL

Celia	NULL
knelt	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL

gave	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL

while	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
encircled	NULL

Celia	NULL

in	NULL

how	NULL

The	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
luncheon	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
butler	NULL
,	NULL
handing	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
nodding	NULL
toward	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL

It	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
remarkable	NULL
to	NULL
Celia	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
dinner	NULL
guest	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
announced	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
beforehand	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
following	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
direction	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
struck	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
peculiar	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
announcement	NULL
on	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
reflection	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
sunlit	NULL
wing	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
across	NULL
her	NULL
features	NULL
,	NULL
ending	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
rare	NULL
blushes	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
it	NULL
entered	NULL
into	NULL
Celia	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
something	NULL
more	NULL
between	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
delight	NULL
in	NULL
bookish	NULL
talk	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
delight	NULL
in	NULL
listening	NULL
.	NULL

Hitherto	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
classed	NULL
the	NULL
admiration	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
"	NULL
ugly	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
learned	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
admiration	NULL
for	NULL
Monsieur	NULL
Liret	NULL
at	NULL
Lausanne	NULL
,	NULL
also	NULL
ugly	NULL
and	NULL
learned	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
old	NULL
Monsieur	NULL
Liret	NULL
when	NULL
Celia	NULL
's	NULL
feet	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
cold	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
really	NULL
become	NULL
dreadful	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
skin	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
bald	NULL
head	NULL
moving	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
then	NULL
should	NULL
her	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
not	NULL
extend	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
simply	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
way	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
Monsieur	NULL
Liret	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
probable	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
learned	NULL
men	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
schoolmaster	NULL
's	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
young	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
Celia	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
startled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
suspicion	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
darted	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
seldom	NULL
taken	NULL
by	NULL
surprise	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
marvellous	NULL
quickness	NULL
in	NULL
observing	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
order	NULL
of	NULL
signs	NULL
generally	NULL
preparing	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
expect	NULL
such	NULL
outward	NULL
events	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
now	NULL
imagined	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
already	NULL
an	NULL
accepted	NULL
lover	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
disgust	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
that	NULL
anything	NULL
in	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
could	NULL
tend	NULL
towards	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
issue	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
really	NULL
to	NULL
vex	NULL
her	NULL
about	NULL
Dodo	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
Sir	NULL
James	NULL
Chettam	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
marrying	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
!	NULL

Celia	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
shame	NULL
mingled	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ludicrous	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
perhaps	NULL
Dodo	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
really	NULL
bordering	NULL
on	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
extravagance	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL
:	NULL
experience	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
shown	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
impressibility	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
calculated	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
day	NULL
was	NULL
damp	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
they	NULL
both	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
Celia	NULL
observed	NULL
that	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
settling	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
usual	NULL
diligent	NULL
interest	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
occupation	NULL
,	NULL
simply	NULL
leaned	NULL
her	NULL
elbow	NULL
on	NULL
an	NULL
open	NULL
book	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
cedar	NULL
silvered	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
damp	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
herself	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
making	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
toy	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
curate	NULL
's	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
on	NULL
any	NULL
subject	NULL
too	NULL
precipitately	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
desirable	NULL
for	NULL
Celia	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
momentous	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
position	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
last	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
fair	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
ignorance	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
necessarily	NULL
affect	NULL
her	NULL
attitude	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
shrink	NULL
from	NULL
telling	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
accused	NULL
herself	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
meanness	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
timidity	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
odious	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
any	NULL
small	NULL
fears	NULL
or	NULL
contrivances	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
actions	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
seeking	NULL
the	NULL
highest	NULL

possible	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
dread	NULL

banished	NULL

returned	NULL
Celia	NULL

who	NULL

Celia	NULL
was	NULL
inwardly	NULL
frightened	NULL

and	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL

never	NULL
turned	NULL

pale	NULL
before	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL

it	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
strike	NULL
him	NULL

the	NULL

Already	NULL
the	NULL
knowledge	NULL
that	NULL
Dorothea	NULL

chosen	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
bruised	NULL
his	NULL
attachment	NULL

relaxed	NULL
its	NULL

Although	NULL
Sir	NULL
James	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
feelings	NULL
towards	NULL
women	NULL

towards	NULL
grouse	NULL

foxes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
regard	NULL
his	NULL
future	NULL
wife	NULL
in	NULL

of	NULL
prey	NULL
,	NULL
valuable	NULL
chiefly	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
excitements	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

Neither	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
acquainted	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
habits	NULL
of	NULL
primitive	NULL
races	NULL
as	NULL

feel	NULL
that	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
mere	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL

him	NULL
spun	NULL
little	NULL
threads	NULL

from	NULL
out	NULL

Thus	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL

that	NULL
after	NULL
Sir	NULL

ridden	NULL
rather	NULL
fast	NULL
for	NULL
half	NULL

a	NULL

he	NULL
slackened	NULL
his	NULL
pace	NULL

at	NULL
last	NULL
turned	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
road	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
lead	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
shorter	NULL
cut	NULL

Various	NULL
feelings	NULL
wrought	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
determination	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Grange	NULL
to-day	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
nothing	NULL

happened	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL

had	NULL
never	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
offer	NULL
and	NULL
been	NULL
rejected	NULL

mere	NULL

required	NULL
that	NULL

should	NULL
call	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
cottages	NULL

now	NULL
happily	NULL
Mrs.	NULL

his	NULL
congratulations	NULL

if	NULL

without	NULL

too	NULL

awkwardness	NULL

He	NULL
really	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
:	NULL
giving	NULL
up	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
painful	NULL

there	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL

And	NULL
without	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
spent	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

in	NULL
these	NULL
weeks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
hindrance	NULL
which	NULL
courtship	NULL
occasioned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
progress	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
great	NULL
work	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
Key	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
Mythologies	NULL
--	NULL
naturally	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
look	NULL
forward	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
eagerly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
happy	NULL
termination	NULL
of	NULL
courtship	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
deliberately	NULL
incurred	NULL
the	NULL
hindrance	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
adorn	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
graces	NULL
of	NULL
female	NULL
companionship	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
irradiate	NULL
the	NULL
gloom	NULL
which	NULL
fatigue	NULL
was	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
hang	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
intervals	NULL
of	NULL
studious	NULL
labor	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL
of	NULL
female	NULL
fancy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
secure	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
culminating	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
solace	NULL
of	NULL
female	NULL
tendance	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
declining	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

Hence	NULL
he	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
abandon	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
stream	NULL
of	NULL
feeling	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
what	NULL
an	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
shallow	NULL
rill	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
in	NULL
droughty	NULL
regions	NULL
baptism	NULL
by	NULL
immersion	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
be	NULL
performed	NULL
symbolically	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
sprinkling	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
approach	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
plunge	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
stream	NULL
would	NULL
afford	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
concluded	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
poets	NULL
had	NULL
much	NULL
exaggerated	NULL
the	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
masculine	NULL
passion	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
observed	NULL
with	NULL
pleasure	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Brooke	NULL
showed	NULL
an	NULL
ardent	NULL
submissive	NULL
affection	NULL
which	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
fulfil	NULL
his	NULL
most	NULL
agreeable	NULL
previsions	NULL
of	NULL
marriage	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
crossed	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
possibly	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
some	NULL
deficiency	NULL
in	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
to	NULL
account	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moderation	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
abandonment	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
discern	NULL
the	NULL
deficiency	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
figure	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
pleased	NULL
him	NULL
better	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
clearly	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL

fall	NULL
back	NULL
upon	NULL

exaggerations	NULL

Those	NULL
provinces	NULL

seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
standing-ground	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
all	NULL

could	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
more	NULL
truly	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL

she	NULL
constantly	NULL
doubted	NULL

because	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL

confident	NULL
that	NULL

zeal	NULL

at	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
reached	NULL

Miss	NULL
Brooke	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
very	NULL
naive	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
alleged	NULL

.	NULL

Celia	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL

had	NULL
never	NULL

thought	NULL

saw	NULL
the	NULL
emptiness	NULL

To	NULL
have	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL

little	NULL
feeling	NULL

seems	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
security	NULL
against	NULL
feeling	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
on	NULL
any	NULL
particular	NULL
occasion	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
consented	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL

teach	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
together	NULL

like	NULL
a	NULL
schoolmaster	NULL

little	NULL

Few	NULL
scholars	NULL

disliked	NULL

the	NULL

But	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
herself	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
shocked	NULL
and	NULL
discouraged	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
stupidity	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
answers	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
timid	NULL
questions	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
value	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Greek	NULL
accents	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
painful	NULL
suspicion	NULL
that	NULL
here	NULL

there	NULL

Mr.	NULL

no	NULL

.	NULL

Happily	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
visitor	NULL
was	NULL
shown	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
study	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
fishing	NULL
tackle	NULL
hung	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
himself	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
room	NULL
adjoining	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
work	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
turning	NULL
apparatus	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
baronet	NULL
to	NULL
join	NULL
him	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
two	NULL
were	NULL
better	NULL
friends	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
landholder	NULL
and	NULL
clergyman	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
significant	NULL
fact	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
agreement	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
amiable	NULL
expression	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
faces	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Cadwallader	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
full	NULL
lips	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
sweet	NULL
smile	NULL
;	NULL
very	NULL
plain	NULL
and	NULL
rough	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
exterior	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
solid	NULL
imperturbable	NULL
ease	NULL
and	NULL
good-humor	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
infectious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
like	NULL
great	NULL
grassy	NULL
hills	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sunshine	NULL
,	NULL
quiets	NULL
even	NULL
an	NULL
irritated	NULL
egoism	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
makes	NULL
it	NULL
rather	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
showing	NULL
a	NULL
hand	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
fit	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
grasped	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Sorry	NULL
I	NULL
missed	NULL
you	NULL
before	NULL

there	NULL
anything	NULL

You	NULL
look	NULL
vexed	NULL

Sir	NULL
James	NULL
's	NULL
brow	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
crease	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL

a	NULL
little	NULL
depression	NULL

the	NULL
eyebrow	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
purposely	NULL
to	NULL
exaggerate	NULL

he	NULL
answered	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
this	NULL
conduct	NULL

Brooke	NULL

somebody	NULL

What	NULL
?	NULL

Mr.	NULL

going	NULL

where	NULL

the	NULL

Any	NULL

She	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL

it	NULL
easy	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
behavior	NULL
about	NULL
settlements	NULL
was	NULL
highly	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
preliminaries	NULL
of	NULL
marriage	NULL
rolled	NULL
smoothly	NULL
along	NULL
,	NULL
shortening	NULL
the	NULL
weeks	NULL
of	NULL
courtship	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
betrothed	NULL
bride	NULL
must	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
dictate	NULL
any	NULL
changes	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL

have	NULL
made	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
woman	NULL
dictates	NULL
before	NULL
marriage	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
appetite	NULL
for	NULL
submission	NULL
afterwards	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
certainly	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
mistakes	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
male	NULL
and	NULL
female	NULL
mortals	NULL
make	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
our	NULL
own	NULL
way	NULL
might	NULL
fairly	NULL
raise	NULL
some	NULL
wonder	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
so	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
a	NULL
gray	NULL
but	NULL
dry	NULL
November	NULL
morning	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
drove	NULL
to	NULL
Lowick	NULL
in	NULL
company	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
uncle	NULL
and	NULL
Celia	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
home	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
manor-house	NULL
.	NULL

Close	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
visible	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
parts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
parsonage	NULL
opposite	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
career	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
held	NULL
the	NULL
living	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
brother	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
manor	NULL
also	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
park	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
old	NULL
oak	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
avenue	NULL
of	NULL
limes	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
southwest	NULL
front	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sunk	NULL
fence	NULL
between	NULL
park	NULL
and	NULL
pleasure-ground	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
windows	NULL
the	NULL
glance	NULL
swept	NULL
uninterruptedly	NULL
along	NULL
a	NULL
slope	NULL
of	NULL
greensward	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
limes	NULL
ended	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
level	NULL
of	NULL
corn	NULL
and	NULL
pastures	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
often	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
melt	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
lake	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
setting	NULL
sun	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
happy	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
south	NULL
and	NULL
east	NULL
looked	NULL
rather	NULL
melancholy	NULL
even	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
brightest	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
grounds	NULL
here	NULL
were	NULL
more	NULL
confined	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
flower-beds	NULL
showed	NULL
no	NULL
very	NULL
careful	NULL
tendance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
large	NULL
clumps	NULL
of	NULL
trees	NULL
,	NULL
chiefly	NULL
of	NULL
sombre	NULL
yews	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
high	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
ten	NULL
yards	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
building	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
greenish	NULL
stone	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
English	NULL
style	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
ugly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
small-windowed	NULL
and	NULL
melancholy-looking	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
house	NULL
that	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
many	NULL
flowers	NULL
,	NULL
open	NULL
windows	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
little	NULL
vistas	NULL
of	NULL
bright	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
seem	NULL
a	NULL
joyous	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
latter	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
autumn	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sparse	NULL
remnant	NULL
of	NULL
yellow	NULL
leaves	NULL
falling	NULL
slowly	NULL
athwart	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
evergreens	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
stillness	NULL
without	NULL
sunshine	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
too	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
autumnal	NULL
decline	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
presented	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
bloom	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
thrown	NULL
into	NULL
relief	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
background	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
dear	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

Celia	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
sure	NULL
Freshitt	NULL
Hall	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
pleasanter	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
freestone	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
pillared	NULL
portico	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
terrace	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
flowers	NULL
,	NULL
Sir	NULL
James	NULL
smiling	NULL
above	NULL
them	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
prince	NULL
issuing	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
enchantment	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
rose-bush	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
swiftly	NULL
metamorphosed	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
delicately	NULL
odorous	NULL
petals	NULL
--	NULL
Sir	NULL
James	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
talked	NULL
so	NULL
agreeably	NULL
,	NULL
always	NULL
about	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
common-sense	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
about	NULL
learning	NULL
!	NULL

Celia	NULL
had	NULL
those	NULL
light	NULL
young	NULL
feminine	NULL
tastes	NULL
which	NULL
grave	NULL
and	NULL
weatherworn	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
sometimes	NULL
prefer	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
happily	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
bias	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
different	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
chance	NULL
with	NULL
Celia	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL
,	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
grounds	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
wish	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
book-shelves	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
library	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
carpets	NULL
and	NULL
curtains	NULL
with	NULL
colors	NULL
subdued	NULL
by	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
curious	NULL
old	NULL
maps	NULL
and	NULL
bird	NULL
's	NULL
-	NULL
eye	NULL
views	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
corridor	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
vase	NULL
below	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
oppression	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seemed	NULL
more	NULL
cheerful	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
easts	NULL
and	NULL
pictures	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Grange	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
uncle	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
brought	NULL
home	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
travels	NULL
--	NULL
they	NULL
being	NULL
probably	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
ideas	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
poor	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
these	NULL
severe	NULL
classical	NULL
nudities	NULL
and	NULL
smirking	NULL
Renaissance-Correggiosities	NULL
were	NULL
painfully	NULL
inexplicable	NULL
,	NULL
staring	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
Puritanic	NULL
conceptions	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
taught	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
bring	NULL
them	NULL
into	NULL
any	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
relevance	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
owners	NULL
of	NULL
Lowick	NULL
apparently	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
travellers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
studies	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
carried	NULL
on	NULL
by	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
aids	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
walked	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
with	NULL
delightful	NULL
emotion	NULL
.	NULL

Everything	NULL
seemed	NULL
hallowed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
:	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
home	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
wifehood	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
eyes	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
confidence	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
drew	NULL
her	NULL
attention	NULL
specially	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
actual	NULL
arrangement	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
alteration	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
appeals	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
taste	NULL
she	NULL
met	NULL
gratefully	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
saw	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
alter	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
efforts	NULL
at	NULL
exact	NULL
courtesy	NULL
and	NULL
formal	NULL
tenderness	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
defect	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
filled	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
blanks	NULL
with	NULL
unmanifested	NULL
perfections	NULL
,	NULL
interpreting	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
interpreted	NULL
the	NULL
works	NULL
of	NULL
Providence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
accounting	NULL
for	NULL
seeming	NULL
discords	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
deafness	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
higher	NULL
harmonies	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
many	NULL
blanks	NULL
left	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
weeks	NULL
of	NULL
courtship	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
loving	NULL
faith	NULL
fills	NULL
with	NULL
happy	NULL
assurance	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL

Poor	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
long	NULL
studious	NULL
bachelorhood	NULL
had	NULL
stored	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
compound	NULL
interest	NULL
of	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
large	NULL
drafts	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
affections	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
fail	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
honored	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
we	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
grave	NULL
or	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
get	NULL
our	NULL
thoughts	NULL
entangled	NULL
in	NULL
metaphors	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
act	NULL
fatally	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
strength	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
danger	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
saddened	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
circumstances	NULL
were	NULL
unusually	NULL
happy	NULL
:	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
external	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
account	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
blankness	NULL
of	NULL
sensibility	NULL
which	NULL
came	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
just	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
expectant	NULL
gladness	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
most	NULL
lively	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
exchanged	NULL
the	NULL
accustomed	NULL
dulness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
Lowick	NULL
library	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
visits	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Grange	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
weary	NULL
experience	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
utterly	NULL
condemned	NULL
to	NULL
loneliness	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
despair	NULL
which	NULL
sometimes	NULL
threatened	NULL
him	NULL
while	NULL
toiling	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morass	NULL
of	NULL
authorship	NULL
without	NULL
seeming	NULL
nearer	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
goal	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
his	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
worst	NULL
loneliness	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
shrink	NULL
from	NULL
sympathy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
but	NULL
wish	NULL
that	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
should	NULL
think	NULL
him	NULL
not	NULL
less	NULL
happy	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
would	NULL
expect	NULL
her	NULL
successful	NULL
suitor	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
relation	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
authorship	NULL
he	NULL
leaned	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
young	NULL
trust	NULL
and	NULL
veneration	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
forth	NULL
her	NULL
fresh	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
listening	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
encouragement	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
:	NULL
in	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
presented	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
performance	NULL
and	NULL
intention	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
reflected	NULL
confidence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pedagogue	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rid	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
chilling	NULL
ideal	NULL
audience	NULL
which	NULL
crowded	NULL
his	NULL
laborious	NULL
uncreative	NULL
hours	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
vaporous	NULL
pressure	NULL
of	NULL
Tartarean	NULL
shades	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
to	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
toy-box	NULL
history	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
adapted	NULL
to	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
chief	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
education	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL

this	NULL

this	NULL
surprise	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
nearer	NULL
introduction	NULL
to	NULL
Stoics	NULL
and	NULL
Alexandrians	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
ideas	NULL
not	NULL
totally	NULL
unlike	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL

kept	NULL
in	NULL
abeyance	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
her	NULL
usual	NULL
eagerness	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL

which	NULL
could	NULL
bring	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL

into	NULL

connection	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
amazing	NULL
past	NULL

and	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
remotest	NULL
sources	NULL
of	NULL
knowledge	NULL
some	NULL
bearing	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
actions	NULL

That	NULL
more	NULL
complete	NULL
teaching	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
--	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
higher	NULL
initiation	NULL
in	NULL
ideas	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
blending	NULL
her	NULL
dim	NULL
conceptions	NULL
of	NULL
both	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
mistake	NULL
to	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
cared	NULL
about	NULL
any	NULL
share	NULL
in	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
learning	NULL
as	NULL
mere	NULL
accomplishment	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
though	NULL
opinion	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
neighborhood	NULL
of	NULL
Freshitt	NULL
and	NULL
Tipton	NULL
had	NULL
pronounced	NULL
her	NULL
clever	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
epithet	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
described	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
circles	NULL
in	NULL
whose	NULL
more	NULL
precise	NULL
vocabulary	NULL
cleverness	NULL
implies	NULL
mere	NULL
aptitude	NULL
for	NULL
knowing	NULL
and	NULL
doing	NULL
,	NULL
apart	NULL
from	NULL
character	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
her	NULL
eagerness	NULL
for	NULL
acquirement	NULL
lay	NULL
within	NULL
that	NULL
full	NULL
current	NULL
of	NULL
sympathetic	NULL
motive	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
ideas	NULL
and	NULL
impulses	NULL
were	NULL
habitually	NULL
swept	NULL
along	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
deck	NULL
herself	NULL
with	NULL
knowledge	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
wear	NULL
it	NULL
loose	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
nerves	NULL
and	NULL
blood	NULL
that	NULL
fed	NULL
her	NULL
action	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
Saint	NULL
Theresa	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
command	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
authority	NULL
that	NULL
constrained	NULL
her	NULL
conscience	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
something	NULL
she	NULL
yearned	NULL
for	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
action	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
rational	NULL
and	NULL
ardent	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
by	NULL
for	NULL
guiding	NULL
visions	NULL
and	NULL
spiritual	NULL
directors	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
prayer	NULL
heightened	NULL
yearning	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
instruction	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
lamp	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
but	NULL
knowledge	NULL
?	NULL

Surely	NULL
learned	NULL
men	NULL
kept	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
oil	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
more	NULL
learned	NULL
than	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
?	NULL

Thus	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
brief	NULL
weeks	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
joyous	NULL
grateful	NULL
expectation	NULL
was	NULL
unbroken	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
however	NULL
her	NULL
lover	NULL
might	NULL
occasionally	NULL
be	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
flatness	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
refer	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
slackening	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
affectionate	NULL
interest	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
season	NULL
was	NULL
mild	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
encourage	NULL
the	NULL
project	NULL
of	NULL
extending	NULL
the	NULL
wedding	NULL
journey	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
Rome	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
was	NULL
anxious	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
inspect	NULL
some	NULL
manuscripts	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Vatican	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
still	NULL
regret	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
one	NULL

some	NULL

been	NULL

turning	NULL

Having	NULL
convinced	NULL

They	NULL

kept	NULL
a	NULL

three	NULL

naturally	NULL

Mr.	NULL

altogether	NULL

Mr.	NULL

on	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL

sense	NULL

for	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vincy	NULL

second	NULL

rich	NULL
old	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Featherstone	NULL

had	NULL
died	NULL

that	NULL

it	NULL
happened	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL

successor	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
raised	NULL
some	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Wrench	NULL
,	NULL
medical	NULL
attendant	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Vincy	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
early	NULL
had	NULL
grounds	NULL
for	NULL
thinking	NULL
lightly	NULL
of	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
professional	NULL
discretion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL

not	NULL
retailed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Vincys	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
visitors	NULL
were	NULL
frequent	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
general	NULL
good-fellowship	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
taking	NULL
sides	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
need	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
hasty	NULL
in	NULL
making	NULL
any	NULL
new	NULL
man	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
silently	NULL
wished	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
would	NULL
invite	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
faces	NULL

figures	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL

the	NULL
various	NULL
irregular	NULL
profiles	NULL

gaits	NULL

turns	NULL
of	NULL
phrase	NULL
distinguishing	NULL
those	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
as	NULL
boys	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
with	NULL
girls	NULL
of	NULL
higher	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
brothers	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
possible	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
inevitable	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
companions	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
chosen	NULL
to	NULL
mention	NULL
her	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
part	NULL

was	NULL
in	NULL
no	NULL
hurry	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL

An	NULL
alderman	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
mayor	NULL
must	NULL
by-and-by	NULL
enlarge	NULL
his	NULL
dinner-parties	NULL

at	NULL
present	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
guests	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
well-spread	NULL
table	NULL

That	NULL

often	NULL
remained	NULL
covered	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Vincy	NULL

gone	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
second	NULL
son	NULL

the	NULL
warehouse	NULL

when	NULL
Miss	NULL

on	NULL

who	NULL
found	NULL
any	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
inconvenience	NULL

less	NULL

than	NULL
getting	NULL
up	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL

one	NULL
morning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

sit	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

longer	NULL

then	NULL
giving	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL

laying	NULL

her	NULL

the	NULL

to	NULL
this	NULL
vision	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

whom	NULL
old	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
made	NULL
haste	NULL
ostentatiously	NULL
to	NULL
introduce	NULL

it	NULL

Nothing	NULL
escaped	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
in	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
graceful	NULL
behavior	NULL

how	NULL
delicately	NULL
she	NULL
waived	NULL
the	NULL
notice	NULL

the	NULL

thrust	NULL

her	NULL

showing	NULL
them	NULL
afterwards	NULL

speaking	NULL

Mary	NULL

herself	NULL

Lydgate	NULL

after	NULL

said	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
lightness	NULL
,	NULL
going	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
whip	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
lay	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
distance	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
quick	NULL
in	NULL
anticipating	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
whip	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
present	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
bowed	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
eyes	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
peculiar	NULL
meeting	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
never	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
by	NULL
effort	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
seems	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
divine	NULL
clearance	NULL
of	NULL
haze	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
turned	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
paler	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
blushed	NULL
deeply	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
astonishment	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
stupidity	NULL
her	NULL
uncle	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
of	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
shake	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
this	NULL
result	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
mutual	NULL
impression	NULL
,	NULL
called	NULL
falling	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
what	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
contemplated	NULL
beforehand	NULL
.	NULL

Ever	NULL
since	NULL
that	NULL
important	NULL
new	NULL
arrival	NULL
in	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
woven	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
future	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
this	NULL
scene	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
necessary	NULL
beginning	NULL
.	NULL

Strangers	NULL
,	NULL
whether	NULL
wrecked	NULL
and	NULL
clinging	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
raft	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
duly	NULL
escorted	NULL
and	NULL
accompanied	NULL
by	NULL
portmanteaus	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
always	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
circumstantial	NULL
fascination	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
virgin	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
against	NULL
which	NULL
native	NULL
merit	NULL
has	NULL
urged	NULL
itself	NULL
in	NULL
vain	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
a	NULL
stranger	NULL
was	NULL
absolutely	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
social	NULL
romance	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
turned	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
lover	NULL
and	NULL
bridegroom	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
Middlemarcher	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
connections	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
like	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
:	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
construction	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
demand	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
somehow	NULL
be	NULL
related	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
baronet	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
stranger	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
,	NULL
reality	NULL
proved	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
moving	NULL
than	NULL
anticipation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
epoch	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
judged	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
symptoms	NULL
as	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
awakening	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
held	NULL
it	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
natural	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
fallen	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
things	NULL
happened	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
at	NULL
balls	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
why	NULL
not	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
complexion	NULL
showed	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
no	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
Mary	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
being	NULL
fallen	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
remained	NULL
indifferent	NULL
and	NULL
fastidiously	NULL
critical	NULL
towards	NULL
both	NULL
fresh	NULL
sprig	NULL
and	NULL
faded	NULL
bachelor	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
suddenly	NULL
corresponding	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
ideal	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
altogether	NULL
foreign	NULL
to	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
,	NULL
carrying	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
distinction	NULL
congruous	NULL
with	NULL
good	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
possessing	NULL
connections	NULL
which	NULL
offered	NULL
vistas	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
middle-class	NULL
heaven	NULL
,	NULL
rank	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
talent	NULL
,	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
especially	NULL
delightful	NULL
to	NULL
enslave	NULL
:	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
touched	NULL
her	NULL
nature	NULL
quite	NULL
newly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
brought	NULL
a	NULL
vivid	NULL
interest	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
fancied	NULL
"	NULL
might-be	NULL
"	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
opposing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
actual	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
riding	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
the	NULL
brother	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sister	NULL
were	NULL
preoccupied	NULL
and	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
basis	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
structure	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
airy	NULL
slightness	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
remarkably	NULL
detailed	NULL
and	NULL
realistic	NULL
imagination	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
foundation	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
once	NULL
presupposed	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
ridden	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
far	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
costume	NULL
and	NULL
introductions	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
wedded	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
determined	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
foreseen	NULL
the	NULL
visits	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
pay	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
high-bred	NULL
relatives	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
distance	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
finished	NULL
manners	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
appropriate	NULL
as	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
her	NULL
school	NULL
accomplishments	NULL
,	NULL
preparing	NULL
herself	NULL
thus	NULL
for	NULL
vaguer	NULL
elevations	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
ultimately	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
financial	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
less	NULL
sordid	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
previsions	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
cared	NULL
about	NULL
what	NULL
were	NULL
considered	NULL
refinements	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Fred	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
busy	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
anxiety	NULL
which	NULL
even	NULL
his	NULL
ready	NULL
hopefulness	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
immediately	NULL
quell	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
eluding	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
's	NULL
stupid	NULL
demand	NULL
without	NULL
incurring	NULL
consequences	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
less	NULL
even	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
task	NULL
of	NULL
fulfilling	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
father	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
humor	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
so	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
additional	NULL
coolness	NULL
between	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
family	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Bulstrodes	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
himself	NULL
hated	NULL
having	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
after	NULL
drinking	NULL
wine	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
many	NULL
foolish	NULL
things	NULL
about	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
's	NULL
property	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
these	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
magnified	NULL
by	NULL
report	NULL
.	NULL

Fred	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
wretched	NULL
figure	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
fellow	NULL
who	NULL
bragged	NULL
about	NULL
expectations	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
old	NULL
miser	NULL
like	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
beg	NULL
for	NULL
certificates	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
bidding	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
--	NULL
those	NULL
expectations	NULL
!	NULL

He	NULL
really	NULL
had	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
agreeable	NULL
alternative	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
them	NULL
up	NULL
;	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lately	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
debt	NULL
which	NULL
galled	NULL
him	NULL
extremely	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
old	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
had	NULL
almost	NULL
bargained	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
it	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
whole	NULL
affair	NULL
was	NULL
miserably	NULL
small	NULL
:	NULL
his	NULL
debts	NULL
were	NULL
small	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
his	NULL
expectations	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
anything	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
magnificent	NULL
.	NULL

Fred	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
men	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
confessing	NULL
the	NULL
smallness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
scrapes	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
ruminations	NULL
naturally	NULL
produced	NULL
a	NULL
streak	NULL
of	NULL
misanthropic	NULL
bitterness	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
born	NULL
the	NULL
son	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
manufacturer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
inevitable	NULL
heir	NULL
to	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
particular	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
such	NULL
men	NULL
as	NULL
Mainwaring	NULL
and	NULL
Vyan	NULL
--	NULL
certainly	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
spirited	NULL
young	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
appetite	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
everything	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
poor	NULL
an	NULL
outlook	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
Fred	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
introduction	NULL
of	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
's	NULL
name	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fiction	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
's	NULL
;	NULL
nor	NULL
could	NULL
this	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
any	NULL
difference	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
plainly	NULL
enough	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
exercise	NULL
his	NULL
power	NULL
by	NULL
tormenting	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
also	NULL
probably	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
some	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
terms	NULL
with	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
.	NULL

Fred	NULL
fancied	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
's	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
in	NULL
reality	NULL
half	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
reflex	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
inclinations	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
difficult	NULL
task	NULL
of	NULL
knowing	NULL
another	NULL
soul	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
young	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
whose	NULL

made	NULL
up	NULL

In	NULL
consequence	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
from	NULL
Fred	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
private	NULL
room	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Bank	NULL
at	NULL
half-past	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
usually	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
other	NULL
callers	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
a	NULL
visitor	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
o'clock	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
interview	NULL
being	NULL
over	NULL
in	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
banker	NULL
's	NULL
speech	NULL
was	NULL
fluent	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
copious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
up	NULL
an	NULL
appreciable	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
brief	NULL
meditative	NULL
pauses	NULL
.	NULL

Do	NULL
not	NULL
imagine	NULL
his	NULL
sickly	NULL
aspect	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
yellow	NULL
,	NULL
black-haired	NULL
sort	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
pale	NULL
blond	NULL
skin	NULL
,	NULL
thin	NULL
gray-besprinkled	NULL
brown	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
light-gray	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
forehead	NULL
.	NULL

Loud	NULL
men	NULL
called	NULL
his	NULL
subdued	NULL
tone	NULL
an	NULL
undertone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
implied	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
inconsistent	NULL
with	NULL
openness	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
there	NULL
seems	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
a	NULL
loud	NULL
man	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
concealment	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
except	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
unless	NULL
it	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
shown	NULL
that	NULL
Holy	NULL
Writ	NULL
has	NULL
placed	NULL
the	NULL
seat	NULL
of	NULL
candor	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lungs	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
had	NULL
also	NULL
a	NULL
deferential	NULL
bending	NULL
attitude	NULL
in	NULL
listening	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
apparently	NULL
fixed	NULL
attentiveness	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
those	NULL
persons	NULL
who	NULL
thought	NULL
themselves	NULL
worth	NULL
hearing	NULL
infer	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
seeking	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
improvement	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
discourse	NULL
.	NULL

Others	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
no	NULL
great	NULL
figure	NULL
,	NULL
disliked	NULL
this	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
moral	NULL
lantern	NULL
turned	NULL
on	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
your	NULL
cellar	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
thrill	NULL
of	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
in	NULL
seeing	NULL
your	NULL
guest	NULL
hold	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
wine-glass	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
judicial	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
joys	NULL
are	NULL
reserved	NULL
for	NULL
conscious	NULL
merit	NULL
.	NULL

Hence	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
's	NULL
close	NULL
attention	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
agreeable	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
publicans	NULL

sinners	NULL
in	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
attributed	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL

being	NULL

by	NULL

of	NULL

a	NULL
voice	NULL
habitually	NULL
deep	NULL

About	NULL

Mr.	NULL

Under	NULL

a	NULL

changes	NULL

Mr.	NULL

on	NULL

Mary	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
looked	NULL
rather	NULL
red	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
crying	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
most	NULL
snappish	NULL
humors	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
Fred	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
receiving	NULL
the	NULL
much-needed	NULL
present	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
preferred	NULL
being	NULL
free	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
round	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
tyrant	NULL
and	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
Mary	NULL
Garth	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
good	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
beck	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
Fred	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
barely	NULL
noticed	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
her	NULL
nerves	NULL
were	NULL
quivering	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
expectation	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
thrown	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
anything	NULL
worse	NULL
than	NULL
words	NULL
to	NULL
dread	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
reach	NULL
the	NULL
waistcoat	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
peg	NULL
,	NULL
Fred	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

said	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

it	NULL
alone	NULL

it	NULL
down	NULL
here	NULL

said	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Featherstone	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
you	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
again	NULL

I	NULL
call	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
added	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
waistcoat	NULL
was	NULL
laid	NULL
down	NULL
by	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
usual	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
season	NULL
his	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
showing	NULL
favor	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
person	NULL
by	NULL
being	NULL
especially	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
to	NULL
another	NULL

Mary	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL

furnish	NULL
the	NULL
condiment	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
relatives	NULL
came	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
treated	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

Slowly	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
bunch	NULL
of	NULL
keys	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
waistcoat	NULL
pocket	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
slowly	NULL
he	NULL
drew	NULL
forth	NULL
a	NULL
tin	NULL
box	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
bed-clothes	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

going	NULL

give	NULL
you	NULL

little	NULL
fortune	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
above	NULL
his	NULL
spectacles	NULL

pausing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
act	NULL
of	NULL
opening	NULL
the	NULL
lid	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL

were	NULL

But	NULL
Fred	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hopeful	NULL
disposition	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
vision	NULL
had	NULL
presented	NULL
itself	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sum	NULL
just	NULL
large	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
deliver	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
anxiety	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Fred	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
debt	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
always	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
highly	NULL
probable	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
necessarily	NULL
conceive	NULL
what	NULL
--	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
enabling	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
in	NULL
due	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
providential	NULL
occurrence	NULL
was	NULL
apparently	NULL
close	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
sheer	NULL
absurdity	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
supply	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
short	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
need	NULL
:	NULL
as	NULL
absurd	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
faith	NULL
that	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
miracle	NULL
for	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
strength	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
whole	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
deep-veined	NULL
hands	NULL
fingered	NULL
many	NULL
bank-notes-one	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
laying	NULL
them	NULL
down	NULL
flat	NULL
again	NULL

while	NULL
Fred	NULL
leaned	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
scorning	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
eager	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
held	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
at	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
courting	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
fellow	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
eyed	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
spectacles	NULL
and	NULL
presented	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
sheaf	NULL
of	NULL
notes	NULL
:	NULL
Fred	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
distinctly	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
but	NULL
five	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
significant	NULL
edges	NULL
gaped	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
might	NULL
mean	NULL
fifty	NULL
pounds	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
roll	NULL
them	NULL
up	NULL
without	NULL
seeming	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
value	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
suit	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL
eying	NULL
him	NULL
intently	NULL

was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
counted	NULL
them	NULL

For	NULL
they	NULL
actually	NULL

the	NULL
absurdity	NULL

less	NULL

behind	NULL
him	NULL

The	NULL
collapse	NULL
for	NULL
Fred	NULL
was	NULL
severe	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
no	NULL

and	NULL
his	NULL
share	NULL

the	NULL

this	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL

with	NULL
rapid	NULL
changes	NULL

that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
could	NULL
know	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Sprague	NULL
and	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Minchin	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
physicians	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
alone	NULL
could	NULL
offer	NULL
any	NULL
hope	NULL
when	NULL
danger	NULL
was	NULL
extreme	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
smallest	NULL
hope	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
a	NULL
guinea	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
repeat	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
rather	NULL
more	NULL
uncommon	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
general	NULL
practitioner	NULL
in	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
seven-and-twenty	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
age	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
many	NULL
men	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
common	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
hopeful	NULL
of	NULL
achievement	NULL
,	NULL
resolute	NULL
in	NULL
avoidance	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
Mammon	NULL
shall	NULL
never	NULL
put	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
mouths	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
astride	NULL
their	NULL
backs	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
rather	NULL
that	NULL
Mammon	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
shall	NULL
draw	NULL
their	NULL
chariot	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
left	NULL
an	NULL
orphan	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
fresh	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
public	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
military	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
but	NULL
little	NULL
provision	NULL
for	NULL
three	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
Tertius	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
medical	NULL
education	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
easier	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
guardians	NULL
to	NULL
grant	NULL
his	NULL
request	NULL
by	NULL
apprenticing	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
country	NULL
practitioner	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
any	NULL
objections	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
score	NULL
of	NULL
family	NULL
dignity	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rarer	NULL
lads	NULL
who	NULL
early	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
decided	NULL
bent	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
their	NULL
minds	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
something	NULL
particular	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
sake	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
because	NULL
their	NULL
fathers	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Most	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
who	NULL
turn	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
subject	NULL
with	NULL
love	NULL
remember	NULL
some	NULL
morning	NULL
or	NULL
evening	NULL
hour	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
high	NULL
stool	NULL
to	NULL
reach	NULL
down	NULL
an	NULL
untried	NULL
volume	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
parted	NULL
lips	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
talker	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
for	NULL
very	NULL
lack	NULL
of	NULL
books	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
voices	NULL
within	NULL

as	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
traceable	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

Something	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
hot	NULL
from	NULL
play	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
toss	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
be	NULL
deep	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
book	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
lay	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
on	NULL
:	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
Rasselas	NULL
or	NULL
Gulliver	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Bailey	NULL
's	NULL
Dictionary	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
Bible	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Apocrypha	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Something	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
read	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
riding	NULL
the	NULL
pony	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
running	NULL
and	NULL
hunting	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
ten	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
age	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
then	NULL
read	NULL
through	NULL
"	NULL
Chrysal	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
Adventures	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Guinea	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
neither	NULL
milk	NULL
for	NULL
babes	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
any	NULL
chalky	NULL
mixture	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
for	NULL
milk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
books	NULL
were	NULL
stuff	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
stupid	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
school	NULL
studies	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
modified	NULL
that	NULL
opinion	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
"	NULL
did	NULL
"	NULL
his	NULL
classics	NULL
and	NULL
mathematics	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
pre-eminent	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
said	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
certainly	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
remarkable	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
vigorous	NULL
animal	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
ready	NULL
understanding	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
spark	NULL
had	NULL
yet	NULL
kindled	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
intellectual	NULL
passion	NULL
;	NULL
knowledge	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
superficial	NULL
affair	NULL
,	NULL
easily	NULL
mastered	NULL
:	NULL
judging	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
elders	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
apparently	NULL
got	NULL
already	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
mature	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Probably	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
an	NULL
exceptional	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
expensive	NULL
teaching	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
period	NULL
of	NULL
short-waisted	NULL
coats	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
fashions	NULL
which	NULL
have	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
recurred	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
vacation	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
wet	NULL
day	NULL
sent	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
home	NULL
library	NULL
to	NULL
hunt	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
some	NULL
freshness	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
in	NULL
vain	NULL
!	NULL

unless	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
dusty	NULL
row	NULL
of	NULL
volumes	NULL
with	NULL
gray-paper	NULL
backs	NULL
and	NULL
dingy	NULL
labels	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
volumes	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
Cyclopaedia	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
disturbed	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
novelty	NULL
to	NULL
disturb	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
highest	NULL
shelf	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
chair	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
them	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
volume	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
first	NULL
took	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
shelf	NULL
:	NULL
somehow	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
is	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
makeshift	NULL
attitude	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
seem	NULL
inconvenient	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
page	NULL
he	NULL
opened	NULL
on	NULL
was	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
Anatomy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
passage	NULL
that	NULL
drew	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
valves	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
acquainted	NULL
with	NULL
valves	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
sort	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
valvae	NULL
were	NULL
folding-doors	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
through	NULL
this	NULL
crevice	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
light	NULL
startling	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
vivid	NULL
notion	NULL
of	NULL
finely	NULL
adjusted	NULL
mechanism	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
human	NULL
frame	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
liberal	NULL
education	NULL
had	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
free	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
indecent	NULL
passages	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
classics	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
beyond	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
secrecy	NULL
and	NULL
obscenity	NULL
in	NULL
connection	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
internal	NULL
structure	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
quite	NULL
unbiassed	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
anything	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
his	NULL
brains	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
small	NULL
bags	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
temples	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
representing	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
how	NULL
his	NULL
blood	NULL
circulated	NULL
than	NULL
how	NULL
paper	NULL
served	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
gold	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
vocation	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
down	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
new	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
presentiment	NULL
of	NULL
endless	NULL
processes	NULL
filling	NULL
the	NULL
vast	NULL
spaces	NULL
planked	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
sight	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
wordy	NULL
ignorance	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
knowledge	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
that	NULL
hour	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
growth	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
intellectual	NULL
passion	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
telling	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
again	NULL
how	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
comes	NULL
to	NULL
fall	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
wedded	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
else	NULL
be	NULL
fatally	NULL
parted	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Is	NULL
it	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
excess	NULL
of	NULL
poetry	NULL
or	NULL
of	NULL
stupidity	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
never	NULL
weary	NULL
of	NULL
describing	NULL
what	NULL
King	NULL
James	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
"	NULL
makdom	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
fairnesse	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
never	NULL
weary	NULL
of	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
twanging	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
Troubadour	NULL
strings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
are	NULL
comparatively	NULL
uninterested	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
other	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
makdom	NULL
and	NULL
fairnesse	NULL
"	NULL
which	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
wooed	NULL
with	NULL
industrious	NULL
thought	NULL
and	NULL
patient	NULL
renunciation	NULL
of	NULL
small	NULL

?	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
development	NULL
varies	NULL
:	NULL
sometimes	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
glorious	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
sometimes	NULL
frustration	NULL
and	NULL
final	NULL
parting	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
not	NULL
seldom	NULL
the	NULL
catastrophe	NULL
is	NULL
bound	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
passion	NULL

sung	NULL
by	NULL

Troubadours	NULL

For	NULL

middle-aged	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
go	NULL

the	NULL

In	NULL

they	NULL
inhaled	NULL
it	NULL
unknowingly	NULL

you	NULL

I	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
sent	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
breath	NULL

we	NULL

perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
vibrations	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL

.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
failures	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
because	NULL
his	NULL
scientific	NULL
interest	NULL
soon	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
professional	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
youthful	NULL
belief	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
bread-winning	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
stifled	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
initiation	NULL
in	NULL
makeshift	NULL
called	NULL
his	NULL
'	NULL
prentice	NULL
days	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
carried	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
studies	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
Edinburgh	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
medical	NULL
profession	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
finest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
;	NULL
presenting	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
perfect	NULL
interchange	NULL
between	NULL
science	NULL

offering	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
direct	NULL
alliance	NULL
between	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL

.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
nature	NULL
demanded	NULL
this	NULL
combination	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
emotional	NULL
creature	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
flesh-and-blood	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
fellowship	NULL
which	NULL
withstood	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
abstractions	NULL
of	NULL
special	NULL
study	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
cared	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
for	NULL
"	NULL
cases	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
John	NULL
and	NULL
Elizabeth	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
Elizabeth	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
another	NULL
attraction	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
profession	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
wanted	NULL
reform	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
indignant	NULL
resolve	NULL
to	NULL
reject	NULL
its	NULL
venal	NULL
decorations	NULL

other	NULL

,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
possessor	NULL
of	NULL
genuine	NULL
though	NULL
undemanded	NULL
qualifications	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
study	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
determination	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
home	NULL
again	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
settle	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
provincial	NULL
town	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
practitioner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
resist	NULL
the	NULL
irrational	NULL
severance	NULL
between	NULL
medical	NULL
and	NULL
surgical	NULL
knowledge	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
interest	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
scientific	NULL
pursuits	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
advance	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
keep	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
range	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
intrigues	NULL
,	NULL
jealousies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
social	NULL
truckling	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
win	NULL
celebrity	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Jenner	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
independent	NULL
value	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
period	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
venerable	NULL
colleges	NULL
which	NULL
used	NULL
great	NULL
efforts	NULL
to	NULL
secure	NULL
purity	NULL
of	NULL
knowledge	NULL
by	NULL
making	NULL
it	NULL
scarce	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
exclude	NULL
error	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
rigid	NULL
exclusiveness	NULL
in	NULL

prescribed	NULL
by	NULL
unscrupulous	NULL
ignorance	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
no	NULL

Considering	NULL
that	NULL

had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
embraced	NULL
a	NULL
calculation	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL

canting	NULL
doctors	NULL
which	NULL
absolutely	NULL
must	NULL
exist	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
teeth	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
changes	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
units	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
direct	NULL
mode	NULL
of	NULL
changing	NULL
the	NULL
numbers	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
unit	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
difference	NULL
towards	NULL
that	NULL
spreading	NULL

which	NULL
would	NULL
one	NULL

the	NULL

making	NULL
an	NULL
advantageous	NULL
difference	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
viscera	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
patients	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
simply	NULL
aim	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
genuine	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
practice	NULL
than	NULL
was	NULL
common	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
ambitious	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
wider	NULL
effect	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
fired	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
work	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
proof	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
anatomical	NULL
conception	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
link	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
chain	NULL
of	NULL
discovery	NULL
.	NULL

Does	NULL
it	NULL
seem	NULL
incongruous	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
surgeon	NULL
should	NULL
dream	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
discoverer	NULL
?	NULL

Most	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
know	NULL
little	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
originators	NULL
until	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
lifted	NULL
up	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL

and	NULL
already	NULL
rule	NULL
our	NULL
fates	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
Herschel	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
example	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
"	NULL
broke	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL

"	NULL
--	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
once	NULL
play	NULL
a	NULL
provincial	NULL
church-organ	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
give	NULL
music-lessons	NULL
to	NULL
stumbling	NULL
pianists	NULL
?	NULL

Each	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
Shining	NULL
Ones	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
among	NULL
neighbors	NULL
who	NULL
perhaps	NULL
thought	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
gait	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
garments	NULL
than	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
title	NULL
to	NULL
everlasting	NULL
fame	NULL
:	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
little	NULL
local	NULL
personal	NULL
history	NULL
sprinkled	NULL
with	NULL
small	NULL
temptations	NULL
and	NULL
sordid	NULL
cares	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
retarding	NULL
friction	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
course	NULL
towards	NULL
final	NULL
companionship	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
immortals	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
blind	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dangers	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
friction	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
confidence	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
resolution	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
:	NULL
being	NULL
seven-and-twenty	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
experienced	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
his	NULL
vanities	NULL
provoked	NULL
by	NULL
contact	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
showy	NULL
worldly	NULL
successes	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
capital	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
among	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
hold	NULL
no	NULL
rivalry	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
pursuit	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
idea	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
twin	NULL
object	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
assiduous	NULL
practice	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
profession	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
fascination	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
purposes	NULL
would	NULL
illuminate	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
careful	NULL
observation	NULL
and	NULL
inference	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
daily	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lens	NULL
to	NULL
further	NULL
his	NULL
judgment	NULL
in	NULL
special	NULL
cases	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
further	NULL
his	NULL
thought	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
instrument	NULL
of	NULL
larger	NULL
inquiry	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
not	NULL
this	NULL
the	NULL
typical	NULL
pre-eminence	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
profession	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
doctor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL
means	NULL
keep	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
track	NULL
of	NULL
far-reaching	NULL
investigation	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
one	NULL
point	NULL
he	NULL
may	NULL
fairly	NULL
claim	NULL
approval	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
particular	NULL
stage	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
career	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
imitate	NULL
those	NULL
philanthropic	NULL
models	NULL
who	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
profit	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
poisonous	NULL
pickles	NULL
to	NULL
support	NULL
themselves	NULL
while	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
exposing	NULL
adulteration	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
hold	NULL
shares	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
gambling-hell	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
leisure	NULL
to	NULL
represent	NULL
the	NULL
cause	NULL
of	NULL
public	NULL
morality	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
intended	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
case	NULL
some	NULL
particular	NULL
reforms	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
quite	NULL
certainly	NULL
within	NULL
his	NULL
reach	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
much	NULL
less	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
problem	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
demonstrating	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
anatomical	NULL
conception	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
reforms	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
act	NULL
stoutly	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
strength	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
recent	NULL
legal	NULL
decision	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
simply	NULL
prescribe	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
dispensing	NULL
drugs	NULL
or	NULL
taking	NULL
percentage	NULL
from	NULL
druggists	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
innovation	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
chosen	NULL
to	NULL
adopt	NULL
the	NULL
style	NULL
of	NULL
general	NULL
practitioner	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
country	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
offensive	NULL
criticism	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
professional	NULL
brethren	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
innovate	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
treatment	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
wise	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
security	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
practising	NULL
honestly	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
belief	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
systematic	NULL
temptations	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
cheerful	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
observers	NULL
and	NULL
theorizers	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
;	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
finest	NULL
era	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
when	NULL
America	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
discovered	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
bold	NULL
sailor	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
wrecked	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
alight	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
kingdom	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
about	NULL
1829	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
territories	NULL
of	NULL
Pathology	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
America	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
spirited	NULL
young	NULL
adventurer	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
ambitious	NULL
above	NULL
all	NULL
to	NULL
contribute	NULL
towards	NULL
enlarging	NULL
the	NULL
scientific	NULL
,	NULL
rational	NULL
basis	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
profession	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
more	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
special	NULL
questions	NULL
of	NULL
disease	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
fever	NULL
or	NULL
fevers	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
keenly	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
need	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
fundamental	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
structure	NULL
which	NULL
just	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
century	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
illuminated	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
brief	NULL
and	NULL
glorious	NULL
career	NULL
of	NULL
Bichat	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
died	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
one-and-thirty	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
another	NULL
Alexander	NULL
,	NULL
left	NULL
a	NULL
realm	NULL
large	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
heirs	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
great	NULL
Frenchman	NULL
first	NULL
carried	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
conception	NULL
that	NULL
living	NULL
bodies	NULL
,	NULL
fundamentally	NULL
considered	NULL
,	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
associations	NULL
of	NULL
organs	NULL
which	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
understood	NULL
by	NULL
studying	NULL
them	NULL
first	NULL
apart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
federally	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
regarded	NULL
as	NULL
consisting	NULL
of	NULL
certain	NULL
primary	NULL
webs	NULL
or	NULL
tissues	NULL
,	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
organs	NULL
--	NULL
brain	NULL
,	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
lungs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
on	NULL
--	NULL
are	NULL
compacted	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
accommodations	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
are	NULL
built	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
various	NULL
proportions	NULL
of	NULL
wood	NULL
,	NULL
iron	NULL
,	NULL
stone	NULL
,	NULL
brick	NULL
,	NULL
zinc	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
material	NULL
having	NULL
its	NULL
peculiar	NULL
composition	NULL
and	NULL
proportions	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
sees	NULL
,	NULL
can	NULL
understand	NULL
and	NULL
estimate	NULL
the	NULL
entire	NULL
structure	NULL
or	NULL
its	NULL
parts	NULL
--	NULL
what	NULL
are	NULL
its	NULL
frailties	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
its	NULL
repairs	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
knowing	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
materials	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
conception	NULL
wrought	NULL
out	NULL
by	NULL
Bichat	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
detailed	NULL
study	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
different	NULL
tissues	NULL
,	NULL
acted	NULL
necessarily	NULL
on	NULL
medical	NULL
questions	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
turning	NULL
of	NULL
gas-light	NULL
would	NULL
act	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
dim	NULL

oil-lit	NULL
street	NULL
,	NULL
showing	NULL
new	NULL
connections	NULL
and	NULL
hitherto	NULL
hidden	NULL
facts	NULL
of	NULL
structure	NULL
which	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
into	NULL
account	NULL
in	NULL
considering	NULL
the	NULL
symptoms	NULL
of	NULL
maladies	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
action	NULL
of	NULL
medicaments	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
results	NULL
which	NULL
depend	NULL
on	NULL
human	NULL
conscience	NULL
and	NULL
intelligence	NULL
work	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
1829	NULL
,	NULL
most	NULL
medical	NULL
practice	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
strutting	NULL
or	NULL
shambling	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
paths	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
scientific	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
direct	NULL
sequence	NULL
of	NULL
Bichat	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
great	NULL
seer	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
consideration	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tissues	NULL
as	NULL
ultimate	NULL
facts	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
living	NULL
organism	NULL
,	NULL
marking	NULL
the	NULL
limit	NULL
of	NULL
anatomical	NULL
analysis	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
open	NULL
to	NULL
another	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
not	NULL
these	NULL
structures	NULL
some	NULL
common	NULL
basis	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
all	NULL
started	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
your	NULL
sarsnet	NULL
,	NULL
gauze	NULL
,	NULL
net	NULL
,	NULL
satin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
velvet	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
raw	NULL
cocoon	NULL
?	NULL

Here	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
another	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
oxy-hydrogen	NULL
,	NULL
showing	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
grain	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
revising	NULL
all	NULL
former	NULL
explanations	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
this	NULL
sequence	NULL
to	NULL
Bichat	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
already	NULL
vibrating	NULL
along	NULL
many	NULL
currents	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
European	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
enamoured	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
longed	NULL
to	NULL
demonstrate	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
intimate	NULL
relations	NULL
of	NULL
living	NULL
structure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
help	NULL
to	NULL
define	NULL
men	NULL
's	NULL
thought	NULL
more	NULL
accurately	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
true	NULL
order	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
work	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
been	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
the	NULL
preparation	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
primitive	NULL
tissue	NULL
?	NULL

In	NULL
that	NULL
way	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
required	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
awaiting	NULL
answer	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
such	NULL
missing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
word	NULL
befalls	NULL
many	NULL
seekers	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
counted	NULL
on	NULL
quiet	NULL
intervals	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
watchfully	NULL
seized	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
taking	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
threads	NULL
of	NULL
investigation	NULL

on	NULL
many	NULL
hints	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
won	NULL
from	NULL
diligent	NULL
application	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
scalpel	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
microscope	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
research	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
again	NULL
with	NULL
new	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
of	NULL

Such	NULL
was	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
plan	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
future	NULL

to	NULL
do	NULL
good	NULL
small	NULL
work	NULL
for	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL

and	NULL
great	NULL
work	NULL
for	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
a	NULL
happy	NULL
fellow	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
:	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
seven-and-twenty	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL

with	NULL

that	NULL

and	NULL
with	NULL
ideas	NULL

The	NULL

All	NULL
these	NULL

alleged	NULL

Lydgate	NULL

then	NULL

they	NULL

Lydgate	NULL

was	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
arrogant	NULL

never	NULL
simpering	NULL

never	NULL

but	NULL
massive	NULL
in	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
a	NULL

quite	NULL
sure	NULL

they	NULL

no	NULL

over	NULL
him	NULL

he	NULL

in	NULL

turn	NULL
them	NULL
against	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL

All	NULL
his	NULL
faults	NULL
were	NULL
marked	NULL
by	NULL
kindred	NULL

were	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL

a	NULL

How	NULL

there	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
complexion	NULL

which	NULL

in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
noble	NULL
intention	NULL

were	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
are	NULL
found	NULL
in	NULL
ordinary	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
:	NULL
that	NULL
distinction	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
which	NULL
belonged	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
intellectual	NULL
ardor	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
penetrate	NULL
his	NULL
feeling	NULL
and	NULL
judgment	NULL
about	NULL
furniture	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
desirability	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
being	NULL
known	NULL
(	NULL
without	NULL
his	NULL
telling	NULL
)	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
born	NULL
than	NULL
other	NULL
country	NULL

.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
furniture	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
feared	NULL
that	NULL
neither	NULL
biology	NULL
nor	NULL
schemes	NULL

reform	NULL
would	NULL
lift	NULL
him	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
vulgarity	NULL
of	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
an	NULL
incompatibility	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
furniture	NULL
not	NULL
being	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
to	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
already	NULL
been	NULL
drawn	NULL
headlong	NULL
by	NULL
impetuous	NULL
folly	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
final	NULL

since	NULL
marriage	NULL
at	NULL
some	NULL
distant	NULL
period	NULL
would	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
not	NULL

For	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
acquainted	NULL
with	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
good	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
impetuous	NULL
folly	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
stand	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
example	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fitful	NULL
swerving	NULL
of	NULL
passion	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
prone	NULL
,	NULL
together	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
chivalrous	NULL
kindness	NULL
which	NULL
helped	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
morally	NULL
lovable	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
story	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
told	NULL
without	NULL
many	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
happened	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
studying	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
above	NULL
his	NULL
other	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
galvanic	NULL
experiments	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
tired	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
experimenting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
being	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
elicit	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
he	NULL
needed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
his	NULL
frogs	NULL
and	NULL
rabbits	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
repose	NULL
under	NULL
their	NULL
trying	NULL
and	NULL
mysterious	NULL
dispensation	NULL
of	NULL
unexplained	NULL
shocks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
finish	NULL
his	NULL
evening	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
theatre	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Porte	NULL
Saint	NULL
Martin	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
melodrama	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
seen	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL
;	NULL
attracted	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
ingenious	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
collaborating	NULL
authors	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
actress	NULL
whose	NULL
part	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
stab	NULL
her	NULL
lover	NULL
,	NULL
mistaking	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
evil-designing	NULL
duke	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
piece	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
actress	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
expects	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Provencale	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
dark	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
Greek	NULL
profile	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rounded	NULL
majestic	NULL
form	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
beauty	NULL
which	NULL
carries	NULL
a	NULL
sweet	NULL
matronliness	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
youth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
soft	NULL
cooing	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
but	NULL
lately	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
bore	NULL
a	NULL
virtuous	NULL
reputation	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
acting	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
unfortunate	NULL
lover	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
acting	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
"	NULL
no	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
was	NULL
satisfied	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
only	NULL
relaxation	NULL
now	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
thrown	NULL
himself	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
breath	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sweet	NULL
south	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
bank	NULL
of	NULL
violets	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
prejudice	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
galvanism	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
presently	NULL
return	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
evening	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
drama	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
catastrophe	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
heroine	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
act	NULL
the	NULL
stabbing	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
lover	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
fall	NULL
gracefully	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
wife	NULL
veritably	NULL
stabbed	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
fell	NULL
as	NULL
death	NULL
willed	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
wild	NULL
shriek	NULL
pierced	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Provencale	NULL
fell	NULL
swooning	NULL
:	NULL
a	NULL
shriek	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
swoon	NULL
were	NULL
demanded	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
swooning	NULL
too	NULL
was	NULL
real	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
leaped	NULL
and	NULL
climbed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
hardly	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
stage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
active	NULL
in	NULL
help	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
the	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
heroine	NULL
by	NULL
finding	NULL
a	NULL
contusion	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
lifting	NULL
her	NULL
gently	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

Paris	NULL
rang	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
death	NULL
:	NULL
--	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
murder	NULL
?	NULL

Some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
actress	NULL
's	NULL
warmest	NULL
admirers	NULL
were	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
guilt	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
liked	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
(	NULL
such	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
taste	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
times	NULL
)	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
vehemently	NULL
contended	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
innocence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
remote	NULL
impersonal	NULL
passion	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
beauty	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
now	NULL
into	NULL
personal	NULL
devotion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tender	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
lot	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
notion	NULL
of	NULL
murder	NULL
was	NULL
absurd	NULL
:	NULL
no	NULL
motive	NULL
was	NULL
discoverable	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
couple	NULL
being	NULL
understood	NULL
to	NULL
dote	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
unprecedented	NULL
that	NULL
an	NULL
accidental	NULL
slip	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
brought	NULL
these	NULL
grave	NULL
consequences	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
legal	NULL
investigation	NULL
ended	NULL
in	NULL
Madame	NULL
Laure	NULL
's	NULL
release	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
many	NULL
interviews	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
adorable	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
talked	NULL
little	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
additional	NULL
charm	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
melancholy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seemed	NULL
grateful	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
presence	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
light	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
madly	NULL
anxious	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
affection	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
jealous	NULL
lest	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
man	NULL
than	NULL
himself	NULL
should	NULL
win	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
ask	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
reopening	NULL
her	NULL
engagement	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Porte	NULL
Saint	NULL
Martin	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
popular	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
fatal	NULL
episode	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
left	NULL
Paris	NULL
without	NULL
warning	NULL
,	NULL
forsaking	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
court	NULL
of	NULL
admirers	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
carried	NULL
inquiry	NULL
far	NULL
except	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
science	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
stand-still	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
imagined	NULL
the	NULL
unhappy	NULL
Laure	NULL
,	NULL
stricken	NULL
by	NULL
ever-wandering	NULL
sorrow	NULL
,	NULL
herself	NULL
wandering	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finding	NULL
no	NULL
faithful	NULL
comforter	NULL
.	NULL

Hidden	NULL
actresses	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
as	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
hidden	NULL
facts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
long	NULL
before	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
gathered	NULL
indications	NULL
that	NULL
Laure	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
route	NULL
to	NULL
Lyons	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
acting	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
success	NULL
at	NULL
Avignon	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
more	NULL
majestic	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
forsaken	NULL
wife	NULL
carrying	NULL
her	NULL
child	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
received	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
quietude	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
beautiful	NULL
as	NULL
clear	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
obtained	NULL
leave	NULL
to	NULL
visit	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
bent	NULL
on	NULL
telling	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
adored	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
asking	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
sudden	NULL
impulse	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
madman	NULL
--	NULL
incongruous	NULL
even	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
habitual	NULL
foibles	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
matter	NULL
!	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
two	NULL
selves	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
apparently	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
learn	NULL
to	NULL
accommodate	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
and	NULL
bear	NULL
reciprocal	NULL

Three	NULL

at	NULL

SIR	NULL

The	NULL
question	NULL
whether	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Tyke	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
appointed	NULL
as	NULL
salaried	NULL
chaplain	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
exciting	NULL
topic	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Middlemarchers	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
heard	NULL
it	NULL
discussed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
that	NULL
threw	NULL
much	NULL
light	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
exercised	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
by	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
banker	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
a	NULL
ruler	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
opposition	NULL
party	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
among	NULL
his	NULL
supporters	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
some	NULL
who	NULL
allowed	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
support	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
compromise	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
frankly	NULL
stated	NULL
their	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
scheme	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
especially	NULL
the	NULL
casualties	NULL
of	NULL
trade	NULL
,	NULL
required	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
a	NULL
candle	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
devil	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
's	NULL
power	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
due	NULL
simply	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
country	NULL
banker	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
financial	NULL
secrets	NULL
of	NULL
most	NULL
traders	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
touch	NULL
the	NULL
springs	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
credit	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
fortified	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
beneficence	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
ready	NULL
and	NULL
severe	NULL
--	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
confer	NULL
obligations	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
severe	NULL
in	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
gathered	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
industrious	NULL
man	NULL
always	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
post	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
chief	NULL
share	NULL
in	NULL
administering	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
charities	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
private	NULL
charities	NULL
were	NULL
both	NULL
minute	NULL
and	NULL
abundant	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
pains	NULL
about	NULL
apprenticing	NULL
Tegg	NULL
the	NULL
shoemaker	NULL
's	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
watch	NULL
over	NULL
Tegg	NULL
's	NULL
church-going	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
defend	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Strype	NULL
the	NULL
washerwoman	NULL
against	NULL
Stubbs	NULL
's	NULL
unjust	NULL
exaction	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
score	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
drying-ground	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
himself	NULL
scrutinize	NULL
a	NULL
calumny	NULL
against	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Strype	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
private	NULL
minor	NULL
loans	NULL
were	NULL
numerous	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
inquire	NULL
strictly	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
both	NULL
before	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
gathers	NULL
a	NULL
domain	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
neighbors	NULL
'	NULL
hope	NULL
and	NULL
fear	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
gratitude	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
power	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
once	NULL
it	NULL
has	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
that	NULL
subtle	NULL
region	NULL
,	NULL
propagates	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
spreading	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
proportion	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
external	NULL
means	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
principle	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
to	NULL
gain	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
power	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
use	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
glory	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
spiritual	NULL
conflict	NULL
and	NULL
inward	NULL
argument	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
adjust	NULL
his	NULL
motives	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
clear	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
what	NULL
God	NULL
's	NULL
glory	NULL
required	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
motives	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
rightly	NULL
appreciated	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
many	NULL
crass	NULL
minds	NULL
in	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
whose	NULL
reflective	NULL
scales	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
weigh	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lump	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
suspicion	NULL
that	NULL
since	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
enjoy	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
eating	NULL
and	NULL
drinking	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
worreting	NULL
himself	NULL
about	NULL
everything	NULL

he	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL

in	NULL

sense	NULL
of	NULL

The	NULL
subject	NULL

came	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
Mr.	NULL

dining	NULL
there	NULL

his	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL
rejection	NULL

the	NULL
belief	NULL

life	NULL
as	NULL

made	NULL

house	NULL
exceptional	NULL

at	NULL
that	NULL

when	NULL

survived	NULL

Before	NULL
it	NULL
ceased	NULL
Mr.	NULL

a	NULL

about	NULL

the	NULL

was	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL

quick	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
like	NULL

arresting	NULL
little	NULL
Louisa	NULL
with	NULL

was	NULL

led	NULL
out	NULL

Miss	NULL
Morgan	NULL

greeting	NULL
everybody	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL

seeming	NULL

condense	NULL
more	NULL
talk	NULL
into	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
than	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
held	NULL
all	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
claimed	NULL
from	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
the	NULL
fulfilment	NULL

promise	NULL

come	NULL

see	NULL

soon	NULL
he	NULL
swerved	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
whist-table	NULL

rubbing	NULL
his	NULL

saying	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL

abilities	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
painful	NULL
to	NULL

could	NULL

looked	NULL
blooming	NULL

joyous	NULL

Miss	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL
brown	NULL

rose	NULL

After	NULL
this	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
thought	NULL

was	NULL
going	NULL

on	NULL
moving	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL

interested	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL

At	NULL
ten	NULL
o'clock	NULL
supper	NULL
was	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL
(	NULL
such	NULL

punch-drinking	NULL

Mr.	NULL

had	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
winning	NULL

there	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL

at	NULL

took	NULL
his	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
eleven	NULL
o'clock	NULL

he	NULL
chose	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
first	NULL

on	NULL
this	NULL

I	NULL
fear	NULL
that	NULL
many	NULL

will	NULL
consider	NULL
him	NULL
hardly	NULL
worthy	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

her	NULL

only	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL

though	NULL

when	NULL

dwelt	NULL
on	NULL

the	NULL

he	NULL
felt	NULL
no	NULL

had	NULL
no	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL

he	NULL
wished	NULL
not	NULL

several	NULL

therefore	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
ready	NULL

entertain	NULL
the	NULL

in	NULL

he	NULL
happened	NULL

that	NULL
madness	NULL

had	NULL

he	NULL
thought	NULL

likely	NULL
to	NULL

Certainly	NULL

if	NULL
falling	NULL

had	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL

it	NULL

itself	NULL

enshrined	NULL

expressed	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
force	NULL

that	NULL
excluded	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
felt	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
ever	NULL
he	NULL
married	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
that	NULL
feminine	NULL

that	NULL

beauty	NULL

by	NULL
its	NULL

nature	NULL
was	NULL
virtuous	NULL

being	NULL
moulded	NULL
only	NULL
for	NULL
pure	NULL

delicate	NULL
joys	NULL

But	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
more	NULL
pressing	NULL
business	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
into	NULL
Louis	NULL
'	NULL
new	NULL
book	NULL
on	NULL
Fever	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
specially	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL

because	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
Louis	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
followed	NULL
many	NULL
anatomical	NULL
demonstrations	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
ascertain	NULL
the	NULL
specific	NULL
differences	NULL
of	NULL
typhus	NULL
and	NULL
typhoid	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
read	NULL
far	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
smallest	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
bringing	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
testing	NULL
vision	NULL
of	NULL
details	NULL
and	NULL
relations	NULL
into	NULL
this	NULL
pathological	NULL
study	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
apply	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
complexities	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
and	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
these	NULL
being	NULL
subjects	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
amply	NULL
informed	NULL
by	NULL
literature	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
traditional	NULL
wisdom	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
handed	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
genial	NULL
conversation	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

Whereas	NULL
Fever	NULL
had	NULL
obscure	NULL
conditions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
delightful	NULL
labor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
imagination	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
mere	NULL
arbitrariness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
exercise	NULL
of	NULL
disciplined	NULL
power	NULL
--	NULL
combining	NULL

constructing	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
clearest	NULL
eye	NULL

probabilities	NULL

the	NULL
fullest	NULL
obedience	NULL

then	NULL

in	NULL
yet	NULL
more	NULL
energetic	NULL
alliance	NULL

Nature	NULL

standing	NULL
aloof	NULL

invent	NULL

Many	NULL
men	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
praised	NULL
as	NULL
vividly	NULL
imaginative	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
strength	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
profuseness	NULL
in	NULL
indifferent	NULL
drawing	NULL

cheap	NULL
narration	NULL

--	NULL
reports	NULL
of	NULL
very	NULL
poor	NULL
talk	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
distant	NULL
orbs	NULL
;	NULL
or	NULL
portraits	NULL
of	NULL
Lucifer	NULL
coming	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
bad	NULL
errands	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL

seem	NULL

reflect	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL

diseased	NULL
dream	NULL

But	NULL
these	NULL
kinds	NULL
of	NULL
inspiration	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
regarded	NULL
as	NULL
rather	NULL
vulgar	NULL
and	NULL
vinous	NULL
compared	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
imagination	NULL
that	NULL
reveals	NULL
subtle	NULL
actions	NULL
inaccessible	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
sort	NULL

tracked	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
outer	NULL
darkness	NULL

long	NULL
pathways	NULL

necessary	NULL

the	NULL
inward	NULL
light	NULL

of	NULL
bathing	NULL
even	NULL

ethereal	NULL
atoms	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
ideally	NULL
illuminated	NULL
space	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
part	NULL
had	NULL
tossed	NULL
away	NULL
all	NULL
cheap	NULL
inventions	NULL
where	NULL
ignorance	NULL
finds	NULL
itself	NULL
able	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
ease	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
enamoured	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
arduous	NULL
invention	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
eye	NULL
of	NULL
research	NULL

provisionally	NULL
framing	NULL
its	NULL
object	NULL
and	NULL
correcting	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
exactness	NULL
of	NULL
relation	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
pierce	NULL
the	NULL
obscurity	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
minute	NULL
processes	NULL
which	NULL
prepare	NULL
human	NULL
misery	NULL
and	NULL
joy	NULL

those	NULL
invisible	NULL

are	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
lurking-places	NULL

anguish	NULL

transition	NULL

determine	NULL
the	NULL
growth	NULL

happy	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
threw	NULL
down	NULL

stretched	NULL
his	NULL
legs	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL

something	NULL

This	NULL
last	NULL
thought	NULL
brought	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
Vincys	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
pictures	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL

They	NULL
floated	NULL

as	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL

had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
subject	NULL

meditation	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL

had	NULL
neither	NULL
any	NULL

for	NULL
throwing	NULL
her	NULL

any	NULL

which	NULL
makes	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
part	NULL

most	NULL
girls	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL

more	NULL

the	NULL

give	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL

girl	NULL

indeed	NULL

it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
enjoyment	NULL

her	NULL
music	NULL
had	NULL
remained	NULL
almost	NULL
silent	NULL

telling	NULL
her	NULL

But	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
registered	NULL
every	NULL

estimated	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL

In	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
romance	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
much	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
inward	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hero	NULL

of	NULL
his	NULL
serious	NULL
business	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
profession	NULL

was	NULL
clever	NULL

as	NULL
well	NULL

sufficiently	NULL
handsome	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
piquant	NULL
fact	NULL
about	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
good	NULL
birth	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
distinguished	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
all	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
admirers	NULL

and	NULL
presented	NULL
marriage	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
rising	NULL
in	NULL
rank	NULL

getting	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
nearer	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
celestial	NULL
condition	NULL
on	NULL
earth	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
nothing	NULL

down	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
part	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
cleverness	NULL

discern	NULL
very	NULL
subtly	NULL
the	NULL
faintest	NULL
aroma	NULL

rank	NULL

once	NULL

think	NULL
it	NULL
incredible	NULL

use	NULL
your	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
so	NULL
quaint	NULL
a	NULL
group	NULL
:	NULL
knowing	NULL
simply	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bachelor	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
ushered	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
snuggery	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
chief	NULL
furniture	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
be	NULL
books	NULL
and	NULL
collections	NULL
of	NULL
natural	NULL
objects	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Vicar	NULL
himself	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
wear	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
changed	NULL
aspect	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
most	NULL
men	NULL
do	NULL
when	NULL
acquaintances	NULL
made	NULL
elsewhere	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL

parts	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL
curmudgeon	NULL
in	NULL

piece	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
trifle	NULL
milder	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
chief	NULL
talker	NULL
being	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
put	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
good-humored	NULL
moderating	NULL
remark	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
company	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
regard	NULL
no	NULL
subject	NULL
as	NULL
quite	NULL
safe	NULL
without	NULL
her	NULL
steering	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
afforded	NULL
leisure	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
function	NULL
by	NULL
having	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
wants	NULL
attended	NULL
to	NULL
by	NULL
Miss	NULL
Winifred	NULL
.	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
tiny	NULL
Miss	NULL
Noble	NULL
carried	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
arm	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
basket	NULL
,	NULL
into	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
diverted	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
sugar	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
first	NULL
dropped	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
saucer	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
by	NULL
mistake	NULL
;	NULL
looking	NULL
round	NULL
furtively	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
reverting	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
teacup	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
innocent	NULL
noise	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
tiny	NULL
timid	NULL
quadruped	NULL
.	NULL

Pray	NULL
think	NULL
no	NULL
ill	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Noble	NULL

That	NULL
basket	NULL
held	NULL
small	NULL
savings	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
more	NULL
portable	NULL
food	NULL

destined	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL

she	NULL
trotted	NULL
on	NULL
fine	NULL
mornings	NULL

petting	NULL
all	NULL
needy	NULL
creatures	NULL
being	NULL
so	NULL
spontaneous	NULL
a	NULL
delight	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL
regarded	NULL
it	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
vice	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
addicted	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
tempted	NULL
to	NULL
steal	NULL
from	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
give	NULL
to	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
carried	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
conscience	NULL
the	NULL
guilt	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
repressed	NULL
desire	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
poor	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
luxury	NULL
of	NULL
giving	NULL
!	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
welcomed	NULL
the	NULL
guest	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
lively	NULL
formality	NULL
and	NULL
precision	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
presently	NULL
informed	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
often	NULL
in	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
medical	NULL
aid	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
children	NULL
to	NULL
wear	NULL
flannel	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
over-eat	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
last	NULL
habit	NULL
she	NULL
considered	NULL
the	NULL
chief	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
people	NULL
needed	NULL
doctors	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
pleaded	NULL
for	NULL
those	NULL
whose	NULL
fathers	NULL
and	NULL
mothers	NULL
had	NULL
over-eaten	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
held	NULL
that	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
dangerous	NULL
:	NULL
Nature	NULL

more	NULL

that	NULL

it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
easy	NULL

say	NULL

If	NULL
those	NULL

had	NULL
bad	NULL
fathers	NULL
and	NULL
mothers	NULL
were	NULL
bad	NULL
themselves	NULL

they	NULL
were	NULL
hanged	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL

back	NULL
on	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL

n't	NULL

its	NULL

People	NULL
outside	NULL
his	NULL

went	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
to	NULL
fill	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
difficult	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL

function	NULL

here	NULL
was	NULL
another	NULL

Besides	NULL

he	NULL

sweet-tempered	NULL

without	NULL

which	NULL
make	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
an	NULL

to	NULL

.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
heartily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wished	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
friendship	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
this	NULL
feeling	NULL
uppermost	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
waive	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chaplaincy	NULL

and	NULL
to	NULL
persuade	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
no	NULL
proper	NULL
business	NULL
of	NULL

,	NULL
but	NULL
likely	NULL
enough	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
vex	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
demand	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
vote	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
's	NULL
request	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
laying	NULL
down	NULL
plans	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
internal	NULL
arrangements	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
hospital	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
were	NULL
often	NULL
in	NULL
consultation	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
banker	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
presupposing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
count	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
on	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
coadjutor	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
special	NULL
recurrence	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
coming	NULL
decision	NULL
between	NULL
Tyke	NULL
and	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
General	NULL
Board	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Infirmary	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
notice	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chaplaincy	NULL
was	NULL
thrown	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
council	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
directors	NULL
and	NULL
medical	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
Friday	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
vexed	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
trivial	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
hearing	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
distinct	NULL
declaration	NULL
that	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
was	NULL
prime	NULL
minister	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Tyke	NULL
affair	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
office	NULL
or	NULL
no	NULL
office	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
an	NULL
equally	NULL
pronounced	NULL
dislike	NULL
to	NULL
giving	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
office	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
his	NULL
observation	NULL
was	NULL
constantly	NULL
confirming	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
's	NULL
assurance	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
banker	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
overlook	NULL
opposition	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Confound	NULL
their	NULL
petty	NULL
politics	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
for	NULL
three	NULL
mornings	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
meditative	NULL
process	NULL
of	NULL
shaving	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
really	NULL
hold	NULL
a	NULL
court	NULL
of	NULL
conscience	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

Certainly	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
valid	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
election	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
already	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
considering	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
spent	NULL
on	NULL
non-clerical	NULL
occupations	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
again	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
continually	NULL
repeated	NULL
shock	NULL
,	NULL
disturbing	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
esteem	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
should	NULL
obviously	NULL
play	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
liking	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
evidently	NULL
liking	NULL
some	NULL
end	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
served	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
contended	NULL
on	NULL
theory	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
desirability	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
games	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
Englishmen	NULL
's	NULL
wit	NULL
was	NULL
stagnant	NULL
for	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
felt	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
played	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
less	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
billiard-room	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Green	NULL
Dragon	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
some	NULL
anxious	NULL
mothers	NULL
and	NULL
wives	NULL
regarded	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
chief	NULL
temptation	NULL
in	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Vicar	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
first-rate	NULL
billiard-player	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
frequent	NULL
the	NULL
Green	NULL
Dragon	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
reports	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sometimes	NULL
been	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
daytime	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
won	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
chaplaincy	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
pretend	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
forty	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
Puritan	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
play	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
winning	NULL
money	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
meanness	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
ideal	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
this	NULL
subservience	NULL
of	NULL
conduct	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
gaining	NULL
of	NULL
small	NULL
sums	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
hateful	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Hitherto	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
life	NULL
his	NULL
wants	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
supplied	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
impulse	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
liberal	NULL
with	NULL
half-crowns	NULL
as	NULL
matters	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
importance	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
devise	NULL
a	NULL
plan	NULL
for	NULL
getting	NULL
half-crowns	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
known	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
way	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
rich	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
felt	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
imagining	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
plays	NULL
in	NULL
determining	NULL
the	NULL
actions	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

Money	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
motive	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Hence	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
frame	NULL
excuses	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
deliberate	NULL
pursuit	NULL
of	NULL
small	NULL
gains	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
altogether	NULL
repulsive	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
entered	NULL
into	NULL
any	NULL
calculation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ratio	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
's	NULL
income	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
necessary	NULL
expenditure	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
calculation	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
voting	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
repulsive	NULL
fact	NULL
told	NULL
more	NULL
strongly	NULL
against	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
would	NULL
know	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
if	NULL
men	NULL
's	NULL
characters	NULL
were	NULL
more	NULL
consistent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
especially	NULL
if	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
friends	NULL
were	NULL
invariably	NULL
fit	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
function	NULL
they	NULL
desired	NULL
to	NULL
undertake	NULL
!	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
no	NULL
valid	NULL
objection	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
voted	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
whatever	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
intend	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
vassal	NULL
of	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
Tyke	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
entirely	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
clerical	NULL
office	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
simply	NULL
curate	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
chapel	NULL
of	NULL
ease	NULL
in	NULL
St.	NULL
Peter	NULL
's	NULL
parish	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
extra	NULL
duty	NULL
.	NULL

Nobody	NULL
had	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
against	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Tyke	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
suspected	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
cant	NULL
.	NULL

Really	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
,	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
was	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
justified	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
whichever	NULL
way	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
incline	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
wince	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
proud	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
exasperated	NULL
at	NULL
being	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
wince	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
frustrating	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
best	NULL
purposes	NULL
by	NULL
getting	NULL
on	NULL
bad	NULL
terms	NULL
with	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
voting	NULL
against	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
helping	NULL
to	NULL
deprive	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
function	NULL
and	NULL
salary	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
occurred	NULL
whether	NULL
the	NULL
additional	NULL
forty	NULL
pounds	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
ignoble	NULL
care	NULL
about	NULL
winning	NULL
at	NULL
cards	NULL
.	NULL

Moreover	NULL
,	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
consciousness	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
voting	NULL
for	NULL
Tyke	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
voting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
obviously	NULL
convenient	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
would	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
really	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
convenience	NULL
?	NULL

Other	NULL
people	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
allege	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
currying	NULL
favor	NULL
with	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
himself	NULL
important	NULL
and	NULL
getting	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
then	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
part	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
personal	NULL
prospects	NULL
simply	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
concerned	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
cared	NULL
a	NULL
rotten	NULL
nut	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
banker	NULL
's	NULL
friendship	NULL
or	NULL
enmity	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
he	NULL
really	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
medium	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
vehicle	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
ideas	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
prefer	NULL
the	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
hospital	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
demonstrate	NULL
the	NULL
specific	NULL
distinctions	NULL
of	NULL
fever	NULL
and	NULL
test	NULL
therapeutic	NULL
results	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
connected	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
chaplaincy	NULL
?	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
feeling	NULL
the	NULL
hampering	NULL
threadlike	NULL
pressure	NULL
of	NULL
small	NULL
social	NULL
conditions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
frustrating	NULL
complexity	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
inward	NULL
debate	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
set	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
hospital	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
hope	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
chance	NULL
that	NULL
discussion	NULL
might	NULL
somehow	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
aspect	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
scale	NULL
dip	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
exclude	NULL
the	NULL
necessity	NULL
for	NULL
voting	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
trusted	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
also	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
energy	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
begotten	NULL
by	NULL
circumstances	NULL
--	NULL
some	NULL
feeling	NULL
rushing	NULL
warmly	NULL
and	NULL
making	NULL
resolve	NULL
easy	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
debate	NULL
in	NULL
cool	NULL
blood	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
more	NULL
difficult	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
distinctly	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
side	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
vote	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
inwardly	NULL
resenting	NULL
the	NULL
subjection	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
forced	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
seemed	NULL
beforehand	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
ridiculous	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
bad	NULL
logic	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
unmixed	NULL
resolutions	NULL
of	NULL
independence	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
select	NULL
purposes	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
find	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
outset	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
grasp	NULL
of	NULL
petty	NULL
alternatives	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
repugnant	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
his	NULL
student	NULL
's	NULL
chambers	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
prearranged	NULL
his	NULL
social	NULL
action	NULL
quite	NULL
differently	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
late	NULL
in	NULL
setting	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Sprague	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
other	NULL
surgeons	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
several	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
directors	NULL
had	NULL
arrived	NULL
early	NULL
;	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
treasurer	NULL
and	NULL
chairman	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
among	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
absent	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
conversation	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
imply	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
issue	NULL
was	NULL
problematical	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
majority	NULL
for	NULL
Tyke	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
certain	NULL
as	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
generally	NULL
supposed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
two	NULL
physicians	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
wonder	NULL
,	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
unanimous	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
of	NULL
different	NULL
minds	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
concurred	NULL
in	NULL
action	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Sprague	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
rugged	NULL
and	NULL
weighty	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
foreseen	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
adherent	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Doctor	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
suspected	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
no	NULL
religion	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
somehow	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
tolerated	NULL
this	NULL
deficiency	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
Lord	NULL
Chancellor	NULL
;	NULL
indeed	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
probable	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
professional	NULL
weight	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
world-old	NULL
association	NULL
of	NULL
cleverness	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
evil	NULL
principle	NULL
being	NULL
still	NULL
potent	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
minds	NULL
even	NULL
of	NULL
lady-patients	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
strictest	NULL
ideas	NULL
of	NULL
frilling	NULL
and	NULL
sentiment	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
this	NULL
negation	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

It	NULL

that	NULL

dispensing	NULL

intended	NULL
to	NULL
cast	NULL
imputations	NULL

obscure	NULL

the	NULL
physicians	NULL

who	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
interest	NULL

felt	NULL
bound	NULL

maintain	NULL
its	NULL
various	NULL
grades	NULL

especially	NULL
against	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL

either	NULL

the	NULL
English	NULL

enjoyed	NULL
the	NULL
absence	NULL

bedside	NULL
study	NULL
there	NULL

came	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
libellous	NULL

A	NULL
brief	NULL

still	NULL
hot	NULL
discussion	NULL
followed	NULL
before	NULL
each	NULL
person	NULL
wrote	NULL
"	NULL
Tyke	NULL

"	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
"	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL

it	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL

and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mean	NULL
time	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
saw	NULL

enter	NULL

"	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL

in	NULL

voice	NULL

Then	NULL

looking	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL

Mr.	NULL

We	NULL
all	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
seem	NULL

speak	NULL

Lydgate	NULL

rather	NULL
defiantly	NULL

keeping	NULL
his	NULL
pencil	NULL
suspended	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
merely	NULL
mean	NULL

you	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
offensive	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
not	NULL

account	NULL

"	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
immediately	NULL
wrote	NULL
down	NULL
"	NULL
Tyke	NULL

"	NULL

So	NULL
the	NULL
Rev.	NULL
Walter	NULL
Tyke	NULL
became	NULL
chaplain	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Infirmary	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
uncertain	NULL
whether	NULL
Tyke	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
suitable	NULL
candidate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
his	NULL
consciousness	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
quite	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
indirect	NULL
bias	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
voted	NULL
for	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
affair	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chaplaincy	NULL
remained	NULL
a	NULL
sore	NULL
point	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
memory	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
this	NULL
petty	NULL
medium	NULL
of	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL
strong	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
be	NULL
satisfied	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
decision	NULL
between	NULL
such	NULL
alternatives	NULL
and	NULL
under	NULL
such	NULL
circumstances	NULL
?	NULL

No	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
satisfied	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
chosen	NULL
from	NULL
among	NULL
such	NULL
shapes	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
resources	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
age	NULL
offer	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
wearing	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
best	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
resignation	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
chiefly	NULL
supported	NULL
by	NULL
comparison	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
met	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
friendliness	NULL
as	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
publican	NULL
and	NULL
sinner	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
practically	NULL
incompatible	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
modern	NULL
Pharisee	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
majority	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
scarcely	NULL
see	NULL
more	NULL
distinctly	NULL
the	NULL
faultiness	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
own	NULL
conduct	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
faultiness	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
own	NULL
arguments	NULL

or	NULL
the	NULL
dulness	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
own	NULL
jokes	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
of	NULL
St.	NULL
Botolph	NULL
's	NULL
had	NULL
certainly	NULL
escaped	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
tincture	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Pharisee	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
dint	NULL
of	NULL
admitting	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
other	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
remarkably	NULL
unlike	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
excuse	NULL
others	NULL
for	NULL
thinking	NULL
slightly	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL

could	NULL
judge	NULL
impartially	NULL

their	NULL
conduct	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
told	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL

Vicar	NULL

talk	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
inspiriting	NULL

had	NULL
escaped	NULL

Two	NULL
hours	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
seated	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
inner	NULL
room	NULL
or	NULL
boudoir	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
handsome	NULL
apartment	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Via	NULL
Sistina	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
sorry	NULL
to	NULL
add	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sobbing	NULL
bitterly	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
abandonment	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
relief	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
oppressed	NULL
heart	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
habitually	NULL
controlled	NULL
by	NULL
pride	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
account	NULL
and	NULL
thoughtfulness	NULL
for	NULL
others	NULL
will	NULL
sometimes	NULL
allow	NULL
herself	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
feels	NULL
securely	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
was	NULL
certain	NULL
to	NULL
remain	NULL
away	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Vatican	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
distinctly	NULL
shapen	NULL
grievance	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
state	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
confused	NULL
thought	NULL
and	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
mental	NULL
act	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
struggling	NULL
forth	NULL
into	NULL
clearness	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
self-accusing	NULL
cry	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
desolation	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
fault	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
spiritual	NULL
poverty	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
choice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
advantage	NULL
over	NULL
most	NULL
girls	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
contemplated	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
chiefly	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
new	NULL
duties	NULL
:	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
first	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
as	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
mind	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
above	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
often	NULL
be	NULL
claimed	NULL
by	NULL
studies	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
entirely	NULL
share	NULL
;	NULL
moreover	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
brief	NULL
narrow	NULL
experience	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
girlhood	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
beholding	NULL
Rome	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
of	NULL
visible	NULL
history	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
whole	NULL
hemisphere	NULL
seems	NULL
moving	NULL
in	NULL
funeral	NULL
procession	NULL
with	NULL
strange	NULL
ancestral	NULL
images	NULL
and	NULL
trophies	NULL
gathered	NULL
from	NULL
afar	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
stupendous	NULL
fragmentariness	NULL
heightened	NULL
the	NULL
dreamlike	NULL
strangeness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
bridal	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
been	NULL
five	NULL
weeks	NULL
in	NULL
Rome	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
kindly	NULL
mornings	NULL
when	NULL
autumn	NULL
and	NULL
winter	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
hand	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
happy	NULL
aged	NULL
couple	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
would	NULL
presently	NULL
survive	NULL
in	NULL
chiller	NULL
loneliness	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
driven	NULL
about	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
chiefly	NULL
with	NULL
Tantripp	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
experienced	NULL
courier	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
led	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
galleries	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
taken	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
chief	NULL
points	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
shown	NULL
the	NULL
grandest	NULL
ruins	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
glorious	NULL
churches	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
ended	NULL
by	NULL
oftenest	NULL
choosing	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Campagna	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
feel	NULL
alone	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
and	NULL
sky	NULL
,	NULL
away-from	NULL
the	NULL
oppressive	NULL
masquerade	NULL
of	NULL
ages	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
life	NULL
too	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
masque	NULL
with	NULL
enigmatical	NULL
costumes	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Rome	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
quickening	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
knowledge	NULL
which	NULL
breathes	NULL
a	NULL
growing	NULL
soul	NULL
into	NULL
all	NULL
historic	NULL
shapes	NULL

traces	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
suppressed	NULL
transitions	NULL
which	NULL
unite	NULL
all	NULL
contrasts	NULL

Rome	NULL
may	NULL
still	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
spiritual	NULL
centre	NULL

interpreter	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL

But	NULL
let	NULL
them	NULL
conceive	NULL
one	NULL
more	NULL
historical	NULL
contrast	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
gigantic	NULL
broken	NULL
revelations	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
Imperial	NULL
and	NULL
Papal	NULL
city	NULL
thrust	NULL
abruptly	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
notions	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
brought	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
English	NULL
and	NULL
Swiss	NULL
Puritanism	NULL
,	NULL
fed	NULL
on	NULL
meagre	NULL
Protestant	NULL
histories	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
art	NULL
chiefly	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hand-screen	NULL
sort	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
whose	NULL
ardent	NULL
nature	NULL
turned	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
small	NULL
allowance	NULL
of	NULL
knowledge	NULL
into	NULL
principles	NULL
,	NULL
fusing	NULL
her	NULL
actions	NULL
into	NULL
their	NULL
mould	NULL

and	NULL
whose	NULL
quick	NULL
emotions	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
abstract	NULL
things	NULL
the	NULL
quality	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
pleasure	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
pain	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
lately	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL

and	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

found	NULL
herself	NULL

in	NULL
tumultuous	NULL
preoccupation	NULL

her	NULL
personal	NULL

The	NULL
weight	NULL

unintelligible	NULL
Rome	NULL

all	NULL

sunk	NULL
in	NULL

degeneracy	NULL

the	NULL
dimmer	NULL

eager	NULL
Titanic	NULL

struggling	NULL
on	NULL
walls	NULL

ceilings	NULL

the	NULL
long	NULL
vistas	NULL
of	NULL
white	NULL
forms	NULL
whose	NULL
marble	NULL
eyes	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
the	NULL
monotonous	NULL

of	NULL
an	NULL
alien	NULL
world	NULL

all	NULL
this	NULL
vast	NULL
wreck	NULL
of	NULL
ambitious	NULL
ideals	NULL

sensuous	NULL

mixed	NULL
confusedly	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
signs	NULL

forgetfulness	NULL

degradation	NULL

at	NULL
first	NULL
jarred	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
electric	NULL
shock	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
urged	NULL
themselves	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
ache	NULL
belonging	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
glut	NULL
of	NULL
confused	NULL
ideas	NULL
which	NULL
check	NULL
the	NULL
flow	NULL
of	NULL
emotion	NULL

Forms	NULL
both	NULL
pale	NULL
and	NULL
glowing	NULL
took	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
young	NULL
sense	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fixed	NULL
themselves	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
memory	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL

preparing	NULL
strange	NULL
associations	NULL
which	NULL
remained	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
after-years	NULL
.	NULL

Our	NULL
moods	NULL
are	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
images	NULL
which	NULL
succeed	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
magic-lantern	NULL
pictures	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
doze	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
certain	NULL
states	NULL
of	NULL
dull	NULL
forlornness	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
vastness	NULL
of	NULL
St.	NULL
Peter	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
huge	NULL
bronze	NULL
canopy	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
excited	NULL
intention	NULL

garments	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
prophets	NULL

evangelists	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mosaics	NULL

the	NULL
red	NULL
drapery	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL

hung	NULL
for	NULL
Christmas	NULL
spreading	NULL
itself	NULL
everywhere	NULL
like	NULL

.	NULL

Not	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
inward	NULL
amazement	NULL
of	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
was	NULL
anything	NULL
very	NULL
exceptional	NULL
:	NULL
many	NULL
souls	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
young	NULL
nudity	NULL
are	NULL
tumbled	NULL
out	NULL
among	NULL
incongruities	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
"	NULL

feet	NULL
"	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
their	NULL
elders	NULL
go	NULL
about	NULL

business	NULL
.	NULL

Nor	NULL
can	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
is	NULL
discovered	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fit	NULL
of	NULL
weeping	NULL
six	NULL
weeks	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
wedding	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
regarded	NULL
as	NULL
tragic	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
discouragement	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
faintness	NULL
of	NULL
heart	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
real	NULL
future	NULL
which	NULL
replaces	NULL
the	NULL
imaginary	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
unusual	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
expect	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
deeply	NULL
moved	NULL
by	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
unusual	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
element	NULL
of	NULL
tragedy	NULL
which	NULL
lies	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
fact	NULL
of	NULL
frequency	NULL
,	NULL
has	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
wrought	NULL
itself	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
coarse	NULL
emotion	NULL
of	NULL
mankind	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
our	NULL
frames	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
bear	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
keen	NULL
vision	NULL
and	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
ordinary	NULL
human	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
like	NULL
hearing	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
grow	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
squirrel	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
die	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
roar	NULL
which	NULL
lies	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
quickest	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
walk	NULL
about	NULL
well	NULL
wadded	NULL
with	NULL
stupidity	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
crying	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
required	NULL
to	NULL
state	NULL
the	NULL
cause	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
such	NULL
general	NULL
words	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
already	NULL
used	NULL
:	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
driven	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
particular	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
like	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
history	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lights	NULL
and	NULL
shadows	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
new	NULL
real	NULL
future	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
replacing	NULL
the	NULL
imaginary	NULL
drew	NULL
its	NULL
material	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
endless	NULL
minutiae	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
wifely	NULL
relation	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
married	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
gradually	NULL
changing	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
secret	NULL
motion	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
watch-hand	NULL
from	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
maiden	NULL
dream	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
early	NULL
yet	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
fully	NULL
to	NULL
recognize	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
admit	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
readjusted	NULL
that	NULL
devotedness	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
necessary	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mental	NULL
life	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
sure	NULL
sooner	NULL
or	NULL
later	NULL
to	NULL
recover	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Permanent	NULL
rebellion	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
disorder	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
life	NULL
without	NULL
some	NULL
loving	NULL
reverent	NULL
resolve	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
interval	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
nature	NULL
heightened	NULL
its	NULL
confusion	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
months	NULL
of	NULL
marriage	NULL
often	NULL
are	NULL
times	NULL
of	NULL
critical	NULL
tumult	NULL
--	NULL
whether	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
shrimp-pool	NULL
or	NULL
of	NULL
deeper	NULL
waters	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
afterwards	NULL
subsides	NULL
into	NULL
cheerful	NULL
peace	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
learned	NULL
as	NULL
before	NULL
?	NULL

Had	NULL
his	NULL
forms	NULL
of	NULL
expression	NULL
changed	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
his	NULL
sentiments	NULL
become	NULL
less	NULL
laudable	NULL
?	NULL

Oh	NULL
waywardness	NULL
of	NULL
womanhood	NULL
!	NULL

did	NULL
his	NULL
chronology	NULL
fail	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
his	NULL
ability	NULL
to	NULL
state	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
theory	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
names	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
held	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
or	NULL
his	NULL
provision	NULL
for	NULL
giving	NULL
the	NULL
heads	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
subject	NULL
on	NULL
demand	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
Rome	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
free	NULL
play	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
accomplishments	NULL
?	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
especially	NULL
dwelt	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
relieving	NULL
the	NULL
weight	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
sadness	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
great	NULL
tasks	NULL
lie	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
to	NULL
achieve	NULL
them	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
And	NULL
that	NULL
such	NULL
weight	NULL
pressed	NULL
on	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
plainer	NULL
than	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
these	NULL
are	NULL
crushing	NULL
questions	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
whatever	NULL
else	NULL
remained	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL

you	NULL

the	NULL

The	NULL
fact	NULL
is	NULL
unalterable	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
fellow-mortal	NULL
with	NULL
whose	NULL

when	NULL
seen	NULL

the	NULL
continuity	NULL

disclosed	NULL

something	NULL
better	NULL

worse	NULL
than	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
preconceived	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
will	NULL
certainly	NULL
not	NULL
appear	NULL
altogether	NULL
the	NULL

.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
astonishing	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
how	NULL
soon	NULL
the	NULL

is	NULL
felt	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL

To	NULL
share	NULL

with	NULL

or	NULL

your	NULL
favorite	NULL

Ministry	NULL

may	NULL
bring	NULL
about	NULL
changes	NULL
quite	NULL
as	NULL
rapid	NULL
:	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
cases	NULL
too	NULL
we	NULL
begin	NULL
by	NULL
knowing	NULL
little	NULL
and	NULL
believing	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
sometimes	NULL
end	NULL
by	NULL
inverting	NULL
the	NULL
quantities	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
comparisons	NULL
might	NULL
mislead	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
incapable	NULL
of	NULL
flashy	NULL
make-believe	NULL
than	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
genuine	NULL
a	NULL
character	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
ruminant	NULL
animal	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
actively	NULL
assisted	NULL
in	NULL
creating	NULL
any	NULL
illusions	NULL
about	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
weeks	NULL
since	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
distinctly	NULL
observed	NULL
but	NULL
felt	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
stifling	NULL
depression	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
vistas	NULL
and	NULL
wide	NULL
fresh	NULL
air	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
dreamed	NULL
of	NULL
finding	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
were	NULL
replaced	NULL
by	NULL
anterooms	NULL
and	NULL
winding	NULL
passages	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
lead	NULL
nowhither	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
courtship	NULL
everything	NULL
is	NULL
regarded	NULL
as	NULL
provisional	NULL
and	NULL
preliminary	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
smallest	NULL
sample	NULL
of	NULL
virtue	NULL
or	NULL
accomplishment	NULL
is	NULL
taken	NULL
to	NULL
guarantee	NULL
delightful	NULL
stores	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
broad	NULL
leisure	NULL
of	NULL
marriage	NULL
will	NULL
reveal	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
door-sill	NULL
of	NULL
marriage	NULL
once	NULL
crossed	NULL
,	NULL
expectation	NULL
is	NULL
concentrated	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
once	NULL
embarked	NULL
on	NULL
your	NULL
marital	NULL
voyage	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
impossible	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
make	NULL
no	NULL
way	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
within	NULL
sight	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
exploring	NULL
an	NULL
enclosed	NULL
basin	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
their	NULL
conversation	NULL
before	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
dwelt	NULL
on	NULL
some	NULL
explanation	NULL
or	NULL
questionable	NULL
detail	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
bearing	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
such	NULL
imperfect	NULL
coherence	NULL
seemed	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
brokenness	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
intercourse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
supported	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
faith	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
future	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
listened	NULL
with	NULL
fervid	NULL
patience	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
recitation	NULL
of	NULL
possible	NULL
arguments	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
brought	NULL
against	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
entirely	NULL
new	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Philistine	NULL
god	NULL
Dagon	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
fish-deities	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
hereafter	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
see	NULL
this	NULL
subject	NULL
which	NULL
touched	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
nearly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
high	NULL
ground	NULL
whence	NULL
doubtless	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
so	NULL
important	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Again	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
matter-of-course	NULL
statement	NULL
and	NULL
tone	NULL
of	NULL
dismissal	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
treated	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
stirring	NULL
thoughts	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
easily	NULL
accounted	NULL
for	NULL
as	NULL
belonging	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
haste	NULL
and	NULL
preoccupation	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
shared	NULL
during	NULL
their	NULL
engagement	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
Rome	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
emotion	NULL
roused	NULL
to	NULL
tumultuous	NULL
activity	NULL

and	NULL
with	NULL
life	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
problem	NULL
by	NULL
new	NULL
elements	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
becoming	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
aware	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
terror	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
continually	NULL
sliding	NULL
into	NULL
inward	NULL
fits	NULL
of	NULL
anger	NULL
and	NULL
repulsion	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
else	NULL
into	NULL
forlorn	NULL
weariness	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
far	NULL
the	NULL
judicious	NULL
Hooker	NULL
or	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
hero	NULL
of	NULL
erudition	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
at	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
means	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
comparison	NULL

her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
commenting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
strangely	NULL
impressive	NULL
objects	NULL
around	NULL
them	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
affect	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
mental	NULL
shiver	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
acquitting	NULL
himself	NULL
worthily	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
of	NULL
acquitting	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
fresh	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
worn	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
such	NULL
capacity	NULL
of	NULL
thought	NULL

feeling	NULL

had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
stimulated	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL

mankind	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
shrunk	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL

preparation	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL

This	NULL

indeed	NULL
Mr.	NULL

showed	NULL
a	NULL
tenacity	NULL

an	NULL
eagerness	NULL

fence	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL

unapplausive	NULL
audience	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL

had	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
given	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL

shrank	NULL

her	NULL
ideal	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
claim	NULL
justice	NULL

to	NULL
give	NULL
tenderness	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
drove	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL

the	NULL
Vatican	NULL

walked	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
stony	NULL
avenue	NULL
of	NULL
inscriptions	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
parted	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
entrance	NULL

went	NULL
on	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
Museum	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
mere	NULL
listlessness	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
spirit	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
round	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
drive	NULL
anywhere	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
when	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
was	NULL
quitting	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
Naumann	NULL

first	NULL

her	NULL

entered	NULL
the	NULL

gallery	NULL

the	NULL

time	NULL

her	NULL

here	NULL
Naumann	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
await	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL

settle	NULL
a	NULL
bet	NULL

about	NULL
an	NULL

After	NULL
they	NULL

examined	NULL
the	NULL

had	NULL
walked	NULL
on	NULL
finishing	NULL
their	NULL

they	NULL

Ladislaw	NULL
lingering	NULL
behind	NULL

Naumann	NULL

gone	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
Hall	NULL

where	NULL
he	NULL
again	NULL
saw	NULL
Dorothea	NULL

and	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
brooding	NULL
abstraction	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
pose	NULL
remarkable	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
really	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
streak	NULL
of	NULL
sunlight	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
statues	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
inwardly	NULL
seeing	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
years	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
fields	NULL
and	NULL
elms	NULL
and	NULL
hedge-bordered	NULL
highroads	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
joyful	NULL
devotedness	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
clear	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
current	NULL
into	NULL
which	NULL
all	NULL
thought	NULL

feeling	NULL
were	NULL
apt	NULL
sooner	NULL

later	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

something	NULL

at	NULL

now	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL

when	NULL

passed	NULL

Mr.	NULL

--	NULL
which	NULL

she	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
coldly	NULL
clever	NULL

indirectly	NULL
satirical	NULL

adorably	NULL
simple	NULL
and	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
feeling	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
angel	NULL
beguiled	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
unique	NULL
delight	NULL

watch	NULL

melodious	NULL
fragments	NULL

which	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL

came	NULL
forth	NULL

directly	NULL

ingenuously	NULL

The	NULL
Aeolian	NULL
harp	NULL
again	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
some	NULL
original	NULL
romance	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
marriage	NULL

And	NULL
if	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
dragon	NULL

had	NULL
carried	NULL
her	NULL
off	NULL

his	NULL
lair	NULL

without	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
benefactor	NULL
with	NULL

his	NULL
back	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL

the	NULL
room	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL
unimpeachable	NULL
correctness	NULL
of	NULL

a	NULL
newly	NULL

Mr.	NULL

Mr.	NULL

was	NULL
less	NULL
happy	NULL

this	NULL
perhaps	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
look	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
dimmer	NULL

more	NULL
faded	NULL
;	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
might	NULL
easily	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
produced	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
contrast	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
impression	NULL

the	NULL

Surely	NULL

his	NULL
very	NULL
features	NULL
changed	NULL

large	NULL

sometimes	NULL
small	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
ripple	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
nose	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
preparation	NULL
for	NULL
metamorphosis	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
quickly	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
shake	NULL
out	NULL
light	NULL

some	NULL

thought	NULL

this	NULL
coruscation	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

stood	NULL
rayless	NULL

As	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
turned	NULL
anxiously	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
not	NULL
insensible	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
contrast	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
mingled	NULL
with	NULL
other	NULL
causes	NULL
in	NULL
making	NULL
her	NULL
more	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL

the	NULL

a	NULL
source	NULL
of	NULL
greater	NULL
freedom	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
Will	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
young	NULL
equality	NULL
was	NULL
agreeable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
also	NULL
perhaps	NULL
his	NULL
openness	NULL
to	NULL
conviction	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
an	NULL
immense	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
before	NULL
seen	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
quick	NULL
and	NULL
pliable	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
everything	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
gravely	NULL
hoped	NULL
that	NULL
Will	NULL
was	NULL
passing	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
profitably	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
pleasantly	NULL
in	NULL
Rome	NULL
--	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
his	NULL
intention	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
remain	NULL
in	NULL
South	NULL
Germany	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
begged	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
dine	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
converse	NULL
more	NULL
at	NULL
large	NULL
:	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
somewhat	NULL
weary	NULL
.	NULL

Ladislaw	NULL
understood	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
accepting	NULL
the	NULL
invitation	NULL
immediately	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
leave	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
followed	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
anxiously	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
sank	NULL
down	NULL
wearily	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sofa	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
resting	NULL
his	NULL
elbow	NULL
supported	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
little	NULL
flushed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
bright	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
seated	NULL
herself	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Forgive	NULL
me	NULL
for	NULL
speaking	NULL
so	NULL
hastily	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
wrong	NULL

I	NULL
fear	NULL

hurt	NULL
you	NULL

the	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
glad	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL

my	NULL

said	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
quietly	NULL
and	NULL
bowed	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
an	NULL
uneasy	NULL
feeling	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
forgive	NULL
me	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
sob	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
her	NULL
need	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
manifestation	NULL
of	NULL
feeling	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
exaggerate	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
fault	NULL
.	NULL

Would	NULL
not	NULL
love	NULL
see	NULL
returning	NULL
penitence	NULL
afar	NULL
off	NULL

and	NULL
fall	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL
neck	NULL
and	NULL
kiss	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
,	NULL
exerting	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
statement	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
also	NULL
to	NULL
smile	NULL
faintly	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
tear	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sob	NULL
would	NULL
insist	NULL
on	NULL
falling	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
are	NULL
excited	NULL

much	NULL
mental	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
thought	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
ought	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
received	NULL
young	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
absence	NULL
:	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
abstained	NULL
,	NULL
partly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
ungracious	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
complaint	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
penitent	NULL
acknowledgment	NULL
,	NULL
partly	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
further	NULL
agitation	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
by	NULL
speech	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
partly	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
proud	NULL
to	NULL
betray	NULL
that	NULL
jealousy	NULL
of	NULL
disposition	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
exhausted	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
scholarly	NULL
compeers	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
none	NULL
to	NULL
spare	NULL
in	NULL
other	NULL
directions	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
jealousy	NULL
which	NULL
needs	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
fire	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
hardly	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
blight	NULL
bred	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cloudy	NULL
,	NULL
damp	NULL
despondency	NULL
of	NULL
uneasy	NULL
egoism	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
us	NULL
to	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
added	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
watch	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
both	NULL
rose	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
any	NULL
further	NULL
allusion	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
remembered	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
vividness	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL

when	NULL
some	NULL

expectation	NULL
dies	NULL

Today	NULL
she	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL

been	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL

response	NULL
to	NULL

Mr.	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
waking	NULL

a	NULL
presentiment	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
sad	NULL
consciousness	NULL

made	NULL

Dorothea	NULL

that	NULL

it	NULL

Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
was	NULL
delightfully	NULL
agreeable	NULL
at	NULL
dinner	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
no	NULL
opportunity	NULL
for	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
disapprobation	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
that	NULL
Will	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
happier	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
drawing	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
into	NULL
conversation	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
deferentially	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
observed	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
before	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
listeners	NULL
about	NULL
Tipton	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
highly	NULL
gifted	NULL
!	NULL

Will	NULL
talked	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
was	NULL
thrown	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
rapidity	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
unimportant	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
saying	NULL
something	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
gay	NULL
little	NULL
chime	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
bell	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Will	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
perfect	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
good	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
described	NULL
touches	NULL
of	NULL
incident	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
Rome	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
move	NULL
about	NULL
freely	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
agreement	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
unsound	NULL
opinions	NULL
of	NULL
Middleton	NULL
concerning	NULL
the	NULL
relations	NULL
of	NULL
Judaism	NULL
and	NULL
Catholicism	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
easily	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
half-enthusiastic	NULL
half-playful	NULL
picture	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
miscellaneousness	NULL
of	NULL
Rome	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
flexible	NULL
with	NULL
constant	NULL
comparison	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saved	NULL
you	NULL
from	NULL
seeing	NULL
the	NULL

's	NULL
ages	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
studies	NULL
,	NULL
Will	NULL
observed	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
of	NULL
too	NULL
broad	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
perhaps	NULL
never	NULL
felt	NULL
any	NULL
such	NULL
sudden	NULL
effect	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
he	NULL
confessed	NULL
that	NULL
Rome	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
history	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
whole	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
fragments	NULL
stimulated	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
constructive	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
occasionally	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
too	NULL
often	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
discussed	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
her	NULL
sentiment	NULL
were	NULL
an	NULL
item	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
considered	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
final	NULL
judgment	NULL
even	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Madonna	NULL
di	NULL
Foligno	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
Laocoon	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
contributing	NULL
to	NULL
form	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
's	NULL
opinion	NULL
makes	NULL
conversation	NULL
particularly	NULL
cheerful	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
too	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
his	NULL
pride	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
young	NULL
wife	NULL

who	NULL
spoke	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
most	NULL

as	NULL
indeed	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
perceived	NULL

Since	NULL
things	NULL

going	NULL
on	NULL

pleasantly	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL

that	NULL

be	NULL
suspended	NULL

a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
days	NULL

that	NULL

a	NULL

renewal	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
staying	NULL
in	NULL
Rome	NULL

encouraged	NULL
Will	NULL

not	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL

two	NULL

not	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL

That	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
ought	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
missed	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
special	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
that	NULL
grew	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
fresh	NULL
vegetation	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
population	NULL
of	NULL
insects	NULL

huge	NULL

Thorwaldsen	NULL

a	NULL
living	NULL
celebrity	NULL
about	NULL

even	NULL
Mr.	NULL

inquired	NULL

before	NULL

one	NULL
of	NULL

had	NULL
not	NULL

revived	NULL

expanded	NULL
that	NULL
grand	NULL
conception	NULL

supreme	NULL
events	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
blinked	NULL
furtively	NULL
at	NULL
Will	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
suspicion	NULL
that	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

They	NULL
found	NULL
Naumann	NULL

no	NULL

present	NULL

set	NULL
off	NULL

everything	NULL

The	NULL

in	NULL
his	NULL

gave	NULL
little	NULL

on	NULL
his	NULL

seeming	NULL

Mr.	NULL

Will	NULL
burst	NULL
in	NULL
here	NULL

there	NULL
with	NULL
ardent	NULL
words	NULL

praise	NULL

marking	NULL
out	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL

Some	NULL

Naumann	NULL
's	NULL

As	NULL

Dorothea	NULL

nothing	NULL

In	NULL

Naumann	NULL

Fred	NULL

we	NULL

with	NULL
this	NULL

which	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL
creditor	NULL
was	NULL
Mr.	NULL

The	NULL

it	NULL

Why	NULL
not	NULL

With	NULL
the	NULL

With	NULL

a	NULL

moderately	NULL

Fred	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL

that	NULL
applying	NULL

would	NULL
be	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
;	NULL
being	NULL
implicitly	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
at	NULL

(	NULL
whatever	NULL

about	NULL

had	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL

free	NULL
from	NULL

That	NULL

was	NULL
an	NULL
absurdity	NULL
irreconcilable	NULL
with	NULL
those	NULL
cheerful	NULL
intuitions	NULL
implanted	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
nature	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Fred	NULL
winced	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
as	NULL
wanting	NULL
funds	NULL
for	NULL
small	NULL
debts	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
friend	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
to	NULL
apply	NULL
to	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
the	NULL
poorest	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
kindest	NULL
--	NULL
namely	NULL
,	NULL
Caleb	NULL
Garth	NULL

The	NULL
Garths	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
Fred	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
were	NULL

had	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
carried	NULL
on	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
children	NULL
drank	NULL
tea	NULL
together	NULL
out	NULL

their	NULL
toy	NULL

and	NULL
spent	NULL
whole	NULL
days	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL

Mary	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
hoyden	NULL

and	NULL
Fred	NULL
at	NULL
six	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
thought	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
nicest	NULL
girl	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
her	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
brass	NULL
ring	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
cut	NULL
from	NULL
an	NULL
umbrella	NULL
.	NULL

Through	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
stages	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
education	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
kept	NULL
his	NULL
affection	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Garths	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
house	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
any	NULL
intercourse	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
elders	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
ceased	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
when	NULL
Caleb	NULL
Garth	NULL
was	NULL
prosperous	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Vincys	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
condescending	NULL
terms	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL

his	NULL
wife	NULL

for	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
nice	NULL
distinctions	NULL

Middlemarch	NULL

though	NULL

manufacturers	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
dukes	NULL
be	NULL
connected	NULL
with	NULL
none	NULL
but	NULL
equals	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
inherent	NULL
social	NULL
superiority	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
defined	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
nicety	NULL
in	NULL
practice	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
hardly	NULL
expressible	NULL
theoretically	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
then	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Garth	NULL
had	NULL
failed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
building	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
unfortunately	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
other	NULL
avocations	NULL
of	NULL
surveyor	NULL

valuer	NULL

had	NULL
conducted	NULL
that	NULL
business	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
entirely	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
benefit	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
assignees	NULL

and	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
living	NULL
narrowly	NULL

exerting	NULL
himself	NULL

the	NULL
utmost	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
pay	NULL
twenty	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
achieved	NULL
this	NULL

from	NULL
all	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL

his	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
ease	NULL
with	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Garth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
frequently	NULL
spoke	NULL

a	NULL
woman	NULL

Fred	NULL

being	NULL
aware	NULL

never	NULL
spoke	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
visits	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Garth	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
of	NULL

the	NULL

ardor	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
affection	NULL

Mary	NULL
inclining	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
towards	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Garth	NULL

a	NULL

in	NULL

town	NULL

and	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
Fred	NULL
went	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
request	NULL

He	NULL
obtained	NULL
it	NULL
without	NULL
much	NULL
difficulty	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
painful	NULL
experience	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
sufficed	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
Caleb	NULL
Garth	NULL
cautious	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
affairs	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
distrustful	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fellow-men	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
proved	NULL
themselves	NULL
untrustworthy	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
highest	NULL
opinion	NULL

Fred	NULL

was	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL

Such	NULL
was	NULL
Caleb	NULL
's	NULL
psychological	NULL
argument	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
rare	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
are	NULL
rigid	NULL
to	NULL
themselves	NULL
and	NULL
indulgent	NULL
to	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
shame	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
neighbors	NULL
'	NULL
errors	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
willingly	NULL
;	NULL
hence	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
divert	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
mode	NULL
of	NULL
hardening	NULL
timber	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
ingenious	NULL
devices	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
preconceive	NULL
those	NULL
errors	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
blame	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
papers	NULL

his	NULL
reach	NULL

describe	NULL

find	NULL
fault	NULL

I	NULL
fear	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
disciplinarian	NULL

When	NULL
Fred	NULL
stated	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
debt	NULL

his	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
it	NULL
without	NULL
troubling	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
certainty	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

be	NULL
forthcoming	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
cause	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
any	NULL
inconvenience	NULL
,	NULL
Caleb	NULL
pushed	NULL
his	NULL
spectacles	NULL
upward	NULL
,	NULL
listened	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
favorite	NULL
's	NULL
clear	NULL
young	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
believed	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
distinguishing	NULL
confidence	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
from	NULL
veracity	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
occasion	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
friendly	NULL
hint	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
conduct	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
before	NULL
giving	NULL
his	NULL
signature	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
strong	NULL
admonition	NULL
.	NULL

Accordingly	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
and	NULL
lowered	NULL
his	NULL
spectacles	NULL
,	NULL
measured	NULL
the	NULL
space	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
command	NULL

reached	NULL
his	NULL
pen	NULL

examined	NULL
it	NULL

dipped	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ink	NULL

examined	NULL
it	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
pushed	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
way	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
lifted	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
spectacles	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
showed	NULL
a	NULL
deepened	NULL
depression	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
outer	NULL
angle	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
bushy	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
gave	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
mildness	NULL
(	NULL
pardon	NULL
these	NULL
details	NULL
for	NULL
once	NULL

you	NULL

them	NULL

you	NULL
had	NULL

Caleb	NULL
Garth	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
comfortable	NULL
tone	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
misfortune	NULL

Whereupon	NULL
Caleb	NULL
drew	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
spectacles	NULL

and	NULL
proceeded	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
his	NULL
signature	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
care	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
gave	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL

for	NULL
whatever	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
business	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
well	NULL

He	NULL
contemplated	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
well-proportioned	NULL
letters	NULL
and	NULL
final	NULL
flourish	NULL

with	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
a	NULL
trifle	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
handed	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Fred	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL
"	NULL
Good-by	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
returned	NULL
forthwith	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
absorption	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
plan	NULL
for	NULL
Sir	NULL
James	NULL

Either	NULL
because	NULL
his	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL

thrust	NULL
the	NULL
incident	NULL

the	NULL

from	NULL
his	NULL

for	NULL
some	NULL
reason	NULL

which	NULL
Caleb	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
conscious	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Garth	NULL
remained	NULL
ignorant	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

Since	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
over	NULL
Fred	NULL
's	NULL
sky	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
altered	NULL
his	NULL
view	NULL

was	NULL
the	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
Featherstone	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
proportionate	NULL
disappointment	NULL

His	NULL
failure	NULL

had	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
accumulation	NULL

Fred	NULL

dealt	NULL

In	NULL
fact	NULL

tacit	NULL
expectations	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
uncle	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
determined	NULL
the	NULL
angle	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
most	NULL
people	NULL
viewed	NULL
Fred	NULL
Vincy	NULL
in	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL

in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
consciousness	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL

Featherstone	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL

what	NULL

an	NULL
incorporated	NULL
luck	NULL

formed	NULL
always	NULL
an	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
present	NULL
of	NULL
bank-notes	NULL
,	NULL
once	NULL
made	NULL

was	NULL
measurable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
being	NULL
applied	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
debt	NULL

showed	NULL
a	NULL
deficit	NULL

had	NULL
still	NULL

filled	NULL
up	NULL
either	NULL

by	NULL

For	NULL
that	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL

had	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL

against	NULL
going	NULL

his	NULL
father	NULL
for	NULL
money	NULL
towards	NULL
meeting	NULL
his	NULL

Fred	NULL
was	NULL
keen	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
foresee	NULL
that	NULL
anger	NULL
would	NULL
confuse	NULL
distinctions	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL

of	NULL

borrowed	NULL

the	NULL
strength	NULL

uncle	NULL

be	NULL
taken	NULL
as	NULL

falsehood	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
one	NULL
vexatious	NULL
affair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
another	NULL
untold	NULL
:	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
cases	NULL
the	NULL
complete	NULL
revelation	NULL
always	NULL
produces	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
previous	NULL
duplicity	NULL

Now	NULL
Fred	NULL
piqued	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
keeping	NULL
clear	NULL
of	NULL
lies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
fibs	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
often	NULL
shrugged	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL

made	NULL
a	NULL
significant	NULL
grimace	NULL
at	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
Rosamond	NULL

;	NULL

rather	NULL
than	NULL
incur	NULL
the	NULL
accusation	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
even	NULL
incur	NULL
some	NULL
trouble	NULL

self-restraint	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
under	NULL
strong	NULL
inward	NULL
pressure	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL

that	NULL
Fred	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
wise	NULL
step	NULL

depositing	NULL
the	NULL
eighty	NULL

with	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pity	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
given	NULL
them	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL

to	NULL
this	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
kept	NULL
twenty	NULL

in	NULL

Fred	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

had	NULL
not	NULL

the	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL

gambling	NULL
which	NULL
has	NULL
no	NULL

is	NULL
carried	NULL

up	NULL
a	NULL
joyous	NULL

Hopefulness	NULL
has	NULL
a	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
making	NULL

because	NULL
the	NULL

Fred	NULL
liked	NULL
play	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
billiards	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
hunting	NULL
or	NULL
riding	NULL
a	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
liked	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
hoped	NULL
to	NULL
win	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
twenty	NULL
pounds	NULL
'	NULL
worth	NULL
of	NULL
seed-corn	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
planted	NULL
in	NULL
vain	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
seductive	NULL
green	NULL
plot	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
dispersed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
roadside	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
Fred	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
close	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
term	NULL
of	NULL
payment	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
money	NULL
at	NULL
command	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
eighty	NULL

which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
deposited	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
broken-winded	NULL
horse	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
rode	NULL
represented	NULL
a	NULL
present	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
while	NULL
ago	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
Featherstone	NULL

his	NULL

always	NULL
allowed	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
a	NULL
horse	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Vincy	NULL

him	NULL

this	NULL

a	NULL
reasonable	NULL
demand	NULL
even	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
son	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
exasperating	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
horse	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
Fred	NULL
's	NULL
property	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
anxiety	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
the	NULL
imminent	NULL
bill	NULL
he	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
a	NULL
possession	NULL
without	NULL
which	NULL
life	NULL
would	NULL
certainly	NULL
be	NULL
worth	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
resolution	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
heroism	NULL
--	NULL
heroism	NULL
forced	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
dread	NULL
of	NULL
breaking	NULL
his	NULL
word	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Garth	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
Mary	NULL
and	NULL
awe	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
opinion	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
start	NULL
for	NULL
Houndsley	NULL
horse-fair	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
held	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL

and	NULL
--	NULL
simply	NULL
sell	NULL
his	NULL
horse	NULL
,	NULL
bringing	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
by	NULL
coach	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
horse	NULL
would	NULL
hardly	NULL
fetch	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
thirty	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
knowing	NULL
what	NULL
might	NULL
happen	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
folly	NULL
to	NULL
balk	NULL
himself	NULL
of	NULL
luck	NULL
beforehand	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
good	NULL
chance	NULL
would	NULL
fall	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
longer	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
possible	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
chance	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
reasonable	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
equip	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
powder	NULL
and	NULL
shot	NULL
for	NULL
bringing	NULL
it	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
ride	NULL
to	NULL
Houndsley	NULL
with	NULL
Bambridge	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
Horrock	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
vet	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
asking	NULL
them	NULL
anything	NULL
expressly	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
virtually	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
benefit	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
opinion	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
he	NULL
set	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
Fred	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
eighty	NULL
pounds	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL

Most	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
saw	NULL
Fred	NULL
riding	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
in	NULL
company	NULL
with	NULL
Bambridge	NULL

Horrock	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
to	NULL
Houndsley	NULL
horse-fair	NULL
,	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
young	NULL
Vincy	NULL
was	NULL
pleasure-seeking	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
unwonted	NULL
consciousness	NULL
of	NULL
grave	NULL
matters	NULL
on	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
himself	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
dissipation	NULL

and	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
what	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
gay	NULL
young	NULL
fellow	NULL
.	NULL

Considering	NULL
that	NULL
Fred	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
coarse	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
rather	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
manners	NULL

speech	NULL
of	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
university	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
stanzas	NULL
as	NULL
pastoral	NULL
and	NULL
unvoluptuous	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
flute-playing	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
attraction	NULL
towards	NULL
Bambridge	NULL
and	NULL
Horrock	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
interesting	NULL
fact	NULL
which	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
love	NULL
of	NULL
horse-flesh	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
wholly	NULL
account	NULL
for	NULL
without	NULL
that	NULL
mysterious	NULL
influence	NULL
of	NULL
Naming	NULL
which	NULL
determinates	NULL

much	NULL
of	NULL

the	NULL
society	NULL

Messieurs	NULL
Bambridge	NULL

must	NULL
certainly	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL

arrive	NULL

them	NULL
at	NULL
Houndsley	NULL

furnished	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

various	NULL

might	NULL
have	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
business	NULL

but	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sustaining	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
nomenclature	NULL
which	NULL
determined	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
pursuit	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
was	NULL
"	NULL
gay	NULL

In	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Horrock	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
an	NULL
apparent	NULL
unfathomableness	NULL

offered	NULL
play	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
imagination	NULL

at	NULL
a	NULL

gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL

association	NULL

(	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
specify	NULL
the	NULL
hat-brim	NULL
which	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
upward	NULL

to	NULL
escape	NULL
the	NULL
suspicion	NULL

him	NULL

a	NULL
nose	NULL

seeming	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
his	NULL
hat-brim	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moderate	NULL
inclination	NULL
upwards	NULL

gave	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
subdued	NULL
unchangeable	NULL
sceptical	NULL
smile	NULL

of	NULL
all	NULL
expressions	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
tyrannous	NULL

probably	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL

It	NULL

a	NULL

seen	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL

perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
has	NULL
never	NULL

more	NULL
powerful	NULL
over	NULL

England	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Horrock	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
from	NULL
Fred	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
horse	NULL
's	NULL

turned	NULL
sideways	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL

watched	NULL
the	NULL
horse	NULL
's	NULL
action	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
space	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
minutes	NULL

then	NULL
turned	NULL
forward	NULL

twitched	NULL

Mr.	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL

him	NULL
called	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL

man	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
regarded	NULL
horse-dealing	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
finest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
arts	NULL

and	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
argued	NULL
plausibly	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL

nothing	NULL

He	NULL

Mr.	NULL

Mr.	NULL

He	NULL

struck	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL

that	NULL
this	NULL

a	NULL

Mr.	NULL

Fred	NULL

he	NULL
saw	NULL

were	NULL
both	NULL
virtually	NULL

that	NULL

very	NULL
evening	NULL

fair	NULL
had	NULL
set	NULL

Fred	NULL

saw	NULL
a	NULL
favorable	NULL
opening	NULL

an	NULL

him	NULL
congratulate	NULL
himself	NULL

bringing	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
eighty	NULL

A	NULL
young	NULL
farmer	NULL
,	NULL
acquainted	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bambridge	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
Red	NULL
Lion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
entered	NULL
into	NULL
conversation	NULL
about	NULL
parting	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
hunter	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
introduced	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
as	NULL
Diamond	NULL
,	NULL
implying	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
public	NULL
character	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
himself	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
wanted	NULL
a	NULL
useful	NULL
hack	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
draw	NULL
upon	NULL
occasion	NULL
;	NULL
being	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL

to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
hunting	NULL

The	NULL
hunter	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL

at	NULL
some	NULL
little	NULL
distance	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
before	NULL

The	NULL
friend	NULL
's	NULL
stable	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
reached	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
back	NULL
street	NULL
where	NULL
you	NULL
might	NULL

easily	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
poisoned	NULL
without	NULL

of	NULL
drugs	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL

street	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
unsanitary	NULL
period	NULL

Fred	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
fortified	NULL
against	NULL
disgust	NULL
by	NULL
brandy	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
companions	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
seen	NULL
the	NULL
horse	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
enable	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
money	NULL
was	NULL
exhilarating	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
lead	NULL
him	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
ground	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL

not	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
bargain	NULL

Fred	NULL

sharpening	NULL
his	NULL
acuteness	NULL

endowing	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
constructive	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
suspicion	NULL
.	NULL

Bambridge	NULL
had	NULL
run	NULL
down	NULL
Diamond	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
(	NULL
the	NULL
horse	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL
's	NULL

if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
buying	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
animal	NULL
--	NULL
even	NULL
Horrock	NULL
--	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
impressed	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
merit	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
get	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
with	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
sort	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
your	NULL
inferences	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
spoon	NULL
who	NULL
takes	NULL
things	NULL
literally	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
color	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
horse	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dappled	NULL
gray	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Fred	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
Lord	NULL
Medlicote	NULL
's	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
look-out	NULL
for	NULL
just	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
horse	NULL

After	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
running	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
Bambridge	NULL
let	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
farmer	NULL
was	NULL
absent	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
worse	NULL
horses	NULL
go	NULL
for	NULL
eighty	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
he	NULL
contradicted	NULL
himself	NULL
twenty	NULL
times	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
true	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
test	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
admissions	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Fred	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
but	NULL
reckon	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
judgment	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
horse	NULL
as	NULL
worth	NULL
something	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
farmer	NULL
had	NULL
paused	NULL
over	NULL
Fred	NULL
's	NULL
respectable	NULL
though	NULL
broken-winded	NULL
steed	NULL
long	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
worth	NULL
consideration	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
probable	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
five-and-twenty	NULL
pounds	NULL
in	NULL
addition	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
equivalent	NULL
of	NULL
Diamond	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
that	NULL
case	NULL
Fred	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
parted	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
new	NULL
horse	NULL
for	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
eighty	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
fifty-five	NULL
pounds	NULL
in	NULL
pocket	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
transaction	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
and	NULL
thirty-five	NULL
pounds	NULL
towards	NULL
meeting	NULL
the	NULL
bill	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
deficit	NULL
temporarily	NULL
thrown	NULL
on	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Garth	NULL
would	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
be	NULL
twenty-five	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
hurrying	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
clothes	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
so	NULL
clearly	NULL
the	NULL
importance	NULL
of	NULL
not	NULL
losing	NULL
this	NULL
rare	NULL
chance	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
Bambridge	NULL
and	NULL
Horrock	NULL
had	NULL
both	NULL
dissuaded	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
deluded	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
direct	NULL
interpretation	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
purpose	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL

deep	NULL
hands	NULL
held	NULL
something	NULL
else	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL

.	NULL

With	NULL

to	NULL
horses	NULL

distrust	NULL

your	NULL
only	NULL

But	NULL
scepticism	NULL

we	NULL

can	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
applied	NULL
,	NULL
else	NULL
life	NULL

a	NULL
standstill	NULL

whatever	NULL
that	NULL

virtually	NULL
our	NULL

even	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
seems	NULL

Fred	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
excellence	NULL

bargain	NULL

and	NULL
even	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL

only	NULL
five	NULL

more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL

he	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL

wearied	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
sorry	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
propitious	NULL
events	NULL
at	NULL
Houndsley	NULL
Fred	NULL
Vincy	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
into	NULL
worse	NULL
spirits	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
disappointed	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
possible	NULL
market	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
horse	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
bargain	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
concluded	NULL
with	NULL
Lord	NULL
Medlicote	NULL

this	NULL

in	NULL

the	NULL

exhibited	NULL

just	NULL
missed	NULL
killing	NULL
the	NULL

had	NULL
ended	NULL

laming	NULL
himself	NULL
severely	NULL
by	NULL
catching	NULL
his	NULL
leg	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
rope	NULL
that	NULL
overhung	NULL
the	NULL
stable-board	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
redress	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL
discovery	NULL
of	NULL
bad	NULL
temper	NULL
after	NULL
marriage	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
old	NULL
companions	NULL
were	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
ceremony	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
some	NULL
reason	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
Fred	NULL
had	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
elasticity	NULL
under	NULL
this	NULL
stroke	NULL
of	NULL
ill-fortune	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
simply	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
fifty	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
getting	NULL
any	NULL

at	NULL

that	NULL
the	NULL
bill	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL

sixty	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
presented	NULL
in	NULL
five	NULL
days	NULL

Even	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
applied	NULL

his	NULL
father	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
plea	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Garth	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
saved	NULL
from	NULL
loss	NULL

Fred	NULL
felt	NULL
smartingly	NULL
that	NULL

angrily	NULL
refuse	NULL

rescue	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Garth	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
consequence	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
call	NULL
encouraging	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
utterly	NULL
downcast	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
frame	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
project	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
straight	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Garth	NULL
and	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
sad	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
carrying	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
fifty	NULL
pounds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
getting	NULL
that	NULL
sum	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
safely	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
warehouse	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
know	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
accident	NULL
:	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
storm	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
vicious	NULL
brute	NULL
being	NULL
brought	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
stable	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
before	NULL
meeting	NULL
that	NULL
lesser	NULL
annoyance	NULL
Fred	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
courage	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
nag	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
Mr.	NULL

,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
ride	NULL
to	NULL

confess	NULL
all	NULL

In	NULL

it	NULL

Mary	NULL

Fred	NULL

much	NULL

active	NULL
both	NULL
in	NULL
previously	NULL
urging	NULL
the	NULL

on	NULL
his	NULL

impelling	NULL
him	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
spare	NULL
himself	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL

by	NULL
deferring	NULL
an	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
theatre	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
my	NULL
actions	NULL
is	NULL
fallen	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
an	NULL
antique	NULL
personage	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
chief	NULL
friend	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
fortunate	NULL
who	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
theatre	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
audience	NULL
demands	NULL
their	NULL
best	NULL
.	NULL

Certainly	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
considerable	NULL
difference	NULL
to	NULL
Fred	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
if	NULL
Mary	NULL
Garth	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
decided	NULL
notions	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
admirable	NULL

character	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Garth	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Fred	NULL
rode	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
way	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
homely	NULL
place	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
orchard	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
rambling	NULL
,	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
,	NULL
half-timbered	NULL
building	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
had	NULL
spread	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
farm-house	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
surrounded	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
private	NULL
gardens	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
townsmen	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
fonder	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
houses	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
physiognomy	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
our	NULL
friends	NULL
have	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Garth	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Mary	NULL
had	NULL
four	NULL
brothers	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
old	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
furniture	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
been	NULL
sold	NULL
.	NULL

Fred	NULL
liked	NULL
it	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
it	NULL
by	NULL
heart	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
attic	NULL
which	NULL
smelt	NULL
deliciously	NULL
of	NULL
apples	NULL
and	NULL
quinces	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
until	NULL
to-day	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
without	NULL
pleasant	NULL
expectations	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
uneasily	NULL
now	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
probably	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
his	NULL
confession	NULL
before	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Garth	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
more	NULL
in	NULL
awe	NULL
than	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
sarcasm	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
impulsive	NULL
sallies	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Mary	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
her	NULL
present	NULL
matronly	NULL
age	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Garth	NULL
never	NULL
committed	NULL
herself	NULL
by	NULL
over-hasty	NULL
speech	NULL
;	NULL
having	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
borne	NULL
the	NULL
yoke	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
youth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
learned	NULL
self-control	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
that	NULL
rare	NULL
sense	NULL
which	NULL
discerns	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
unalterable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
submits	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
without	NULL
murmuring	NULL
.	NULL

Adoring	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
virtues	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
very	NULL
early	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
incapacity	NULL
of	NULL
minding	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
interests	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
the	NULL
consequences	NULL
cheerfully	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
magnanimous	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
renounce	NULL
all	NULL
pride	NULL
in	NULL
teapots	NULL
or	NULL
children	NULL
's	NULL
frilling	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
poured	NULL
any	NULL
pathetic	NULL
confidences	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
ears	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
feminine	NULL
neighbors	NULL
concerning	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Garth	NULL
's	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
prudence	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sums	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
like	NULL
other	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

Hence	NULL
these	NULL
fair	NULL
neighbors	NULL
thought	NULL
her	NULL
either	NULL
proud	NULL
or	NULL
eccentric	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
husbands	NULL
as	NULL
"	NULL
your	NULL
fine	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Garth	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
her	NULL
criticism	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
return	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
more	NULL
accurately	NULL
instructed	NULL
than	NULL
most	NULL
matrons	NULL
in	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
--	NULL
where	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
blameless	NULL
woman	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
severe	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
sex	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
opinion	NULL
was	NULL
framed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
entirely	NULL
subordinate	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
disproportionately	NULL
indulgent	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
failings	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
often	NULL
heard	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
these	NULL
were	NULL
natural	NULL
.	NULL

Also	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
admitted	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Garth	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
trifle	NULL
too	NULL
emphatic	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
resistance	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
held	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
follies	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
from	NULL
governess	NULL
into	NULL
housewife	NULL
had	NULL
wrought	NULL
itself	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
too	NULL
strongly	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
consciousness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
rarely	NULL
forgot	NULL
that	NULL
while	NULL
her	NULL
grammar	NULL
and	NULL
accent	NULL
were	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
standard	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
plain	NULL
cap	NULL
,	NULL
cooked	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
darned	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
stockings	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
sometimes	NULL
taken	NULL
pupils	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
peripatetic	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
them	NULL
follow	NULL
her	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
book	NULL
or	NULL
slate	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
lather	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
corrected	NULL
their	NULL
blunders	NULL
"	NULL
without	NULL
looking	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
sleeves	NULL
tucked	NULL
up	NULL
above	NULL
her	NULL
elbows	NULL
might	NULL
know	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
Subjunctive	NULL
Mood	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
Torrid	NULL
Zone	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
possess	NULL
"	NULL
education	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
good	NULL
things	NULL
ending	NULL
in	NULL
"	NULL
tion	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
worthy	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
pronounced	NULL
emphatically	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
useless	NULL
doll	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
remarks	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
edifying	NULL
effect	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
firm	NULL
little	NULL
frown	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
brow	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
yet	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
hinder	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
from	NULL
looking	NULL
benevolent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
words	NULL
which	NULL
came	NULL
forth	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
procession	NULL
were	NULL
uttered	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fervid	NULL
agreeable	NULL
contralto	NULL
.	NULL

Certainly	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
exemplary	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Garth	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
droll	NULL
aspects	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
character	NULL
sustained	NULL
her	NULL
oddities	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
fine	NULL
wine	NULL
sustains	NULL
a	NULL
flavor	NULL
of	NULL
skin	NULL
.	NULL

Towards	NULL
Fred	NULL
Vincy	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
motherly	NULL
feeling	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
excuse	NULL
his	NULL
errors	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
excused	NULL
Mary	NULL
for	NULL
engaging	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
daughter	NULL
being	NULL
included	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
more	NULL
rigorous	NULL
judgment	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
applied	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
sex	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
very	NULL
fact	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
exceptional	NULL
indulgence	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
harder	NULL
to	NULL
Fred	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
now	NULL
inevitably	NULL
sink	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
opinion	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
visit	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
Caleb	NULL
Garth	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
early	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
some	NULL
repairs	NULL
not	NULL
far	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Garth	NULL
at	NULL
certain	NULL
hours	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
carrying	NULL
on	NULL
several	NULL
occupations	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
there	NULL
--	NULL
making	NULL
her	NULL
pies	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
well-scoured	NULL
deal	NULL
table	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
airy	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
observing	NULL
Sally	NULL
's	NULL
movements	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
oven	NULL
and	NULL
dough-tub	NULL
through	NULL
an	NULL
open	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
giving	NULL
lessons	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
youngest	NULL
boy	NULL
and	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
standing	NULL
opposite	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
books	NULL
and	NULL
slates	NULL
before	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
tub	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
clothes-horse	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
indicated	NULL
an	NULL
intermittent	NULL
wash	NULL
of	NULL
small	NULL
things	NULL
also	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Garth	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
sleeves	NULL
turned	NULL
above	NULL
her	NULL
elbows	NULL
,	NULL
deftly	NULL
handling	NULL
her	NULL
pastry	NULL
--	NULL
applying	NULL
her	NULL
rolling-pin	NULL
and	NULL
giving	NULL
ornamental	NULL
pinches	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
expounded	NULL
with	NULL
grammatical	NULL
fervor	NULL
what	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
views	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
concord	NULL
of	NULL
verbs	NULL
and	NULL
pronouns	NULL
with	NULL
"	NULL
nouns	NULL
of	NULL
multitude	NULL
or	NULL
signifying	NULL
many	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sight	NULL
agreeably	NULL
amusing	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
curly-haired	NULL
,	NULL
square-faced	NULL
type	NULL
as	NULL
Mary	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
handsomer	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
delicacy	NULL
of	NULL
feature	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
pale	NULL
skin	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
solid	NULL
matronly	NULL
figure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
remarkable	NULL
firmness	NULL
of	NULL
glance	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
her	NULL
snowy-frilled	NULL
cap	NULL
she	NULL
reminded	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
delightful	NULL
Frenchwoman	NULL
whom	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
all	NULL
seen	NULL
marketing	NULL
,	NULL
basket	NULL

Looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
might	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
daughter	NULL
would	NULL
become	NULL
like	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
prospective	NULL
advantage	NULL

possible	NULL

had	NULL
been	NULL

most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
special	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL

His	NULL
classification	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
employments	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
crude	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL

more	NULL
celebrated	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL

he	NULL
regarded	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL

other	NULL
gods	NULL

his	NULL
own	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
ranks	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
himself	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL

of	NULL
any	NULL

which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
such	NULL

Though	NULL
he	NULL

never	NULL

him	NULL

I	NULL

the	NULL

his	NULL
prince	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
spirit	NULL
of	NULL
denial	NULL
in	NULL
Caleb	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
wondrous	NULL

him	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL

having	NULL
ascertained	NULL
this	NULL

he	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL

of	NULL
his	NULL
beloved	NULL

which	NULL
required	NULL
that	NULL

He	NULL
gave	NULL
himself	NULL
up	NULL
entirely	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
many	NULL
kinds	NULL
of	NULL

which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
without	NULL
handling	NULL

was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
precious	NULL
men	NULL
within	NULL
his	NULL

whom	NULL
everybody	NULL
would	NULL
choose	NULL

because	NULL

charged	NULL

unconscious	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
costume	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
fresh	NULL
and	NULL
gay	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
sick	NULL
bird	NULL
with	NULL
languid	NULL
eye	NULL
and	NULL
plumage	NULL
ruffled	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
senses	NULL
dulled	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sights	NULL
and	NULL
sounds	NULL
that	NULL
used	NULL
most	NULL
to	NULL
interest	NULL
her	NULL

Fred	NULL
's	NULL
delirium	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
wandering	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
reach	NULL
,	NULL
tore	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
outburst	NULL
against	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Wrench	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
about	NULL
very	NULL
quietly	NULL
:	NULL
her	NULL
one	NULL
low	NULL
cry	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
follow	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
moaning	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Save	NULL
my	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Once	NULL
she	NULL
pleaded	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
He	NULL
has	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
good	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
word	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
poor	NULL
Fred	NULL
's	NULL
suffering	NULL
were	NULL
an	NULL
accusation	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
deepest	NULL
fibres	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
memory	NULL
were	NULL
stirred	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
whose	NULL
voice	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
gentler	NULL
tone	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
babe	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
loved	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
love	NULL
new	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
born	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
good	NULL
hope	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
us	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
food	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

In	NULL
that	NULL
way	NULL
he	NULL
led	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
parlor	NULL
where	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
surprising	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
taking	NULL
some	NULL
tea	NULL
or	NULL
broth	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
constant	NULL
understanding	NULL
between	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
on	NULL
these	NULL
matters	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
almost	NULL
always	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
before	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sickroom	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
for	NULL
mamma	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
and	NULL
adroitness	NULL
in	NULL
carrying	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
hints	NULL
were	NULL
admirable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
wonderful	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
mingle	NULL
itself	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

Especially	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
critical	NULL
stage	NULL
was	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
confident	NULL
of	NULL
Fred	NULL
's	NULL
recovery	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
doubtful	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
advised	NULL
calling	NULL
in	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Sprague	NULL
(	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
rather	NULL
have	NULL
remained	NULL
neutral	NULL
on	NULL
Wrench	NULL
's	NULL
account	NULL
)	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
after	NULL
two	NULL
consultations	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
conduct	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
every	NULL
reason	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
assiduous	NULL
.	NULL

Morning	NULL
and	NULL
evening	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gradually	NULL
the	NULL
visits	NULL
became	NULL
cheerful	NULL
as	NULL
Fred	NULL
became	NULL
simply	NULL
feeble	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lay	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
petting	NULL
but	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
illness	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
festival	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
tenderness	NULL
.	NULL

Both	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
held	NULL
it	NULL
an	NULL
added	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
good	NULL
spirits	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
old	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
sent	NULL
messages	NULL
by	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
Fred	NULL
must	NULL
make	NULL
haste	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
Peter	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
without	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
missed	NULL
his	NULL
visits	NULL
sadly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
himself	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
bedridden	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
told	NULL
these	NULL
messages	NULL
to	NULL
Fred	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
listen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
his	NULL
delicate	NULL
,	NULL
pinched	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
thick	NULL
blond	NULL
hair	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
cut	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
larger	NULL
,	NULL
yearning	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
word	NULL
about	NULL
Mary	NULL
--	NULL
wondering	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
illness	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
word	NULL
passed	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
"	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
with	NULL
eyes	NULL
belongs	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
's	NULL
rare	NULL
wit	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
mother	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fulness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
divined	NULL
Fred	NULL
's	NULL
longing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
felt	NULL
ready	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
satisfy	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
only	NULL
see	NULL
my	NULL
boy	NULL
strong	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
loving	NULL
folly	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
knows	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
perhaps	NULL
master	NULL
of	NULL
Stone	NULL
Court	NULL
!	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
can	NULL
marry	NULL
anybody	NULL
he	NULL
likes	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Fred	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
illness	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
childish	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tears	NULL
came	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
jelly	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
,	NULL
secretly	NULL
incredulous	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
such	NULL
refusal	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
never	NULL
left	NULL
Fred	NULL
's	NULL
side	NULL
when	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
unusual	NULL
position	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
much	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
naturally	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
staying	NULL
long	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
brief	NULL
impersonal	NULL
conversations	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
together	NULL
were	NULL
creating	NULL
that	NULL
peculiar	NULL
intimacy	NULL
which	NULL
consists	NULL
in	NULL
shyness	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
in	NULL
speaking	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
somehow	NULL
the	NULL
looking	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
carried	NULL
through	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
really	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
this	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
consciousness	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
anywhere	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
ill-worked	NULL
puppet	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
badly	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
consequence	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
their	NULL
eyes	NULL
met	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
were	NULL
more	NULL
conscious	NULL
than	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
help	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
in	NULL
science	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
flirt	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
help	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
folly	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
therefore	NULL
a	NULL
relief	NULL
when	NULL
neighbors	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
considered	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
quarantine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
chances	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
alone	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
reduced	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
intimacy	NULL
of	NULL
mutual	NULL
embarrassment	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
each	NULL
feels	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
is	NULL
feeling	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
once	NULL
existed	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
effect	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

Talk	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
well-bred	NULL
topics	NULL
is	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
seem	NULL
a	NULL
hollow	NULL
device	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
behavior	NULL
can	NULL
hardly	NULL
become	NULL
easy	NULL
unless	NULL
it	NULL
frankly	NULL
recognizes	NULL
a	NULL
mutual	NULL
fascination	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
need	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
anything	NULL
deep	NULL
or	NULL
serious	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
and	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
slid	NULL
gracefully	NULL
into	NULL
ease	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
their	NULL
intercourse	NULL
lively	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Visitors	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
music	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
extra	NULL
hospitality	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
's	NULL
mayoralty	NULL
returned	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
seat	NULL
by	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lingered	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
her	NULL
music	NULL
,	NULL
calling	NULL
himself	NULL
her	NULL
captive	NULL
--	NULL
meaning	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
her	NULL
captive	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
preposterousness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
notion	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
set	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
establishment	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
married	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sufficient	NULL
guarantee	NULL
against	NULL
danger	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
play	NULL
at	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
was	NULL
agreeable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
interfere	NULL
with	NULL
graver	NULL
pursuits	NULL
.	NULL

Flirtation	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
necessarily	NULL
a	NULL
singeing	NULL
process	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
before	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
admired	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
worth	NULL
captivating	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
distinguish	NULL
flirtation	NULL
from	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
either	NULL
in	NULL
herself	NULL
or	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sailing	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
fair	NULL
wind	NULL
just	NULL
whither	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
thoughts	NULL
were	NULL
much	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
handsome	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
Lowick	NULL
Gate	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
hoped	NULL
would	NULL
by-and-by	NULL
be	NULL
vacant	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
determined	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
married	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
rid	NULL
herself	NULL
adroitly	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
visitors	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
agreeable	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
imagined	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
favorite	NULL
house	NULL
with	NULL
various	NULL
styles	NULL
of	NULL
furniture	NULL
.	NULL

Certainly	NULL
her	NULL
thoughts	NULL
were	NULL
much	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
almost	NULL
perfect	NULL
:	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
his	NULL
notes	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
enchantment	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
music	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
less	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
emotional	NULL
elephant	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
discriminate	NULL
better	NULL
the	NULL
refinements	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
taste	NULL
in	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
have	NULL
mentioned	NULL
a	NULL
deficiency	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
different	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
from	NULL
young	NULL
Plymdale	NULL
or	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Caius	NULL
Larcher	NULL
!	NULL

Those	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
notion	NULL
of	NULL
French	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
speak	NULL
on	NULL
no	NULL
subject	NULL
with	NULL
striking	NULL
knowledge	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
dyeing	NULL
and	NULL
carrying	NULL
trades	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
ashamed	NULL
to	NULL
mention	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
gentry	NULL
,	NULL
elated	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
silver-headed	NULL
whips	NULL
and	NULL
satin	NULL
stocks	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
manners	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
timidly	NULL
jocose	NULL
:	NULL
even	NULL
Fred	NULL
was	NULL
above	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
the	NULL
accent	NULL
and	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
university	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

Whereas	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
bore	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
careless	NULL
politeness	NULL
of	NULL
conscious	NULL
superiority	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
clothes	NULL
on	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
natural	NULL
affinity	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
ever	NULL
having	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
was	NULL
proud	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
approached	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
distinguishing	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
delicious	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
enviable	NULL
homage	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
pride	NULL
he	NULL
excited	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
delicate	NULL
bosom	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
pleased	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
densely	NULL
ignorant	NULL
of	NULL
humoral	NULL
pathology	NULL
or	NULL
fibrous	NULL
tissue	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
it	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
prettiest	NULL
attitudes	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
feminine	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
adore	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
pre-eminence	NULL
without	NULL
too	NULL
precise	NULL
a	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
consisted	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
helpless	NULL
girls	NULL
who	NULL
betray	NULL
themselves	NULL
unawares	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whose	NULL
behavior	NULL
is	NULL
awkwardly	NULL
driven	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
impulses	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
steered	NULL
by	NULL
wary	NULL

she	NULL

the	NULL

strengthen	NULL
her	NULL

her	NULL

Never	NULL

she	NULL

preconceived	NULL
them	NULL

somehow	NULL

somehow	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
solemnly	NULL
pledged	NULL
union	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL

Mr.	NULL

too	NULL
languid	NULL

out	NULL

passionate	NULL

it	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
fluttering	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

where	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
hatched	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL

His	NULL
experience	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
pitiable	NULL

which	NULL
shrinks	NULL
from	NULL
pity	NULL

fears	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL

known	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
proud	NULL

And	NULL
Mr.	NULL

many	NULL

the	NULL

thought	NULL

them	NULL

bitterly	NULL
convinced	NULL

our	NULL

Becoming	NULL

fear	NULL

to	NULL
Mr.	NULL

's	NULL

Doubtless	NULL
some	NULL

observed	NULL
that	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL

mask	NULL

the	NULL

there	NULL
must	NULL
always	NULL

To	NULL
this	NULL
mental	NULL
estate	NULL
mapped	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
century	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
sensibilities	NULL
thus	NULL
fenced	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
annexing	NULL
happiness	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
lovely	NULL
young	NULL
bride	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
even	NULL
before	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
depression	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
consciousness	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
bliss	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
blissful	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Inclination	NULL
yearned	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
easier	NULL
custom	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
deeper	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
domesticity	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
acquitting	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
acting	NULL
with	NULL
propriety	NULL
predominate	NULL
over	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
satisfaction	NULL

Marriage	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
religion	NULL
and	NULL
erudition	NULL
,	NULL
nay	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
authorship	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
fated	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
an	NULL
outward	NULL
requirement	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Edward	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
was	NULL
bent	NULL
on	NULL
fulfilling	NULL
unimpeachably	NULL
all	NULL
requirements	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
drawing	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
into	NULL
use	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
study	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
intention	NULL
before	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
tempted	NULL
to	NULL
defer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
pleading	NULL
insistence	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
begun	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
making	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
place	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
early	NULL
hour	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
work	NULL
either	NULL
of	NULL
reading	NULL
aloud	NULL
or	NULL
copying	NULL
assigned	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
work	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
easier	NULL
to	NULL
define	NULL
because	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
adopted	NULL
an	NULL
immediate	NULL
intention	NULL
:	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
Parergon	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
monograph	NULL
on	NULL
some	NULL
lately	NULL
traced	NULL
indications	NULL
concerning	NULL
the	NULL
Egyptian	NULL
mysteries	NULL
whereby	NULL
certain	NULL
assertions	NULL
of	NULL
Warburton	NULL
's	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
corrected	NULL
.	NULL

References	NULL
were	NULL
extensive	NULL
even	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
altogether	NULL
shoreless	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
sentences	NULL
were	NULL
actually	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
written	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shape	NULL
wherein	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
scanned	NULL
by	NULL
Brasenose	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
less	NULL
formidable	NULL
posterity	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
minor	NULL
monumental	NULL
productions	NULL
were	NULL
always	NULL
exciting	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
;	NULL
digestion	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
difficult	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
interference	NULL
of	NULL
citations	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
rivalry	NULL
of	NULL
dialectical	NULL
phrases	NULL
ringing	NULL
against	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
brain	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
Latin	NULL
dedication	NULL
about	NULL
which	NULL
everything	NULL
was	NULL
uncertain	NULL
except	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
addressed	NULL
to	NULL
Carp	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
poisonous	NULL
regret	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
addressed	NULL
a	NULL
dedication	NULL
to	NULL
Carp	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
numbered	NULL
that	NULL
member	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
animal	NULL
kingdom	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
viros	NULL
nullo	NULL
aevo	NULL
perituros	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
mistake	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
infallibly	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
dedicator	NULL
open	NULL
to	NULL
ridicule	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
age	NULL

and	NULL
might	NULL
even	NULL
be	NULL
chuckled	NULL
over	NULL
by	NULL
Pike	NULL
and	NULL
Tench	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
busiest	NULL
epochs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL

a	NULL
little	NULL

joined	NULL

The	NULL

Here	NULL
Mr.	NULL

dipped	NULL
his	NULL

when	NULL
you	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
justice	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
left	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL

two	NULL

her	NULL

went	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

the	NULL

within	NULL
her	NULL
rejecting	NULL
the	NULL

just	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL

She	NULL

:	NULL
she	NULL
only	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
caused	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
offend	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
tremble	NULL
;	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL

in	NULL
writing	NULL
out	NULL

her	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL

she	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
forming	NULL
her	NULL

beautifully	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
construction	NULL

the	NULL

she	NULL

copying	NULL

and	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL

understand	NULL

more	NULL

In	NULL
her	NULL
indignation	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL

it	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL

firmness	NULL

There	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
this	NULL
apparent	NULL
quiet	NULL
for	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
looked	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
table	NULL

when	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
loud	NULL
bang	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turning	NULL
quickly	NULL
saw	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
steps	NULL
clinging	NULL
forward	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
bodily	NULL
distress	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
started	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
bounded	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
in	NULL
great	NULL
straits	NULL
for	NULL
breath	NULL
.	NULL

Jumping	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
stool	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
elbow	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
whole	NULL
soul	NULL
melted	NULL
into	NULL
tender	NULL
alarm	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Can	NULL
you	NULL
lean	NULL
on	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
dear	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
minutes	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
endless	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
or	NULL
move	NULL
,	NULL
gasping	NULL
for	NULL
breath	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
descended	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
steps	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
backward	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
chair	NULL
which	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
had	NULL
drawn	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ladder	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
gasped	NULL
but	NULL
seemed	NULL
helpless	NULL
and	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
faint	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
rang	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
violently	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
was	NULL
helped	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
couch	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
faint	NULL

was	NULL
gradually	NULL
reviving	NULL

when	NULL
Sir	NULL

was	NULL
his	NULL
immediate	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
his	NULL
prophetic	NULL
soul	NULL

been	NULL
urged	NULL
to	NULL
particularize	NULL

it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL
fits	NULL
"	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
definite	NULL
expression	NULL
alighted	NULL
upon	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
his	NULL
informant	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
butler	NULL
,	NULL
whether	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL

The	NULL
butler	NULL
never	NULL
knew	NULL
his	NULL
master	NULL

want	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
before	NULL

but	NULL
would	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL

When	NULL
Sir	NULL

entered	NULL
the	NULL

however	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL

could	NULL
make	NULL
some	NULL
signs	NULL

his	NULL
usual	NULL
politeness	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
reaction	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
terror	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
kneeling	NULL
and	NULL
sobbing	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
side	NULL
now	NULL
rose	NULL
and	NULL
herself	NULL
proposed	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
should	NULL
ride	NULL
off	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
medical	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

said	NULL
Sir	NULL

made	NULL

he	NULL
certainly	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL

meant	NULL

asked	NULL

When	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
begged	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL

happened	NULL

nothing	NULL

what	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
about	NULL
Mr.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL

there	NULL

For	NULL
years	NULL
after	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
produced	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
involuntary	NULL
appeal	NULL
--	NULL
this	NULL
cry	NULL
from	NULL
soul	NULL

soul	NULL

without	NULL

their	NULL
moving	NULL

the	NULL

embroiled	NULL

the	NULL

troublous	NULL
fitfully	NULL
illuminated	NULL
life	NULL

But	NULL
what	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
say	NULL
now	NULL
except	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
see	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
again	NULL
to-morrow	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
tears	NULL
gushed	NULL
forth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
relieved	NULL
her	NULL
stifling	NULL
oppression	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
dried	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
reminded	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
distress	NULL
must	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
betrayed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL

and	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL

she	NULL
must	NULL
order	NULL

servant	NULL

attend	NULL

it	NULL

since	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
might	NULL
now	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
moment	NULL
wish	NULL

enter	NULL

On	NULL
his	NULL
writing-table	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
letters	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
lain	NULL
untouched	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
ill	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
well	NULL
remembered	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
young	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
's	NULL
letters	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
addressed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
still	NULL
unopened	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
associations	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
letters	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
painful	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
sudden	NULL
attack	NULL
of	NULL
illness	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
agitation	NULL
caused	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
anger	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
helped	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
on	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
time	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
them	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
again	NULL
thrust	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
inclination	NULL
to	NULL
fetch	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL

whatever	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL

annoyance	NULL

he	NULL
must	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
possible	NULL

not	NULL
be	NULL
annoyed	NULL
again	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
ran	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
first	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
addressed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
assure	NULL
herself	NULL
whether	NULL

not	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
hinder	NULL
the	NULL
offensive	NULL
visit	NULL
.	NULL

Will	NULL
wrote	NULL
from	NULL
Rome	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
by	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
obligations	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
deep	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
thanks	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
seem	NULL
impertinent	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
plain	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
grateful	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
poorest-spirited	NULL
rascal	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
generous	NULL
friend	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
expand	NULL
in	NULL
wordy	NULL
thanks	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
like	NULL
saying	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
honest	NULL

But	NULL
Will	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
perceive	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
defects	NULL
--	NULL
defects	NULL
which	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
himself	NULL
often	NULL
pointed	NULL
to	NULL
--	NULL
needed	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
correction	NULL
that	NULL
more	NULL
strenuous	NULL
position	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
relative	NULL
's	NULL
generosity	NULL
had	NULL
hitherto	NULL
prevented	NULL
from	NULL
being	NULL
inevitable	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
trusted	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
return	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
return	NULL
were	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
showing	NULL
the	NULL
effectiveness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
education	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
indebted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
ceasing	NULL
in	NULL
future	NULL
to	NULL
need	NULL
any	NULL
diversion	NULL
towards	NULL
himself	NULL
of	NULL
funds	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
others	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
England	NULL

to	NULL
try	NULL
his	NULL
fortune	NULL

as	NULL
many	NULL

A	NULL
letter	NULL
addressed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Poste	NULL
Restante	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
within	NULL

from	NULL
arriving	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL

moment	NULL

He	NULL
enclosed	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
continued	NULL
a	NULL
discussion	NULL
about	NULL

begun	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
Rome	NULL

Opening	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
letter	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lively	NULL
continuation	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
remonstrance	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
fanatical	NULL
sympathy	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
sturdy	NULL
neutral	NULL
delight	NULL
in	NULL
things	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
outpouring	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
young	NULL
vivacity	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
just	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
immediately	NULL
to	NULL
consider	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
letter	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
time	NULL
perhaps	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
Will	NULL
from	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
Lowick	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
ended	NULL
by	NULL
giving	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
uncle	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

and	NULL
begging	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
Will	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
ill	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
health	NULL

not	NULL

the	NULL
reception	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
more	NULL
ready	NULL
than	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL

his	NULL
only	NULL
difficulty	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
one	NULL

his	NULL
ideas	NULL
in	NULL

case	NULL
expanded	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
large	NULL
pages	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
inward	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
simply	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
Dorothea	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
's	NULL
pen	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
thinking	NULL
organ	NULL

evolving	NULL
sentences	NULL

of	NULL
a	NULL

kind	NULL

before	NULL
the	NULL

could	NULL
well	NULL
overtake	NULL
them	NULL

It	NULL
expressed	NULL

proposed	NULL
remedies	NULL

which	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Mr.	NULL

read	NULL
them	NULL

seemed	NULL
felicitously	NULL

surprisingly	NULL
the	NULL

determined	NULL
a	NULL

In	NULL

that	NULL

go	NULL
over	NULL

also	NULL
felt	NULL
such	NULL

that	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL

had	NULL
persuaded	NULL
Mr.	NULL

Why	NULL
not	NULL
?	NULL

They	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
together	NULL

this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
period	NULL

the	NULL

--	NULL
in	NULL

Mr.	NULL

off	NULL

How	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Vincy	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL

and	NULL
laid	NULL
some	NULL
emphasis	NULL
on	NULL

said	NULL
Rosamond	NULL

implying	NULL
a	NULL

the	NULL

regarded	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
prettiest	NULL

for	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL

but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL

very	NULL
melancholy	NULL

how	NULL

said	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

how	NULL
it	NULL

said	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
melancholy	NULL
voice	NULL

rising	NULL

go	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

with	NULL
emphasis	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
quite	NULL
confident	NULL

you	NULL

"	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
cheeks	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
were	NULL
persistently	NULL
burning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
much	NULL
mortification	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
chose	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
convinced	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
in	NULL
things	NULL
worldly	NULL
and	NULL
indifferent	NULL
was	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
what	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
bade	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
telling	NULL
her	NULL
reasons	NULL

desired	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
opportunity	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
marrying	NULL
soon	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
result	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
decided	NULL
negative	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
being	NULL
cross-questioned	NULL
,	NULL
showed	NULL
that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
as	NULL
no	NULL
man	NULL
would	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
attachment	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
now	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
serious	NULL
duty	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
soon	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
arrange	NULL
a	NULL
tete-a-tete	NULL
with	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
passed	NULL
from	NULL
inquiries	NULL
about	NULL
Fred	NULL
Vincy	NULL
's	NULL
health	NULL

expressions	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL

lay	NULL
before	NULL
young	NULL
people	NULL
with	NULL
regard	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
settlement	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL

Young	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
often	NULL
wild	NULL

disappointing	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
little	NULL
return	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
spent	NULL
on	NULL
them	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
exposed	NULL
to	NULL
many	NULL
circumstances	NULL

"	NULL
Especially	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Lydgate	NULL

you	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
flattered	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
advantage	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
Orlandos	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
annoyed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
perception	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
's	NULL
meaning	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
as	NULL
impressively	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
using	NULL
the	NULL
superior	NULL
word	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
thrown	NULL
a	NULL
noble	NULL
drapery	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
particulars	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
evident	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
fuming	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
pushed	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
back	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
felt	NULL
curiously	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
waistcoat-pocket	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL

then	NULL
stooped	NULL
to	NULL
beckon	NULL

tiny	NULL
black	NULL
spaniel	NULL

which	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
insight	NULL
to	NULL
decline	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
decent	NULL
to	NULL

away	NULL

because	NULL
he	NULL

dining	NULL

just	NULL
taken	NULL
tea	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
no	NULL

understood	NULL

Mr.	NULL

from	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

supposed	NULL

at	NULL
Vincy	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
answered	NULL
curtly	NULL

had	NULL
work	NULL

the	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
no	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
words	NULL
as	NULL
anything	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
's	NULL
usual	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
putting	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
seemed	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
convey	NULL
an	NULL
innuendo	NULL
which	NULL
confirmed	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
behaving	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
misunderstood	NULL

not	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL

by	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
herself	NULL

she	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
everything	NULL
as	NULL
lightly	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
intended	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
exquisite	NULL
tact	NULL
and	NULL
insight	NULL
in	NULL
relation	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
points	NULL
of	NULL
manners	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
she	NULL
lived	NULL
among	NULL
were	NULL
blunderers	NULL
and	NULL
busybodies	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
mistake	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
no	NULL
farther	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
resolved	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
kept	NULL
his	NULL
resolution	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
's	NULL
except	NULL
on	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
became	NULL
very	NULL
unhappy	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
uneasiness	NULL
first	NULL
stirred	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL
's	NULL
questions	NULL
grew	NULL
and	NULL
grew	NULL
till	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
ten	NULL
days	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
grew	NULL
into	NULL
terror	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
blank	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
possibly	NULL
come	NULL
--	NULL
into	NULL
foreboding	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
ready	NULL
,	NULL
fatal	NULL
sponge	NULL
which	NULL
so	NULL
cheaply	NULL
wipes	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
hopes	NULL
of	NULL
mortals	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
world	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
dreariness	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
wilderness	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
magician	NULL
's	NULL
spells	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
garden	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
pang	NULL
of	NULL
disappointed	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
man	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
delightful	NULL
aerial	NULL
building	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
enjoying	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
.	NULL

Poor	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
lost	NULL
her	NULL
appetite	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
forlorn	NULL
as	NULL
Ariadne	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
charming	NULL
stage	NULL
Ariadne	NULL
left	NULL
behind	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
boxes	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
costumes	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
coach	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
many	NULL
wonderful	NULL
mixtures	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
all	NULL
alike	NULL
called	NULL
love	NULL

and	NULL
claim	NULL
the	NULL
privileges	NULL

a	NULL
sublime	NULL
rage	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
an	NULL
apology	NULL
for	NULL
everything	NULL
(	NULL
in	NULL
literature	NULL

the	NULL
drama	NULL

.	NULL

Happily	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
committing	NULL
any	NULL
desperate	NULL
act	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
plaited	NULL
her	NULL
fair	NULL
hair	NULL
as	NULL
beautifully	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL

and	NULL
kept	NULL
herself	NULL
proudly	NULL
calm	NULL

Her	NULL
most	NULL
cheerful	NULL
supposition	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
had	NULL
interfered	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
hinder	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
visits	NULL
:	NULL
everything	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
spontaneous	NULL
indifference	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL

Any	NULL

imagines	NULL
ten	NULL
days	NULL
too	NULL

not	NULL

into	NULL
leanness	NULL

other	NULL
measurable	NULL
effects	NULL
of	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
spiritual	NULL
circuit	NULL
of	NULL
alarmed	NULL
conjecture	NULL
and	NULL
disappointment	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
ignorant	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
can	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
elegant	NULL
leisure	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
lady	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
eleventh	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
when	NULL
leaving	NULL
Stone	NULL
Court	NULL
was	NULL
requested	NULL
by	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL

that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Featherstone	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL
wished	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
Stone	NULL
Court	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
called	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
warehouse	NULL

or	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
written	NULL
a	NULL
message	NULL

a	NULL
leaf	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
pocket-book	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL

Yet	NULL
these	NULL
simple	NULL
devices	NULL
apparently	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
occur	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
may	NULL
conclude	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
strong	NULL
objection	NULL
to	NULL
calling	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
when	NULL
Mr.	NULL

was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL

leaving	NULL
the	NULL
message	NULL

from	NULL

to	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL

her	NULL
father	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
moment	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
her	NULL
happiness	NULL
were	NULL
returning	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
keenly	NULL
hurt	NULL
by	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
manner	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
blush	NULL
had	NULL
departed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
assented	NULL
coldly	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
adding	NULL
an	NULL
unnecessary	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
trivial	NULL
chain-work	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
enabling	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
higher	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
chin	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
all	NULL
failures	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
is	NULL
certainly	NULL
the	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
sitting	NULL
two	NULL
long	NULL
moments	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
moved	NULL
his	NULL
whip	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
say	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
rose	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
nervous	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
struggle	NULL
between	NULL
mortification	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
wish	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
betray	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
dropped	NULL
her	NULL
chain	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
startled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rose	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
mechanically	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
instantaneously	NULL
stooped	NULL
to	NULL
pick	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
chain	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
rose	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
near	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
lovely	NULL
little	NULL
face	NULL
set	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
fair	NULL
long	NULL
neck	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
turning	NULL
about	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
perfect	NULL
management	NULL
of	NULL
self-contented	NULL
grace	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
raised	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
helpless	NULL
quivering	NULL
which	NULL
touched	NULL
him	NULL
quite	NULL
newly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
questioning	NULL
flash	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
natural	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
old	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
tears	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
use	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
than	NULL
let	NULL
them	NULL
stay	NULL
like	NULL
water	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
blue	NULL
flower	NULL
or	NULL
let	NULL
them	NULL
fall	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
naturalness	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
crystallizing	NULL
feather-touch	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
shook	NULL
flirtation	NULL
into	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

Remember	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
ambitious	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
those	NULL
Forget-me-nots	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
warm-hearted	NULL
and	NULL
rash	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
chain	NULL
went	NULL
;	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
had	NULL
thrilled	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
recesses	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
miraculous	NULL
effect	NULL
in	NULL
raising	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
passionate	NULL
love	NULL
lying	NULL
buried	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
no	NULL
sealed	NULL
sepulchre	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
lightest	NULL
,	NULL
easily	NULL
pierced	NULL
mould	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
words	NULL
were	NULL
quite	NULL
abrupt	NULL
and	NULL
awkward	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
tone	NULL
made	NULL
them	NULL
sound	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
ardent	NULL
,	NULL
appealing	NULL
avowal	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
?	NULL

you	NULL
are	NULL
distressed	NULL
.	NULL

Tell	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
pray	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
tones	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
were	NULL
:	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tears	NULL
fell	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
complete	NULL
answer	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
forgetting	NULL
everything	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
completely	NULL
mastered	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
outrush	NULL
of	NULL
tenderness	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sudden	NULL
belief	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
sweet	NULL
young	NULL
creature	NULL
depended	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
joy	NULL
,	NULL
actually	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
folding	NULL
her	NULL
gently	NULL
and	NULL
protectingly	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
being	NULL
gentle	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
weak	NULL
and	NULL
suffering	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
large	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
arriving	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
understanding	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
angry	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
moved	NULL
backward	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
in	NULL
timid	NULL
happiness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
could	NULL
now	NULL
sit	NULL
near	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
speak	NULL
less	NULL
incompletely	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
confession	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
gratitude	NULL
and	NULL
tenderness	NULL
with	NULL
impulsive	NULL
lavishment	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
an	NULL
engaged	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
soul	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bound	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL

was	NULL

before	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL

demand	NULL

Naturally	NULL

for	NULL

those	NULL

Featherstone	NULL
blood	NULL
was	NULL

,	NULL
not	NULL
from	NULL
penuriousness	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL

from	NULL

Brother	NULL

were	NULL
rich	NULL

the	NULL

candor	NULL
and	NULL
total	NULL
abstinence	NULL

act	NULL
of	NULL

will	NULL
would	NULL
overlook	NULL
the	NULL
superior	NULL
claims	NULL
of	NULL
wealth	NULL

Themselves	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
unnatural	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
banish	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
hardly	NULL
eccentric	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL

kept	NULL

Brother	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
claims	NULL

They	NULL
knew	NULL
Peter	NULL

maxim	NULL

that	NULL
money	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
egg	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
laid	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
warm	NULL
nest	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Brother	NULL
Jonah	NULL
,	NULL
Sister	NULL
Martha	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
needy	NULL
exiles	NULL
,	NULL
held	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
.	NULL

Probabilities	NULL
are	NULL
as	NULL
various	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
faces	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
at	NULL
will	NULL

from	NULL
Jupiter	NULL
to	NULL
Judy	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
only	NULL
look	NULL
with	NULL
creative	NULL
inclination	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
the	NULL
poorer	NULL
and	NULL
least	NULL
favored	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
likely	NULL
that	NULL
since	NULL
Peter	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
nothing	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
remember	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

Jonah	NULL
argued	NULL
that	NULL
men	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
surprise	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
wills	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Martha	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
nobody	NULL
need	NULL
be	NULL
surprised	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
to	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
least	NULL
expected	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Also	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
thought	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
an	NULL
own	NULL
brother	NULL
"	NULL
lying	NULL
there	NULL
"	NULL
with	NULL
dropsy	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
legs	NULL
must	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
blood	NULL
was	NULL
thicker	NULL
than	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
alter	NULL
his	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
money	NULL
by	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
some	NULL
blood-relations	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
premises	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
watch	NULL
against	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
hardly	NULL
relations	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL

Such	NULL
things	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
known	NULL
as	NULL
forged	NULL
wills	NULL
and	NULL
disputed	NULL
wills	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
golden-hazy	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
somehow	NULL

non-legatees	NULL

Again	NULL

those	NULL

thought	NULL

Stone	NULL
Court	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL

nothing	NULL

right	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL

her	NULL

poor	NULL
Peter	NULL

could	NULL
represent	NULL

watch	NULL

Jonah	NULL

an	NULL
unfair	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
improbable	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL

In	NULL
fact	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
sense	NULL
running	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
blood	NULL
that	NULL
everybody	NULL

watch	NULL
everybody	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL

Almighty	NULL

Stone	NULL

saw	NULL
one	NULL

Mary	NULL

her	NULL
down	NULL

the	NULL

telling	NULL

I	NULL

come	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL

was	NULL
mainly	NULL
supported	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
calling	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
modest	NULL
enough	NULL

it	NULL

which	NULL

liked	NULL

about	NULL

seemed	NULL
to	NULL
consider	NULL
Miss	NULL
Garth	NULL
a	NULL
suspicious	NULL
character	NULL

and	NULL
followed	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
cold	NULL
eyes	NULL

Mary	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
borne	NULL
this	NULL
one	NULL
pair	NULL

comparative	NULL
ease	NULL

unfortunately	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
young	NULL
Cranch	NULL

who	NULL

having	NULL
come	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL

represent	NULL
his	NULL

Jonah	NULL

also	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL

give	NULL
his	NULL

Young	NULL
Cranch	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
exactly	NULL
the	NULL
balancing	NULL

the	NULL
idiot	NULL

--	NULL
verging	NULL
slightly	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL

squinting	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
everything	NULL

doubt	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
sentiments	NULL
except	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL

a	NULL

character	NULL

When	NULL
Mary	NULL
Garth	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Jonah	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
cold	NULL
detective	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
young	NULL
Cranch	NULL
turning	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

seemed	NULL
to	NULL
insist	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
remark	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
squinting	NULL

it	NULL
with	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
too	NULL

poor	NULL
Mary	NULL
;	NULL
sometimes	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
bilious	NULL

sometimes	NULL
it	NULL
upset	NULL
her	NULL
gravity	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
resist	NULL
describing	NULL
the	NULL

Fred	NULL

who	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL

hindered	NULL
from	NULL
immediately	NULL

see	NULL
it	NULL

simply	NULL

But	NULL
no	NULL
sooner	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
face	NULL
the	NULL
four	NULL
eyes	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
rush	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
nearest	NULL
door	NULL

happened	NULL
to	NULL
lead	NULL

the	NULL
dairy	NULL

and	NULL
there	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
roof	NULL

among	NULL
the	NULL
pans	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
laughter	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
hollow	NULL
resonance	NULL
perfectly	NULL
audible	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL

He	NULL
fled	NULL

were	NULL
some	NULL

under	NULL
Mary	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
comic	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
secretly	NULL
convinced	NULL

though	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL

grounds	NULL
than	NULL
her	NULL

observation	NULL

they	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL

disappointed	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
relations	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
at	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
disdain	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
's	NULL
evident	NULL
alarm	NULL
lest	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
Fred	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
alone	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
hinder	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
thinking	NULL
anxiously	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Fred	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
affected	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
turn	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL

left	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
poor	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
butt	NULL
of	NULL
Fred	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
present	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
enjoy	NULL
his	NULL
follies	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
absent	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
her	NULL
thoughts	NULL

a	NULL
vigorous	NULL
young	NULL
mind	NULL
not	NULL
overbalanced	NULL
by	NULL

making	NULL
acquaintance	NULL

Mary	NULL
had	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
merriment	NULL
within	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
thought	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
veined	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
solemnity	NULL
or	NULL
pathos	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
:	NULL
such	NULL
sentiments	NULL
are	NULL
easier	NULL
to	NULL
affect	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
about	NULL
an	NULL
aged	NULL
creature	NULL
whose	NULL
life	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
visibly	NULL
anything	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
remnant	NULL
of	NULL
vices	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
seen	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
useful	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
anxious	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
soul	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
always	NULL
snapping	NULL
at	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
saints	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Mary	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
returned	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
harsh	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
waited	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
faithfully	NULL

that	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
utmost	NULL

Old	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
himself	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
anxious	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
declined	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Tucker	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL

To-night	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
snapped	NULL

and	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
he	NULL
lay	NULL
remarkably	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
Mary	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
rattling	NULL
his	NULL
bunch	NULL
of	NULL
keys	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
tin	NULL
box	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
kept	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

About	NULL
three	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

with	NULL
remarkable	NULL
distinctness	NULL

"	NULL

Mary	NULL
obeyed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
drawn	NULL
the	NULL
tin	NULL
box	NULL
from	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
clothes	NULL

though	NULL
he	NULL
usually	NULL
asked	NULL

have	NULL
this	NULL

for	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
selected	NULL
the	NULL
key	NULL

He	NULL
now	NULL
unlocked	NULL
the	NULL
box	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
drawing	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL
another	NULL
key	NULL

looked	NULL
straight	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
eyes	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL

have	NULL
recovered	NULL
all	NULL
their	NULL
sharpness	NULL

said	NULL

"	NULL

nodded	NULL
slightly	NULL

went	NULL

Mary	NULL
approached	NULL
him	NULL
cautiously	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
him	NULL
too	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
dropping	NULL
his	NULL
keys	NULL
and	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
grasp	NULL
his	NULL
stick	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
aged	NULL
hyena	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
muscles	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
getting	NULL
distorted	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
effort	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
paused	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
safe	NULL
distance	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
me	NULL
give	NULL
you	NULL
some	NULL
cordial	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
quietly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
compose	NULL
yourself	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
will	NULL
perhaps	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL

And	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
by	NULL
daylight	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
like	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
lifted	NULL
the	NULL
stick	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
being	NULL
beyond	NULL
his	NULL
reach	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
threw	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
effort	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
impotence	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
fell	NULL
,	NULL
slipping	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
let	NULL
it	NULL
lie	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
retreated	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
chair	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
.	NULL

By-and-by	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
cordial	NULL
.	NULL

Fatigue	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
passive	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
chillest	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
low	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
chink	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
moreen	NULL
window-curtains	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
whitened	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
blind	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
put	NULL
some	NULL
wood	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
and	NULL
thrown	NULL
a	NULL
shawl	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
hoping	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
might	NULL
now	NULL
fall	NULL
asleep	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
near	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
irritation	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
kept	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
after	NULL
throwing	NULL
the	NULL
stick	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
taking	NULL
his	NULL
keys	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
laying	NULL
his	NULL
right	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dropping	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Mary	NULL
herself	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
agitated	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
remembrance	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
through	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
reality	NULL
--	NULL
questioning	NULL
those	NULL
acts	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
imperatively	NULL
and	NULL
excluded	NULL
all	NULL
question	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
critical	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
the	NULL
dry	NULL
wood	NULL
sent	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
flame	NULL
which	NULL
illuminated	NULL
every	NULL
crevice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mary	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
quietly	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
turned	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
inaudible	NULL
steps	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
looked	NULL
strangely	NULL
motionless	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
movement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
flame	NULL
communicating	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
objects	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
uncertain	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
violent	NULL
beating	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
rendered	NULL
her	NULL
perceptions	NULL
so	NULL
doubtful	NULL
that	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
touched	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
breathing	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
trust	NULL
her	NULL
conclusions	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
and	NULL
gently	NULL
propped	NULL
aside	NULL
the	NULL
curtain	NULL
and	NULL
blind	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
still	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
fell	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
next	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
ran	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
and	NULL
rang	NULL
it	NULL
energetically	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
any	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
Peter	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
right	NULL
hand	NULL
clasping	NULL
the	NULL
keys	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
left	NULL
hand	NULL
lying	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
heap	NULL
of	NULL
notes	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
morning	NULL
of	NULL
May	NULL
that	NULL
Peter	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
was	NULL
buried	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
prosaic	NULL
neighborhood	NULL
of	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
,	NULL
May	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
warm	NULL
and	NULL
sunny	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
particular	NULL
morning	NULL
a	NULL
chill	NULL
wind	NULL
was	NULL
blowing	NULL
the	NULL
blossoms	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
surrounding	NULL
gardens	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
mounds	NULL
of	NULL
Lowick	NULL
churchyard	NULL
.	NULL

Swiftly	NULL
moving	NULL
clouds	NULL
only	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
allowed	NULL
a	NULL
gleam	NULL
to	NULL
light	NULL
up	NULL
any	NULL
object	NULL
,	NULL
whether	NULL
ugly	NULL
or	NULL
beautiful	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
within	NULL
its	NULL
golden	NULL
shower	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
churchyard	NULL
the	NULL
objects	NULL
were	NULL
remarkably	NULL
various	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
country	NULL
crowd	NULL
waiting	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
funeral	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
news	NULL
had	NULL
spread	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
big	NULL

the	NULL
old	NULL

have	NULL
a	NULL
funeral	NULL

beyond	NULL
his	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
old	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
Harpagon	NULL
whose	NULL
passions	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
been	NULL
devoured	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
ever-lean	NULL

ever-hungry	NULL
passion	NULL
of	NULL

and	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
drive	NULL
a	NULL
bargain	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
undertaker	NULL
beforehand	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
loved	NULL
money	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
also	NULL
loved	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
gratifying	NULL
his	NULL
peculiar	NULL
tastes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
loved	NULL
it	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
others	NULL
feel	NULL

If	NULL
any	NULL

will	NULL
here	NULL
contend	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
traits	NULL
of	NULL
goodness	NULL
in	NULL
old	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
presume	NULL
to	NULL
deny	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
observe	NULL
that	NULL
goodness	NULL
is	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
modest	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
easily	NULL
discouraged	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
much	NULL
privacy	NULL
,	NULL
elbowed	NULL
in	NULL
early	NULL
life	NULL
by	NULL
unabashed	NULL
vices	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
retire	NULL
into	NULL
extreme	NULL
privacy	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
more	NULL
easily	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
by	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
construct	NULL
a	NULL
selfish	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
theoretically	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
by	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
form	NULL
the	NULL
narrower	NULL
judgments	NULL
based	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
personal	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
any	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
bent	NULL
on	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
handsome	NULL
funeral	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
having	NULL
persons	NULL
"	NULL
bid	NULL
"	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
rather	NULL
have	NULL
stayed	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
even	NULL
desired	NULL
that	NULL
female	NULL
relatives	NULL
should	NULL
follow	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
grave	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
poor	NULL
sister	NULL
Martha	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
difficult	NULL
journey	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
purpose	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Chalky	NULL
Flats	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
and	NULL
Jane	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
altogether	NULL
cheered	NULL
(	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
tearful	NULL
manner	NULL
)	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
sign	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
brother	NULL
who	NULL
disliked	NULL
seeing	NULL
them	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
living	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
prospectively	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
presence	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
testator	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
sign	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
equivocal	NULL
by	NULL
being	NULL
extended	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
expense	NULL
in	NULL
handsome	NULL
crape	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
imply	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
presumptuous	NULL
hopes	NULL
,	NULL
aggravated	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
bloom	NULL
of	NULL
complexion	NULL
which	NULL
told	NULL
pretty	NULL
plainly	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
blood-relation	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
generally	NULL
objectionable	NULL
class	NULL
called	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
kin	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
are	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
imaginative	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
form	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
images	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
brood	NULL
of	NULL
desire	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
poor	NULL
old	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
laughed	NULL
much	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
others	NULL
cajoled	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
escape	NULL
the	NULL
fellowship	NULL
of	NULL
illusion	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
writing	NULL
the	NULL
programme	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
burial	NULL
he	NULL
certainly	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
clear	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
drama	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
formed	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
was	NULL
confined	NULL
to	NULL
anticipation	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
chuckling	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
vexations	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
inflict	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
rigid	NULL
clutch	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
dead	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
inevitably	NULL
mingled	NULL
his	NULL
consciousness	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
livid	NULL
stagnant	NULL
presence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
preoccupied	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
future	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
gratification	NULL
inside	NULL
his	NULL
coffin	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
old	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
was	NULL
imaginative	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
fashion	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
mourning-coaches	NULL
were	NULL
filled	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
written	NULL
orders	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
deceased	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
pall-bearers	NULL
on	NULL
horseback	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
richest	NULL
scarfs	NULL
and	NULL
hatbands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
under-bearers	NULL
had	NULL
trappings	NULL
of	NULL
woe	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
well-priced	NULL
quality	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
black	NULL
procession	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
dismounted	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
the	NULL
larger	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
smallness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
churchyard	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
heavy	NULL
human	NULL
faces	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
draperies	NULL
shivering	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
world	NULL
strangely	NULL
incongruous	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
lightly	NULL
dropping	NULL
blossoms	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
gleams	NULL
of	NULL
sunshine	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
daisies	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
clergyman	NULL
who	NULL
met	NULL
the	NULL
procession	NULL
was	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Cadwallader	NULL
--	NULL
also	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
request	NULL
of	NULL
Peter	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
,	NULL
prompted	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
by	NULL
peculiar	NULL
reasons	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
a	NULL
contempt	NULL
for	NULL
curates	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
called	NULL
understrappers	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
buried	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
beneficed	NULL
clergyman	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
merely	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
declined	NULL
duty	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
sort	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
because	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
especial	NULL
dislike	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
rector	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
parish	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
lien	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shape	NULL
of	NULL
tithe	NULL
,	NULL
also	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
deliverer	NULL
of	NULL
morning	NULL
sermons	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pew	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
sleepy	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
through	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
inward	NULL
snarl	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
objection	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
parson	NULL
stuck	NULL
up	NULL
above	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
preaching	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
relations	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Cadwallader	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
kind	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
trout-stream	NULL
which	NULL
ran	NULL
through	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
land	NULL
took	NULL
its	NULL
course	NULL
through	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
's	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Cadwallader	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
parson	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
a	NULL
favor	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
preaching	NULL
.	NULL

Moreover	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
gentry	NULL
living	NULL
four	NULL
miles	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
Lowick	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
exalted	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
equal	NULL
sky	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sheriff	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

This	NULL

conferred	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

made	NULL
one	NULL

the	NULL

that	NULL
watched	NULL
old	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
's	NULL
funeral	NULL
from	NULL
an	NULL

such	NULL
as	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
funeral	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL

persuaded	NULL
Sir	NULL

the	NULL
young	NULL
Lady	NULL
Chettam	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL

The	NULL
upper	NULL

the	NULL

be	NULL
well	NULL
seen	NULL

in	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
stranger	NULL
described	NULL
by	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cadwallader	NULL
as	NULL
frog-faced	NULL
:	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
perhaps	NULL
about	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
and	NULL
thirty	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
prominent	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
thin-lipped	NULL
,	NULL
downward-curved	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hair	NULL
sleekly	NULL
brushed	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
forehead	NULL
that	NULL
sank	NULL
suddenly	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
ridge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
,	NULL
certainly	NULL
gave	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
a	NULL
batrachian	NULL
unchangeableness	NULL
of	NULL
expression	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
,	NULL
clearly	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
legatee	NULL
;	NULL
else	NULL
why	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
bidden	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
mourner	NULL
?	NULL

Here	NULL
were	NULL
new	NULL
possibilities	NULL
,	NULL
raising	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
uncertainty	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
almost	NULL
checked	NULL
remark	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mourning-coaches	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
are	NULL
all	NULL
humiliated	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sudden	NULL
discovery	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fact	NULL
which	NULL
has	NULL
existed	NULL
very	NULL
comfortably	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
been	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
us	NULL
in	NULL
private	NULL
while	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
making	NULL
up	NULL
our	NULL
world	NULL
entirely	NULL
without	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
this	NULL
questionable	NULL
stranger	NULL
before	NULL
except	NULL
Mary	NULL
Garth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
twice	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
Stone	NULL
Court	NULL
when	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
was	NULL
down-stairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
sat	NULL
alone	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
several	NULL
hours	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL
of	NULL
mentioning	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
Caleb	NULL
's	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
lawyer	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
examined	NULL
the	NULL
stranger	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
inquiry	NULL
than	NULL
of	NULL
disgust	NULL
or	NULL
suspicion	NULL
.	NULL

Caleb	NULL
Garth	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
little	NULL
expectation	NULL
and	NULL
less	NULL
cupidity	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
verification	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
guesses	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
calmness	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
half	NULL
smilingly	NULL
rubbed	NULL
his	NULL
chin	NULL
and	NULL
shot	NULL
intelligent	NULL
glances	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
valuing	NULL
a	NULL
tree	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
contrast	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
alarm	NULL
or	NULL
scorn	NULL
visible	NULL
in	NULL
other	NULL
faces	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
unknown	NULL
mourner	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
understood	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
Rigg	NULL
,	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
wainscoted	NULL
parlor	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
seat	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
audience	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL

Just	NULL
then	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Solomon	NULL

Mr.	NULL

were	NULL
gone	NULL
up-stairs	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

seeing	NULL
two	NULL

Mr.	NULL

had	NULL
the	NULL

I	NULL

something	NULL

Mary	NULL
Garth	NULL
,	NULL
discerning	NULL
his	NULL
distress	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
twitchings	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL

and	NULL
his	NULL
recourse	NULL

a	NULL
cough	NULL

came	NULL
cleverly	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
rescue	NULL
by	NULL
asking	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
seats	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
shadowy	NULL
corner	NULL

Fred	NULL
was	NULL
feeling	NULL
as	NULL
good-naturedly	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
towards	NULL
everybody	NULL

including	NULL
Rigg	NULL

having	NULL
some	NULL
relenting	NULL
towards	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
less	NULL
lucky	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL

being	NULL
himself	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
have	NULL
behaved	NULL
amiss	NULL

still	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
particularly	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
laugh	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
entrance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lawyer	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
brothers	NULL
drew	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
attention	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lawyer	NULL
was	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Standish	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
Stone	NULL
Court	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
believing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
well	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
pleased	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
disappointed	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
will	NULL
he	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
drawn	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Standish	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
varied	NULL
his	NULL
manners	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
behaved	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
deep-voiced	NULL
,	NULL
off-hand	NULL
civility	NULL
to	NULL
everybody	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
difference	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL

and	NULL
talked	NULL
chiefly	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hay-crop	NULL

which	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
"	NULL
very	NULL
fine	NULL

the	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL

every	NULL

just	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
rule	NULL
over	NULL
an	NULL
island	NULL
like	NULL
Britain	NULL
.	NULL

Old	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
reflected	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
that	NULL
Standish	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
surprised	NULL
some	NULL
day	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
burnt	NULL
the	NULL
will	NULL
drawn	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
another	NULL
lawyer	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
secured	NULL
that	NULL
minor	NULL
end	NULL
;	NULL
still	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
ruminating	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
certainly	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Standish	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
sorry	NULL
;	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
rather	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
the	NULL
zest	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
curiosity	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
discovery	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
will	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
prospective	NULL
amazement	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
family	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sentiments	NULL
of	NULL
Solomon	NULL
and	NULL
Jonah	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
held	NULL
in	NULL
utter	NULL
suspense	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
will	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
validity	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
interlacement	NULL
of	NULL
poor	NULL
Peter	NULL
's	NULL
former	NULL
and	NULL
latter	NULL
intentions	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
create	NULL
endless	NULL
"	NULL
lawing	NULL
"	NULL
before	NULL
anybody	NULL
came	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
inconvenience	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
the	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL

Hence	NULL
the	NULL
brothers	NULL
showed	NULL
a	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
neutral	NULL
gravity	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
re-entered	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Standish	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Solomon	NULL
took	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
white	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
again	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
case	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
affecting	NULL
passages	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
crying	NULL
at	NULL
funerals	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
dry	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
customarily	NULL
served	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
lawn	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
person	NULL
who	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
throbbing	NULL
excitement	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
was	NULL
Mary	NULL
Garth	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
consciousness	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
virtually	NULL
determined	NULL
the	NULL
production	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
second	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
momentous	NULL
effects	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
persons	NULL
present	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
soul	NULL
except	NULL
herself	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
final	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
will	NULL
I	NULL
hold	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Standish	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
seated	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
about	NULL
everything	NULL
,	NULL
including	NULL
the	NULL
coughs	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
showed	NULL
a	NULL
disposition	NULL
to	NULL
clear	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL

"	NULL
was	NULL

up	NULL

9th	NULL

I	NULL
find	NULL
that	NULL

is	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL

cleared	NULL

Featherstones	NULL

brought	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL

Mr.	NULL

was	NULL
more	NULL
discontent	NULL
with	NULL

speculation	NULL

And	NULL
here	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
naturally	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
reflect	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
means	NULL

elevating	NULL
a	NULL

Historical	NULL
parallels	NULL
are	NULL
remarkably	NULL
efficient	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL

The	NULL
chief	NULL
objection	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
diligent	NULL
narrator	NULL
may	NULL
lack	NULL
space	NULL

(	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL

them	NULL

he	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
philosophical	NULL
confidence	NULL

dignity	NULL

observe	NULL
that	NULL

may	NULL

this	NULL

Lydgate	NULL

the	NULL
prosecution	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL

he	NULL
walked	NULL
by	NULL
hereditary	NULL
habit	NULL

half	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
personal	NULL
pride	NULL

unreflecting	NULL
egoism	NULL
which	NULL

half	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL

Any	NULL

Lydgate	NULL

the	NULL
consequences	NULL

out	NULL

had	NULL
been	NULL

And	NULL
happening	NULL
the	NULL

Brassing	NULL

he	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
dinner-service	NULL
there	NULL
which	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL

exactly	NULL
the	NULL

thing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL

it	NULL

when	NULL
you	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
hated	NULL

The	NULL
dinner-service	NULL
in	NULL

that	NULL

the	NULL

it	NULL

"	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

Of	NULL

it	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
was	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL

gained	NULL
her	NULL
point	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
's	NULL

consisted	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
demand	NULL
that	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

spirit	NULL

without	NULL

considerations	NULL

however	NULL

bride	NULL

going	NULL

half-dozen	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

herself	NULL

very	NULL
highest	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
finding	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
sum	NULL

eight	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
considerably	NULL
reduced	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL

his	NULL
inclination	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL

pattern	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
shown	NULL

him	NULL

into	NULL
Kibble	NULL

establishment	NULL
at	NULL

was	NULL
too	NULL
proud	NULL

act	NULL
as	NULL

presupposed	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
would	NULL
advance	NULL
money	NULL

necessary	NULL

everything	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL

anything	NULL

the	NULL

All	NULL
these	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
foresaw	NULL
that	NULL

the	NULL
objects	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
alone	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
smiled	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

really	NULL
accepted	NULL
the	NULL
suggestion	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

pleasure	NULL

of	NULL
injuring	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
rather	NULL
we	NULL
meet	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
claims	NULL
on	NULL
us	NULL
by	NULL
active	NULL
benefits	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
drawing	NULL
of	NULL
cheques	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
superiority	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
recognize	NULL
,	NULL
gives	NULL
our	NULL
bitterness	NULL
a	NULL
milder	NULL
infusion	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
deprived	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
superiority	NULL
(	NULL
as	NULL
anything	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
remembrance	NULL
)	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
,	NULL
capricious	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
antipathy	NULL
to	NULL
Will	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
spring	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
common	NULL
jealousy	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
winter-worn	NULL
husband	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
deeper	NULL
,	NULL
bred	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
lifelong	NULL
claims	NULL
and	NULL
discontents	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
present	NULL
--	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
wife	NULL
who	NULL
herself	NULL
had	NULL
shown	NULL
an	NULL
offensive	NULL
capability	NULL
of	NULL
criticism	NULL
,	NULL
necessarily	NULL
gave	NULL
concentration	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
uneasiness	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
before	NULL
been	NULL
vague	NULL
.	NULL

Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
side	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
dislike	NULL
was	NULL
flourishing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
expense	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
gratitude	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
spent	NULL
much	NULL
inward	NULL
discourse	NULL
in	NULL
justifying	NULL
the	NULL
dislike	NULL
.	NULL

Casaubon	NULL
hated	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
;	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
entrance	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
discern	NULL
a	NULL
bitterness	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mouth	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
venom	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
glance	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
almost	NULL
justify	NULL
declaring	NULL
war	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
past	NULL
benefits	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
really	NULL
the	NULL
act	NULL
of	NULL
marrying	NULL
this	NULL
wife	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
set-off	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
obligation	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
whether	NULL
gratitude	NULL
which	NULL
refers	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
done	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
self	NULL
ought	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
indignation	NULL
at	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
done	NULL
against	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
a	NULL
wrong	NULL
to	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
in	NULL
marrying	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
himself	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
gray	NULL
crunching	NULL
bones	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cavern	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
business	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
luring	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
companionship	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
horrible	NULL
of	NULL
virgin-sacrifices	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Will	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
painted	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
what	NULL
were	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
inward	NULL
sorrows	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
writing	NULL
a	NULL
choric	NULL
wail	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
lose	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
watch	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
up	NULL
everything	NULL
else	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
watch	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
one	NULL
slave	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
Will	NULL
had	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
Sir	NULL
Thomas	NULL
Browne	NULL
's	NULL
phrase	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
passionate	NULL
prodigality	NULL
"	NULL
of	NULL
statement	NULL
both	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
simple	NULL
truth	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
then	NULL
invited	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
strongly	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
.	NULL

Invitations	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
formal	NULL
kind	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
wanting	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Will	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Lowick	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
confident	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
everything	NULL
agreeable	NULL
which	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
absorbed	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
arranged	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
to	NULL
Lowick	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL
(	NULL
not	NULL
neglecting	NULL
meanwhile	NULL
to	NULL
introduce	NULL
him	NULL
elsewhere	NULL
on	NULL
every	NULL
opportunity	NULL
as	NULL
"	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
relative	NULL
of	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
"	NULL
)	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
though	NULL
Will	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
interviews	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
restore	NULL
her	NULL
former	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
young	NULL
companionship	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
cleverer	NULL
than	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
seemed	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
swayed	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Poor	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
found	NULL
much	NULL
room	NULL
in	NULL
other	NULL
minds	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
cared	NULL
most	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
superior	NULL
instruction	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
with	NULL
any	NULL
keenness	NULL
of	NULL
interest	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
patience	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
a	NULL
quotation	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Delectus	NULL
familiar	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
tender	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
mentioned	NULL
curtly	NULL
what	NULL
ancient	NULL
sects	NULL
or	NULL
personages	NULL
had	NULL
held	NULL
similar	NULL
ideas	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
in	NULL
stock	NULL
already	NULL
;	NULL
at	NULL
other	NULL
times	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
inform	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
mistaken	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
reassert	NULL
what	NULL
her	NULL
remark	NULL
had	NULL
questioned	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
always	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
more	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
saw	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
had	NULL
little	NULL
vanity	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
ardent	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
need	NULL
to	NULL
rule	NULL
beneficently	NULL
by	NULL
making	NULL
the	NULL
joy	NULL
of	NULL
another	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

Hence	NULL
the	NULL
mere	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
Will	NULL
occasionally	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
lunette	NULL
opened	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
prison	NULL
,	NULL
giving	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
glimpse	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sunny	NULL
air	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
pleasure	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
nullify	NULL
her	NULL
original	NULL
alarm	NULL
at	NULL
what	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
might	NULL
think	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
introduction	NULL
of	NULL
Will	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
guest	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
this	NULL
subject	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
remained	NULL
dumb	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Will	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
with	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
impatient	NULL
of	NULL
slow	NULL
circumstance	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
slight	NULL
the	NULL
terrestrial	NULL
intercourse	NULL
between	NULL
Dante	NULL
and	NULL
Beatrice	NULL
or	NULL
Petrarch	NULL
and	NULL
Laura	NULL
,	NULL
time	NULL
changes	NULL
the	NULL
proportion	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
later	NULL
days	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
preferable	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
fewer	NULL
sonnets	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
conversation	NULL
.	NULL

Necessity	NULL
excused	NULL
stratagem	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
stratagem	NULL
was	NULL
limited	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
dread	NULL
of	NULL
offending	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
particular	NULL
sketch	NULL
at	NULL
Lowick	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
morning	NULL
when	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
Lowick	NULL
road	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
Will	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
set	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
sketch-book	NULL
and	NULL
camp-stool	NULL
at	NULL
Lowick	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
announcing	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Manor	NULL
settled	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
sketch	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
position	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
see	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
usually	NULL
walked	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
stratagem	NULL
was	NULL
defeated	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
.	NULL

Clouds	NULL
gathered	NULL
with	NULL
treacherous	NULL
quickness	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
rain	NULL
came	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Will	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
shelter	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
intended	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
strength	NULL
of	NULL
relationship	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
and	NULL
wait	NULL
there	NULL
without	NULL
being	NULL
announced	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
seeing	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
the	NULL
butler	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL

Pratt	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
red-cheeked	NULL
man	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
lively	NULL
converse	NULL
with	NULL
Tantripp	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
often	NULL
agreeing	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
dull	NULL
for	NULL
Madam	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
Will	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
so	NULL
happy	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
affected	NULL
indifference	NULL
with	NULL
delightful	NULL
ease	NULL

In	NULL
another	NULL
minute	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL

and	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
meeting	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
sweet	NULL
unconstrained	NULL
smile	NULL

Mr.	NULL

would	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
uttered	NULL
these	NULL
common	NULL
words	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
simple	NULL
sincerity	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
unhappy	NULL
child	NULL

visited	NULL

Will	NULL
,	NULL
mysteriously	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
just	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL

"	NULL

at	NULL
once	NULL

the	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL

a	NULL

my	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
you	NULL

ask	NULL

the	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
himself	NULL

dimmed	NULL

forever	NULL
ray-shorn	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
you	NULL

said	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
mournfulness	NULL

as	NULL
she	NULL
rose	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL

She	NULL
also	NULL

her	NULL
thought	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL

So	NULL
they	NULL
only	NULL
said	NULL

Will	NULL
quitted	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

striking	NULL
across	NULL

carriage	NULL

however	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL
appear	NULL
at	NULL

four	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
unpropitious	NULL
hour	NULL
for	NULL
coming	NULL
home	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
early	NULL

gain	NULL
the	NULL
moral	NULL
support	NULL
under	NULL
ennui	NULL
of	NULL
dressing	NULL
his	NULL
person	NULL

undress	NULL
his	NULL

be	NULL
prepared	NULL

On	NULL
such	NULL

he	NULL

read	NULL

him	NULL

added	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
air	NULL

effort	NULL
which	NULL
never	NULL
forsook	NULL
him	NULL

when	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
without	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
consideration	NULL
to	NULL
soften	NULL
her	NULL

However	NULL

he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

she	NULL
presently	NULL
recurred	NULL

there	NULL

has	NULL
on	NULL
your	NULL

in	NULL
some	NULL

which	NULL
involves	NULL
your	NULL
residence	NULL

this	NULL

a	NULL
capacity	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
justified	NULL
in	NULL

my	NULL

such	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
as	NULL
renders	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
natural	NULL

warrantable	NULL
in	NULL
me	NULL
when	NULL
that	NULL
effect	NULL
is	NULL
viewed	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
influence	NULL

legitimate	NULL
feeling	NULL

incumbent	NULL
on	NULL
me	NULL

the	NULL

considered	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

my	NULL

state	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
that	NULL
your	NULL
acceptance	NULL

It	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
innocently	NULL
at	NULL
work	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
further	NULL
embitterment	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
;	NULL
dwelling	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sympathy	NULL
that	NULL
grew	NULL
to	NULL
agitation	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
what	NULL
Will	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
parents	NULL
and	NULL
grandparents	NULL
.	NULL

Any	NULL
private	NULL
hours	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
day	NULL
were	NULL
usually	NULL
spent	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
blue-green	NULL
boudoir	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
pallid	NULL
quaintness	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
outwardly	NULL
altered	NULL
there	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
had	NULL
gradually	NULL
advanced	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
western	NULL
fields	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
avenue	NULL
of	NULL
elms	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
bare	NULL
room	NULL
had	NULL
gathered	NULL
within	NULL
it	NULL
those	NULL
memories	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
inward	NULL
life	NULL
which	NULL
fill	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
as	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
cloud	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
or	NULL
bad	NULL
angels	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
invisible	NULL
yet	NULL
active	NULL
forms	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
spiritual	NULL
triumphs	NULL
or	NULL
our	NULL
spiritual	NULL
falls	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
struggle	NULL
for	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
resolve	NULL
in	NULL
looking	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
avenue	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
arch	NULL
of	NULL
western	NULL
light	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
vision	NULL
itself	NULL
had	NULL
gained	NULL
a	NULL
communicating	NULL
power	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
the	NULL
pale	NULL
stag	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
reminding	NULL
glances	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
mean	NULL
mutely	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
delicately	NULL
touched	NULL
miniatures	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
audience	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
beings	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
disturbed	NULL
about	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
earthly	NULL
lot	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
humanly	NULL
interested	NULL

Especially	NULL
the	NULL
mysterious	NULL
"	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Julia	NULL
"	NULL
about	NULL
whom	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
question	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
her	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
Will	NULL
,	NULL
many	NULL
fresh	NULL
images	NULL
had	NULL
gathered	NULL
round	NULL
that	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Julia	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
Will	NULL
's	NULL
grandmother	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
delicate	NULL
miniature	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
living	NULL
face	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
helping	NULL
to	NULL
concentrate	NULL
her	NULL
feelings	NULL

What	NULL
a	NULL
wrong	NULL

to	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
protection	NULL
and	NULL
inheritance	NULL
only	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
chosen	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
poor	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
early	NULL
troubling	NULL
her	NULL
elders	NULL
with	NULL
questions	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
wrought	NULL
herself	NULL
into	NULL
some	NULL
independent	NULL
clearness	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
historical	NULL
,	NULL
political	NULL
reasons	NULL
why	NULL
eldest	NULL
sons	NULL
had	NULL
superior	NULL
rights	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
why	NULL
land	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
entailed	NULL
:	NULL
those	NULL
reasons	NULL
,	NULL
impressing	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
awe	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
weightier	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
ties	NULL
which	NULL
left	NULL
them	NULL
uninfringed	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
daughter	NULL
whose	NULL
child	NULL
--	NULL
even	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ordinary	NULL
aping	NULL
of	NULL
aristocratic	NULL
institutions	NULL
by	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
are	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
aristocratic	NULL
than	NULL
retired	NULL
grocers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
land	NULL
to	NULL
"	NULL
keep	NULL
together	NULL
"	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
lawn	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
paddock	NULL
--	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
prior	NULL
claim	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
inheritance	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
liking	NULL
or	NULL
of	NULL
responsibility	NULL
?	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
energy	NULL
of	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
nature	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
responsibility	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
fulfilment	NULL
of	NULL
claims	NULL
founded	NULL
on	NULL
our	NULL
own	NULL
deeds	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
marriage	NULL
and	NULL
parentage	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
debt	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Ladislaws	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
back	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
Ladislaws	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
wronged	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
bulk	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
property	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
proviso	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
having	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
altered	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
time	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
lost	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
very	NULL
question	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
arisen	NULL
about	NULL
Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
's	NULL
occupation	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
for	NULL
placing	NULL
things	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
,	NULL
right	NULL
footing	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
previous	NULL
conduct	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
just	NULL
view	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
proposed	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
whose	NULL
interest	NULL
an	NULL
unfair	NULL
concentration	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
property	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
urged	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
right	NULL
had	NULL
surmounted	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
continue	NULL
to	NULL
surmount	NULL
anything	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
called	NULL
antipathy	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
suspected	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
scheme	NULL
was	NULL
disapproved	NULL
by	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
seem	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
opportune	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
fresh	NULL
understanding	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
begun	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
Will	NULL
's	NULL
starting	NULL
penniless	NULL
and	NULL
accepting	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
function	NULL
that	NULL
offered	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
find	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
rightful	NULL
income	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
paid	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
immediate	NULL
alteration	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
secured	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
vision	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
as	NULL
what	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
letting	NULL
in	NULL
of	NULL
daylight	NULL
,	NULL
waking	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
previous	NULL
stupidity	NULL
and	NULL
incurious	NULL
self-absorbed	NULL
ignorance	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
relation	NULL
to	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
had	NULL
refused	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
future	NULL
aid	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
ground	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
appeared	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
himself	NULL
seen	NULL
fully	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
claim	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
great	NULL
strength	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
character	NULL
lies	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
what	NULL
are	NULL
we	NULL
doing	NULL
with	NULL
our	NULL
money	NULL
?	NULL

We	NULL
make	NULL
no	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
half	NULL

our	NULL
income	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
own	NULL
money	NULL
buys	NULL
me	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
an	NULL
uneasy	NULL
conscience	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
fascination	NULL
for	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
division	NULL
of	NULL
property	NULL
intended	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
always	NULL
regarded	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
excessive	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
blind	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL
obvious	NULL
to	NULL
others	NULL
--	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
tread	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
places	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Celia	NULL
had	NULL
warned	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
yet	NULL
her	NULL
blindness	NULL
to	NULL
whatever	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
lie	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
pure	NULL
purpose	NULL
carried	NULL
her	NULL
safely	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
precipices	NULL
where	NULL
vision	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
perilous	NULL
with	NULL
fear	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
thoughts	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
gathered	NULL
vividness	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
solitude	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
boudoir	NULL
occupied	NULL
her	NULL
incessantly	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
his	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
Will	NULL
.	NULL

Everything	NULL
seemed	NULL
hindrance	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL
of	NULL
opening	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
his	NULL
preoccupied	NULL
mind	NULL
all	NULL
subjects	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
approached	NULL
gently	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
since	NULL
his	NULL
illness	NULL
lost	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
consciousness	NULL
the	NULL
dread	NULL
of	NULL
agitating	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
young	NULL
ardor	NULL
is	NULL
set	NULL
brooding	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
conception	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
prompt	NULL
deed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
deed	NULL
itself	NULL
seems	NULL
to	NULL
start	NULL
forth	NULL
with	NULL
independent	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
mastering	NULL
ideal	NULL
obstacles	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
day	NULL
passed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sombre	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
unusual	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
unusually	NULL
silent	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
hours	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
counted	NULL
on	NULL
as	NULL
opportunities	NULL
of	NULL
conversation	NULL

for	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
sleeplessness	NULL

had	NULL
established	NULL
a	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
rising	NULL

him	NULL

this	NULL

he	NULL
laughed	NULL

himself	NULL

Having	NULL

this	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
less	NULL
uneasy	NULL
in	NULL
calling	NULL
attention	NULL

if	NULL
we	NULL

Socially	NULL
speaking	NULL
,	NULL
Joshua	NULL
Rigg	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
generally	NULL
pronounced	NULL
a	NULL
superfluity	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
like	NULL
Peter	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
copy	NULL
of	NULL
themselves	NULL
demanded	NULL

are	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
last	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
for	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
request	NULL
either	NULL
in	NULL
prose	NULL

The	NULL
copy	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
case	NULL
bore	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
outside	NULL
resemblance	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
whose	NULL
sex	NULL
frog-features	NULL
,	NULL
accompanied	NULL
with	NULL
fresh-colored	NULL
cheeks	NULL

a	NULL

,	NULL
are	NULL
compatible	NULL
with	NULL
much	NULL
charm	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
order	NULL
of	NULL
admirers	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
result	NULL
is	NULL
sometimes	NULL
a	NULL
frog-faced	NULL
male	NULL
,	NULL
desirable	NULL
,	NULL
surely	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
no	NULL
order	NULL
of	NULL
intelligent	NULL
beings	NULL

Especially	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
suddenly	NULL
brought	NULL
into	NULL
evidence	NULL

frustrate	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
's	NULL
expectations	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
lowest	NULL
aspect	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
social	NULL
superfluity	NULL
can	NULL
present	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Rigg	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
's	NULL
low	NULL
characteristics	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sober	NULL
,	NULL
water-drinking	NULL
kind	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
earliest	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
latest	NULL
hour	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
as	NULL
sleek	NULL
,	NULL
neat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cool	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
frog	NULL
he	NULL
resembled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
old	NULL
Peter	NULL
had	NULL
secretly	NULL
chuckled	NULL
over	NULL
an	NULL
offshoot	NULL
almost	NULL
more	NULL
calculating	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
far	NULL
more	NULL
imperturbable	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
add	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
finger-nails	NULL
were	NULL
scrupulously	NULL
attended	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
a	NULL
well-educated	NULL
young	NULL
lady	NULL
(	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
unspecified	NULL
)	NULL
whose	NULL
person	NULL
was	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whose	NULL
connections	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
solid	NULL
middle-class	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
undeniable	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
his	NULL
nails	NULL
and	NULL
modesty	NULL
were	NULL
comparable	NULL
to	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
most	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
his	NULL
ambition	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
educated	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
opportunities	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
clerk	NULL
and	NULL
accountant	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
smaller	NULL
commercial	NULL
houses	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
seaport	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
rural	NULL
Featherstones	NULL
very	NULL
simple	NULL
absurd	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
turn	NULL
regarded	NULL
his	NULL
"	NULL
bringing	NULL
up	NULL
"	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
seaport	NULL
town	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
exaggeration	NULL

their	NULL
brother	NULL
Peter	NULL

still	NULL
more	NULL
Peter	NULL
's	NULL
property	NULL

should	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
belongings	NULL

The	NULL
garden	NULL
and	NULL
gravel	NULL
approach	NULL

from	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
doubtful	NULL
whether	NULL

looked	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL

contemplation	NULL

turning	NULL

stood	NULL

showed	NULL

As	NULL
Rigg	NULL
pronounced	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
words	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Raffles	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
prominent	NULL
frozen	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
contrast	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
striking	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
eighteen	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Rigg	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
unengaging	NULL
kickable	NULL
boy	NULL

Raffles	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
rather	NULL
thick-set	NULL
Adonis	NULL
of	NULL
bar-rooms	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
advantage	NULL
now	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
Rigg	NULL

auditors	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL

might	NULL

Raffles	NULL

retire	NULL

the	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
defeated	NULL
dog	NULL

Not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
grimace	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
habitual	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
"	NULL

in	NULL

then	NULL
subsided	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL

drew	NULL

He	NULL
jerked	NULL
forward	NULL
the	NULL
flask	NULL
and	NULL
Rigg	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
old	NULL
oaken	NULL
bureau	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
keys	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Raffles	NULL
had	NULL
reminded	NULL
himself	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
movement	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
flask	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
dangerously	NULL
loose	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
leather	NULL
covering	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
catching	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
folded	NULL
paper	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
fender	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
shoved	NULL
it	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
leather	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
glass	NULL
firm	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
Rigg	NULL
came	NULL
forward	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
brandy-bottle	NULL
,	NULL
filled	NULL
the	NULL
flask	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
handed	NULL
Raffles	NULL
a	NULL
sovereign	NULL
,	NULL
neither	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
nor	NULL
speaking	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

After	NULL
locking	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
bureau	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
and	NULL
gazed	NULL
out	NULL
as	NULL
impassibly	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
interview	NULL

while	NULL
Raffles	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
allowance	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

screwed	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL

deposited	NULL
it	NULL

Raffles	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
back	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

Rigg	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
grounds	NULL
and	NULL
enter	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
gray	NULL
day	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
drizzling	NULL
rain	NULL

freshened	NULL
the	NULL
hedgerows	NULL

the	NULL
grassy	NULL

and	NULL
hastened	NULL
the	NULL
laborers	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
loading	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL

Raffles	NULL
,	NULL
walking	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
uneasy	NULL
gait	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
town	NULL
loiterer	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
country	NULL
journeying	NULL
on	NULL
foot	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
incongruous	NULL
amid	NULL
this	NULL
moist	NULL

industry	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
baboon	NULL

from	NULL
a	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
none	NULL
to	NULL
stare	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
long-weaned	NULL
calves	NULL
,	NULL

none	NULL

show	NULL
dislike	NULL

appearance	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
water-rats	NULL

rustled	NULL
away	NULL
at	NULL

was	NULL
fortunate	NULL

got	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
highroad	NULL

be	NULL

him	NULL

Mr.	NULL

on	NULL

kept	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL

SHAKESPEARE	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
professional	NULL
calls	NULL
made	NULL
by	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
soon	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
return	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
wedding-journey	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
Lowick	NULL
Manor	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
consequence	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
requested	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
fix	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
visit	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
put	NULL
any	NULL
question	NULL
concerning	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
illness	NULL
to	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
betrayed	NULL
any	NULL
anxiety	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
how	NULL
far	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
short	NULL
his	NULL
labors	NULL
or	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
this	NULL
point	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
on	NULL
all	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
shrank	NULL
from	NULL
pity	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
suspicion	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
pitied	NULL
for	NULL
anything	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
lot	NULL
surmised	NULL
or	NULL
known	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
was	NULL
embittering	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
calling	NULL
forth	NULL
a	NULL
show	NULL
of	NULL
compassion	NULL
by	NULL
frankly	NULL
admitting	NULL
an	NULL
alarm	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
sorrow	NULL
was	NULL
necessarily	NULL
intolerable	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
proud	NULL
mind	NULL
knows	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
experience	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
overcome	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
fellowship	NULL
deep	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
all	NULL
efforts	NULL
at	NULL
isolation	NULL
seem	NULL
mean	NULL
and	NULL
petty	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
exalting	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
brooding	NULL
over	NULL
something	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
health	NULL
and	NULL
life	NULL
haunted	NULL
his	NULL
silence	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
harassing	NULL
importunity	NULL
even	NULL
than	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
autumnal	NULL
unripeness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
authorship	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
last	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
called	NULL
his	NULL
central	NULL
ambition	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
some	NULL
kinds	NULL
of	NULL
authorship	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
by	NULL
far	NULL
the	NULL
largest	NULL
result	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
uneasy	NULL
susceptibility	NULL
accumulated	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
consciousness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
author	NULL
--	NULL
one	NULL
knows	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
streaks	NULL
amid	NULL
a	NULL
long-gathered	NULL
deposit	NULL
of	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
mud	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
hard	NULL
intellectual	NULL
labors	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
most	NULL
characteristic	NULL
result	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Key	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
Mythologies	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
morbid	NULL
consciousness	NULL
that	NULL
others	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
demonstrably	NULL
merited	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
perpetual	NULL
suspicious	NULL
conjecture	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
views	NULL
entertained	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
advantage	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
melancholy	NULL
absence	NULL
of	NULL
passion	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
efforts	NULL
at	NULL
achievement	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
passionate	NULL
resistance	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
confession	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
achieved	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
his	NULL
intellectual	NULL
ambition	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
others	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
absorbed	NULL
and	NULL
dried	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
no	NULL
security	NULL
against	NULL
wounds	NULL
,	NULL
least	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
against	NULL
those	NULL
which	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
frame	NULL
possibilities	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
somehow	NULL
more	NULL
embittering	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
than	NULL
anything	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
had	NULL
dwelt	NULL
on	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

Against	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
helpless	NULL

stay	NULL

his	NULL
flippant	NULL
state	NULL

mind	NULL
with	NULL
regard	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
possessors	NULL
of	NULL
authentic	NULL
,	NULL
well-stamped	NULL
erudition	NULL

against	NULL
Dorothea	NULL

nature	NULL

always	NULL
taking	NULL
on	NULL
some	NULL
new	NULL
shape	NULL
of	NULL
ardent	NULL
activity	NULL

and	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
submission	NULL

it	NULL

was	NULL

lady	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL

be	NULL
something	NULL
more	NULL
troublesome	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
conceived	NULL

She	NULL
nursed	NULL
him	NULL

she	NULL
read	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

she	NULL
anticipated	NULL

was	NULL

there	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL
certainty	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
judged	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
wifely	NULL
devotedness	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
penitential	NULL
expiation	NULL
of	NULL
unbelieving	NULL
thoughts	NULL

was	NULL
accompanied	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL

which	NULL
himself	NULL

were	NULL
seen	NULL
too	NULL
luminously	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
discontent	NULL
passed	NULL
vapor-like	NULL
through	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
gentle	NULL
loving	NULL
manifestations	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
clung	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL

nearer	NULL

him	NULL

The	NULL

Mr.	NULL

leave	NULL
only	NULL

And	NULL
who	NULL

if	NULL
Mr.	NULL

expound	NULL
his	NULL
discontents	NULL

his	NULL
suspicions	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
any	NULL

adored	NULL
without	NULL
criticism	NULL
--	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
denied	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
founded	NULL
on	NULL
good	NULL
reasons	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
reason	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
added	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
himself	NULL
taken	NULL
explicitly	NULL
into	NULL
account	NULL
--	NULL
namely	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
unmixedly	NULL
adorable	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
suspected	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
suspected	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
confessing	NULL
it	NULL

and	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL

This	NULL
sore	NULL
susceptibility	NULL
in	NULL

to	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
prepared	NULL
before	NULL
Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
had	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
Lowick	NULL

and	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
occurred	NULL
since	NULL

had	NULL
brought	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
suspicious	NULL
construction	NULL
into	NULL
exasperated	NULL
activity	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
added	NULL
imaginary	NULL
facts	NULL
both	NULL
present	NULL
and	NULL
future	NULL
which	NULL
became	NULL
more	NULL
real	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
than	NULL
those	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
called	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
stronger	NULL
dislike	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
predominating	NULL
bitterness	NULL
.	NULL

Suspicion	NULL
and	NULL
jealousy	NULL
of	NULL
Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
's	NULL
intentions	NULL
,	NULL
suspicion	NULL
and	NULL
jealousy	NULL
of	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
impressions	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
constantly	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
weaving	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
quite	NULL
unjust	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
entered	NULL
into	NULL
any	NULL
coarse	NULL
misinterpretation	NULL
of	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
:	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
habits	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
and	NULL
conduct	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
elevation	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
saved	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
any	NULL
such	NULL
mistake	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
jealous	NULL
of	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
opinion	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sway	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
ardent	NULL
mind	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
judgments	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
possibilities	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
these	NULL
might	NULL
lead	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
to	NULL
Will	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
until	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
defiant	NULL
letter	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
definite	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
choose	NULL
formally	NULL
to	NULL
allege	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
warranted	NULL
in	NULL
believing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
design	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
fascinate	NULL
a	NULL
rebellious	NULL
temper	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
undisciplined	NULL
impulsiveness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
cause	NULL
of	NULL
Will	NULL
's	NULL
return	NULL
from	NULL
Rome	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
determination	NULL
to	NULL
settle	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
neighborhood	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
penetrating	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
that	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
had	NULL
innocently	NULL
encouraged	NULL
this	NULL
course	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
clear	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
attached	NULL
to	NULL
Will	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
pliant	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
suggestions	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
tete-a-tete	NULL
without	NULL
her	NULL
bringing	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL
some	NULL
new	NULL
troublesome	NULL
impression	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
interview	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
(	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
returning	NULL
from	NULL
Freshitt	NULL
Hall	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
been	NULL
silent	NULL
about	NULL
having	NULL
seen	NULL
Will	NULL
)	NULL
had	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
scene	NULL
which	NULL
roused	NULL
an	NULL
angrier	NULL
feeling	NULL
against	NULL
them	NULL
both	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
known	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
outpouring	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
notions	NULL
about	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL

had	NULL
done	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
bring	NULL
a	NULL
mixture	NULL
of	NULL
more	NULL
odious	NULL
foreboding	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
shock	NULL
lately	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
health	NULL
always	NULL
sadly	NULL
present	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
much	NULL
revived	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
recovered	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
work	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
illness	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
mere	NULL
fatigue	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
still	NULL
be	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
achievement	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
justify	NULL
the	NULL
thirty	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
preparation	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
prospect	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
sweeter	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
flavor	NULL
of	NULL
vengeance	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
hasty	NULL
sneers	NULL
of	NULL
Carp	NULL
&	NULL
Company	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
was	NULL
carrying	NULL
his	NULL
taper	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
tombs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
,	NULL
those	NULL
modern	NULL
figures	NULL
came	NULL
athwart	NULL
the	NULL
dim	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
interrupted	NULL
his	NULL
diligent	NULL
exploration	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
convince	NULL
Carp	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mistake	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
words	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
indigestion	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
an	NULL
agreeable	NULL
accident	NULL

triumphant	NULL
authorship	NULL

which	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
living	NULL
to	NULL
future	NULL
ages	NULL
on	NULL
earth	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
eternity	NULL
in	NULL
heaven	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
exclude	NULL
from	NULL
contemplation	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
,	NULL
thus	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
prevision	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
unending	NULL
bliss	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
nullify	NULL
the	NULL
bitter	NULL
savors	NULL
of	NULL
irritated	NULL
jealousy	NULL

vindictiveness	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL

probability	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
transient	NULL
earthly	NULL
bliss	NULL
for	NULL
other	NULL
persons	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
himself	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
entered	NULL
into	NULL
glory	NULL

had	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
potently	NULL
sweetening	NULL
effect	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
undermining	NULL
disease	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
work	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
large	NULL
opportunity	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
happier	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL

the	NULL

would	NULL
make	NULL
part	NULL

This	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
bare	NULL

a	NULL
very	NULL
incomplete	NULL
way	NULL

putting	NULL
the	NULL

Mr.	NULL

an	NULL

pride	NULL

which	NULL
compelled	NULL
him	NULL

other	NULL
reasons	NULL

those	NULL
of	NULL
jealousy	NULL

The	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Mr.	NULL

put	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL

"	NULL
In	NULL

You	NULL

why	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
manliness	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
behaved	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

Consider	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mind	NULL
which	NULL
shrank	NULL
from	NULL
pity	NULL
:	NULL
have	NULL
you	NULL
ever	NULL
watched	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
mind	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
suspicion	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
pressing	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
grief	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
really	NULL
a	NULL
source	NULL
of	NULL
contentment	NULL
,	NULL
either	NULL
actual	NULL
or	NULL
future	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
being	NULL
who	NULL
already	NULL
offends	NULL
by	NULL
pitying	NULL
?	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
little	NULL
of	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
sensations	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
reflected	NULL
that	NULL
on	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
occasion	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
comparable	NULL
in	NULL
strength	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
sensibilities	NULL
about	NULL
Carp	NULL
's	NULL
criticisms	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
withdraw	NULL
her	NULL
arm	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
venture	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
directed	NULL
his	NULL
steps	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
entered	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
glass	NULL
door	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
eastern	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
withdrew	NULL
her	NULL
arm	NULL
and	NULL
lingered	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
matting	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
leave	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
quite	NULL
free	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
and	NULL
shut	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
alone	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
sorrow	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
boudoir	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
open	NULL
bow-window	NULL
let	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
serene	NULL
glory	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
lying	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
avenue	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
lime-trees	NULL
cast	NULL
long	NULL
shadows	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
threw	NULL
herself	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
heeding	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dazzling	NULL
sun-rays	NULL
:	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
discomfort	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
tell	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
inward	NULL
misery	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
reaction	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
rebellious	NULL
anger	NULL
stronger	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
since	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
.	NULL

Instead	NULL
of	NULL
tears	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
words	NULL
:	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
What	NULL
have	NULL
I	NULL
done	NULL
--	NULL
what	NULL
am	NULL
I	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
knows	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL

he	NULL
never	NULL
cares	NULL

What	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL

anything	NULL
I	NULL

?	NULL

He	NULL
wishes	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
married	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
checked	NULL
into	NULL
stillness	NULL
.	NULL

Like	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
lost	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
and	NULL
is	NULL
weary	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
glance	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
paths	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
young	NULL
hope	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
never	NULL
find	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
clearly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
miserable	NULL
light	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
solitude	NULL
--	NULL
how	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
apart	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
survey	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
drawn	NULL
her	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
surveyed	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Is	NULL
he	NULL
worth	NULL
living	NULL
for	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

but	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
him	NULL
simply	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
bitterly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
his	NULL
fault	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
mine	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
jar	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
whole	NULL
being	NULL
,	NULL
Pity	NULL
was	NULL
overthrown	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
her	NULL
fault	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
had	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
worthiness	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
And	NULL
what	NULL
,	NULL
exactly	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
She	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
estimate	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
who	NULL
waited	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
glances	NULL
with	NULL
trembling	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shut	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
soul	NULL
in	NULL
prison	NULL
,	NULL
paying	NULL
it	NULL
only	NULL
hidden	NULL
visits	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
petty	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
please	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
crisis	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
women	NULL
begin	NULL
to	NULL
hate	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
low	NULL
when	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
would	NULL
send	NULL
a	NULL
message	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
well	NULL
and	NULL
preferred	NULL
remaining	NULL
up-stairs	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
deliberately	NULL
allowed	NULL
her	NULL
resentment	NULL
to	NULL
govern	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
believed	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
without	NULL
telling	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
feeling	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
wait	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
without	NULL
interruption	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
might	NULL
wonder	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
hurt	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
message	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
good	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
wonder	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
hurt	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
anger	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
anger	NULL
is	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
God	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
heaven	NULL

though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
crowded	NULL
with	NULL
spirits	NULL
watching	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
ring	NULL
her	NULL
bell	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
rap	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
his	NULL
dinner	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
quite	NULL
alone	NULL
this	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
much	NULL
occupied	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
not	NULL
dine	NULL

then	NULL

Tantripp	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
sat	NULL
almost	NULL
motionless	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
meditative	NULL
struggle	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
slowly	NULL
deepened	NULL
into	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
struggle	NULL
changed	NULL
continually	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
begins	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
movement	NULL
towards	NULL
striking	NULL
and	NULL
ends	NULL
with	NULL
conquering	NULL
his	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
strike	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
energy	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
animate	NULL
a	NULL
crime	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
is	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
inspire	NULL
a	NULL
resolved	NULL
submission	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
noble	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
reasserts	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
thought	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
--	NULL
her	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
asking	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
possible	NULL
arrest	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
answer	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
wrung	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
long	NULL
without	NULL
rising	NULL
beside	NULL
the	NULL
image	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
shadowy	NULL
monitor	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
anger	NULL
with	NULL
sad	NULL
remonstrance	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
cost	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
litany	NULL
of	NULL
pictured	NULL
sorrows	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
silent	NULL
cries	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
mercy	NULL
for	NULL
those	NULL
sorrows	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
resolved	NULL
submission	NULL
did	NULL
come	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
habitually	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
rest	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
opened	NULL
her	NULL
door	NULL
gently	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
outside	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
coming	NULL
up-stairs	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
soon	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
risk	NULL
incurring	NULL
another	NULL
pang	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
again	NULL
expect	NULL
anything	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL

open	NULL

and	NULL
slowly	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
advanced	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
staircase	NULL
without	NULL
noise	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
footsteps	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
carpet	NULL

When	NULL
her	NULL

stood	NULL
opposite	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
haggard	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
started	NULL
slightly	NULL
on	NULL
seeing	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
beseechingly	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
speaking	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Dorothea	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
gentle	NULL
surprise	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
tone	NULL

"	NULL
Were	NULL
you	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL

quiet	NULL

that	NULL

on	NULL
Dorothea	NULL

almost	NULL
guilty	NULL

the	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
servant	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
deliver	NULL
that	NULL
message	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL

a	NULL
few	NULL
notes	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL

a	NULL
piano	NULL
bursting	NULL
into	NULL
roulades	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
roulades	NULL
broke	NULL
off	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
servant	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Lydgate	NULL

be	NULL
happy	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
contrast	NULL
not	NULL
infrequent	NULL
in	NULL
country	NULL
life	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
habits	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

ranks	NULL
were	NULL
less	NULL
blent	NULL
than	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
tell	NULL
us	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
stuff	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
wore	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
mild	NULL
autumn	NULL

that	NULL
thin	NULL
white	NULL
woollen	NULL
stuff	NULL
soft	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
touch	NULL
and	NULL
soft	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL

It	NULL
always	NULL
seemed	NULL

been	NULL
lately	NULL
washed	NULL

and	NULL
to	NULL
smell	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

audience	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL

the	NULL

To	NULL
Rosamond	NULL

one	NULL

those	NULL

mixing	NULL

Middlemarch	NULL

whose	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

What	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL

being	NULL
exquisite	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL

Sir	NULL
Godwin	NULL

quite	NULL
confident	NULL

the	NULL
impression	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
make	NULL
on	NULL
people	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
birth	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
usual	NULL
simple	NULL
kindness	NULL

looked	NULL
admiringly	NULL
at	NULL
Lydgate	NULL

lovely	NULL
bride	NULL

aware	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL

a	NULL
gentleman	NULL

seeing	NULL
him	NULL
merely	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
coated	NULL
figure	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
wide	NULL
angle	NULL

The	NULL
gentleman	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
woman	NULL
to	NULL
reflect	NULL

a	NULL
contrast	NULL
that	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
both	NULL

their	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

Dorothea	NULL

She	NULL
colored	NULL

out	NULL
her	NULL

Her	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
arrested	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
sudden	NULL
thought	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
hardly	NULL

around	NULL
her	NULL

hardly	NULL

that	NULL
Will	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL

her	NULL

offered	NULL
her	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
to	NULL
lead	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL

said	NULL
nothing	NULL

Will	NULL
was	NULL
feeling	NULL
rather	NULL
vexed	NULL

miserable	NULL

and	NULL
found	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
side	NULL

He	NULL
handed	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL

in	NULL
silence	NULL

they	NULL
said	NULL
good-by	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
drove	NULL
away	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
'	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL
Hospital	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
reflections	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
quite	NULL
new	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

Her	NULL
decision	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
preoccupation	NULL
in	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
sudden	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
deception	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
voluntarily	NULL
allowing	NULL
any	NULL
further	NULL
intercourse	NULL
between	NULL
herself	NULL
and	NULL
Will	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
mention	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL

and	NULL
already	NULL
her	NULL
errand	NULL
in	NULL
seeking	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
concealment	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
explicitly	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
urged	NULL
also	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
vague	NULL
discomfort	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
alone	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
drive	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
notes	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
accompanying	NULL
piano	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
noted	NULL
much	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
returning	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
inward	NULL
sense	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
thinking	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
wonder	NULL
that	NULL
Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
was	NULL
passing	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
with	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
absence	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
remembering	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
under	NULL
like	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
why	NULL
should	NULL
there	NULL
be	NULL
any	NULL
unfitness	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL

But	NULL
Will	NULL
was	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
relative	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
towards	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
kindness	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
signs	NULL
which	NULL
perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
understood	NULL
as	NULL
implying	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
his	NULL
cousin	NULL
's	NULL
visits	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
absence	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Perhaps	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
mistaken	NULL
in	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
poor	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
tears	NULL
came	NULL
rolling	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
dry	NULL
them	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
confusedly	NULL
unhappy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
image	NULL
of	NULL
Will	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
clear	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
before	NULL
was	NULL
mysteriously	NULL
spoiled	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
stopped	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Hospital	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
soon	NULL
walking	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
plots	NULL
with	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
feelings	NULL
recovered	NULL
the	NULL
strong	NULL
bent	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
seek	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
interview	NULL
.	NULL

Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
,	NULL
meanwhile	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
mortified	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
reason	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
clearly	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
chances	NULL
of	NULL
meeting	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
were	NULL
rare	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
set	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
disadvantage	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
hitherto	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
supremely	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
under	NULL
circumstances	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
appear	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
supremely	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
thrust	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
distance	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
amongst	NULL
the	NULL
circles	NULL
of	NULL
Middlemarchers	NULL
who	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
his	NULL
fault	NULL
:	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
his	NULL
lodgings	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
making	NULL
as	NULL
many	NULL
acquaintances	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
requiring	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
know	NULL
everybody	NULL
and	NULL
everything	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
better	NULL
worth	NULL
knowing	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
neighborhood	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
musical	NULL
and	NULL
altogether	NULL
worth	NULL
calling	NULL
upon	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
history	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Diana	NULL
had	NULL
descended	NULL
too	NULL
unexpectedly	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
worshipper	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
mortifying	NULL
.	NULL

Will	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
threatening	NULL
to	NULL
divide	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
those	NULL
barriers	NULL
of	NULL
habitual	NULL
sentiment	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
more	NULL
fatal	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
persistence	NULL
of	NULL
mutual	NULL
interest	NULL
than	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
between	NULL
Rome	NULL
and	NULL
Britain	NULL
.	NULL

Prejudices	NULL
about	NULL
rank	NULL
and	NULL
status	NULL
were	NULL
easy	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
defy	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
tyrannical	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
prejudices	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
odorous	NULL
bodies	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
double	NULL
existence	NULL
both	NULL
solid	NULL
and	NULL
subtle	NULL
--	NULL
solid	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
pyramids	NULL
,	NULL
subtle	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
twentieth	NULL
echo	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
echo	NULL

or	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
memory	NULL
of	NULL
hyacinths	NULL
which	NULL
once	NULL
scented	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Will	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
temperament	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
keenly	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
subtleties	NULL

a	NULL
man	NULL

Half	NULL
the	NULL

would	NULL
almost	NULL
take	NULL
trouble	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
thwarting	NULL
him	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
stupid	NULL

most	NULL

never	NULL

it	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
connection	NULL
with	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
before	NULL
I	NULL
came	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
quite	NULL
impartially	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
some	NULL

a	NULL

I	NULL
hold	NULL
that	NULL
by	NULL
refusing	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL

That	NULL

all	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
affairs	NULL

Middlemarch	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL
great	NULL
persecutions	NULL

"	NULL
To	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
quite	NULL
fairly	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
other	NULL
objections	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
masterful	NULL
and	NULL
rather	NULL
unsociable	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
concerned	NULL
with	NULL
trade	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
has	NULL
complaints	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL

But	NULL
what	NULL
has	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
establish	NULL
here	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
valuable	NULL
hospital	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
immediate	NULL
motive	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
opposition	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
has	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
medical	NULL
direction	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
glad	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
gives	NULL
me	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL

doing	NULL
some	NULL
good	NULL
work	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
justify	NULL
his	NULL
choice	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
consequence	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
profession	NULL
in	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
have	NULL
set	NULL
themselves	NULL
tooth	NULL
and	NULL
nail	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
Hospital	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
refuse	NULL
to	NULL
cooperate	NULL
themselves	NULL

try	NULL
to	NULL
blacken	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
affair	NULL

hinder	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
very	NULL
petty	NULL

exclaimed	NULL
Dorothea	NULL

indignantly	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
ignorance	NULL

stupendous	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL

That	NULL
opposition	NULL

the	NULL
New	NULL

Hospital	NULL

Lydgate	NULL

sketched	NULL

He	NULL
regarded	NULL

Mr.	NULL

a	NULL
determination	NULL

hatred	NULL
which	NULL
certainly	NULL
found	NULL
pretexts	NULL

only	NULL
too	NULL
easy	NULL

find	NULL

These	NULL

the	NULL

humorously	NULL

Hence	NULL
Mr.	NULL

could	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL

not	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL

that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL

those	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Gambit	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL

had	NULL
a	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
practice	NULL

much	NULL
pervaded	NULL
by	NULL

suggested	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
worth	NULL
his	NULL
while	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
up	NULL
until	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL

work	NULL

Other	NULL

themselves	NULL
more	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Toller	NULL
shared	NULL
the	NULL

Unlike	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

it	NULL
gave	NULL
precisely	NULL
the	NULL

Most	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
when	NULL
Nancy	NULL
presented	NULL
herself	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Infirmary	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
days	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
questioning	NULL
and	NULL
examining	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
house-surgeon	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
undertone	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
not	NULL
tumor	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
cramp	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
ordered	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
blister	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
steel	NULL
mixture	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
rest	NULL
,	NULL
giving	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
a	NULL
note	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Larcher	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
employer	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
testify	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
food	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
by-and-by	NULL
Nancy	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
attic	NULL
,	NULL
became	NULL
portentously	NULL
worse	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
supposed	NULL
tumor	NULL
having	NULL
indeed	NULL
given	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
blister	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
wandered	NULL
to	NULL
another	NULL
region	NULL
with	NULL
angrier	NULL
pain	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
staymaker	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
fetch	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
continued	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
to	NULL
attend	NULL
Nancy	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
treatment	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
quite	NULL
well	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
described	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
tumor	NULL
in	NULL
Churchyard	NULL
Lane	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL

--	NULL
nay	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Larcher	NULL
also	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
when	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
remarkable	NULL
cure	NULL
was	NULL
mentioned	NULL
to	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Minchin	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
naturally	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
case	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
tumor	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
mistaken	NULL

describing	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
such	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Indeed	NULL
!	NULL

ah	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
surgical	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fatal	NULL
kind	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
inwardly	NULL
annoyed	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Infirmary	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
recommended	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
house-surgeon	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
youngster	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sorry	NULL
to	NULL
vex	NULL
Minchin	NULL
with	NULL
impunity	NULL
,	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
occurred	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
privately	NULL
pronounced	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
indecent	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
practitioner	NULL
to	NULL
contradict	NULL
a	NULL
physician	NULL
's	NULL
diagnosis	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
open	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
afterwards	NULL
agreed	NULL
with	NULL
Wrench	NULL
that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
disagreeably	NULL
inattentive	NULL
to	NULL
etiquette	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
a	NULL
ground	NULL
for	NULL
valuing	NULL
himself	NULL
or	NULL
(	NULL
very	NULL
particularly	NULL
)	NULL
despising	NULL
Minchin	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
rectification	NULL
of	NULL
misjudgments	NULL
often	NULL
happening	NULL
among	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
equal	NULL
qualifications	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
report	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL
this	NULL
amazing	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
tumor	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
clearly	NULL
distinguished	NULL
from	NULL
cancer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
considered	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
awful	NULL
for	NULL
being	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wandering	NULL
sort	NULL
;	NULL
till	NULL
much	NULL
prejudice	NULL
against	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
method	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
drugs	NULL
was	NULL
overcome	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
proof	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
marvellous	NULL
skill	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
speedy	NULL
restoration	NULL
of	NULL
Nancy	NULL
Nash	NULL
after	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
rolling	NULL
and	NULL
rolling	NULL
in	NULL
agonies	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
tumor	NULL
both	NULL
hard	NULL
and	NULL
obstinate	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
compelled	NULL
to	NULL
yield	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
help	NULL
himself	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
offensive	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
a	NULL
lady	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
is	NULL
expressing	NULL
her	NULL
amazement	NULL
at	NULL
your	NULL
skill	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
is	NULL
altogether	NULL
mistaken	NULL
and	NULL
rather	NULL
foolish	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
amazement	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
entered	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
diseases	NULL
would	NULL
only	NULL
have	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
breaches	NULL
of	NULL
medical	NULL
propriety	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
wince	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
promise	NULL
of	NULL
success	NULL
given	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
ignorant	NULL
praise	NULL
which	NULL
misses	NULL
every	NULL
valid	NULL
quality	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
conspicuous	NULL
patient	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Borthrop	NULL
Trumbull	NULL
,	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
shown	NULL
himself	NULL
something	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
an	NULL
every-day	NULL
doctor	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
here	NULL
too	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
equivocal	NULL
advantage	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
won	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
eloquent	NULL
auctioneer	NULL
was	NULL
seized	NULL
with	NULL
pneumonia	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
patient	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Peacock	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
expressed	NULL
his	NULL
intention	NULL
to	NULL
patronize	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Trumbull	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
robust	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
subject	NULL
for	NULL
trying	NULL
the	NULL
expectant	NULL
theory	NULL
upon	NULL
--	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
interesting	NULL
disease	NULL
when	NULL
left	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
stages	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
noted	NULL
for	NULL
future	NULL
guidance	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
described	NULL
his	NULL
sensations	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
surmised	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
medical	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
confidence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
represented	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
partner	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
cure	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
auctioneer	NULL
heard	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
much	NULL
surprise	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
constitution	NULL
which	NULL
(	NULL
always	NULL
with	NULL
due	NULL
watching	NULL
)	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
a	NULL
beautiful	NULL
example	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
disease	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
its	NULL
phases	NULL
seen	NULL
in	NULL
clear	NULL
delineation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
probably	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
rare	NULL
strength	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
voluntarily	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
the	NULL
test	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
rational	NULL
procedure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
disorder	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
pulmonary	NULL
functions	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
benefit	NULL
to	NULL
society	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Trumbull	NULL
acquiesced	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
entered	NULL
strongly	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
view	NULL
that	NULL
an	NULL
illness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
ordinary	NULL
occasion	NULL
for	NULL
medical	NULL
science	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Never	NULL
fear	NULL

sir	NULL

you	NULL
are	NULL

one	NULL
who	NULL

altogether	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
superiority	NULL
of	NULL
expression	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
rather	NULL
pathetic	NULL
by	NULL
difficulty	NULL
of	NULL
breathing	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
without	NULL
shrinking	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
abstinence	NULL
from	NULL
drugs	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
sustained	NULL
by	NULL
application	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
thermometer	NULL
which	NULL
implied	NULL
the	NULL
importance	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
temperature	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
furnished	NULL
objects	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
microscope	NULL

and	NULL
by	NULL
learning	NULL
many	NULL
new	NULL
words	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
suited	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dignity	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
secretions	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
acute	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
indulge	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
technical	NULL
talk	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Trumbull	NULL
rose	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
couch	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
disposition	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
illness	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
manifested	NULL
the	NULL
strength	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
constitution	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
backward	NULL
in	NULL
awarding	NULL
credit	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
medical	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
discerned	NULL
the	NULL
quality	NULL
of	NULL
patient	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
deal	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
auctioneer	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
an	NULL
ungenerous	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
others	NULL
their	NULL
due	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
afford	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
caught	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
"	NULL
expectant	NULL
method	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
rang	NULL
chimes	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
learned	NULL
phrases	NULL
to	NULL
accompany	NULL
the	NULL
assurance	NULL
that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL

a	NULL

two	NULL
more	NULL

This	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL

Fred	NULL

Mr.	NULL

The	NULL

already	NULL
threatened	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
nuisance	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shape	NULL
of	NULL
rivalry	NULL

met	NULL

It	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL

on	NULL
a	NULL
Saturday	NULL
evening	NULL
that	NULL
Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
had	NULL
that	NULL
little	NULL
discussion	NULL
with	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
.	NULL

Its	NULL
effect	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
rooms	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
sit	NULL
up	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
over	NULL
again	NULL

under	NULL
a	NULL

irritation	NULL

all	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
before	NULL

his	NULL
having	NULL
settled	NULL
in	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL

harnessed	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL

Hesitations	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
step	NULL
had	NULL
since	NULL
turned	NULL
into	NULL
susceptibility	NULL
to	NULL
every	NULL
hint	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
wiser	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
hence	NULL
came	NULL
his	NULL
heat	NULL
towards	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
heat	NULL
which	NULL
still	NULL
kept	NULL
him	NULL
restless	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL

and	NULL
at	NULL

time	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL

ever	NULL
conscious	NULL

something	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL

And	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL

Well	NULL

for	NULL
no	NULL

there	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
human	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL

which	NULL
happens	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
all	NULL

happens	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
wide	NULL
difference	NULL

not	NULL
one	NULL

he	NULL

unwilling	NULL
to	NULL
entertain	NULL
thoughts	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL

accused	NULL

away	NULL

freedom	NULL

which	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL

spoke	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
so	NULL
exquisite	NULL
in	NULL

her	NULL

Will	NULL

within	NULL
him	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
towards	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
inheritance	NULL

fortune	NULL

What	NULL
others	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
futility	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
additional	NULL
delight	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
generous	NULL
movement	NULL

and	NULL
of	NULL
verifying	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
experience	NULL
that	NULL
higher	NULL
love-poetry	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
charmed	NULL
his	NULL
fancy	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
forever	NULL
enthroned	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
:	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
woman	NULL
could	NULL
sit	NULL
higher	NULL
than	NULL
her	NULL
footstool	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
written	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
immortal	NULL
syllables	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
she	NULL
wrought	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL

boasted	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL

--	NULL
"	NULL
Queens	NULL

the	NULL
alms	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
result	NULL
was	NULL
questionable	NULL

And	NULL
what	NULL
else	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
do	NULL
for	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
devotion	NULL
worth	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
reach	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
creature	NULL
among	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
simple	NULL
confidence	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
him	NULL

stay	NULL

stay	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL

whatever	NULL
fire-breathing	NULL
dragons	NULL

hiss	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
of	NULL
Will	NULL
's	NULL
hesitations	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
contradictoriness	NULL
and	NULL
rebellion	NULL
even	NULL
towards	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
resolve	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
got	NULL
irritated	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
particular	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
outside	NULL
demonstration	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
public	NULL
exertions	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
chief	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
as	NULL
heroic	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
associated	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
ground	NULL
of	NULL
irritation	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
his	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
of	NULL
dignity	NULL
for	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
ever	NULL

.	NULL

Whereupon	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
being	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
contradict	NULL
these	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
facts	NULL

he	NULL
contradicted	NULL

ended	NULL

Lowick	NULL

Sunday	NULL

his	NULL

Will	NULL
easily	NULL
felt	NULL
happy	NULL
when	NULL
nothing	NULL
crossed	NULL
his	NULL
humor	NULL

by	NULL
this	NULL

the	NULL
thought	NULL

vexing	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
rather	NULL
amusing	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
break	NULL
into	NULL
its	NULL
merry	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
breaking	NULL
of	NULL
sunshine	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
--	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
exemplary	NULL

But	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
are	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
settle	NULL
within	NULL
ourselves	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
blocks	NULL
our	NULL
way	NULL
is	NULL
odious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
mind	NULL
causing	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
disgust	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
personality	NULL
excites	NULL
in	NULL
ourselves	NULL

Will	NULL
went	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
book	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
hand	NULL
in	NULL
each	NULL
side-pocket	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
reading	NULL

but	NULL
chanting	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL

as	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
scenes	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
happen	NULL
in	NULL
church	NULL

coming	NULL
out	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
experimenting	NULL
in	NULL

his	NULL

sometimes	NULL
trying	NULL
a	NULL
ready-made	NULL

sometimes	NULL
improvising	NULL

The	NULL
words	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
exactly	NULL

they	NULL
certainly	NULL
fitted	NULL

Sometimes	NULL

when	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL

shaking	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
backward	NULL

his	NULL

at	NULL

at	NULL

no	NULL
one	NULL
took	NULL
much	NULL

the	NULL
choir	NULL

who	NULL
expected	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL

figure	NULL
in	NULL

singing	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
did	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
appear	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
quaint	NULL
background	NULL
,	NULL
walking	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
short	NULL
aisle	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
white	NULL
beaver	NULL
bonnet	NULL
and	NULL
gray	NULL
cloak	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
worn	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Vatican	NULL

face	NULL
being	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
entrance	NULL
,	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
chancel	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
her	NULL
shortsighted	NULL
eyes	NULL
soon	NULL
discerned	NULL
Will	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
outward	NULL
show	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
feeling	NULL
except	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
paleness	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
grave	NULL
bow	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
passed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
surprise	NULL
Will	NULL
felt	NULL
suddenly	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
after	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
bowed	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
minutes	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vestry	NULL
,	NULL

,	NULL
entering	NULL
the	NULL
pew	NULL

seated	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
Will	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
paralysis	NULL
more	NULL
complete	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
look	NULL
nowhere	NULL
except	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
choir	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
gallery	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
vestry-door	NULL
:	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
pained	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
wretched	NULL
blunder	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
amusing	NULL
to	NULL
vex	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
advantage	NULL
probably	NULL
of	NULL
watching	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
seeing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
turn	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
imagined	NULL
this	NULL
beforehand	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
expect	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
sit	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
square	NULL
pew	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
unrelieved	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
Tuckers	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
apparently	NULL
departed	NULL
from	NULL
Lowick	NULL
altogether	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
clergyman	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
desk	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
himself	NULL
stupid	NULL
now	NULL
for	NULL
not	NULL
foreseeing	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
towards	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
--	NULL
nay	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
feel	NULL
his	NULL
coming	NULL
an	NULL
impertinence	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
delivering	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
cage	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Will	NULL
found	NULL
his	NULL
places	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
book	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
school-mistress	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
service	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
immeasurably	NULL
long	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
utterly	NULL
ridiculous	NULL
,	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
temper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
miserable	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
got	NULL
by	NULL
worshipping	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
!	NULL

The	NULL
clerk	NULL
observed	NULL
with	NULL
surprise	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
join	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tune	NULL
of	NULL
Hanover	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
reflected	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
preach	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
Will	NULL
's	NULL
situation	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
blessing	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
pronounced	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
rose	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
fashion	NULL
at	NULL
Lowick	NULL
for	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
betters	NULL
"	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
first	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
determination	NULL
to	NULL
break	NULL
the	NULL
spell	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
Will	NULL
looked	NULL
straight	NULL
at	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
gentleman	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
button	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pew-door	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
opened	NULL
,	NULL
allowing	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
following	NULL
her	NULL
immediately	NULL
without	NULL
raising	NULL
his	NULL
eyelids	NULL
.	NULL

Will	NULL
's	NULL
glance	NULL
had	NULL
caught	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pew	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
she	NULL
bowed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
agitation	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
repressing	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

Will	NULL
walked	NULL
out	NULL
after	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
gate	NULL
leading	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
churchyard	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
shrubbery	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
looking	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
walk	NULL
back	NULL
sadly	NULL
at	NULL
mid-day	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
road	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
trodden	NULL
hopefully	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lights	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
changed	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
both	NULL
without	NULL
and	NULL
within	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
distress	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
came	NULL
chiefly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
perception	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
cousin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
Will	NULL
's	NULL
presence	NULL
at	NULL
church	NULL
had	NULL
served	NULL
to	NULL
mark	NULL
more	NULL
strongly	NULL
the	NULL
alienation	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Will	NULL
's	NULL
coming	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
quite	NULL
excusable	NULL
,	NULL
nay	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
an	NULL
amiable	NULL
movement	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
towards	NULL
a	NULL
reconciliation	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
constantly	NULL
wishing	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
probably	NULL
imagined	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
meet	NULL
easily	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
shake	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
friendly	NULL
intercourse	NULL
might	NULL
return	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
felt	NULL
quite	NULL
robbed	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
hope	NULL
.	NULL

Will	NULL
was	NULL
banished	NULL
further	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
newly	NULL
embittered	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
thrusting	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
presence	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
recognize	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
suffering	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
breathing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
preached	NULL
in	NULL
consequence	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
surprised	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
silent	NULL
at	NULL
luncheon	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
less	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
allusion	NULL
to	NULL
Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
part	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
again	NULL
introduce	NULL
that	NULL
subject	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
usually	NULL
spent	NULL
apart	NULL
the	NULL
hours	NULL
between	NULL
luncheon	NULL
and	NULL
dinner	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
Sunday	NULL
;	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

and	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
boudoir	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
wont	NULL
to	NULL
occupy	NULL
herself	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
favorite	NULL
books	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
heap	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bow-window	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
various	NULL
sorts	NULL

from	NULL
Herodotus	NULL

which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
learning	NULL
to	NULL

the	NULL

About	NULL
Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
ended	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
severely	NULL
repulsed	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
strong	NULL
feeling	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
claims	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL

by	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
helpless	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
afternoon	NULL
the	NULL
helplessness	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
wretchedly	NULL
benumbing	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
longed	NULL
for	NULL
objects	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
dear	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
dear	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
longed	NULL
for	NULL
work	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
directly	NULL
beneficent	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
sunshine	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rain	NULL

and	NULL
now	NULL
it	NULL
appeared	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
virtual	NULL
tomb	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
apparatus	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
ghastly	NULL
labor	NULL
producing	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
.	NULL

Today	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
stood	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tomb	NULL
and	NULL
seen	NULL
Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
receding	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
distant	NULL
world	NULL
of	NULL
warm	NULL
activity	NULL
and	NULL
fellowship	NULL
--	NULL
turning	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
.	NULL

Books	NULL
were	NULL

Thinking	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
use	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Sunday	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Celia	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
lately	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
baby	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
refuge	NULL
now	NULL
from	NULL
spiritual	NULL
emptiness	NULL
and	NULL
discontent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
her	NULL
bad	NULL
mood	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
borne	NULL
a	NULL
headache	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
usually	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
aloud	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
proposed	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ordered	NULL
a	NULL
fire	NULL
and	NULL
lights	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
revived	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
thinking	NULL
intently	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
observed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
newly	NULL
arranged	NULL
a	NULL
row	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
note-books	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
a	NULL
well-known	NULL
volume	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
table	NULL
of	NULL
contents	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
will	NULL
oblige	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
seating	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
if	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
reading	NULL
this	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
go	NULL
through	NULL
this	NULL
aloud	NULL
,	NULL
pencil	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
each	NULL
point	NULL
where	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
'	NULL
mark	NULL
,	NULL
'	NULL
will	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
cross	NULL
with	NULL
your	NULL
pencil	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
step	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sifting	NULL
process	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
long	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
view	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
indicate	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
certain	NULL
principles	NULL
of	NULL
selection	NULL
whereby	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
trust	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
intelligent	NULL
participation	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
purpose	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

This	NULL
proposal	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
more	NULL
sign	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
many	NULL
since	NULL
his	NULL
memorable	NULL
interview	NULL
with	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
original	NULL
reluctance	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
work	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
place	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL
disposition	NULL
,	NULL
namely	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
demand	NULL
much	NULL
interest	NULL
and	NULL
labor	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
and	NULL
marked	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
We	NULL

we	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
prefer	NULL

said	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
told	NULL
the	NULL
simple	NULL
truth	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
dreaded	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
exert	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
reading	NULL
or	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
which	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
joyless	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
proof	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
force	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
certain	NULL
characteristics	NULL
in	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
impressed	NULL
those	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
jealousy	NULL
and	NULL
suspicion	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
gathered	NULL
implicit	NULL
trust	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
integrity	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
promises	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
devoting	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
and	NULL
best	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
late	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
these	NULL
qualities	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
possession	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
engross	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
reading	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
did	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
young	NULL
weariness	NULL
had	NULL
slept	NULL
soon	NULL
and	NULL
fast	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
awakened	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
vision	NULL
of	NULL
sunset	NULL
after	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
climbed	NULL
a	NULL
steep	NULL
hill	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
opened	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
wrapped	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
warm	NULL
gown	NULL
seating	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
arm-chair	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
fire-place	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
embers	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
glowing	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
lit	NULL
two	NULL
candles	NULL
,	NULL
expecting	NULL
that	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
would	NULL
awake	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
liking	NULL
to	NULL
rouse	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
more	NULL
direct	NULL
means	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL
ill	NULL

Edward	NULL

"	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
rising	NULL
immediately	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
some	NULL
uneasiness	NULL

a	NULL
reclining	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL

She	NULL
threw	NULL
wood	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
wrapped	NULL
herself	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
shade	NULL
more	NULL
meekness	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
polite	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
wakeful	NULL

Dorothea	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
insist	NULL

she	NULL
read	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL

more	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

plan	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL

getting	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
pages	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
quickness	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
alert	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
anticipate	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
slight	NULL
verbal	NULL
indication	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
amazed	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bird-like	NULL
speed	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
surveying	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
creeping	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL

you	NULL

laid	NULL
down	NULL

Till	NULL

said	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sleeping	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
sleep	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
she	NULL
constrained	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
lie	NULL
still	NULL
lest	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
disturb	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
carrying	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
conflict	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
imagination	NULL
ranged	NULL
its	NULL
forces	NULL
first	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
presentiment	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
establish	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
future	NULL
action	NULL
had	NULL
relation	NULL
to	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
expect	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
devote	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
sifting	NULL
those	NULL
mixed	NULL
heaps	NULL
of	NULL
material	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
doubtful	NULL
illustration	NULL
of	NULL
principles	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
doubtful	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
poor	NULL
child	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
altogether	NULL
unbelieving	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
trustworthiness	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
Key	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
ambition	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
labor	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
wonderful	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
small	NULL
instruction	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
judgment	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
matter	NULL
was	NULL
truer	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
:	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
with	NULL
unbiassed	NULL
comparison	NULL
and	NULL
healthy	NULL
sense	NULL
at	NULL
probabilities	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
risked	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
egoism	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
pictured	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
months	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
years	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
spend	NULL
in	NULL
sorting	NULL
what	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
called	NULL
shattered	NULL
mummies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fragments	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
tradition	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
itself	NULL
a	NULL
mosaic	NULL
wrought	NULL
from	NULL
crushed	NULL
ruins	NULL
--	NULL
sorting	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
food	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
theory	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
withered	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
birth	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
elfin	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

Doubtless	NULL
a	NULL
vigorous	NULL
error	NULL
vigorously	NULL
pursued	NULL
has	NULL
kept	NULL
the	NULL
embryos	NULL
of	NULL
truth	NULL
a-breathing	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
quest	NULL
of	NULL
gold	NULL
being	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
a	NULL
questioning	NULL
of	NULL
substances	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
of	NULL
chemistry	NULL
is	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Lavoisier	NULL
is	NULL
born	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
theory	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
elements	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
seed	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
tradition	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
bruise	NULL
itself	NULL
unawares	NULL
against	NULL
discoveries	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
floated	NULL
among	NULL
flexible	NULL
conjectures	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
solid	NULL
than	NULL
those	NULL
etymologies	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
strong	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
likeness	NULL
in	NULL
sound	NULL
until	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
shown	NULL
that	NULL
likeness	NULL
in	NULL
sound	NULL
made	NULL
them	NULL
impossible	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
method	NULL
of	NULL
interpretation	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
tested	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
necessity	NULL
of	NULL
forming	NULL
anything	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
sharper	NULL
collisions	NULL
than	NULL
an	NULL
elaborate	NULL
notion	NULL
of	NULL
Gog	NULL
and	NULL
Magog	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
interruption	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
plan	NULL
for	NULL
threading	NULL
the	NULL
stars	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
check	NULL
her	NULL
weariness	NULL
and	NULL
impatience	NULL
over	NULL
this	NULL
questionable	NULL
riddle-guessing	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
revealed	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fellowship	NULL
in	NULL
high	NULL
knowledge	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
life	NULL
worthier	NULL
!	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
understand	NULL
well	NULL
enough	NULL
now	NULL
why	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
cling	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
possibly	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
hope	NULL
left	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
labors	NULL
would	NULL
ever	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
shape	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
even	NULL
her	NULL
aloof	NULL
from	NULL
any	NULL
close	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
gradually	NULL
the	NULL
terrible	NULL
stringency	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
need	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
too	NULL
speedy	NULL
death	NULL
--	NULL
And	NULL
here	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
pity	NULL
turned	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
future	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
past	NULL
--	NULL
nay	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
present	NULL
hard	NULL
struggle	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
past	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
lonely	NULL
labor	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
ambition	NULL
breathing	NULL
hardly	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
pressure	NULL
of	NULL
self-distrust	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
goal	NULL
receding	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
heavier	NULL
limbs	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
the	NULL
sword	NULL
visibly	NULL
trembling	NULL
above	NULL
him	NULL
!	NULL

And	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
not	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
's	NULL
labor	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
But	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
something	NULL
greater	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
serve	NULL
in	NULL
devoutly	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
sake	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
soothe	NULL
his	NULL
grief	NULL
--	NULL
would	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
promised	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
treadmill	NULL
fruitlessly	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
deny	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

Could	NULL
she	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
refuse	NULL
to	NULL
content	NULL
this	NULL
pining	NULL
hunger	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
refusing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
sure	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
living	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
lived	NULL
as	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
fifteen	NULL
years	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
would	NULL
certainly	NULL
be	NULL
spent	NULL
in	NULL
helping	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
obeying	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL
that	NULL
devotion	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
living	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
indefinite	NULL
promise	NULL
of	NULL
devotion	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
he	NULL
lived	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
claim	NULL
nothing	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
still	NULL
be	NULL
free	NULL
to	NULL
remonstrate	NULL
against	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
refuse	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
might	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
demand	NULL
something	NULL
more	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
her	NULL
pledge	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
wishes	NULL
without	NULL
telling	NULL
her	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
?	NULL

No	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
bound	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
only	NULL
:	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
failing	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
eked	NULL
out	NULL
by	NULL
hers	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
No	NULL
!	NULL

if	NULL
you	NULL
die	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
put	NULL
no	NULL
finger	NULL
to	NULL
your	NULL
work	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
crushing	NULL
that	NULL
bruised	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
four	NULL
hours	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
conflict	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
ill	NULL
and	NULL
bewildered	NULL
,	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
resolve	NULL
,	NULL
praying	NULL
mutely	NULL
.	NULL

Helpless	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
which	NULL
has	NULL
sobbed	NULL
and	NULL
sought	NULL
too	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
late	NULL
morning	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
waked	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

Tantripp	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
prayers	NULL
,	NULL
breakfasted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
saw	NULL

look	NULL
so	NULL
pale	NULL

said	NULL
Tantripp	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
solid-figured	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sisters	NULL
at	NULL
Lausanne	NULL

"	NULL
Was	NULL

ever	NULL
high-colored	NULL

said	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
smiling	NULL
faintly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

not	NULL

say	NULL
high-colored	NULL

But	NULL
always	NULL
smelling	NULL
those	NULL
leather	NULL
books	NULL

what	NULL
can	NULL

Do	NULL
rest	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL

Let	NULL
me	NULL
say	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

no	NULL

me	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL

me	NULL

"	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
promise	NULL
to	NULL
fulfil	NULL
his	NULL
wishes	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
later	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL

As	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
placing	NULL
some	NULL
books	NULL

Mr.	NULL

left	NULL
her	NULL

Dorothea	NULL

feeling	NULL
very	NULL
weary	NULL

rang	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
Tantripp	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
her	NULL
some	NULL
wraps	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sitting	NULL
still	NULL

a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL

not	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
renewal	NULL

she	NULL
simply	NULL

to	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
still	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
Tantripp	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
bonnet	NULL
and	NULL
shawl	NULL

a	NULL
passivity	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
unusual	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
gravel	NULL
walks	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
lingered	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
nearer	NULL
clumps	NULL
of	NULL
trees	NULL
,	NULL
hesitating	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
once	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
cause	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
feared	NULL
lest	NULL
her	NULL
effort	NULL
at	NULL
fellowship	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
unwelcome	NULL
;	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
dreaded	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
foresaw	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
bind	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
fellowship	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
shrank	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
law	NULL
nor	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
's	NULL
opinion	NULL
compelled	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
--	NULL
only	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
nature	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
compassion	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
ideal	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
yoke	NULL
of	NULL
marriage	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
clearly	NULL
enough	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
situation	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
fettered	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
smite	NULL
the	NULL
stricken	NULL
soul	NULL
that	NULL
entreated	NULL
hers	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
weakness	NULL
,	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
weak	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
half-hour	NULL
was	NULL
passing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
not	NULL
delay	NULL
longer	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
Yew-tree	NULL
Walk	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
walk	NULL
had	NULL
bends	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
expecting	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
figure	NULL
wrapped	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
blue	NULL
cloak	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
warm	NULL
velvet	NULL
cap	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
outer	NULL
garment	NULL
on	NULL
chill	NULL
days	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
resting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
summer-house	NULL
,	NULL
towards	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
path	NULL
diverged	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

Turning	NULL
the	NULL
angle	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
seated	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bench	NULL
,	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
stone	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
arms	NULL
were	NULL
resting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
brow	NULL
was	NULL
bowed	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
cloak	NULL
being	NULL
dragged	NULL
forward	NULL
and	NULL
screening	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
exhausted	NULL
himself	NULL
last	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
asleep	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
summer-house	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
damp	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
to	NULL
rest	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
take	NULL
that	NULL
attitude	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
reading	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
easier	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
sometimes	NULL
speak	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
listen	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
summerhouse	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
Edward	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
ready	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
notice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
fast	NULL
asleep	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
laid	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
shoulder	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
repeated	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
ready	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

Still	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
motionless	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
confused	NULL
fear	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
leaned	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
velvet	NULL
cap	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
leaned	NULL
her	NULL
cheek	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
crying	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
distressed	NULL
tone	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Wake	NULL

But	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
never	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
answer	NULL
.	NULL

Later	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
seated	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
bedside	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
deliriously	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
aloud	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
recalling	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
right	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
explain	NULL
everything	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
begged	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
everything	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Tell	NULL
him	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL

was	NULL
never	NULL
more	NULL

be	NULL

Celia	NULL

Celia	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

if	NULL

's	NULL

she	NULL
thought	NULL

be	NULL
apparent	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

it	NULL

to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL

to	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL

Mr.	NULL

had	NULL
been	NULL
slow	NULL

hesitating	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL
sense	NULL

moving	NULL
heavily	NULL

a	NULL

medium	NULL
:	NULL
distrust	NULL
of	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
competence	NULL

what	NULL

had	NULL
prepared	NULL
was	NULL
subdued	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
distrust	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
to	NULL
create	NULL
a	NULL
trust	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
nature	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
:	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
willingly	NULL
imagined	NULL
her	NULL
toiling	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
fetters	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
promise	NULL
to	NULL
erect	NULL
a	NULL
tomb	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

(	NULL
Not	NULL

Mr.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
months	NULL
gained	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
his	NULL
plans	NULL
belated	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
had	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
promise	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
sought	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
his	NULL
cold	NULL
grasp	NULL
on	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
grasp	NULL
had	NULL
slipped	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Bound	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
pledge	NULL
given	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
pity	NULL

she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
undertaking	NULL
a	NULL
toil	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
judgment	NULL
whispered	NULL

vain	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
uses	NULL
except	NULL
that	NULL
consecration	NULL
of	NULL
faithfulness	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
supreme	NULL
use	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
her	NULL
judgment	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
controlled	NULL
by	NULL
duteous	NULL
devotion	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
active	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
imbittering	NULL
discovery	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
past	NULL
union	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
lurked	NULL
the	NULL
hidden	NULL
alienation	NULL
of	NULL
secrecy	NULL
and	NULL
suspicion	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
living	NULL
,	NULL
suffering	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
awaken	NULL
her	NULL
pity	NULL
:	NULL
there	NULL
remained	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
retrospect	NULL
of	NULL
painful	NULL
subjection	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
husband	NULL
whose	NULL
thoughts	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
lower	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
believed	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
exorbitant	NULL
claims	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
had	NULL
even	NULL
blinded	NULL
his	NULL
scrupulous	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
defeat	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
pride	NULL
by	NULL
shocking	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
ordinary	NULL
honor	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
property	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
broken	NULL
tie	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
her	NULL
original	NULL
fortune	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL

About	NULL
this	NULL
property	NULL
many	NULL
troublous	NULL
questions	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
rising	NULL

had	NULL
she	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
right	NULL

was	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL

now	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
act	NULL

justice	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
cruelly	NULL
effective	NULL

hindering	NULL
her	NULL

even	NULL
with	NULL
indignation	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL

heart	NULL
,	NULL
any	NULL
act	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
triumphant	NULL
eluding	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
purpose	NULL
revolted	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
collecting	NULL
papers	NULL
of	NULL
business	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
examine	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
locked	NULL
up	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
desks	NULL

drawers	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
empty	NULL

in	NULL

had	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
excuse	NULL

explanation	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Freshitt	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL

his	NULL

the	NULL
silence	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
tried	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
her	NULL
thoughts	NULL
towards	NULL
immediate	NULL

one	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL

It	NULL

everything	NULL

if	NULL

;	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL

he	NULL
stood	NULL
aloof	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
tell	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
without	NULL
lowering	NULL
himself	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
easily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
begin	NULL
a	NULL
career	NULL
which	NULL
at	NULL
five-and-twenty	NULL
seemed	NULL
probable	NULL
enough	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
inward	NULL
order	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL

where	NULL
talent	NULL
brings	NULL
fame	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
speak	NULL

Why	NULL
should	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
one	NULL

feel	NULL
that	NULL

he	NULL

leave	NULL

not	NULL
immediately	NULL

not	NULL
until	NULL
some	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
sign	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
between	NULL
him	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL

satisfied	NULL

would	NULL
not	NULL

Hence	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
keep	NULL
his	NULL
post	NULL
and	NULL
bear	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
soon	NULL
had	NULL

himself	NULL

Fred	NULL

you	NULL

taken	NULL
his	NULL
degree	NULL

He	NULL
has	NULL
worked	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL

and	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
he	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL

That	NULL
question	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
difficult	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
wishes	NULL
and	NULL
enter	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
set	NULL
against	NULL
that	NULL
formerly	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
questioned	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
confess	NULL
I	NULL
see	NULL
no	NULL
insuperable	NULL
objection	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
things	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
says	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
turn	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
doing	NULL
his	NULL
best	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
vocation	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
condition	NULL

If	NULL
that	NULL
condition	NULL
were	NULL
fulfilled	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
my	NULL
utmost	NULL
in	NULL
helping	NULL
Fred	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL

of	NULL
course	NULL

at	NULL
first	NULL

he	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL

my	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
stipend	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
nearly	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
as	NULL
vicar	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
repeat	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
condition	NULL
without	NULL
which	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
good	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL

He	NULL
has	NULL
opened	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Garth	NULL

and	NULL
asked	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL

It	NULL

that	NULL
Mr.	NULL

intended	NULL
to	NULL
frequent	NULL
Lowick	NULL
Church	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
reside	NULL
at	NULL
Stone	NULL
Court	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
while	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
the	NULL
excellent	NULL
farm	NULL
and	NULL
fine	NULL
homestead	NULL
simply	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
retreat	NULL

he	NULL
might	NULL
gradually	NULL

beautify	NULL

it	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
conducive	NULL

the	NULL
divine	NULL
glory	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
enter	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
residence	NULL

partially	NULL
withdrawing	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
present	NULL
exertions	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
administration	NULL

and	NULL
throwing	NULL

the	NULL
side	NULL

proprietorship	NULL

which	NULL
Providence	NULL
might	NULL

A	NULL
strong	NULL
leading	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
direction	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
given	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
surprising	NULL
facility	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
Stone	NULL
Court	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Rigg	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
clung	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
Garden	NULL
of	NULL
Eden	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
poor	NULL
old	NULL
Peter	NULL
himself	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
;	NULL
having	NULL
often	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
imagination	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
sods	NULL
above	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
unobstructed	NULL
by	NULL
perspective	NULL
,	NULL
seen	NULL
his	NULL
frog-faced	NULL
legatee	NULL
enjoying	NULL
the	NULL
fine	NULL
old	NULL
place	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
perpetual	NULL
surprise	NULL
and	NULL
disappointment	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
survivors	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
how	NULL
little	NULL
we	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
paradise	NULL
for	NULL
our	NULL
neighbors	NULL
!	NULL

We	NULL
judge	NULL
from	NULL
our	NULL
own	NULL
desires	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
our	NULL
neighbors	NULL
themselves	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
open	NULL
enough	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
hint	NULL
of	NULL
theirs	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
cool	NULL
and	NULL
judicious	NULL
Joshua	NULL
Rigg	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
allowed	NULL
his	NULL
parent	NULL
to	NULL
perceive	NULL
that	NULL
Stone	NULL
Court	NULL
was	NULL
anything	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
chief	NULL
good	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
estimation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
certainly	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
it	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
Warren	NULL
Hastings	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
gold	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
buying	NULL
Daylesford	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
Joshua	NULL
Rigg	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Stone	NULL
Court	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
buying	NULL
gold	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
distinct	NULL
and	NULL
intense	NULL
vision	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
chief	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
vigorous	NULL
greed	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
inherited	NULL
having	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
special	NULL
form	NULL
by	NULL
dint	NULL
of	NULL
circumstance	NULL
:	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
chief	NULL
good	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
moneychanger	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
his	NULL
earliest	NULL
employment	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
errand-boy	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
seaport	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
moneychangers	NULL
as	NULL
other	NULL
boys	NULL
look	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pastry-cooks	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
fascination	NULL
had	NULL
wrought	NULL
itself	NULL
gradually	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
special	NULL
passion	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
property	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
being	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
a	NULL
genteel	NULL
young	NULL
person	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
these	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
accidents	NULL
and	NULL
joys	NULL
that	NULL
imagination	NULL
could	NULL
dispense	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
one	NULL
joy	NULL
after	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
thirsted	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
money-changer	NULL
's	NULL
shop	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
much-frequented	NULL
quay	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
locks	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
the	NULL
keys	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
sublimely	NULL
cool	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
handled	NULL
the	NULL
breeding	NULL
coins	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
nations	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
helpless	NULL
Cupidity	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
enviously	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
iron	NULL
lattice	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
strength	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
passion	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
power	NULL
enabling	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
master	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
knowledge	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
gratify	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
when	NULL
others	NULL
were	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
settled	NULL
at	NULL
Stone	NULL
Court	NULL
for	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
Joshua	NULL
himself	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
now	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
far	NULL
off	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
settle	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
North	NULL
Quay	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
appointments	NULL
in	NULL
safes	NULL
and	NULL
locks	NULL
.	NULL

Enough	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
are	NULL
concerned	NULL
with	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
Joshua	NULL
Rigg	NULL
's	NULL
sale	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
land	NULL
from	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
's	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
interpreted	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
cheering	NULL
dispensation	NULL
conveying	NULL
perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
sanction	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
purpose	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
entertained	NULL
without	NULL
external	NULL
encouragement	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
interpreted	NULL
it	NULL
thus	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
too	NULL
confidently	NULL
,	NULL
offering	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
thanksgiving	NULL
in	NULL
guarded	NULL
phraseology	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
doubts	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
arise	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
possible	NULL
relations	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
event	NULL
to	NULL
Joshua	NULL
Rigg	NULL
's	NULL
destiny	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
belonged	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
unmapped	NULL
regions	NULL
not	NULL
taken	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
providential	NULL
government	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
perhaps	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
imperfect	NULL
colonial	NULL
way	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
arose	NULL
from	NULL
reflecting	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
dispensation	NULL
too	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
chastisement	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
's	NULL
induction	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
living	NULL
clearly	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
what	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
man	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
deceiving	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
genuinely	NULL
his	NULL
mode	NULL
of	NULL
explaining	NULL
events	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
theory	NULL
of	NULL
yours	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
disagree	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
egoism	NULL
which	NULL
enters	NULL
into	NULL
our	NULL
theories	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
affect	NULL
their	NULL
sincerity	NULL

rather	NULL

the	NULL
more	NULL
our	NULL
egoism	NULL
is	NULL
satisfied	NULL

the	NULL

our	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
whether	NULL
for	NULL
sanction	NULL
or	NULL
for	NULL
chastisement	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
hardly	NULL
fifteen	NULL
months	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
Peter	NULL
Featherstone	NULL

the	NULL

an	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

Affectionate	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
was	NULL
particularly	NULL
glad	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
advantage	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
health	NULL
was	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
purchase	NULL
of	NULL
Stone	NULL
Court	NULL
.	NULL

Few	NULL
days	NULL
passed	NULL
without	NULL
his	NULL
riding	NULL
thither	NULL
and	NULL
looking	NULL
over	NULL
some	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
farm	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
bailiff	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
evenings	NULL
were	NULL
delicious	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
quiet	NULL
spot	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
hay-ricks	NULL
lately	NULL
set	NULL
up	NULL
were	NULL
sending	NULL
forth	NULL
odors	NULL
to	NULL
mingle	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
breath	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rich	NULL
old	NULL
garden	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
horizon	NULL
and	NULL
burning	NULL
in	NULL
golden	NULL
lamps	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
walnut	NULL
boughs	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
was	NULL
pausing	NULL
on	NULL
horseback	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
gate	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
Caleb	NULL
Garth	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
appointment	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
an	NULL
opinion	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
stable	NULL
drainage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
advising	NULL
the	NULL
bailiff	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rick-yard	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
spiritual	NULL
frame	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
usually	NULL
serene	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
influence	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
innocent	NULL
recreation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
doctrinally	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
total	NULL
absence	NULL
of	NULL
merit	NULL
in	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
doctrinal	NULL
conviction	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
held	NULL
without	NULL
pain	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
demerit	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
distinct	NULL
shape	NULL
in	NULL
memory	NULL
and	NULL
revive	NULL
the	NULL
tingling	NULL
of	NULL
shame	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
pang	NULL
of	NULL
remorse	NULL
.	NULL

Nay	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
held	NULL
with	NULL
intense	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
depth	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
sinning	NULL
is	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
measure	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
depth	NULL
of	NULL
forgiveness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
clenching	NULL
proof	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
peculiar	NULL
instruments	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
divine	NULL
intention	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
memory	NULL
has	NULL
as	NULL
many	NULL
moods	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
temper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shifts	NULL
its	NULL
scenery	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
diorama	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
sunshine	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
one	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
far-off	NULL
evenings	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
preaching	NULL
beyond	NULL
Highbury	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
willingly	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
that	NULL
service	NULL
of	NULL
exhortation	NULL
in	NULL
prospect	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
texts	NULL
were	NULL
there	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
facility	NULL
in	NULL
expounding	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
brief	NULL
reverie	NULL
was	NULL
interrupted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
return	NULL
of	NULL
Caleb	NULL
Garth	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
also	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
horseback	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
shaking	NULL
his	NULL
bridle	NULL
before	NULL
starting	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL

like	NULL
one	NULL

those	NULL
men	NULL

"	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
turned	NULL
his	NULL
horse	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
reply	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
comer	NULL
was	NULL
our	NULL
slight	NULL
acquaintance	NULL

presented	NULL
no	NULL

was	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
suit	NULL
of	NULL
black	NULL

a	NULL
crape	NULL
hat-band	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
within	NULL
three	NULL
yards	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
horseman	NULL
now	NULL

and	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
flash	NULL
of	NULL
recognition	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
whirled	NULL
his	NULL
stick	NULL
upward	NULL

looking	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL

at	NULL
Mr.	NULL

But	NULL
Mr.	NULL

had	NULL
aimed	NULL

half-past	NULL
seven	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL

he	NULL
again	NULL
reached	NULL
Stone	NULL

The	NULL

at	NULL
that	NULL

the	NULL

a	NULL

But	NULL
everything	NULL
was	NULL
spoiled	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
walked	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

awaited	NULL
the	NULL

Mr.	NULL

Raffles	NULL

that	NULL

The	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL
his	NULL
morning	NULL

evening	NULL
self	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
great	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL

imagined	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
delight	NULL
in	NULL
tormenting	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
stronger	NULL
because	NULL
his	NULL

were	NULL

the	NULL
shutters	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
opened	NULL
at	NULL
Lowick	NULL
Manor	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
gazed	NULL
calmly	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL

shining	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
rows	NULL
of	NULL
note-books	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
weary	NULL
waste	NULL

the	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
laden	NULL
with	NULL
roses	NULL
entered	NULL
silently	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
blue-green	NULL
boudoir	NULL
where	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
chose	NULL
oftenest	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
into	NULL

questioning	NULL
the	NULL
eighteen	NULL
months	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL

carrying	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
thoughts	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
speech	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
heard	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
lingered	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
at	NULL
rest	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
carefully	NULL
ranged	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
note-books	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
orderly	NULL
sequence	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pity	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
restraining	NULL
compelling	NULL
motive	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
still	NULL
clung	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
image	NULL

even	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
remonstrated	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
indignant	NULL
thought	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
unjust	NULL

One	NULL
little	NULL
act	NULL
of	NULL

may	NULL
perhaps	NULL
be	NULL
smiled	NULL
at	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
deposited	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL

That	NULL
silent	NULL
colloquy	NULL

perhaps	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL

underneath	NULL

through	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL

was	NULL

had	NULL
really	NULL
determined	NULL

The	NULL
longing	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL

any	NULL

up	NULL

him	NULL

lot	NULL

But	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL
thirsted	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
otherwise	NULL
?	NULL

If	NULL
a	NULL
princess	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL

enchantment	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
a	NULL
four-footed	NULL
creature	NULL
from	NULL

to	NULL
her	NULL
once	NULL

again	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
human	NULL
gaze	NULL
which	NULL
rested	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL

beseeching	NULL

what	NULL

Surely	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
gaze	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL

her	NULL

and	NULL
which	NULL

would	NULL
know	NULL
again	NULL

no	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
recurred	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
knitting	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
dignified	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
neat	NULL
little	NULL
effort	NULL
at	NULL

this	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
what	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
wanted	NULL

Poor	NULL
thing	NULL

she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL

still	NULL
at	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL

at	NULL

those	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL

did	NULL
happen	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
formal	NULL
way	NULL
quite	NULL

by	NULL
her	NULL

One	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
eleven	NULL
,	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
seated	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
boudoir	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

attached	NULL

other	NULL
papers	NULL

her	NULL

which	NULL

her	NULL
in	NULL
making	NULL
an	NULL
exact	NULL
statement	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL

her	NULL
income	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
applied	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
was	NULL
seated	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
folded	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
lap	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
out	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
avenue	NULL
of	NULL
limes	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
distant	NULL
fields	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
leaf	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
rest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sunshine	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
familiar	NULL
scene	NULL
was	NULL
changeless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
represent	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL

her	NULL
life	NULL

The	NULL
widow	NULL
's	NULL
cap	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
times	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
oval	NULL
frame	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
crown	NULL
standing	NULL
up	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
dress	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
experiment	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
laying	NULL
on	NULL
of	NULL
crape	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
heavy	NULL
solemnity	NULL
of	NULL
clothing	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
look	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
younger	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
recovered	NULL
bloom	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sweet	NULL
,	NULL
inquiring	NULL
candor	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
reverie	NULL
was	NULL
broken	NULL
by	NULL
Tantripp	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
was	NULL
below	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
begged	NULL
permission	NULL
to	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

Dorothea	NULL

rising	NULL
immediately	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
him	NULL

The	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL

room	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

her	NULL

the	NULL
one	NULL

her	NULL
married	NULL
life	NULL

the	NULL
damask	NULL
matched	NULL
the	NULL
wood-work	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
white	NULL
and	NULL
gold	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
tall	NULL
mirrors	NULL
and	NULL
tables	NULL
with	NULL
nothing	NULL
on	NULL
them	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
brief	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
where	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
place	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
below	NULL
the	NULL
boudoir	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
also	NULL
a	NULL
bow-window	NULL
looking	NULL
out	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
avenue	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
Pratt	NULL
showed	NULL
Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
into	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
was	NULL
open	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
winged	NULL
visitor	NULL

buzzing	NULL
in	NULL

out	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
without	NULL
minding	NULL
the	NULL
furniture	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
look	NULL
less	NULL
formal	NULL

uninhabited	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Glad	NULL

Will	NULL

who	NULL
wished	NULL

as	NULL

had	NULL
drawn	NULL

had	NULL
not	NULL
differed	NULL

Tantripp	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
many	NULL
moments	NULL
for	NULL
Will	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
about	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
before	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
entered	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
meeting	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
first	NULL
meeting	NULL
in	NULL
Rome	NULL
when	NULL
Will	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
and	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
calm	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
miserable	NULL

determined	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
agitation	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
hidden	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
longed-for	NULL
meeting	NULL
was	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
too	NULL
difficult	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
Will	NULL
advancing	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
deep	NULL
blush	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
rare	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
came	NULL
with	NULL
painful	NULL
suddenness	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
neither	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
spoke	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL

on	NULL
one	NULL

another	NULL

Will	NULL
was	NULL
peculiarly	NULL
uneasy	NULL

it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
mere	NULL
fact	NULL

that	NULL

his	NULL
imagination	NULL

easily	NULL
enough	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
supposition	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL

seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

For	NULL
this	NULL

she	NULL
dwelt	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
without	NULL

That	NULL

For	NULL

judged	NULL

any	NULL

rejoiced	NULL

think	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
reproach	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
oval	NULL
picture	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
palm	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
bed	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
leaned	NULL
her	NULL
cheek	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
soothe	NULL
the	NULL
creatures	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
unjust	NULL
condemnation	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Love	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
briefly	NULL

as	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
hues	NULL

on	NULL
his	NULL
wings	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Love	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sobbing	NULL
her	NULL
farewell	NULL

his	NULL
image	NULL
was	NULL
banished	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
blameless	NULL
rigor	NULL
of	NULL
irresistible	NULL
day	NULL

She	NULL
only	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
irrevocably	NULL
amiss	NULL
and	NULL
lost	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
hint	NULL

every	NULL

The	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
Frick	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
ill-fed	NULL

and	NULL
were	NULL
less	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL

disposed	NULL

take	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
disposition	NULL
observable	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

Thus	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
of	NULL
Frick	NULL
was	NULL
exactly	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
for	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Solomon	NULL
Featherstone	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
upon	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
having	NULL
more	NULL
plenteous	NULL
ideas	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
order	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
suspicion	NULL
of	NULL
heaven	NULL
and	NULL
earth	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
fed	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
entirely	NULL
at	NULL
leisure	NULL
.	NULL

Solomon	NULL
was	NULL
overseer	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
roads	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
slow-paced	NULL
cob	NULL
often	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
rounds	NULL
by	NULL
Frick	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
workmen	NULL
getting	NULL
the	NULL
stones	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
pausing	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
mysterious	NULL
deliberation	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
misled	NULL
you	NULL
into	NULL
supposing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
staying	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
mere	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
impulse	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
looking	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
while	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
work	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
raise	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
horizon	NULL
;	NULL
finally	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
shake	NULL
his	NULL
bridle	NULL
,	NULL
touch	NULL
his	NULL
horse	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
whip	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
slowly	NULL
onward	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hour-hand	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
clock	NULL
was	NULL
quick	NULL
by	NULL
comparison	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Solomon	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
agreeable	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
afford	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
slow	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
pausing	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
cautious	NULL
,	NULL
vaguely	NULL
designing	NULL
chat	NULL
with	NULL
every	NULL
hedger	NULL
or	NULL
ditcher	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
especially	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
news	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
advantage	NULL
over	NULL
all	NULL
narrators	NULL
in	NULL
partially	NULL
disbelieving	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
dialogue	NULL
with	NULL
Hiram	NULL
Ford	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
wagoner	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
himself	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL

The	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
harder	NULL

Fred	NULL

Even	NULL

Here	NULL
Caleb	NULL
tossed	NULL
the	NULL

Any	NULL

peeping	NULL
into	NULL

Fred	NULL
was	NULL
struggling	NULL
with	NULL
many	NULL
thoughts	NULL

Mr.	NULL

been	NULL
so	NULL
kind	NULL

encouraging	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
interview	NULL

that	NULL

had	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
high	NULL
pitch	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
downfall	NULL
was	NULL
proportionate	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
thought	NULL

desk-work	NULL

in	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
majority	NULL

young	NULL

,	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
an	NULL
occupation	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
disagreeables	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
what	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
consequences	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
distinctly	NULL
promised	NULL

he	NULL

go	NULL

Lowick	NULL

her	NULL

When	NULL
Fred	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
necessary	NULL
disclosure	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
parents	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
relative	NULL
effect	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
surprise	NULL
which	NULL
entered	NULL
very	NULL
deeply	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
memory	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
straight	NULL
from	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Garth	NULL
's	NULL
office	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
warehouse	NULL
,	NULL
rightly	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
respectful	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
behave	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
painful	NULL
communication	NULL
as	NULL
gravely	NULL
and	NULL
formally	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

Moreover	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
decision	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
certainly	NULL
understood	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
final	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
interview	NULL
took	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
gravest	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
always	NULL
those	NULL
spent	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
private	NULL
room	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
warehouse	NULL
.	NULL

Fred	NULL
entered	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
directly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
declared	NULL
briefly	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
expressing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
his	NULL
regret	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
cause	NULL
of	NULL
disappointment	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
taking	NULL
the	NULL
blame	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
deficiencies	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
regret	NULL
was	NULL
genuine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
inspired	NULL
Fred	NULL
with	NULL
strong	NULL
,	NULL
simple	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
listened	NULL
in	NULL
profound	NULL
surprise	NULL
without	NULL
uttering	NULL
even	NULL
an	NULL
exclamation	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
silence	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
impatient	NULL
temperament	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
unusual	NULL
emotion	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
good	NULL

about	NULL
trade	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
slight	NULL
bitterness	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
grew	NULL
intense	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
listened	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Fred	NULL
had	NULL
ended	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pause	NULL
of	NULL
nearly	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL

Mr.	NULL

replaced	NULL
a	NULL

emphatically	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL

steadily	NULL

This	NULL

very	NULL
cutting	NULL
to	NULL
Fred	NULL

was	NULL
using	NULL
that	NULL

by	NULL
us	NULL
all	NULL
when	NULL

at	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL

Her	NULL

little	NULL

was	NULL
the	NULL

at	NULL
a	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

cutting	NULL
her	NULL

Fred	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
dismayed	NULL

sharply	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Garth	NULL
,	NULL
laying	NULL
her	NULL
knitting	NULL
down	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL

folding	NULL
her	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
unwonted	NULL

her	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
tone	NULL

demand	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Garth	NULL
could	NULL

what	NULL

to	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
consciousness	NULL

exceeded	NULL
in	NULL
words	NULL
was	NULL
peculiarly	NULL
mortifying	NULL

Besides	NULL

Fred	NULL
had	NULL

out	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

felt	NULL
a	NULL

it	NULL

a	NULL
history	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

the	NULL

ones	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tete-a-tete	NULL

Fred	NULL
was	NULL
ended	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
away	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Garth	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
imply	NULL
some	NULL
retractation	NULL

her	NULL
severity	NULL

saying	NULL
"	NULL
God	NULL

you	NULL
"	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
unpleasantly	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL

been	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
verge	NULL
of	NULL
speaking	NULL

--	NULL
telling	NULL
first	NULL

entreating	NULL
silence	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
entreated	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
Caleb	NULL
's	NULL
blame	NULL
she	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
blame	NULL
herself	NULL
and	NULL
confess	NULL
all	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL
night	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
curious	NULL
what	NULL
an	NULL
awful	NULL
tribunal	NULL
the	NULL
mild	NULL
Caleb	NULL
's	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
set	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
point	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
revelation	NULL
might	NULL
do	NULL
Fred	NULL
Vincy	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
doubt	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
effect	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
to	NULL
Lowick	NULL
.	NULL

Fred	NULL
's	NULL
light	NULL
hopeful	NULL
nature	NULL
had	NULL
perhaps	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bruise	NULL
as	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
suggestion	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL

been	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
Mary	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
good	NULL

Also	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
piqued	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL

been	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
stupid	NULL
lout	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
that	NULL
intervention	NULL
from	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
lover	NULL
's	NULL
nature	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
Fred	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
anxiety	NULL
raised	NULL
about	NULL
Mary	NULL
's	NULL
feeling	NULL

not	NULL
surmount	NULL
every	NULL

Notwithstanding	NULL
his	NULL
trust	NULL
in	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
's	NULL
generosity	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
what	NULL
Mary	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
Fred	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
rival	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
consciousness	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
objected	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
extremely	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
being	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
Mary	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
ready	NULL
rather	NULL
to	NULL
fight	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
any	NULL
man	NULL
whatsoever	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
fighting	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
metaphorical	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
Fred	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
muscular	NULL
.	NULL

Certainly	NULL
this	NULL
experience	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
discipline	NULL
for	NULL
Fred	NULL
hardly	NULL
less	NULL
sharp	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
disappointment	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
will	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
iron	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
entered	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
sharp	NULL
edge	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
once	NULL
occur	NULL
to	NULL
Fred	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Garth	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
mistaken	NULL
about	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
suspected	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
wrong	NULL
about	NULL
Mary	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
staying	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
parsonage	NULL
lately	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
might	NULL
know	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
passing	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
easier	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
looking	NULL
cheerful	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
ladies	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
animated	NULL
discussion	NULL
on	NULL
some	NULL
subject	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
dropped	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
entered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mary	NULL
was	NULL
copying	NULL
the	NULL
labels	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
heap	NULL
of	NULL
shallow	NULL
cabinet	NULL
drawers	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
handwriting	NULL
which	NULL

was	NULL
skilled	NULL
in	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
was	NULL
somewhere	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
ladies	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
Fred	NULL
's	NULL
peculiar	NULL
relation	NULL
to	NULL
Mary	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
either	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
propose	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
walk	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Fred	NULL
predicted	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
without	NULL
saying	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
private	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
of	NULL
Christy	NULL
's	NULL
arrival	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
engagement	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
comforted	NULL
by	NULL
seeing	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
latter	NULL
news	NULL
touched	NULL
her	NULL
keenly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
hurriedly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
so	NULL
glad	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
bent	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
writing	NULL
to	NULL
hinder	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
from	NULL
noticing	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
subject	NULL
which	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
pass	NULL

quite	NULL
gone	NULL

sleep	NULL

Mary	NULL
was	NULL
accustomed	NULL

think	NULL
rather	NULL
rigorously	NULL

what	NULL
was	NULL

if	NULL
a	NULL

flattered	NULL
her	NULL

Mr.	NULL

make	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
appeal	NULL
which	NULL

foresaw	NULL

although	NULL
her	NULL

For	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
this	NULL
visit	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
source	NULL
of	NULL
unprecedented	NULL
but	NULL
gracefully	NULL
concealed	NULL
exultation	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
intensely	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
cousin	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
baronet	NULL
's	NULL
son	NULL
staying	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
imagined	NULL
the	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
implied	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
presence	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
diffused	NULL
through	NULL
all	NULL
other	NULL
minds	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
introduced	NULL
Captain	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
guests	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
placid	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
rank	NULL
penetrated	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
an	NULL
odor	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
melt	NULL
away	NULL
some	NULL
disappointment	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
conditions	NULL
of	NULL
marriage	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
medical	NULL
man	NULL
even	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
birth	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
was	NULL
visibly	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
ideally	NULL
floating	NULL
her	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
level	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
looked	NULL
bright	NULL
with	NULL
letters	NULL
and	NULL
visits	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
Quallingham	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
vague	NULL
advancement	NULL
in	NULL
consequence	NULL
for	NULL
Tertius	NULL
.	NULL

Especially	NULL
as	NULL
,	NULL
probably	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Captain	NULL
's	NULL
suggestion	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
married	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Mengan	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
maid	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stayed	NULL
two	NULL
nights	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
from	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

Hence	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
clearly	NULL
worth	NULL
while	NULL
for	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
pains	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
music	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
careful	NULL
selection	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
lace	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
to	NULL
Captain	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
low	NULL
brow	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
aquiline	NULL
nose	NULL
bent	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
rather	NULL
heavy	NULL
utterance	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
disadvantageous	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
young	NULL
gentleman	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
military	NULL
bearing	NULL
and	NULL
mustache	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
doted	NULL
on	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
flower-like	NULL
blond	NULL
heads	NULL
as	NULL
"	NULL
style	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
moreover	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
high-breeding	NULL
which	NULL
consists	NULL
in	NULL
being	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
petty	NULL
solicitudes	NULL
of	NULL
middle-class	NULL
gentility	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
critic	NULL
of	NULL
feminine	NULL
charms	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
delighted	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
admiration	NULL
now	NULL
even	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
at	NULL
Quallingham	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
several	NULL
hours	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
flirting	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
visit	NULL
altogether	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pleasantest	NULL
larks	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
so	NULL
perhaps	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
suspected	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
queer	NULL
cousin	NULL
Tertius	NULL
wished	NULL
him	NULL
away	NULL
:	NULL
though	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
rather	NULL
(	NULL
hyperbolically	NULL
speaking	NULL
)	NULL
have	NULL
died	NULL
than	NULL
have	NULL
failed	NULL
in	NULL
polite	NULL
hospitality	NULL
,	NULL
suppressed	NULL
his	NULL
dislike	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
pretended	NULL
generally	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
gallant	NULL
officer	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
consigning	NULL
the	NULL
task	NULL
of	NULL
answering	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
a	NULL
jealous	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
preferred	NULL
leaving	NULL
a	NULL
feather-headed	NULL
young	NULL
gentleman	NULL
alone	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
to	NULL
bearing	NULL
him	NULL
company	NULL

"	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

moving	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL

in	NULL
it	NULL

Ask	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
thought	NULL

perfectly	NULL
well	NULL
why	NULL
Mr.	NULL

disliked	NULL
the	NULL
Captain	NULL

my	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
fact	NULL

said	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
resigned	NULL
murmur	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
exactly	NULL
tender	NULL

and	NULL
certainly	NULL
not	NULL
merry	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
smile	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
lovely	NULL
curves	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
looked	NULL
good-tempered	NULL
enough	NULL
without	NULL
smiling	NULL
.	NULL

Those	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
were	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
sad	NULL
milestone	NULL
marking	NULL
how	NULL
far	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
travelled	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
dreamland	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
Vincy	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
that	NULL
perfect	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
womanhood	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
reverence	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
fashion	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
accomplished	NULL
mermaid	NULL
,	NULL
using	NULL
her	NULL
comb	NULL
and	NULL
looking-glass	NULL
and	NULL
singing	NULL
her	NULL
song	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
relaxation	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
adored	NULL
wisdom	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
distinguish	NULL
between	NULL
that	NULL
imagined	NULL
adoration	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
attraction	NULL
towards	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
talent	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
gives	NULL
him	NULL
prestige	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
is	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
order	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
button-hole	NULL
or	NULL
an	NULL
Honorable	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
supposed	NULL
that	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
travelled	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
pointless	NULL
conversation	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Ned	NULL
Plymdale	NULL
perfectly	NULL
wearisome	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
most	NULL
mortals	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
stupidity	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
unendurable	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
stupidity	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
altogether	NULL
acceptable	NULL
--	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
become	NULL
of	NULL
social	NULL
bonds	NULL

Captain	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
stupidity	NULL
was	NULL
delicately	NULL
scented	NULL
,	NULL
carried	NULL
itself	NULL
with	NULL
"	NULL
style	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
talked	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
accent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
closely	NULL
related	NULL
to	NULL
Sir	NULL
Godwin	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
quite	NULL
agreeable	NULL
and	NULL
caught	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
phrases	NULL
.	NULL

Therefore	NULL
since	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
horseback	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
reasons	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
tempted	NULL
to	NULL
resume	NULL
her	NULL
riding	NULL
when	NULL
Captain	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
ordered	NULL
his	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
horses	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Green	NULL
Dragon	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
begged	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
warranted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
gentle	NULL
and	NULL
trained	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
a	NULL
lady	NULL
--	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
taking	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Quallingham	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
without	NULL
telling	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
return	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
ride	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
thorough	NULL
a	NULL
success	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
declared	NULL
herself	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
in	NULL
consequence	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
informed	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
full	NULL
reliance	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
consent	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
riding	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
hurt	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
utterly	NULL
confounded	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
risked	NULL
herself	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
horse	NULL
without	NULL
referring	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
wish	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
almost	NULL
thundering	NULL
exclamations	NULL
of	NULL
astonishment	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
warned	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
moments	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
However	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
safely	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
decisive	NULL
tone	NULL

You	NULL
will	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
was	NULL
arranging	NULL
her	NULL

before	NULL

the	NULL
reflection	NULL

her	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
moving	NULL
about	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pockets	NULL

and	NULL
now	NULL
paused	NULL
near	NULL
her	NULL

awaited	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

letting	NULL
her	NULL

little	NULL

as	NULL

make	NULL
a	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL

among	NULL
the	NULL
deftest	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL

He	NULL
swept	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL

fastened	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

looking	NULL

There	NULL
did	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
some	NULL
truth	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
objection	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Very	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
surly	NULL
obedience	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
the	NULL
discussion	NULL
ended	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
promising	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
promising	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
determined	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
promise	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
that	NULL
victorious	NULL
obstinacy	NULL
which	NULL
never	NULL
wastes	NULL
its	NULL
energy	NULL
in	NULL
impetuous	NULL
resistance	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
cleverness	NULL
was	NULL
directed	NULL
to	NULL
getting	NULL
the	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
riding	NULL
again	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
opportunity	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
absence	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
intending	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
know	NULL
until	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
late	NULL
enough	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
signify	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
temptation	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
great	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
exercise	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
gratification	NULL
of	NULL
riding	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
horse	NULL

with	NULL
Captain	NULL
Lydgate	NULL

Sir	NULL

's	NULL

on	NULL
another	NULL
fine	NULL
horse	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL

and	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
met	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
position	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
as	NULL
good	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
dreams	NULL
before	NULL
marriage	NULL
:	NULL
moreover	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
riveting	NULL
the	NULL
connection	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
at	NULL
Quallingham	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
wise	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
gentle	NULL
gray	NULL
,	NULL
unprepared	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
crash	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
tree	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
felled	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
Halsell	NULL
wood	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
fright	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
caused	NULL
a	NULL
worse	NULL
fright	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
leading	NULL
finally	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
baby	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
show	NULL
his	NULL
anger	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
bearish	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Captain	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
visit	NULL
naturally	NULL
soon	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
all	NULL
future	NULL
conversations	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
was	NULL
mildly	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
ride	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
difference	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
stayed	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
symptoms	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
ended	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
them	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Poor	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
darling	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

--	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
secretly	NULL
wondered	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
terrible	NULL
tenacity	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
mild	NULL
creature	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
gathering	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
amazed	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
powerlessness	NULL
over	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
superior	NULL
knowledge	NULL
and	NULL
mental	NULL
force	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
imagined	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
shrine	NULL
to	NULL
consult	NULL
on	NULL
all	NULL
occasions	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
simply	NULL
set	NULL
aside	NULL
on	NULL
every	NULL
practical	NULL
question	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
regarded	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
cleverness	NULL
as	NULL
precisely	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
receptive	NULL
kind	NULL
which	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
what	NULL
that	NULL
cleverness	NULL
was	NULL
--	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
shape	NULL
into	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
run	NULL
as	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
close	NULL
network	NULL
aloof	NULL
and	NULL
independent	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
quicker	NULL
than	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
causes	NULL
and	NULL
effects	NULL
which	NULL
lay	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
track	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
tastes	NULL
and	NULL
interests	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
clearly	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
preeminence	NULL
in	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
imaginatively	NULL
tracing	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
agreeable	NULL
social	NULL
effects	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
talent	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
advanced	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
professional	NULL
and	NULL
scientific	NULL
ambition	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
relation	NULL
to	NULL
these	NULL
desirable	NULL
effects	NULL
than	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
fortunate	NULL
discovery	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
ill-smelling	NULL
oil	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
oil	NULL
apart	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
she	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
opinion	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
astounded	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
in	NULL
numberless	NULL
trifling	NULL
matters	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
last	NULL
serious	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
riding	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
affection	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
compliant	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
affection	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
presentiment	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
repel	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
part	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
tenderly	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
negations	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
--	NULL
well	NULL
!	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
worried	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
new	NULL
elements	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
as	NULL
noxious	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
inlet	NULL
of	NULL
mud	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
creature	NULL
that	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
breathe	NULL
and	NULL
bathe	NULL
and	NULL
dart	NULL
after	NULL
its	NULL
illuminated	NULL
prey	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
clearest	NULL
of	NULL
waters	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
was	NULL
soon	NULL
looking	NULL
lovelier	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
worktable	NULL
,	NULL
enjoying	NULL
drives	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
phaeton	NULL
and	NULL
thinking	NULL
it	NULL
likely	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
invited	NULL
to	NULL
Quallingham	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
exquisite	NULL
ornament	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
there	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
daughter	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
reflecting	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
were	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
perhaps	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
consider	NULL
whether	NULL
the	NULL
ladies	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
eager	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
themselves	NULL
surpassed	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
relieved	NULL
from	NULL
anxiety	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
relapsed	NULL
into	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
inwardly	NULL
called	NULL
his	NULL
moodiness	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
name	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
covered	NULL
his	NULL
thoughtful	NULL
preoccupation	NULL
with	NULL
other	NULL
subjects	NULL
than	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
uneasy	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
brow	NULL
and	NULL
distaste	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
ordinary	NULL
things	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
mixed	NULL
with	NULL
bitter	NULL
herbs	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
really	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
weather-glass	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
vexation	NULL
and	NULL
foreboding	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
latter	NULL
states	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
had	NULL
one	NULL
cause	NULL
amongst	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
generously	NULL
but	NULL
mistakenly	NULL
avoided	NULL
mentioning	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
lest	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
affect	NULL
her	NULL
health	NULL
and	NULL
spirits	NULL
.	NULL

Between	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
indeed	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
total	NULL
missing	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
's	NULL
mental	NULL
track	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
too	NULL
evidently	NULL
possible	NULL
even	NULL
between	NULL
persons	NULL
who	NULL
are	NULL
continually	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
spending	NULL
month	NULL
after	NULL
month	NULL
in	NULL
sacrificing	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
best	NULL
intent	NULL
and	NULL
best	NULL
power	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
tenderness	NULL
for	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
;	NULL
bearing	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
claims	NULL
and	NULL
interruptions	NULL
without	NULL
impatience	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
above	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
bearing	NULL
without	NULL
betrayal	NULL
of	NULL
bitterness	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
through	NULL
less	NULL
and	NULL
less	NULL
of	NULL
interfering	NULL
illusion	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
blank	NULL
unreflecting	NULL
surface	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
presented	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
ardor	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
impersonal	NULL
ends	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
profession	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
scientific	NULL
study	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
ardor	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
fancied	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
ideal	NULL
wife	NULL
must	NULL
somehow	NULL
worship	NULL
as	NULL
sublime	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
knowing	NULL
why	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
endurance	NULL
was	NULL
mingled	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
self-discontent	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
candid	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
shall	NULL
confess	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
half	NULL
our	NULL
bitterness	NULL
under	NULL
grievances	NULL
,	NULL
wife	NULL
or	NULL
husband	NULL
included	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
always	NULL
remains	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
greater	NULL
,	NULL
circumstance	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
less	NULL
strong	NULL
against	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
concessions	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
were	NULL
often	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
lapse	NULL
of	NULL
slackening	NULL
resolution	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
creeping	NULL
paralysis	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
seize	NULL
an	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
adjustment	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
constant	NULL
portion	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
lives	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
on	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
constantly	NULL
pressing	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
simple	NULL
weight	NULL
of	NULL
sorrow	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
biting	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
petty	NULL
degrading	NULL
care	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
casts	NULL
the	NULL
blight	NULL
of	NULL
irony	NULL
over	NULL
all	NULL
higher	NULL
effort	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
care	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
hitherto	NULL
abstained	NULL
from	NULL
mentioning	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
believed	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
wonder	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
entered	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
certainly	NULL
no	NULL
difficulty	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
less	NULL
mysterious	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
inference	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
conspicuous	NULL
handle	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
easily	NULL
drawn	NULL
by	NULL
indifferent	NULL
observers	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
debt	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
succeed	NULL
in	NULL
keeping	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
for	NULL
long	NULL
together	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
getting	NULL
deeper	NULL
into	NULL
that	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
tempts	NULL
men	NULL
towards	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
covering	NULL
of	NULL
flowers	NULL
and	NULL
verdure	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
wonderful	NULL
how	NULL
soon	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
gets	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
chin	NULL
there	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
condition	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
chiefly	NULL
of	NULL
release	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
scheme	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
universe	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

Eighteen	NULL
months	NULL
ago	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
known	NULL
the	NULL
eager	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
small	NULL
sums	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
burning	NULL
contempt	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
descended	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
gain	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
experiencing	NULL
something	NULL
worse	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
simple	NULL
deficit	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
assailed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
vulgar	NULL
hateful	NULL
trials	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
bought	NULL
and	NULL
used	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
done	NULL
without	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
demand	NULL
for	NULL
payment	NULL
has	NULL
become	NULL
pressing	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
this	NULL
came	NULL
about	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
easily	NULL
seen	NULL
without	NULL
much	NULL
arithmetic	NULL
or	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
prices	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
setting	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
preparing	NULL
for	NULL
marriage	NULL
finds	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
furniture	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
initial	NULL
expenses	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
between	NULL
four	NULL
and	NULL
five	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
capital	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
for	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
it	NULL
appears	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
household	NULL
expenses	NULL
,	NULL
horses	NULL
and	NULL
et	NULL
caeteras	NULL
,	NULL
amount	NULL
to	NULL
nearly	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

our	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
believed	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
careless	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
despised	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
calculated	NULL
the	NULL
effects	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
costume	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
abundance	NULL
of	NULL
fresh	NULL
garments	NULL
--	NULL
such	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
naturally	NULL
ordered	NULL
in	NULL
sheaves	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
hitherto	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
check	NULL
of	NULL
importunate	NULL
debt	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
by	NULL
habit	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
by	NULL
self-criticism	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
check	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

Its	NULL
novelty	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
irritating	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
amazed	NULL
,	NULL
disgusted	NULL
that	NULL
conditions	NULL
so	NULL
foreign	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
purposes	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
hatefully	NULL
disconnected	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
objects	NULL
he	NULL
cared	NULL
to	NULL
occupy	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
lain	NULL
in	NULL
ambush	NULL
and	NULL
clutched	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
unaware	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
actual	NULL
debt	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
certainty	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
present	NULL
position	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
deepening	NULL
it	NULL

Two	NULL
furnishing	NULL
tradesmen	NULL

whose	NULL

before	NULL

whom	NULL
uncalculated	NULL

had	NULL
ever	NULL
since	NULL
prevented	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL

had	NULL
repeatedly	NULL
sent	NULL
him	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
letters	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
forced	NULL
themselves	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
attention	NULL

This	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
galling	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
disposition	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
intense	NULL
pride	NULL

his	NULL
dislike	NULL

being	NULL
under	NULL

obligation	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
scorned	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
form	NULL
conjectures	NULL
about	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
's	NULL
intentions	NULL
on	NULL
money	NULL
matters	NULL

nothing	NULL
but	NULL
extremity	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
induced	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
apply	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
father-in-law	NULL

even	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
aware	NULL
in	NULL
various	NULL
indirect	NULL
ways	NULL
since	NULL
his	NULL
marriage	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
's	NULL
own	NULL
affairs	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
flourishing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
expectation	NULL
of	NULL
help	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
resented	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
men	NULL
easily	NULL
trust	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
readiness	NULL
of	NULL
friends	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
former	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
need	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
thought	NULL
what	NULL
borrowing	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
had	NULL
entered	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
rather	NULL
incur	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
hardship	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
mean	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
money	NULL
or	NULL
prospects	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
practice	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
getting	NULL
more	NULL
lucrative	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
wonder	NULL
that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
suppress	NULL
all	NULL
signs	NULL
of	NULL
inward	NULL
trouble	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
few	NULL
months	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
was	NULL
regaining	NULL
brilliant	NULL
health	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
meditated	NULL
taking	NULL
her	NULL
entirely	NULL
into	NULL
confidence	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
difficulties	NULL
.	NULL

New	NULL
conversance	NULL
with	NULL
tradesmen	NULL
's	NULL
bills	NULL
had	NULL
forced	NULL
his	NULL
reasoning	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
channel	NULL
of	NULL
comparison	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
consider	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
and	NULL
unnecessary	NULL
in	NULL
goods	NULL

and	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
some	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL

.	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
without	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
concurrence	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
immediate	NULL
occasion	NULL
of	NULL
opening	NULL
the	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
fact	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
was	NULL
forced	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
no	NULL
money	NULL

and	NULL
having	NULL
privately	NULL
sought	NULL
advice	NULL

to	NULL
what	NULL

could	NULL
possibly	NULL
be	NULL
given	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
offered	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL

Opinions	NULL

divided	NULL

to	NULL
his	NULL
wisdom	NULL

this	NULL

Lydgate	NULL

that	NULL
the	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

in	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
ridiculous	NULL
fastidiousness	NULL
about	NULL
asking	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
for	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
moment	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
fine	NULL
morning	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
final	NULL
order	NULL
for	NULL
plate	NULL
:	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
jewels	NULL
enormously	NULL
expensive	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
addition	NULL
to	NULL
orders	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
amount	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
exactly	NULL
calculated	NULL

thirty	NULL
pounds	NULL
for	NULL
ornaments	NULL
so	NULL
exquisitely	NULL
suited	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
neck	NULL
and	NULL
arms	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
appear	NULL
excessive	NULL
when	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
ready	NULL
cash	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
exceed	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
crisis	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
imagination	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
dwelling	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
letting	NULL
the	NULL
amethysts	NULL
take	NULL
their	NULL
place	NULL
again	NULL
among	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Dover	NULL
's	NULL
stock	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
shrank	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
proposing	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
been	NULL
roused	NULL
to	NULL
discern	NULL
consequences	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
tracing	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
preparing	NULL
to	NULL
act	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
discernment	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rigor	NULL
(	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL
means	NULL
all	NULL
)	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
applied	NULL
in	NULL
pursuing	NULL
experiment	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
nerving	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
rigor	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
rode	NULL
from	NULL
Brassing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
meditated	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
representations	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
make	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
evening	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
intensely	NULL
miserable	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
strong	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
nine-and-twenty	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
gifts	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
saying	NULL
angrily	NULL
within	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
profound	NULL
mistake	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
mistake	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
work	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
recognized	NULL
chronic	NULL
disease	NULL
,	NULL
mingling	NULL
its	NULL
uneasy	NULL
importunities	NULL
with	NULL
every	NULL
prospect	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
enfeebling	NULL
every	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
and	NULL
singing	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
some	NULL
weeks	NULL
since	NULL
Will	NULL
had	NULL
parted	NULL
from	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
post	NULL
in	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
objection	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
to	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
's	NULL
coming	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
just	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
annoyed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
his	NULL
hearth	NULL
free	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
singers	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
key-note	NULL
,	NULL
raising	NULL
their	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
regarding	NULL
his	NULL
entrance	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
interruption	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
galled	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
harness	NULL
as	NULL
poor	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
soothing	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
two	NULL
people	NULL
warbling	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
comes	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
painful	NULL
day	NULL
has	NULL
still	NULL
pains	NULL
in	NULL
store	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
already	NULL
paler	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
scowl	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
flung	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
chair	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
singers	NULL
feeling	NULL
themselves	NULL
excused	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
three	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
quickly	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
presently	NULL
rose	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
place	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
tea-tray	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
turned	NULL
his	NULL
dark	NULL
eyes	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
watched	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
delicately	NULL
handled	NULL
the	NULL
tea-service	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
taper	NULL
fingers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
objects	NULL
immediately	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
curve	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
disturbed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
ineffable	NULL
protest	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
air	NULL
against	NULL
all	NULL
people	NULL
with	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
manners	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
lost	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wound	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
speculation	NULL
about	NULL
this	NULL
new	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
feminine	NULL
impassibility	NULL
revealing	NULL
itself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sylph-like	NULL
frame	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
interpreted	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
ready	NULL
intelligent	NULL
sensitiveness	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
mind	NULL
glancing	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Laure	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
inwardly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Would	NULL
_	NULL
she	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
with	NULL

"	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
generalizing	NULL
which	NULL
gives	NULL
men	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
superiority	NULL
in	NULL
mistake	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
dumb	NULL
animals	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
immediately	NULL
thwarted	NULL
by	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
memory	NULL
of	NULL
wondering	NULL
impressions	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
behavior	NULL
of	NULL
another	NULL
woman	NULL
--	NULL
from	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
looks	NULL
and	NULL
tones	NULL
of	NULL
emotion	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL

when	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
attend	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
passionate	NULL

be	NULL
taught	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
best	NULL
comfort	NULL
that	NULL
man	NULL
for	NULL
whose	NULL

it	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
quell	NULL
every	NULL
impulse	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
yearnings	NULL
of	NULL
faithfulness	NULL
and	NULL
compassion	NULL

These	NULL
revived	NULL
impressions	NULL
succeeded	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
quickly	NULL

dreamily	NULL
in	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
tea	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
brewed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
shut	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
instant	NULL
of	NULL
reverie	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL

That	NULL

within	NULL
him	NULL

;	NULL
the	NULL
tones	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
music	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
falling	NULL
away	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
really	NULL
fallen	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
momentary	NULL
doze	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
said	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
silvery	NULL
neutral	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Here	NULL
is	NULL
your	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
Tertius	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
setting	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
table	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
moved	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
place	NULL
without	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
hasty	NULL
in	NULL
attributing	NULL
insensibility	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sensitive	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
lasting	NULL
impressions	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
impression	NULL
now	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
offence	NULL
and	NULL
repulsion	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
scowls	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
raised	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
justly	NULL
find	NULL
fault	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
felt	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
off	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
before	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
strong	NULL
reasons	NULL
for	NULL
not	NULL
deferring	NULL
his	NULL
revelation	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
already	NULL
begun	NULL
it	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
abrupt	NULL
announcement	NULL
;	NULL
indeed	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
angry	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
rouse	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
more	NULL
sensibility	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
account	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
prompted	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
prematurely	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
mingled	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
pain	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
pain	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
tray	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
candles	NULL
were	NULL
lit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
quiet	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
counted	NULL
on	NULL

the	NULL

had	NULL
left	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
repelled	NULL
tenderness	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
course	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
kindly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Dear	NULL
Rosy	NULL
,	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL
your	NULL
work	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
gently	NULL
,	NULL
pushing	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stretching	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
a	NULL
chair	NULL
near	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
obeyed	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
drapery	NULL
of	NULL
transparent	NULL
faintly	NULL
tinted	NULL
muslin	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
slim	NULL
yet	NULL
round	NULL
figure	NULL
never	NULL
looked	NULL
more	NULL
graceful	NULL
;	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
by	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
laid	NULL
one	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
elbow	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL

meeting	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
delicate	NULL
neck	NULL
and	NULL
cheek	NULL
and	NULL
purely	NULL
cut	NULL
lips	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
untarnished	NULL
beauty	NULL
which	NULL
touches	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
spring-time	NULL
and	NULL
infancy	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
sweet	NULL
freshness	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
touched	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
mingled	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
moments	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
memories	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
stirred	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
crisis	NULL
of	NULL
deep	NULL
trouble	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
laid	NULL
his	NULL
ample	NULL
hand	NULL
softly	NULL
on	NULL
hers	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Dear	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
lingering	NULL
utterance	NULL
which	NULL
affection	NULL
gives	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
too	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
same	NULL
past	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
in	NULL
part	NULL
the	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
whose	NULL
approval	NULL
had	NULL
stirred	NULL
delight	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
lightly	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
forehead	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
laid	NULL
her	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
forgiving	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
obliged	NULL

tell	NULL
you	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
things	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
paused	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
turned	NULL
her	NULL
neck	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
vase	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

turning	NULL

again	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

Lydgate	NULL

on	NULL

Miss	NULL

astounded	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL

known	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
before	NULL

observed	NULL
that	NULL
Camden	NULL

the	NULL
most	NULL
wonderful	NULL
man	NULL
for	NULL
knowing	NULL
things	NULL

not	NULL
telling	NULL

whereupon	NULL
Mary	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

considered	NULL
that	NULL

something	NULL

with	NULL
their	NULL
having	NULL
only	NULL
once	NULL

at	NULL
Lowick	NULL

Miss	NULL

Fred	NULL
knew	NULL
little	NULL

cared	NULL
less	NULL
about	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Casaubons	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
never	NULL
recurred	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
discussion	NULL
till	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
calling	NULL
on	NULL
Rosamond	NULL

happened	NULL

Ladislaw	NULL
going	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Fred	NULL
and	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
little	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
marriage	NULL
had	NULL
removed	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
collision	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
unpleasantness	NULL
of	NULL
brothers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
especially	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
held	NULL
the	NULL
stupid	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
reprehensible	NULL
step	NULL
of	NULL
giving	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
business	NULL
as	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Garth	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

Hence	NULL
Fred	NULL
talked	NULL
by	NULL
preference	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
considered	NULL
indifferent	NULL
news	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
"	NULL
a	NULL
propos	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
young	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
"	NULL
mentioned	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
at	NULL
Lowick	NULL
Parsonage	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
,	NULL
knew	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
been	NULL
set	NULL
thinking	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
relation	NULL
between	NULL
Will	NULL
and	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
his	NULL
conjectures	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
passionate	NULL
attachment	NULL
on	NULL
both	NULL
sides	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
too	NULL
serious	NULL
to	NULL
gossip	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
Will	NULL
's	NULL
irritability	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
mentioned	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
circumspect	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
his	NULL
surmises	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
addition	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
increased	NULL
his	NULL
friendliness	NULL
and	NULL
tolerance	NULL
towards	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
understand	NULL
the	NULL
vacillation	NULL
which	NULL
kept	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
significant	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
separateness	NULL
between	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
and	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
impulse	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
;	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
trust	NULL
her	NULL
reticence	NULL
towards	NULL
Will	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
there	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
vision	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
would	NULL
act	NULL
in	NULL
urging	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
repeated	NULL
Fred	NULL
's	NULL
news	NULL
to	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
turned	NULL
her	NULL

the	NULL

This	NULL

sounded	NULL
rather	NULL
satirically	NULL

But	NULL
indefinite	NULL

weak	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
ease	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
what	NULL

lingered	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
Rugby	NULL

would	NULL
remember	NULL
him	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
there	NULL

and	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
political	NULL
writing	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
rather	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL

"	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
was	NULL
speaking	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
both	NULL
a	NULL
strengthened	NULL
resolve	NULL

an	NULL
equally	NULL
strong	NULL
resolve	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
seen	NULL
Dorothea	NULL

Hence	NULL
he	NULL
replied	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
reasons	NULL
for	NULL
deferring	NULL
his	NULL
departure	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
happy	NULL

go	NULL

Will	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
defiant	NULL
mood	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
consciousness	NULL
being	NULL
deeply	NULL
stung	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
probably	NULL
knew	NULL
a	NULL
fact	NULL
tantamount	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
accusation	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
fellow	NULL
with	NULL
low	NULL
designs	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
frustrated	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
disposal	NULL
of	NULL
property	NULL
.	NULL

Like	NULL
most	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
assert	NULL
their	NULL
freedom	NULL
with	NULL
regard	NULL
to	NULL
conventional	NULL
distinction	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
prepared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sudden	NULL
and	NULL
quick	NULL
at	NULL
quarrel	NULL
with	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
might	NULL
hint	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
personal	NULL
reasons	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
assertion	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
anything	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
blood	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
bearing	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
his	NULL
character	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
mask	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
opinion	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
under	NULL
an	NULL
irritating	NULL
impression	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
kind	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
about	NULL
for	NULL
days	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
defiant	NULL
look	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
color	NULL
changing	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
transparent	NULL
skin	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
qui	NULL

watching	NULL
for	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
dart	NULL
upon	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
expression	NULL
was	NULL
peculiarly	NULL
noticeable	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sale	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
moods	NULL
of	NULL
gentle	NULL
oddity	NULL
or	NULL
of	NULL
bright	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
struck	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
contrast	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sorry	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
this	NULL
occasion	NULL
for	NULL
appearing	NULL
in	NULL
public	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
tribes	NULL

Toller	NULL

Hackbutt	NULL

the	NULL

looked	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL

and	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
brutal	NULL
ignorance	NULL
about	NULL
Dante	NULL

who	NULL
sneered	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
Polish	NULL

were	NULL
themselves	NULL

breed	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
in	NULL
need	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
conspicuous	NULL
place	NULL
not	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
auctioneer	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL

his	NULL

not	NULL

he	NULL
pushed	NULL

out	NULL

He	NULL

a	NULL
glass	NULL

it	NULL

struck	NULL

at	NULL
this	NULL

At	NULL

whose	NULL

carried	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
eminence	NULL
in	NULL

her	NULL

been	NULL
the	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL

also	NULL

everywhere	NULL

honest	NULL
Mrs.	NULL

was	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
saved	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
respectable	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
ignore	NULL
towards	NULL
others	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
London	NULL
Dissenter	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
sight	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL
indeed	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
respects	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
ingenuous	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
imitative	NULL
piety	NULL
and	NULL
native	NULL
worldliness	NULL
were	NULL
equally	NULL
sincere	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL

ashamed	NULL

whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
thorough	NULL
inclination	NULL
still	NULL
subsisting	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
fears	NULL
were	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
belong	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
cares	NULL
to	NULL
maintain	NULL
his	NULL
recognized	NULL
supremacy	NULL

the	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
high	NULL
consideration	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL

as	NULL
from	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
clearly	NULL
hate	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
enmity	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL

death	NULL

him	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL

quite	NULL
gone	NULL
away	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
trust	NULL
so	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
sober	NULL
unconcern	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
tone	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
!	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
truth	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
quiet	NULL
trust	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
interview	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Bank	NULL
,	NULL
Raffles	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
evident	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
eagerness	NULL
to	NULL
torment	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
strong	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
greed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
frankly	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
whether	NULL
the	NULL
neighborhood	NULL
would	NULL
suit	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
certainly	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
debts	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
gone	NULL
yet	NULL
:	NULL
a	NULL
cool	NULL
five-and-twenty	NULL
would	NULL
suffice	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
wanted	NULL
chiefly	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
friend	NULL
Nick	NULL
and	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
know	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
prosperity	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
attached	NULL
.	NULL

By-and-by	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
longer	NULL
stay	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
time	NULL
Raffles	NULL
declined	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
"	NULL
seen	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
premises	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
expressed	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
declined	NULL
to	NULL
quit	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
under	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
by	NULL
coach	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
.	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
helpless	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
threats	NULL
nor	NULL
coaxing	NULL
could	NULL
avail	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
count	NULL
on	NULL
any	NULL
persistent	NULL
fear	NULL
nor	NULL
on	NULL
any	NULL
promise	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
certainty	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
that	NULL
Raffles	NULL
--	NULL
unless	NULL
providence	NULL
sent	NULL
death	NULL
to	NULL
hinder	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
before	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
certainty	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
terror	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
danger	NULL
of	NULL
legal	NULL
punishment	NULL
or	NULL
of	NULL
beggary	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
danger	NULL
only	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
disclosed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
judgment	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
neighbors	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
mournful	NULL
perception	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
certain	NULL
facts	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
past	NULL
life	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
render	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
scorn	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
opprobrium	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
religion	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
diligently	NULL
associated	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
terror	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
judged	NULL
sharpens	NULL
the	NULL
memory	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
sends	NULL
an	NULL
inevitable	NULL
glare	NULL
over	NULL
that	NULL
long-unvisited	NULL
past	NULL
which	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
habitually	NULL
recalled	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
phrases	NULL

Even	NULL
without	NULL
memory	NULL

the	NULL
life	NULL
is	NULL
bound	NULL
into	NULL
one	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
zone	NULL
of	NULL
dependence	NULL

growth	NULL

forces	NULL
a	NULL

own	NULL

the	NULL

only	NULL
wove	NULL

be	NULL
dwelt	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
turn	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
still	NULL
kept	NULL
their	NULL
hold	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
consciousness	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
more	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
himself	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
banker	NULL
's	NULL
clerk	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
agreeable	NULL
person	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
clever	NULL
in	NULL
figures	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
fluent	NULL
in	NULL
speech	NULL
and	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
theological	NULL
definition	NULL
:	NULL
an	NULL
eminent	NULL
though	NULL
young	NULL
member	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Calvinistic	NULL
dissenting	NULL
church	NULL
at	NULL
Highbury	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
had	NULL
striking	NULL
experience	NULL
in	NULL
conviction	NULL
of	NULL
sin	NULL
and	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
pardon	NULL
.	NULL

Again	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
himself	NULL
called	NULL
for	NULL
as	NULL
Brother	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
in	NULL
prayer	NULL
meetings	NULL
,	NULL
speaking	NULL
on	NULL
religious	NULL
platforms	NULL
,	NULL
preaching	NULL
in	NULL
private	NULL
houses	NULL
.	NULL

Again	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ministry	NULL
as	NULL
possibly	NULL
his	NULL
vocation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
inclined	NULL
towards	NULL
missionary	NULL
labor	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
happiest	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
:	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
chosen	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
awake	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
people	NULL
among	NULL
whom	NULL
Brother	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
was	NULL
distinguished	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
few	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
near	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stirred	NULL
his	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
power	NULL
stretched	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
narrow	NULL
space	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
its	NULL
effect	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
intensely	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
believed	NULL
without	NULL
effort	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
peculiar	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
grace	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
signs	NULL
that	NULL
God	NULL
intended	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
special	NULL
instrumentality	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
transition	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
promotion	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
orphan	NULL
educated	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
commercial	NULL
charity-school	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
invited	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
villa	NULL
belonging	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Dunkirk	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
richest	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
congregation	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
an	NULL
intimate	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
honored	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
piety	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
marked	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
ability	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
wealth	NULL
was	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
flourishing	NULL
city	NULL
and	NULL
west-end	NULL
trade	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
setting-in	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
current	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
ambition	NULL
,	NULL
directing	NULL
his	NULL
prospects	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
instrumentality	NULL
"	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
uniting	NULL
of	NULL
distinguished	NULL
religious	NULL
gifts	NULL
with	NULL
successful	NULL
business	NULL
.	NULL

By-and-by	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
decided	NULL
external	NULL
leading	NULL
:	NULL
a	NULL
confidential	NULL
subordinate	NULL
partner	NULL
died	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
nobody	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
principal	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
fitted	NULL
to	NULL
fill	NULL
the	NULL
severely	NULL
felt	NULL
vacancy	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
young	NULL
friend	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
become	NULL
confidential	NULL
accountant	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
offer	NULL
was	NULL
accepted	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
business	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pawnbroker	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
magnificent	NULL
sort	NULL
both	NULL
in	NULL
extent	NULL
and	NULL
profits	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
became	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
source	NULL
of	NULL
magnificent	NULL
profit	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
easy	NULL
reception	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
goods	NULL
offered	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
strict	NULL
inquiry	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
branch	NULL
house	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
west	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
pettiness	NULL
or	NULL
dinginess	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
suggestions	NULL
of	NULL
shame	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
moments	NULL
of	NULL
shrinking	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
private	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
arguments	NULL
;	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
taking	NULL
the	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
prayer	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
business	NULL
was	NULL
established	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
old	NULL
roots	NULL
;	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
one	NULL

to	NULL
set	NULL
up	NULL

another	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
an	NULL
investment	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL

made	NULL
out	NULL

the	NULL

Metaphors	NULL
and	NULL
precedents	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
wanting	NULL

peculiar	NULL
spiritual	NULL

were	NULL
not	NULL

a	NULL

him	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL
fortune	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL

itself	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL

remained	NULL
private	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Dunkirk	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
expected	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
any	NULL
shrinking	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
conceived	NULL
that	NULL
trade	NULL
had	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
scheme	NULL
of	NULL
salvation	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
carrying	NULL
on	NULL
two	NULL
distinct	NULL
lives	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
religious	NULL
activity	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
incompatible	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
business	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
argued	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
not	NULL
feeling	NULL
it	NULL
incompatible	NULL
.	NULL

Mentally	NULL
surrounded	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
past	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
pleas	NULL
--	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
years	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
perpetually	NULL
spinning	NULL
them	NULL
into	NULL
intricate	NULL
thickness	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
masses	NULL
of	NULL
spider-web	NULL
,	NULL
padding	NULL
the	NULL
moral	NULL
sensibility	NULL
;	NULL
nay	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
age	NULL
made	NULL
egoism	NULL
more	NULL
eager	NULL
but	NULL
less	NULL
enjoying	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
more	NULL
saturated	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
belief	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
everything	NULL
for	NULL
God	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
indifferent	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
far-off	NULL
spot	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
youthful	NULL
poverty	NULL
--	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
choose	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
missionary	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
of	NULL
causes	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
locked	NULL
himself	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
trouble	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fine	NULL
villa	NULL
at	NULL
Highbury	NULL
.	NULL

Years	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
daughter	NULL
had	NULL
run	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
defied	NULL
her	NULL
parents	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gone	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stage	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
boy	NULL
died	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
time	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Dunkirk	NULL
died	NULL
also	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
simple	NULL
pious	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
left	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
wealth	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
magnificent	NULL
trade	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
precise	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
innocently	NULL
adore	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
women	NULL
often	NULL
adore	NULL
their	NULL
priest	NULL
or	NULL
"	NULL
man-made	NULL
"	NULL
minister	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
that	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
marriage	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Dunkirk	NULL
had	NULL
qualms	NULL
and	NULL
yearnings	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
daughter	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
been	NULL
regarded	NULL
as	NULL
lost	NULL
both	NULL
to	NULL
God	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
parents	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
known	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
daughter	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
utterly	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
sight	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
lost	NULL
her	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
imagined	NULL
a	NULL
grandson	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wished	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
double	NULL
sense	NULL
to	NULL
reclaim	NULL
her	NULL
daughter	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
found	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
channel	NULL
for	NULL
property	NULL
--	NULL
perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
wide	NULL
one	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
provision	NULL
for	NULL
several	NULL
grandchildren	NULL
.	NULL

Efforts	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
her	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
before	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Dunkirk	NULL
would	NULL
marry	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL
concurred	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
after	NULL
advertisement	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
other	NULL
modes	NULL
of	NULL
inquiry	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
tried	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
mother	NULL
believed	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
daughter	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
consented	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
without	NULL
reservation	NULL
of	NULL
property	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
daughter	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
found	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
man	NULL
besides	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
paid	NULL
for	NULL
keeping	NULL
silence	NULL
and	NULL
carrying	NULL
himself	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
bare	NULL
fact	NULL
which	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rigid	NULL
outline	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
acts	NULL
present	NULL
themselves	NULL
onlookers	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
distant	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
burning	NULL
memory	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
was	NULL
broken	NULL
into	NULL
little	NULL
sequences	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
justified	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
by	NULL
reasonings	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
prove	NULL
it	NULL
righteous	NULL
.	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL
's	NULL
course	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL

been	NULL

appearing	NULL

be	NULL
the	NULL
agent	NULL
in	NULL
making	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
property	NULL
and	NULL
withdrawing	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
perversion	NULL

Death	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
striking	NULL
dispositions	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
feminine	NULL
trustfulness	NULL

had	NULL
come	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
adopted	NULL

's	NULL
words	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
you	NULL

The	NULL
events	NULL
were	NULL
comparatively	NULL
small	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
essential	NULL
condition	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
--	NULL
namely	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
favor	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
easy	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
settle	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
due	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL

by	NULL
inquiring	NULL
what	NULL
were	NULL
God	NULL

Could	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
for	NULL
God	NULL
's	NULL
service	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
fortune	NULL
should	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL

proportion	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
lightest	NULL
pursuits	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
might	NULL
scatter	NULL
it	NULL
abroad	NULL
in	NULL
triviality	NULL
--	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
lie	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
path	NULL
of	NULL
remarkable	NULL
providences	NULL
?	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
beforehand	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
daughter	NULL
shall	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
came	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
her	NULL
existence	NULL
hidden	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
other	NULL
moments	NULL
followed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
soothed	NULL
the	NULL
mother	NULL
with	NULL
consolation	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
probability	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
unhappy	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
hours	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
action	NULL
was	NULL
unrighteous	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
how	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
mental	NULL
exercises	NULL
,	NULL
called	NULL
himself	NULL
nought	NULL
,	NULL
laid	NULL
hold	NULL
on	NULL
redemption	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
instrumentality	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
after	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
Death	NULL
again	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
widen	NULL
his	NULL
path	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
taking	NULL
away	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
gradually	NULL
withdraw	NULL
his	NULL
capital	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
sacrifices	NULL
requisite	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
carried	NULL
on	NULL
for	NULL
thirteen	NULL
years	NULL
afterwards	NULL
before	NULL
it	NULL
finally	NULL
collapsed	NULL
.	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
Nicholas	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
had	NULL
used	NULL
his	NULL
hundred	NULL
thousand	NULL
discreetly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
become	NULL

when	NULL

thirty	NULL

,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
Raffles	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
something	NULL
momentous	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
entered	NULL
actively	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
struggle	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
longings	NULL
and	NULL
terrors	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
lay	NULL
an	NULL
opening	NULL
towards	NULL
spiritual	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
towards	NULL
material	NULL
rescue	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
spiritual	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
rescue	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
genuine	NULL
need	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
coarse	NULL
hypocrites	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
consciously	NULL
affect	NULL
beliefs	NULL
and	NULL
emotions	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
gulling	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
simply	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
whose	NULL
desires	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
stronger	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
theoretic	NULL
beliefs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
gradually	NULL
explained	NULL
the	NULL
gratification	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
desires	NULL
into	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
agreement	NULL
with	NULL
those	NULL
beliefs	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
this	NULL
be	NULL
hypocrisy	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
process	NULL
which	NULL
shows	NULL
itself	NULL
occasionally	NULL
in	NULL
us	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
whatever	NULL
confession	NULL
we	NULL
belong	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whether	NULL
we	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
perfection	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
race	NULL
or	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
nearest	NULL
date	NULL
fixed	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
;	NULL
whether	NULL
we	NULL
regard	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
putrefying	NULL
nidus	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
saved	NULL
remnant	NULL
,	NULL
including	NULL
ourselves	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
passionate	NULL
belief	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
solidarity	NULL
of	NULL
mankind	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
service	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
cause	NULL
of	NULL
religion	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
through	NULL
life	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
he	NULL
alleged	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
choice	NULL
of	NULL
action	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
motive	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
prayers	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
would	NULL
use	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
position	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
them	NULL
?	NULL

Who	NULL
could	NULL
surpass	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
self-abhorrence	NULL
and	NULL
exaltation	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
's	NULL
cause	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
God	NULL
's	NULL
cause	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
distinct	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
rectitude	NULL
of	NULL
conduct	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
enforced	NULL
a	NULL
discrimination	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
's	NULL
enemies	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
used	NULL
merely	NULL
as	NULL
instruments	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whom	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
if	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
consequent	NULL
influence	NULL
.	NULL

Also	NULL
,	NULL
profitable	NULL
investments	NULL
in	NULL
trades	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
prince	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
showed	NULL
its	NULL
most	NULL
active	NULL
devices	NULL
,	NULL
became	NULL
sanctified	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
application	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
profits	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
God	NULL
's	NULL
servant	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
implicit	NULL
reasoning	NULL
is	NULL
essentially	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
peculiar	NULL
to	NULL
evangelical	NULL
belief	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
wide	NULL
phrases	NULL
for	NULL
narrow	NULL
motives	NULL
is	NULL
peculiar	NULL
to	NULL
Englishmen	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
general	NULL
doctrine	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
eating	NULL
out	NULL
our	NULL
morality	NULL
if	NULL
unchecked	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
deep-seated	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
direct	NULL
fellow-feeling	NULL
with	NULL
individual	NULL
fellow-men	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
believes	NULL
in	NULL
something	NULL
else	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
greed	NULL
,	NULL
has	NULL
necessarily	NULL
a	NULL
conscience	NULL
or	NULL
standard	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
adapts	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL
's	NULL
standard	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
serviceableness	NULL
to	NULL
God	NULL
's	NULL
cause	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
sinful	NULL
and	NULL
nought	NULL

a	NULL
vessel	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
consecrated	NULL

but	NULL
use	NULL
me	NULL

"	NULL

--	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
mould	NULL
into	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
constrained	NULL
his	NULL
immense	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
something	NULL
important	NULL
and	NULL
predominating	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
that	NULL
mould	NULL
seemed	NULL
in	NULL
danger	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
broken	NULL
and	NULL
utterly	NULL
cast	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
acts	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
reconciled	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
stronger	NULL
instrument	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
divine	NULL
glory	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
the	NULL
pretext	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
scoffer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
darkening	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
glory	NULL
?	NULL

If	NULL
this	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
ruling	NULL
of	NULL
Providence	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
cast	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
temple	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
unclean	NULL
offerings	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
utterances	NULL
of	NULL
repentance	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
today	NULL
a	NULL
repentance	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bitterer	NULL
flavor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
threatening	NULL
Providence	NULL
urged	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
propitiation	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
simply	NULL
a	NULL
doctrinal	NULL
transaction	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
divine	NULL
tribunal	NULL
had	NULL
changed	NULL
its	NULL
aspect	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
self-prostration	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
bring	NULL
restitution	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
God	NULL
that	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
attempt	NULL
such	NULL
restitution	NULL
as	NULL
seemed	NULL
possible	NULL
:	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
dread	NULL
had	NULL
seized	NULL
his	NULL
susceptible	NULL
frame	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
scorching	NULL
approach	NULL
of	NULL
shame	NULL
wrought	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
spiritual	NULL
need	NULL
.	NULL

Night	NULL
and	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
resurgent	NULL
threatening	NULL
past	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
conscience	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
by	NULL
what	NULL
means	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
recover	NULL
peace	NULL
and	NULL
trust	NULL
--	NULL
by	NULL
what	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
stay	NULL
the	NULL
rod	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
belief	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
moments	NULL
of	NULL
dread	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
spontaneously	NULL
did	NULL
something	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
God	NULL
would	NULL
save	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
consequences	NULL
of	NULL
wrong-doing	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
religion	NULL
can	NULL
only	NULL
change	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
emotions	NULL
which	NULL
fill	NULL
it	NULL
are	NULL
changed	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
religion	NULL
of	NULL
personal	NULL
fear	NULL
remains	NULL
nearly	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
level	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
savage	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
Raffles	NULL
actually	NULL
going	NULL
away	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Brassing	NULL
coach	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
temporary	NULL
relief	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
removed	NULL
the	NULL
pressure	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
immediate	NULL
dread	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
put	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
spiritual	NULL
conflict	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
need	NULL
to	NULL
win	NULL
protection	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
difficult	NULL
resolve	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wrote	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL

Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL

the	NULL

Will	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
no	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL
request	NULL

connected	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL

when	NULL
he	NULL

when	NULL
,	NULL
checking	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL

he	NULL
only	NULL
inquired	NULL
after	NULL
Mrs.	NULL

her	NULL

Will	NULL
felt	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
electric	NULL
shock	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL

keen	NULL
sensitiveness	NULL

hardly	NULL
allayed	NULL
agitation	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

his	NULL
presentiments	NULL

seemed	NULL

at	NULL
this	NULL

almost	NULL

the	NULL

that	NULL

this	NULL

could	NULL
not	NULL

because	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
choose	NULL

had	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL

before	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
happened	NULL

could	NULL
ever	NULL

Dorothea	NULL

the	NULL

a	NULL

talking	NULL
to	NULL

following	NULL

along	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
over	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
blow	NULL

but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
perceptibly	NULL
checked	NULL

in	NULL
truth	NULL

the	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
Will	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
all-satisfying	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
precious	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL

lost	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Kell	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Go	NULL
in	NULL

tell	NULL
him	NULL

Will	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
his	NULL
portfolio	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
laid	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
far	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL

over	NULL

himself	NULL

piece	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
relation	NULL
to	NULL
nature	NULL
too	NULL
mysterious	NULL
for	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
smiling	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shaking	NULL
the	NULL
sketches	NULL
into	NULL
order	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
awaiting	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL

when	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Kell	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
elbow	NULL
said	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Mrs.	NULL

Will	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
moment	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
entering	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Kell	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
they	NULL
met	NULL
:	NULL
each	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
consciousness	NULL
was	NULL
overflowed	NULL
by	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
suppressed	NULL
utterance	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
confusion	NULL
that	NULL
kept	NULL
them	NULL
silent	NULL

for	NULL
they	NULL
both	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
parting	NULL

near	NULL

there	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
shamefacedness	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sad	NULL

She	NULL
moved	NULL
automatically	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
chair	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
writing-table	NULL

and	NULL
Will	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
drawing	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL

went	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
paces	NULL
off	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
opposite	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Pray	NULL
sit	NULL
down	NULL

said	NULL
Dorothea	NULL

crossing	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
lap	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
very	NULL
glad	NULL

"	NULL

Will	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
looked	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
first	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
Rome	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
widow	NULL

fixed	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL

gone	NULL
off	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
lately	NULL
been	NULL
shedding	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
mixture	NULL
of	NULL
anger	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
agitation	NULL
had	NULL
vanished	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL

him	NULL

she	NULL

been	NULL

when	NULL
they	NULL

impetuously	NULL

shaking	NULL
his	NULL

irritation	NULL

Will	NULL
rose	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
word	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
hardly	NULL
knew	NULL
where	NULL

but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
projecting	NULL
window	NULL
nearest	NULL
him	NULL

which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
open	NULL

about	NULL
the	NULL

season	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL

when	NULL
he	NULL

Dorothea	NULL

stood	NULL
within	NULL
it	NULL

talked	NULL
together	NULL

Her	NULL
whole	NULL

going	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
in	NULL
sympathy	NULL
with	NULL
Will	NULL

she	NULL
only	NULL
wanted	NULL

convince	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL

him	NULL
injustice	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL

had	NULL
been	NULL
part	NULL

the	NULL

she	NULL
began	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
ardent	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
wanting	NULL
to	NULL
plead	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
moved	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
chair	NULL

went	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL

saying	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
you	NULL

When	NULL
Will	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
start	NULL
and	NULL
moved	NULL
backward	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
meeting	NULL
her	NULL
glance	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
hurt	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
movement	NULL
following	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
previous	NULL
anger	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
tone	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
hard	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
helpless	NULL

those	NULL
strange	NULL
particulars	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
relation	NULL
which	NULL
neither	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
could	NULL
explicitly	NULL
mention	NULL
kept	NULL
her	NULL
always	NULL
in	NULL
dread	NULL
of	NULL
saying	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL

At	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
belief	NULL
that	NULL

would	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
case	NULL

her	NULL

she	NULL
feared	NULL
using	NULL
words	NULL

such	NULL
a	NULL
belief	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
only	NULL
said	NULL
earnestly	NULL

recurring	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
word	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL

Will	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
stormy	NULL
fluctuation	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
feelings	NULL
these	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
cruelly	NULL
neutral	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
pale	NULL
and	NULL
miserable	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
angry	NULL
outburst	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
and	NULL
fastened	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
portfolio	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
wasting	NULL
these	NULL
last	NULL
moments	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
wretched	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
obstinately	NULL
uppermost	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
passionate	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
forbade	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
utter	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
offer	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
help	NULL
--	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
that	NULL

have	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
since	NULL
to-day	NULL

to	NULL
her	NULL

But	NULL
Will	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
portfolio	NULL

approached	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

with	NULL
that	NULL

sometimes	NULL
accompanies	NULL
bitter	NULL

burned	NULL

a	NULL
light	NULL

"	NULL

a	NULL

Will	NULL
paused	NULL
,	NULL
imagining	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
to	NULL
misunderstand	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL
indeed	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
contradicting	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
offending	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
self-approval	NULL
in	NULL
speaking	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
plainly	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
fairly	NULL
called	NULL
wooing	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
woo	NULL
her	NULL

It	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
admitted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
ghostly	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
wooing	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
rapidly	NULL
going	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
with	NULL
quite	NULL
another	NULL
vision	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
what	NULL
Will	NULL
most	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
did	NULL
throb	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
came	NULL
doubt	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
memory	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
through	NULL
together	NULL
turned	NULL
pale	NULL
and	NULL
shrank	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
memory	NULL
which	NULL
suggested	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
fuller	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
intercourse	NULL
between	NULL
Will	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
constant	NULL
companionship	NULL
.	NULL

Everything	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
might	NULL
refer	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
other	NULL
relation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whatever	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
between	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
herself	NULL
was	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
explained	NULL
by	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
regarded	NULL
as	NULL
their	NULL
simple	NULL
friendship	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
cruel	NULL
obstruction	NULL
thrust	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
injurious	NULL
act	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
stood	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
cast	NULL
down	NULL
dreamily	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
images	NULL
crowded	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
which	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
sickening	NULL
certainty	NULL
that	NULL
Will	NULL
was	NULL
referring	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
why	NULL
sickening	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
here	NULL
too	NULL
his	NULL
conduct	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
above	NULL
suspicion	NULL
.	NULL

Will	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
surprised	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
mind	NULL
also	NULL
was	NULL
tumultuously	NULL
busy	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
watched	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
feeling	NULL
rather	NULL
wildly	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
must	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
hinder	NULL
their	NULL
parting	NULL
--	NULL
some	NULL
miracle	NULL
,	NULL
clearly	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
deliberate	NULL
speech	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
any	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
pretend	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
rather	NULL
believe	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
without	NULL
that	NULL
pain	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
deny	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
secret	NULL
longing	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
assurance	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
root	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
long	NULL
they	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
raising	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
opened	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
footman	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Presently	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
turning	NULL
to	NULL
Will	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
some	NULL
memoranda	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Will	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
had	NULL
closed	NULL
again	NULL
--	NULL
advancing	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
day	NULL

I	NULL

leave	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
have	NULL
acted	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
way	NULL
rightly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
tone	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
a	NULL
pressure	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Will	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
without	NULL
speaking	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
words	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
cruelly	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
unlike	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
eyes	NULL
met	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
discontent	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
hers	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
sadness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
portfolio	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
never	NULL
done	NULL
you	NULL
injustice	NULL
.	NULL

Please	NULL
remember	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
repressing	NULL
a	NULL
rising	NULL
sob	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
should	NULL
you	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Will	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
irritation	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
As	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
danger	NULL
of	NULL
forgetting	NULL
everything	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
really	NULL
a	NULL
movement	NULL
of	NULL
anger	NULL
against	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
impelled	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
without	NULL
pause	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
one	NULL
flash	NULL
to	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
words	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
distant	NULL
bow	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sank	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
moments	NULL
sat	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
statue	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
images	NULL
and	NULL
emotions	NULL
were	NULL
hurrying	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Joy	NULL
came	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
threatening	NULL
train	NULL
behind	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
joy	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
herself	NULL
whom	NULL
Will	NULL
loved	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
renouncing	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
love	NULL
less	NULL
permissible	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
blameworthy	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
honor	NULL
was	NULL
hurrying	NULL
him	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
parted	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
--	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
drew	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
breath	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
her	NULL
strength	NULL
return	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
unrestrainedly	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
parting	NULL
was	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
loving	NULL
and	NULL
being	NULL
loved	NULL
excluded	NULL
sorrow	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
some	NULL
hard	NULL
icy	NULL
pressure	NULL
had	NULL
melted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
consciousness	NULL
had	NULL
room	NULL
to	NULL
expand	NULL
:	NULL
her	NULL
past	NULL
was	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
larger	NULL
interpretation	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
joy	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
--	NULL
perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
complete	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
--	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
irrevocable	NULL
parting	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
reproach	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
contemptuous	NULL
wonder	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
eye	NULL
or	NULL
from	NULL
any	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
acted	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
defy	NULL
reproach	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
wonder	NULL
respectful	NULL

Any	NULL
one	NULL
watching	NULL

was	NULL

She	NULL
spoke	NULL
her	NULL

the	NULL
housekeeper	NULL
in	NULL
cheerful	NULL
tones	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
seated	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
bright	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
blooming	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
dismal	NULL
bonnet	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
threw	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
heavy	NULL

weepers	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
wondering	NULL
which	NULL
road	NULL
Will	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
nature	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
proud	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
blameless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
through	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
feelings	NULL
there	NULL
ran	NULL
this	NULL
vein	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
defend	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
coachman	NULL
was	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
his	NULL
grays	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
pace	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
being	NULL
unenjoying	NULL
and	NULL
impatient	NULL
in	NULL
everything	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
desk	NULL

and	NULL
wanting	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
journeys	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
bowled	NULL
along	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

Driving	NULL
was	NULL
pleasant	NULL

for	NULL
rain	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
had	NULL
laid	NULL
the	NULL
dust	NULL

the	NULL
blue	NULL

away	NULL

the	NULL
region	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

clouds	NULL
that	NULL
sailed	NULL
in	NULL
masses	NULL

The	NULL
earth	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
happy	NULL

under	NULL
the	NULL
vast	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
wishing	NULL
that	NULL

might	NULL
overtake	NULL
Will	NULL

see	NULL
him	NULL
once	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
turn	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

there	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
portfolio	NULL

passing	NULL
him	NULL

he	NULL
raised	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL

she	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
pang	NULL
at	NULL
being	NULL
seated	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
exaltation	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
him	NULL
behind	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
look	NULL
back	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL

them	NULL
farther	NULL

farther	NULL
away	NULL

each	NULL

making	NULL
it	NULL
useless	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
no	NULL

an	NULL

anything	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
talked	NULL
persistently	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
work-room	NULL

putting	NULL
arguments	NULL

to	NULL
himself	NULL

taste	NULL

"	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
proud	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
having	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
corresponding	NULL
fibre	NULL
in	NULL
himself	NULL

and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
too	NULL
little	NULL
care	NULL
about	NULL

dignity	NULL

except	NULL
the	NULL
dignity	NULL
of	NULL
not	NULL
being	NULL
mean	NULL

foolish	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
allow	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
shrank	NULL

as	NULL
from	NULL

from	NULL
the	NULL
utterance	NULL

And	NULL
soon	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL

at	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Toller	NULL
's	NULL

the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
learned	NULL
something	NULL

made	NULL
him	NULL
watch	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
eagerly	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL

indirectly	NULL

about	NULL
any	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL

The	NULL
opportunity	NULL
came	NULL
at	NULL
Mr.	NULL

where	NULL

on	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
party	NULL

to	NULL
which	NULL
Mr.	NULL

was	NULL
irresistibly	NULL
invited	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
plea	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL

his	NULL
old	NULL

on	NULL

And	NULL
this	NULL

was	NULL
thoroughly	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL
ladies	NULL

the	NULL
Farebrother	NULL

were	NULL
present	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
Vincy	NULL
children	NULL
all	NULL
dined	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL

and	NULL
Fred	NULL
had	NULL
persuaded	NULL

that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL

Mary	NULL
came	NULL

Fred	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
high	NULL

though	NULL
his	NULL

much	NULL
streaked	NULL
with	NULL
jealousy	NULL
when	NULL
Mr.	NULL

sat	NULL
down	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL

Fred	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
easy	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL

and	NULL
this	NULL

still	NULL

him	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
fullest	NULL
matronly	NULL
bloom	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Mary	NULL
's	NULL
little	NULL
figure	NULL

rough	NULL

hair	NULL

and	NULL
visage	NULL
quite	NULL
without	NULL
lilies	NULL

roses	NULL

and	NULL
wondered	NULL

trying	NULL
unsuccessfully	NULL

fancy	NULL

However	NULL

the	NULL

was	NULL

Mary	NULL
was	NULL
particularly	NULL

that	NULL

getting	NULL

her	NULL

being	NULL
also	NULL
quite	NULL
willing	NULL

was	NULL
valued	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
seemed	NULL
bored	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
spoke	NULL
as	NULL
little	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
son-in-law	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
graceful	NULL

calm	NULL

and	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
subtle	NULL
observation	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
roused	NULL
to	NULL
bestow	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
perceived	NULL
the	NULL
total	NULL
absence	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL

which	NULL
a	NULL
loving	NULL
wife	NULL
is	NULL
sure	NULL
to	NULL
betray	NULL

even	NULL
if	NULL

her	NULL

When	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
taking	NULL
part	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL

she	NULL
never	NULL
looked	NULL

him	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL

when	NULL

after	NULL

called	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
re-entered	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
unconscious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
eighteen	NULL
months	NULL
before	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL

In	NULL
reality	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL

Lydgate	NULL

voice	NULL

movements	NULL

and	NULL
her	NULL
pretty	NULL
good-tempered	NULL
air	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
tone	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
clutch	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL

for	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL

walked	NULL
out	NULL

with	NULL
an	NULL
intense	NULL
determination	NULL
to	NULL
hinder	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
liked	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

but	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
blood	NULL
cooled	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
chief	NULL
result	NULL

the	NULL
discussion	NULL
was	NULL

him	NULL

might	NULL
again	NULL

him	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
fracture	NULL
in	NULL

had	NULL
begun	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL

any	NULL
movement	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
fatal	NULL

His	NULL
marriage	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
bitter	NULL
irony	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL

go	NULL
on	NULL
loving	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL

made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
negative	NULL
character	NULL
--	NULL
her	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
sensibility	NULL

which	NULL
showed	NULL
itself	NULL
in	NULL
disregard	NULL
both	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
specific	NULL
wishes	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
general	NULL
aims	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
great	NULL
disappointment	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
borne	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
tender	NULL
devotedness	NULL
and	NULL
docile	NULL
adoration	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ideal	NULL
wife	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
renounced	NULL

life	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
up	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
lower	NULL
stage	NULL

expectation	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
by	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
lost	NULL
their	NULL
limbs	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
wife	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
her	NULL
claims	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
still	NULL
a	NULL
hold	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
intense	NULL
desire	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
hold	NULL
should	NULL
remain	NULL
strong	NULL

In	NULL

the	NULL

Hence	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
outburst	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
inward	NULL
effort	NULL
was	NULL
entirely	NULL
to	NULL
excuse	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
blame	NULL
the	NULL
hard	NULL
circumstances	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
partly	NULL
his	NULL
fault	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL

by	NULL
petting	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
heal	NULL
the	NULL
wound	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL

nature	NULL

repellent	NULL

welcomed	NULL
the	NULL
signs	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL

was	NULL
under	NULL
control	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
quite	NULL
distinct	NULL
from	NULL

_	NULL
him	NULL

Lydgate	NULL

the	NULL
plan	NULL

parting	NULL

the	NULL
house	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
as	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
herself	NULL
touched	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
breakfast	NULL
by	NULL
saying	NULL
,	NULL
mildly	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL

you	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL

forehead	NULL

he	NULL
rested	NULL
his	NULL
elbows	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
feeling	NULL
bitter	NULL
disappointment	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
opened	NULL
a	NULL
door	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
suffocating	NULL
place	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
walled	NULL
up	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
also	NULL
felt	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
was	NULL
pleased	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
cause	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
disappointment	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
preferred	NULL
not	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
speaking	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
spasm	NULL
of	NULL
vexation	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
bitterness	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
can	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
care	NULL
about	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
furniture	NULL
?	NULL

a	NULL
husband	NULL
without	NULL
them	NULL
is	NULL
an	NULL
absurdity	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
pushed	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
aside	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
dark	NULL
eyes	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
miserable	NULL
blank	NULL
non-expectance	NULL
of	NULL
sympathy	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
coolly	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Perhaps	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
may	NULL
turn	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
told	NULL
Trumbull	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
look-out	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
failed	NULL
with	NULL
Plymdale	NULL

"	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
remark	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
trusted	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
chance	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
would	NULL
pass	NULL
between	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
auctioneer	NULL
until	NULL
some	NULL
issue	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
justified	NULL
her	NULL
interference	NULL
;	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
hindered	NULL
the	NULL
event	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
immediately	NULL
dreaded	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
pause	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
How	NULL
much	NULL
money	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL

how	NULL

satisfy	NULL
them	NULL

that	NULL
you	NULL
need	NULL

"	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
surveyed	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
looking	NULL
for	NULL
symptoms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
six	NULL

as	NULL
premium	NULL

I	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
managed	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
paid	NULL
off	NULL

given	NULL

contracted	NULL

expenses	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
how	NULL

should	NULL

this	NULL
house	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
More	NULL
than	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
likely	NULL

said	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
grating	NULL
sarcasm	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
tone	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
angered	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
perceive	NULL
that	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
wandering	NULL
over	NULL
impracticable	NULL
wishes	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
facing	NULL
possible	NULL
efforts	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
should	NULL
you	NULL
not	NULL
mention	NULL
the	NULL
sum	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
mild	NULL
indication	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
his	NULL
manners	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
guessing	NULL
tone	NULL

"	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
at	NULL

,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
added	NULL

incisively	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL

consider	NULL

it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
said	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
she	NULL
carried	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
plan	NULL
of	NULL
writing	NULL
to	NULL
Sir	NULL
Godwin	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
the	NULL
Captain	NULL
's	NULL
visit	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
received	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
also	NULL
one	NULL
from	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Mengan	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
married	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
condoling	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
baby	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
expressing	NULL
vaguely	NULL
the	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
at	NULL
Quallingham	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
politeness	NULL
meant	NULL
nothing	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
secretly	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
backwardness	NULL
in	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
family	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
contemptuous	NULL
behavior	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
answered	NULL
the	NULL
letters	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
most	NULL
charming	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
some	NULL
confidence	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
specific	NULL
invitation	NULL
would	NULL
follow	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
total	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Captain	NULL
evidently	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
penman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
reflected	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
sisters	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
abroad	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
was	NULL
come	NULL
for	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
friends	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
Sir	NULL
Godwin	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
chucked	NULL
her	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
chin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pronounced	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
celebrated	NULL
beauty	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Croly	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
conquest	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
1790	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
touched	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
appeal	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
find	NULL
it	NULL
pleasant	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
sake	NULL
to	NULL
behave	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
towards	NULL
his	NULL
nephew	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
was	NULL
naively	NULL
convinced	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
suffering	NULL
annoyance	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
wrote	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
considered	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
judicious	NULL
letter	NULL
possible	NULL
--	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
strike	NULL
Sir	NULL
Godwin	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
proof	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
excellent	NULL
sense	NULL
--	NULL
pointing	NULL
out	NULL
how	NULL
desirable	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Tertius	NULL
should	NULL
quit	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
as	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
more	NULL
fitted	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
talents	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
inhabitants	NULL
had	NULL
hindered	NULL
his	NULL
professional	NULL
success	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
in	NULL
consequence	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
money	NULL
difficulties	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
require	NULL
a	NULL
thousand	NULL
pounds	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
to	NULL
extricate	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
Tertius	NULL
was	NULL
unaware	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
intention	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
supposed	NULL
sanction	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
letter	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
accordance	NULL
with	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
say	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
great	NULL
regard	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
Godwin	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
relative	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
best	NULL
friend	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
Poor	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
tactics	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
applied	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
affairs	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
party	NULL
on	NULL
New	NULL
Year	NULL
's	NULL
Day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
answer	NULL
had	NULL
yet	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
Sir	NULL
Godwin	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
that	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
revoked	NULL
his	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
Borthrop	NULL
Trumbull	NULL
.	NULL

Feeling	NULL
it	NULL
necessary	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
gradually	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
quitting	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
Lowick	NULL
Gate	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
overcame	NULL
his	NULL
reluctance	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
breakfasting	NULL
said	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Trumbull	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
advertise	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
Pioneer	NULL
'	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
Trumpet	NULL
.	NULL
'	NULL

If	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
were	NULL
advertised	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
otherwise	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
these	NULL
country	NULL
places	NULL
many	NULL
people	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
old	NULL
houses	NULL
when	NULL

families	NULL
are	NULL
too	NULL
large	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL

for	NULL

where	NULL
they	NULL
can	NULL
find	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Trumbull	NULL
seems	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
no	NULL
bite	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
inevitable	NULL
moment	NULL
was	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
ordered	NULL
Trumbull	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
inquire	NULL
further	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
careful	NULL
calmness	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
defensive	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
mute	NULL
amazement	NULL
.	NULL

Only	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
fastening	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
plaits	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
talking	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
little	NULL
language	NULL
"	NULL
of	NULL
affection	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
not	NULL
returning	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
accepted	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
serene	NULL
and	NULL
lovely	NULL
image	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
miraculously	NULL
dimpling	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
votary	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
such	NULL
fibres	NULL
still	NULL
astir	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
shock	NULL
he	NULL
received	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
be	NULL
distinctly	NULL
anger	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
confused	NULL

He	NULL
laid	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
knife	NULL
and	NULL
fork	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
carving	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
throwing	NULL
himself	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
cool	NULL
irony	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
tone	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
May	NULL
I	NULL
ask	NULL
when	NULL

why	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL
When	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Plymdales	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL

I	NULL
called	NULL

Lydgate	NULL

bitingly	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
thunder	NULL
and	NULL
lightning	NULL
gathering	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
brow	NULL

The	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL

's	NULL
anger	NULL
on	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL

to	NULL
become	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

replied	NULL

was	NULL
he	NULL

saw	NULL

more	NULL

the	NULL

discontent	NULL
within	NULL

a	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL

life	NULL
with	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
images	NULL

even	NULL

journey	NULL

seeing	NULL
Sir	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
then	NULL
known	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL
pressure	NULL

more	NULL
disagreeable	NULL

could	NULL
not	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
his	NULL

purpose	NULL

Quallingham	NULL

one	NULL
morning	NULL
after	NULL
Lydgate	NULL

gone	NULL
out	NULL

a	NULL
letter	NULL
came	NULL
addressed	NULL

him	NULL

which	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
saw	NULL
clearly	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
from	NULL
Sir	NULL
Godwin	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
hope	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
particular	NULL
note	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
enclosed	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
naturally	NULL
addressed	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
aid	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
nay	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
delay	NULL
in	NULL
writing	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
certify	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
answer	NULL
was	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
compliant	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
excited	NULL
by	NULL
these	NULL
thoughts	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
but	NULL
light	NULL
stitching	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
warm	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
outside	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
momentous	NULL
letter	NULL
lying	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

About	NULL
twelve	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
step	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL

and	NULL
tripping	NULL
to	NULL
open	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

not	NULL
taking	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL

just	NULL
turning	NULL
her	NULL
round	NULL
within	NULL
his	NULL

the	NULL

where	NULL
the	NULL

exclaimed	NULL

while	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
reseated	NULL
herself	NULL

and	NULL
watched	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
surprised	NULL

While	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
glanced	NULL
rapidly	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL
saw	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL

usually	NULL

a	NULL
pale	NULL

taking	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
dry	NULL
whiteness	NULL

with	NULL
nostrils	NULL
and	NULL
lips	NULL
quivering	NULL
he	NULL
tossed	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
violently	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
checked	NULL
his	NULL
speech	NULL

turned	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
wheeled	NULL
round	NULL

walked	NULL
about	NULL

sat	NULL
down	NULL

got	NULL
up	NULL

grasping	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL

aggrieved	NULL

that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
recognize	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL

the	NULL
need	NULL

himself	NULL

nature	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
inflexible	NULL
in	NULL

held	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL

an	NULL

foresight	NULL

her	NULL

love	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL

fulness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL

made	NULL
this	NULL

alternate	NULL
quickly	NULL

the	NULL

his	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
's	NULL

Under	NULL
the	NULL

galling	NULL
pressure	NULL
of	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
perception	NULL

He	NULL

him	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL

watching	NULL
it	NULL

He	NULL

no	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
by	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
winning	NULL
he	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
attained	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL

process	NULL

towards	NULL
a	NULL

The	NULL

But	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL

his	NULL
thought	NULL
now	NULL
began	NULL

turn	NULL
upon	NULL

which	NULL
implied	NULL
no	NULL

it	NULL

lookers-on	NULL

as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
players	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
betting	NULL
with	NULL
animation	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
playing	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
confident	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
bets	NULL
were	NULL
dropping	NULL
round	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
swift	NULL
glancing	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

gain	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
double	NULL
the	NULL
sum	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
saving	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
horse	NULL

he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
bet	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
play	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
won	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Bambridge	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
notice	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
excited	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
play	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
visions	NULL
were	NULL
gleaming	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
Brassing	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
gambling	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
grander	NULL
scale	NULL

be	NULL

and	NULL
where	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
powerful	NULL
snatch	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
devil	NULL
's	NULL
bait	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
carry	NULL
it	NULL
off	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
hook	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
buy	NULL
his	NULL
rescue	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
daily	NULL
solicitings	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
winning	NULL
when	NULL
two	NULL
new	NULL
visitors	NULL
entered	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
Hawley	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
law	NULL
studies	NULL
in	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
was	NULL
Fred	NULL
Vincy	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
several	NULL
evenings	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
old	NULL
haunt	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

Young	NULL
Hawley	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
accomplished	NULL
billiard-player	NULL
,	NULL
brought	NULL
a	NULL
cool	NULL
fresh	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
cue	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Fred	NULL
Vincy	NULL
,	NULL
startled	NULL
at	NULL
seeing	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
astonished	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
betting	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
excited	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
aside	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
kept	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
circle	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

Fred	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
rewarding	NULL
resolution	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
laxity	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
working	NULL
heartily	NULL
for	NULL
six	NULL
months	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
outdoor	NULL
occupations	NULL
under	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Garth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
dint	NULL
of	NULL
severe	NULL
practice	NULL
had	NULL
nearly	NULL
mastered	NULL
the	NULL
defects	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
handwriting	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
practice	NULL
being	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
severe	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
often	NULL
carried	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
at	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Garth	NULL
's	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
Mary	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
fortnight	NULL
Mary	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
staying	NULL
at	NULL
Lowick	NULL
Parsonage	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
ladies	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
's	NULL
residence	NULL
in	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
carrying	NULL
out	NULL
some	NULL
parochial	NULL
plans	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Fred	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
seeing	NULL
anything	NULL
more	NULL
agreeable	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
Green	NULL
Dragon	NULL
,	NULL
partly	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
at	NULL
billiards	NULL
,	NULL
partly	NULL
to	NULL
taste	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
flavor	NULL
of	NULL
discourse	NULL
about	NULL
horses	NULL
,	NULL
sport	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
,	NULL
considered	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
strenuously	NULL
correct	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
out	NULL
hunting	NULL
once	NULL
this	NULL
season	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
horse	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
to	NULL
ride	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
from	NULL
place	NULL
to	NULL
place	NULL
chiefly	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Garth	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
gig	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sober	NULL
cob	NULL
which	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Garth	NULL
could	NULL
lend	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
too	NULL
bad	NULL
,	NULL
Fred	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
kept	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
traces	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
severity	NULL
than	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
what	NULL
,	NULL
Mistress	NULL
Mary	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
rather	NULL
harder	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
surveying	NULL
and	NULL
drawing	NULL
plans	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
sermons	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
wishing	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
appreciate	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
through	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
sake	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
Hercules	NULL
and	NULL
Theseus	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
sport	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
learned	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
a	NULL
bookkeeping	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
Mary	NULL
being	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
Fred	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
strong	NULL
dog	NULL
who	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
slip	NULL
his	NULL
collar	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
pulled	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
staple	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
chain	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
escape	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
meaning	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
fast	NULL
or	NULL
far	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
play	NULL
at	NULL
billiards	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
bet	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
to	NULL
money	NULL
just	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
Fred	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
the	NULL
heroic	NULL
project	NULL
of	NULL
saving	NULL
almost	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
eighty	NULL
pounds	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Garth	NULL
offered	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
returning	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
easily	NULL
do	NULL
by	NULL
giving	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
futile	NULL
money-spending	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
superfluous	NULL
stock	NULL
of	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
expense	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
board	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
that	NULL
way	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
go	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
way	NULL
towards	NULL
repaying	NULL
the	NULL
ninety	NULL
pounds	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
deprived	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Garth	NULL
,	NULL
unhappily	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
needed	NULL
that	NULL
sum	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
acknowledged	NULL
that	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
fifth	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
recent	NULL
visits	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
billiard-room	NULL
,	NULL
Fred	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
ten	NULL
pounds	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
reserve	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
half-year	NULL
's	NULL
salary	NULL
(	NULL
having	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
pleasure	NULL
of	NULL
carrying	NULL
thirty	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Garth	NULL
when	NULL
Mary	NULL
was	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
come	NULL
home	NULL
again	NULL
)	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
those	NULL
ten	NULL
pounds	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
fund	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
risk	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
bet	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
?	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
sovereigns	NULL
were	NULL
flying	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
should	NULL
n't	NULL
he	NULL
catch	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
go	NULL
far	NULL
along	NULL
that	NULL
road	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
likes	NULL
to	NULL
assure	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
pleasure	NULL
generally	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
mischief	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
abstains	NULL
from	NULL
making	NULL
himself	NULL
ill	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
beggaring	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
talking	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
looseness	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
narrow	NULL
limits	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
capacity	NULL
will	NULL
allow	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
spooney	NULL
.	NULL

Fred	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
enter	NULL
into	NULL
formal	NULL
reasons	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
artificial	NULL
,	NULL
inexact	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
representing	NULL
the	NULL
tingling	NULL
returns	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
habit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
caprices	NULL
of	NULL
young	NULL
blood	NULL
:	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
lurking	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
prophetic	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
also	NULL
begin	NULL
to	NULL
bet	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
enjoy	NULL
some	NULL
punch-drinking	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
prepare	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
feeling	NULL
"	NULL
rather	NULL
seedy	NULL
"	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
indefinable	NULL
movements	NULL
that	NULL
action	NULL
often	NULL
begins	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
thing	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
entered	NULL
Fred	NULL
's	NULL
expectation	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
brother-in-law	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
quite	NULL
dropped	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
opinion	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
prig	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tremendously	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
superiority	NULL
--	NULL
looking	NULL
excited	NULL
and	NULL
betting	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
himself	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

Fred	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
shock	NULL
greater	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
quite	NULL
account	NULL
for	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
vague	NULL
knowledge	NULL
that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
debt	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
had	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
inclination	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL
was	NULL
suddenly	NULL
checked	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
reversal	NULL
of	NULL
attitudes	NULL
:	NULL
Fred	NULL
's	NULL
blond	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
usually	NULL
bright	NULL
and	NULL
careless	NULL
,	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
anything	NULL
that	NULL
held	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
promise	NULL
of	NULL
amusement	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
involuntarily	NULL
grave	NULL
and	NULL
almost	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
unfitting	NULL
;	NULL
while	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
habitually	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
self-possessed	NULL
strength	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
meditativeness	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
lie	NULL
behind	NULL
his	NULL
most	NULL
observant	NULL
attention	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
acting	NULL
,	NULL
watching	NULL
,	NULL
speaking	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
excited	NULL
narrow	NULL
consciousness	NULL
which	NULL
reminds	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
animal	NULL
with	NULL
fierce	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
retractile	NULL
claws	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
betting	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
strokes	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
won	NULL
sixteen	NULL
pounds	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
young	NULL
Hawley	NULL
's	NULL
arrival	NULL
had	NULL
changed	NULL
the	NULL
poise	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
first-rate	NULL
strokes	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
bet	NULL
against	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
strokes	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
strain	NULL
of	NULL
whose	NULL
nerves	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
changed	NULL
from	NULL
simple	NULL
confidence	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
movements	NULL
to	NULL
defying	NULL
another	NULL
person	NULL
's	NULL
doubt	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
defiance	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
exciting	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
confidence	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
sure	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
bet	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
play	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
began	NULL
often	NULL
to	NULL
fail	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
utterly	NULL
narrowed	NULL
into	NULL
that	NULL
precipitous	NULL
crevice	NULL
of	NULL
play	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
ignorant	NULL
lounger	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

Fred	NULL
observed	NULL
that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
losing	NULL
fast	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
situation	NULL
of	NULL
puzzling	NULL
his	NULL
brains	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
device	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
being	NULL
offensive	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
withdraw	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
attention	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
suggest	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
quitting	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
others	NULL
were	NULL
observing	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
strange	NULL
unlikeness	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
merely	NULL
to	NULL
touch	NULL
his	NULL
elbow	NULL
and	NULL
call	NULL
him	NULL
aside	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
might	NULL
rouse	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
absorption	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
cleverer	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
daring	NULL
improbability	NULL
of	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Rosy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
this	NULL
evening	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
desperately	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
out	NULL
this	NULL
weak	NULL
device	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
waiter	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
message	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
was	NULL
below	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
begged	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Fred	NULL
was	NULL
surprised	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
comfortably	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
sending	NULL
word	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
down	NULL
immediately	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
impulse	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Can	NULL
I	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

and	NULL
drew	NULL
him	NULL
aside	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
has	NULL
just	NULL
sent	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
message	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wants	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
below	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
might	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Fred	NULL
had	NULL
simply	NULL
snatched	NULL
up	NULL
this	NULL
pretext	NULL
for	NULL
speaking	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
are	NULL
losing	NULL

Now	NULL
is	NULL
there	NULL
civil	NULL

within	NULL

Resolve	NULL

Happily	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
ended	NULL
by	NULL
losing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
billiard-room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
brought	NULL
away	NULL
no	NULL
encouragement	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
raid	NULL
on	NULL
luck	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
unmixed	NULL
disgust	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
four	NULL
or	NULL
five	NULL
pounds	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
above	NULL
his	NULL
gains	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
carried	NULL
about	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
vision	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
figure	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
rubbing	NULL
elbows	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Green	NULL
Dragon	NULL
but	NULL
behaving	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
philosopher	NULL
fallen	NULL
to	NULL
betting	NULL
is	NULL
hardly	NULL
distinguishable	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
Philistine	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
circumstances	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
will	NULL
chiefly	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
subsequent	NULL
reflections	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
chewed	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
cud	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
reason	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
magnified	NULL
into	NULL
ruin	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
scenery	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
gambling-house	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
into	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
chance	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
clutched	NULL
with	NULL
both	NULL
hands	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
picked	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
thumb	NULL
and	NULL
fore-finger	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
reason	NULL
strangled	NULL
the	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
gamble	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
remained	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
assurance	NULL
of	NULL
luck	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
needful	NULL
amount	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
gamble	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
alternative	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
urge	NULL
itself	NULL
as	NULL
inevitable	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
alternative	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
apply	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
times	NULL
boasted	NULL
both	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
others	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
totally	NULL
independent	NULL
of	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
whose	NULL
plans	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lent	NULL
himself	NULL
solely	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
enabled	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
ideas	NULL
of	NULL
professional	NULL
work	NULL
and	NULL
public	NULL
benefit	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
constantly	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
personal	NULL
intercourse	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
pride	NULL
sustained	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
social	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
predominating	NULL
banker	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
opinions	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
contemptible	NULL
and	NULL
whose	NULL
motives	NULL
often	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
absurd	NULL
mixture	NULL
of	NULL
contradictory	NULL
impressions	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
creating	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
strong	NULL

proffering	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
considerable	NULL
request	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
early	NULL
in	NULL
March	NULL
his	NULL
affairs	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
pass	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
men	NULL
begin	NULL

perceive	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

they	NULL
had	NULL
called	NULL
impossible	NULL

them	NULL
is	NULL
becoming	NULL
manifestly	NULL
possible	NULL

With	NULL

be	NULL
put	NULL

with	NULL

absorbed	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
hopeless	NULL

continually	NULL
haunting	NULL
him	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
inevitably	NULL
bend	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
help	NULL
from	NULL
somebody	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
considered	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
on	NULL
questioning	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
suspected	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
applied	NULL
twice	NULL
to	NULL

father	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
time	NULL
being	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
disappointment	NULL
from	NULL
Sir	NULL
Godwin	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
papa	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
must	NULL
look	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Papa	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL

with	NULL
one	NULL
bad	NULL
year	NULL
after	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
trade	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
on	NULL
borrowed	NULL
capital	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
many	NULL
indulgences	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
spare	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
hundred	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
charges	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
let	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
ask	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
glove	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
himself	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
end	NULL
by	NULL
asking	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
free	NULL
loan	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
relations	NULL
with	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
than	NULL
with	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
shape	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
claim	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
purely	NULL
personal	NULL
.	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL
had	NULL
indirectly	NULL
helped	NULL
to	NULL
cause	NULL
the	NULL
failure	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
practice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
also	NULL
been	NULL
highly	NULL
gratified	NULL
by	NULL
getting	NULL
a	NULL
medical	NULL
partner	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
plans	NULL
:	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
who	NULL
among	NULL
us	NULL
ever	NULL
reduced	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
dependence	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
now	NULL
stood	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
claims	NULL
which	NULL
diminished	NULL
the	NULL
humiliation	NULL
of	NULL
asking	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
languor	NULL
of	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
Hospital	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
health	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
worse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
showed	NULL
signs	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
deep-seated	NULL
nervous	NULL
affection	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
other	NULL
respects	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
appear	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
changed	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
highly	NULL
polite	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
observed	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
a	NULL
marked	NULL
coldness	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
marriage	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
private	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
coldness	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
hitherto	NULL
preferred	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
warmth	NULL
of	NULL
familiarity	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
deferred	NULL
the	NULL
intention	NULL
from	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
acting	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
conclusions	NULL
being	NULL
made	NULL
infirm	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
repugnance	NULL
to	NULL
every	NULL
possible	NULL
conclusion	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
consequent	NULL
act	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
often	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
any	NULL
occasion	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
private	NULL
purpose	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
one	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
write	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
:	NULL
I	NULL
prefer	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
circuitous	NULL

"	NULL
at	NULL
another	NULL

thought	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
No	NULL

if	NULL
I	NULL
were	NULL
talking	NULL

him	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL

retreat	NULL

Still	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
passed	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
letter	NULL
was	NULL
written	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
special	NULL
interview	NULL
sought	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
his	NULL
shrinking	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
humiliation	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
dependent	NULL
attitude	NULL
towards	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
familiarize	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
with	NULL
another	NULL
step	NULL
even	NULL
more	NULL
unlike	NULL
his	NULL
remembered	NULL
self	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
began	NULL
spontaneously	NULL
to	NULL
consider	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
puerile	NULL
notion	NULL
of	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
angry	NULL
,	NULL
namely	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
quit	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
without	NULL
seeing	NULL
anything	NULL
beyond	NULL
that	NULL
preface	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
question	NULL
came	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Would	NULL
any	NULL
man	NULL
buy	NULL
the	NULL
practice	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
even	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
as	NULL
little	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
worth	NULL
?	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
sale	NULL
might	NULL
happen	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
necessary	NULL
preparation	NULL
for	NULL
going	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
taking	NULL
this	NULL
step	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
still	NULL
felt	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
contemptible	NULL
relinquishment	NULL
of	NULL
present	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
guilty	NULL
turning	NULL
aside	NULL
from	NULL
what	NULL

might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
widening	NULL

start	NULL
again	NULL

And	NULL
afterwards	NULL
?	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
lodging	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
largest	NULL
city	NULL

most	NULL
distant	NULL
town	NULL

would	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL

could	NULL
save	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
save	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL

plunged	NULL
her	NULL

it	NULL

For	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL

in	NULL

came	NULL
to	NULL
decide	NULL
him	NULL

A	NULL
note	NULL
from	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
requested	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Bank	NULL

hypochondriacal	NULL

shown	NULL
itself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
banker	NULL

constitution	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
lack	NULL

was	NULL
really	NULL

had	NULL
been	NULL
dwelt	NULL

him	NULL

wanted	NULL

when	NULL
Raffles	NULL
had	NULL
recognized	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL

On	NULL
Christmas	NULL
Eve	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
reappeared	NULL
at	NULL
The	NULL
Shrubs	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL

and	NULL
hinder	NULL
his	NULL
communication	NULL
with	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL

circumstances	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
visit	NULL
from	NULL
compromising	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
alarming	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

Raffles	NULL
proved	NULL
more	NULL
unmanageable	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
shown	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
former	NULL
appearances	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
chronic	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mental	NULL
restlessness	NULL

the	NULL

effect	NULL
of	NULL
habitual	NULL

,	NULL
quickly	NULL
shaking	NULL
off	NULL
every	NULL
impression	NULL
from	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
staying	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
weighing	NULL
two	NULL
sets	NULL
of	NULL
evils	NULL
,	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
worse	NULL
alternative	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
going	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
kept	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
room	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
Raffles	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
amusing	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
annoyance	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
causing	NULL
this	NULL
decent	NULL
and	NULL
highly	NULL
prosperous	NULL
fellow-sinner	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
amusement	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
facetiously	NULL
expressed	NULL
as	NULL
sympathy	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
friend	NULL
's	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
entertaining	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
serviceable	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
earnings	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
cunning	NULL
calculation	NULL
under	NULL
this	NULL
noisy	NULL
joking	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
cool	NULL
resolve	NULL
to	NULL
extract	NULL
something	NULL
the	NULL
handsomer	NULL
from	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
as	NULL
payment	NULL
for	NULL
release	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
new	NULL
application	NULL
of	NULL
torture	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
cunning	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
overcast	NULL
its	NULL
mark	NULL
.	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL
was	NULL
indeed	NULL
more	NULL
tortured	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
coarse	NULL
fibre	NULL
of	NULL
Raffles	NULL
could	NULL
enable	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
simply	NULL
taking	NULL
care	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
wretched	NULL
creature	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
victim	NULL
of	NULL
vice	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
might	NULL
otherwise	NULL
injure	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
implied	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
direct	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
falsehood	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
tie	NULL
which	NULL
bound	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
care	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
signs	NULL
of	NULL
mental	NULL
alienation	NULL
in	NULL
Raffles	NULL
which	NULL
urged	NULL
caution	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
himself	NULL
drive	NULL
the	NULL
unfortunate	NULL
being	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
these	NULL
hints	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
supplying	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
with	NULL
precautionary	NULL
information	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
daughters	NULL
and	NULL
servants	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
accounting	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
allowing	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
but	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
even	NULL
with	NULL
food	NULL
and	NULL
drink	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
agony	NULL
of	NULL
fear	NULL
lest	NULL
Raffles	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
overheard	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
loud	NULL
and	NULL
plain	NULL
references	NULL
to	NULL
past	NULL
facts	NULL
--	NULL
lest	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
even	NULL
tempted	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
hinder	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
betray	NULL
his	NULL
terror	NULL
by	NULL
opening	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
to	NULL
detect	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
honest	NULL
direct	NULL
habits	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
little	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
so	NULL
low	NULL
a	NULL
course	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
arrive	NULL
at	NULL
painful	NULL
knowledge	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
fear	NULL
was	NULL
stronger	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
calculation	NULL
of	NULL
probabilities	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
Raffles	NULL
had	NULL
pushed	NULL
the	NULL
torture	NULL
too	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
produced	NULL
an	NULL
effect	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
plan	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
showing	NULL
himself	NULL
hopelessly	NULL
unmanageable	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
defiance	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
resource	NULL
left	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
taking	NULL
Raffles	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
the	NULL
banker	NULL
ordered	NULL
his	NULL
closed	NULL
carriage	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
ready	NULL
at	NULL
half-past	NULL
seven	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
six	NULL
o'clock	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
been	NULL
long	NULL
dressed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wretchedness	NULL
in	NULL
prayer	NULL
,	NULL
pleading	NULL
his	NULL
motives	NULL
for	NULL
averting	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
evil	NULL
if	NULL
in	NULL
anything	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
used	NULL
falsity	NULL
and	NULL
spoken	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
true	NULL
before	NULL
God	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
shrank	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
direct	NULL
lie	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
intensity	NULL
disproportionate	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
more	NULL
indirect	NULL
misdeeds	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
misdeeds	NULL
were	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
subtle	NULL
muscular	NULL
movements	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
taken	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
consciousness	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
bring	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
fix	NULL
our	NULL
mind	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL
desire	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
what	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
vividly	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
can	NULL
vividly	NULL
imagine	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
by	NULL
Omniscience	NULL
.	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL
carried	NULL
his	NULL
candle	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bedside	NULL
of	NULL
Raffles	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
apparently	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
painful	NULL
dream	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
hoping	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
would	NULL
serve	NULL
to	NULL
waken	NULL
the	NULL
sleeper	NULL
gradually	NULL
and	NULL
gently	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
feared	NULL
some	NULL
noise	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
consequence	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
too	NULL
sudden	NULL
awakening	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
watched	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
minutes	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
the	NULL
shudderings	NULL
and	NULL
pantings	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
end	NULL
in	NULL
waking	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Raffles	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
half-stifled	NULL
moan	NULL
,	NULL
started	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
stared	NULL
round	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
terror	NULL
,	NULL
trembling	NULL
and	NULL
gasping	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
noise	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
setting	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
candle	NULL
,	NULL
awaited	NULL
his	NULL
recovery	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
later	NULL
before	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
peremptoriness	NULL
of	NULL
manner	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
before	NULL
shown	NULL

The	NULL

imagined	NULL

a	NULL

were	NULL
not	NULL

a	NULL

their	NULL
master	NULL

who	NULL
held	NULL
his	NULL

high	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

should	NULL
be	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
cousin	NULL
and	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
banker	NULL
's	NULL
drive	NULL
of	NULL
ten	NULL
miles	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hated	NULL
companion	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dreary	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Christmas	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
drive	NULL
,	NULL
Raffles	NULL
had	NULL
recovered	NULL
his	NULL
spirits	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
parted	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
contentment	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
reason	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
banker	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

Various	NULL
motives	NULL
urged	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
open-handedness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
himself	NULL
inquire	NULL
closely	NULL
into	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
stood	NULL
watching	NULL
Raffles	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
uneasy	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
certainly	NULL
entered	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
much	NULL
shattered	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
gift	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
hundred	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
care	NULL
to	NULL
repeat	NULL
the	NULL
incisive	NULL
statement	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
resolve	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
played	NULL
on	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
penetrate	NULL
Raffles	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
shown	NULL
the	NULL
risks	NULL
of	NULL
bribing	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
quite	NULL
equal	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
risks	NULL
of	NULL
defying	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
freed	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
repulsive	NULL
presence	NULL
,	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
quiet	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
brought	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
confidence	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
secured	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
respite	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
loathsome	NULL
dream	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
shake	NULL
off	NULL
its	NULL
images	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
hateful	NULL
kindred	NULL
of	NULL
sensations	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
on	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
pleasant	NULL
surroundings	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
a	NULL
dangerous	NULL
reptile	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
his	NULL
slimy	NULL
traces	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
can	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
most	NULL
inward	NULL
life	NULL
is	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
thoughts	NULL
he	NULL
believes	NULL
other	NULL
men	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
that	NULL
fabric	NULL
of	NULL
opinion	NULL
is	NULL
threatened	NULL
with	NULL
ruin	NULL
?	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
deposit	NULL
of	NULL
uneasy	NULL
presentiment	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
carefully	NULL
avoided	NULL
any	NULL
allusion	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
used	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
taste	NULL
the	NULL
flavor	NULL
of	NULL
supremacy	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tribute	NULL
of	NULL
complete	NULL
deference	NULL
:	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
certainty	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
watched	NULL
or	NULL
measured	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
hidden	NULL
suspicion	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
having	NULL
some	NULL
discreditable	NULL
secret	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
totter	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
speaking	NULL
to	NULL
edification	NULL
.	NULL

Foreseeing	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
's	NULL
anxious	NULL
temperament	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
often	NULL
worse	NULL
than	NULL
seeing	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
continually	NULL
heightened	NULL
the	NULL
anguish	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
imminent	NULL
disgrace	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
imminent	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
defiance	NULL
of	NULL
Raffles	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
keep	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
away	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
prayed	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
result	NULL
he	NULL
hardly	NULL
hoped	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
disgrace	NULL
was	NULL
certain	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
vain	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
permitted	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
divine	NULL
visitation	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
chastisement	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
preparation	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
recoiled	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
imagined	NULL
burning	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
judged	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Divine	NULL
glory	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
escape	NULL
dishonor	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
recoil	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
urged	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
preparations	NULL
for	NULL
quitting	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
evil	NULL
truth	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
reported	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
then	NULL
be	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
less	NULL
scorching	NULL
distance	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
contempt	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
neighbors	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
scene	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
gathered	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
wide	NULL
sensibility	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
tormentor	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
pursued	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
less	NULL
formidable	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
finally	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
be	NULL
extremely	NULL
painful	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
other	NULL
grounds	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
preferred	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
struck	NULL
root	NULL
.	NULL

Hence	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
preparations	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
conditional	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
wishing	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
on	NULL
all	NULL
sides	NULL
an	NULL
opening	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
return	NULL
after	NULL
brief	NULL
absence	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
any	NULL
favorable	NULL
intervention	NULL
of	NULL
Providence	NULL
should	NULL
dissipate	NULL
his	NULL
fears	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
preparing	NULL
to	NULL
transfer	NULL
his	NULL
management	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Bank	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
any	NULL
active	NULL
control	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
commercial	NULL
affairs	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
neighborhood	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
failing	NULL
health	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
without	NULL
excluding	NULL
his	NULL
future	NULL
resumption	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
measure	NULL
would	NULL
cause	NULL
him	NULL
some	NULL
added	NULL
expense	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
diminution	NULL
of	NULL
income	NULL
beyond	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
undergone	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
depression	NULL
of	NULL
trade	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Hospital	NULL
presented	NULL
itself	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
principal	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
outlay	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
fairly	NULL
economize	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
experience	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
determined	NULL
his	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
his	NULL
arrangements	NULL
had	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
gone	NULL
no	NULL
farther	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
stage	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
recall	NULL
them	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
proved	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
unnecessary	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
continually	NULL
deferred	NULL
the	NULL
final	NULL
steps	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fears	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
many	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
danger	NULL
of	NULL
shipwreck	NULL
or	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
dashed	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
carriage	NULL
by	NULL
runaway	NULL
horses	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
clinging	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
would	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
hinder	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
spoil	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
late	NULL
transplantation	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
over-hasty	NULL
--	NULL
especially	NULL
since	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
account	NULL
satisfactorily	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
project	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
indefinite	NULL
exile	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
place	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
.	NULL

Among	NULL
the	NULL
affairs	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
management	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
farm	NULL
at	NULL
Stone	NULL
Court	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
absence	NULL

and	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
on	NULL
all	NULL
other	NULL
matters	NULL
connected	NULL
with	NULL
any	NULL
houses	NULL
and	NULL
land	NULL
he	NULL
possessed	NULL
in	NULL
or	NULL
about	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
consulted	NULL
Caleb	NULL
Garth	NULL
.	NULL

Like	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
business	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
agent	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
anxious	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
employer	NULL
's	NULL
interests	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
regard	NULL
to	NULL
Stone	NULL
Court	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
retain	NULL
his	NULL
hold	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stock	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
arrangement	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL

if	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
,	NULL
resume	NULL
his	NULL
favorite	NULL
recreation	NULL
of	NULL
superintendence	NULL

Caleb	NULL
had	NULL
advised	NULL
him	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
trust	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
bailiff	NULL

but	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL

and	NULL
implements	NULL
yearly	NULL

and	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
proportionate	NULL
share	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
proceeds	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
May	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
consider	NULL
Fred	NULL
Vincy	NULL
's	NULL
future	NULL

Mr.	NULL

always	NULL
fearing	NULL
an	NULL

for	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
older	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
on	NULL
quitting	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
conversation	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
alluring	NULL
idea	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
this	NULL

of	NULL

What	NULL
if	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
would	NULL
agree	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
placing	NULL
Fred	NULL
Vincy	NULL
there	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
understanding	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL

Caleb	NULL

should	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL

might	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
modest	NULL

there	NULL

still	NULL
have	NULL
time	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
knowledge	NULL
by	NULL
helping	NULL
in	NULL

He	NULL
mentioned	NULL
his	NULL
notion	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Garth	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
evident	NULL
delight	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL

his	NULL
pleasure	NULL
by	NULL
expressing	NULL
her	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL

looking	NULL
radiant	NULL

His	NULL

it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL

it	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

My	NULL

said	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
wincing	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL

which	NULL
were	NULL

That	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
's	NULL
remonstrance	NULL
subsided	NULL
into	NULL
pity	NULL
for	NULL
poor	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
extravagant	NULL
education	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
foreseen	NULL
the	NULL
fruits	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
remembering	NULL
that	NULL
dialogue	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
fully	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
plan	NULL
of	NULL
quitting	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
arrangement	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
nephew	NULL
Fred	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
present	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
merely	NULL
mentioned	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
shutting	NULL
up	NULL
The	NULL
Shrubs	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
months	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Southern	NULL
Coast	NULL
.	NULL

Hence	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Garth	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
assurance	NULL
he	NULL
desired	NULL
,	NULL
namely	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
's	NULL
departure	NULL
from	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
indefinite	NULL
time	NULL

Fred	NULL
Vincy	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
tenancy	NULL
of	NULL
Stone	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
terms	NULL
proposed	NULL
.	NULL

Caleb	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
elated	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
"	NULL
neat	NULL
turn	NULL
"	NULL
being	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
self-control	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
braced	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
affectionate	NULL
wifely	NULL
scolding	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
betrayed	NULL
everything	NULL
to	NULL
Mary	NULL
,	NULL
wanting	NULL
"	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
comfort	NULL

"	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
restrained	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
kept	NULL
in	NULL
strict	NULL
privacy	NULL
from	NULL
Fred	NULL
certain	NULL
visits	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
to	NULL

stock	NULL

take	NULL
a	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
more	NULL
eager	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL

the	NULL
probable	NULL

him	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
stimulated	NULL

this	NULL

the	NULL

to	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

agreed	NULL

that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL

no	NULL

a	NULL

In	NULL

Lydgate	NULL

bowed	NULL
slightly	NULL

just	NULL
before	NULL

This	NULL

came	NULL
from	NULL

kept	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

regard	NULL
him	NULL

the	NULL

He	NULL

they	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
before	NULL
entered	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
prospects	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL

imagine	NULL
how	NULL
two	NULL
creatures	NULL

loved	NULL
each	NULL

had	NULL
a	NULL
stock	NULL

afford	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
glimpse	NULL

that	NULL

golden	NULL
age	NULL

in	NULL
poor	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
room	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
luxuries	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
small	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
down	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
horse	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
sad	NULL
mood	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
expecting	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
cheered	NULL
except	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
reflecting	NULL
that	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
closed	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
wise	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
Rosamond	NULL

his	NULL
application	NULL

its	NULL
failure	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL

his	NULL
dinner	NULL
waited	NULL

eat	NULL
it	NULL

For	NULL
on	NULL
entering	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
Dover	NULL

had	NULL
already	NULL
put	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

when	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
where	NULL
Mrs.	NULL

was	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
told	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL

bedroom	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
stretched	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL

silent	NULL

without	NULL
an	NULL

even	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
leaning	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
said	NULL
with	NULL
almost	NULL
a	NULL
cry	NULL

about	NULL

since	NULL
Raffles	NULL

no	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL
gathered	NULL
a	NULL

At	NULL

what	NULL

The	NULL

come	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL

the	NULL
sight	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
up	NULL

ordering	NULL

that	NULL

sleepless	NULL

still	NULL
quailing	NULL

the	NULL

he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
concentrate	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
terror	NULL
on	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL

imploringly	NULL
deprecating	NULL
his	NULL
anger	NULL

a	NULL

in-the	NULL
morning	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL
's	NULL
native	NULL
imperiousness	NULL

served	NULL
him	NULL
well	NULL

This	NULL
delicate-looking	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
himself	NULL
nervously	NULL
perturbed	NULL
,	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
needed	NULL
stimulus	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
strenuous	NULL
circumstances	NULL

and	NULL
through	NULL
that	NULL
difficult	NULL
night	NULL

morning	NULL

while	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL

holding	NULL
the	NULL
mastery	NULL
by	NULL
its	NULL

impassibility	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
intensely	NULL
at	NULL
work	NULL

what	NULL

guard	NULL

what	NULL

security	NULL

Whatever	NULL

he	NULL
might	NULL
lift	NULL
up	NULL

whatever	NULL
statements	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
inwardly	NULL
make	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
wretched	NULL
spiritual	NULL
condition	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
duty	NULL
he	NULL
himself	NULL
was	NULL
under	NULL

submit	NULL

the	NULL
punishment	NULL
divinely	NULL
appointed	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
rather	NULL

wish	NULL

another	NULL

through	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
effort	NULL

condense	NULL
words	NULL

a	NULL
solid	NULL
mental	NULL
state	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
pierced	NULL
and	NULL
spread	NULL
with	NULL
irresistible	NULL
vividness	NULL
the	NULL
images	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
events	NULL
he	NULL
desired	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
images	NULL
came	NULL
their	NULL
apology	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
but	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
Raffles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
deliverance	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
removal	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
wretched	NULL
creature	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
impenitent	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
public	NULL
criminals	NULL
impenitent	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
yet	NULL
the	NULL
law	NULL
decided	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
fate	NULL
.	NULL

Should	NULL
Providence	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
case	NULL
award	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
sin	NULL
in	NULL
contemplating	NULL
death	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
desirable	NULL
issue	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
from	NULL
hastening	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
scrupulously	NULL
did	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
prescribed	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
here	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
mistake	NULL
:	NULL
human	NULL
prescriptions	NULL
were	NULL
fallible	NULL
things	NULL
:	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
treatment	NULL
had	NULL
hastened	NULL
death	NULL

--	NULL
why	NULL
not	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
method	NULL

treatment	NULL

But	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
intention	NULL
was	NULL
everything	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
right	NULL

wrong	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
set	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
his	NULL
intention	NULL
separate	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
desire	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
inwardly	NULL
declared	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
intended	NULL
to	NULL
obey	NULL
orders	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
should	NULL
he	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
any	NULL
argument	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
validity	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
orders	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
common	NULL
trick	NULL
of	NULL
desire	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
avails	NULL
itself	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
irrelevant	NULL
scepticism	NULL
,	NULL
finding	NULL
larger	NULL
room	NULL
for	NULL
itself	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
uncertainty	NULL
about	NULL
effects	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
obscurity	NULL
that	NULL
looks	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
absence	NULL
of	NULL
law	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
obey	NULL
the	NULL
orders	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
anxieties	NULL
continually	NULL
glanced	NULL
towards	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
remembrance	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
place	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
before	NULL
was	NULL
accompanied	NULL
with	NULL
sensibilities	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
roused	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
actual	NULL
scene	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
then	NULL
cared	NULL
but	NULL
little	NULL
about	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
painful	NULL
impressions	NULL
with	NULL
regard	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
suggested	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Hospital	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
disposition	NULL
towards	NULL
himself	NULL
which	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
justifiable	NULL
refusal	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
exorbitant	NULL
request	NULL
might	NULL
call	NULL
forth	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
recurred	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
now	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
perception	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
probably	NULL
made	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
his	NULL
enemy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
awakened	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
propitiate	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
to	NULL
create	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
personal	NULL
obligation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
regretted	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
made	NULL
even	NULL
an	NULL
unreasonable	NULL
money-sacrifice	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
suspicions	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
knowledge	NULL
gathered	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
raving	NULL
of	NULL
Raffles	NULL
,	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
defence	NULL
in	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
by	NULL
having	NULL
conferred	NULL
a	NULL
momentous	NULL
benefit	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
regret	NULL
had	NULL
perhaps	NULL
come	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL
.	NULL

Strange	NULL
,	NULL
piteous	NULL
conflict	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
unhappy	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
longed	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
--	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
his	NULL
selfish	NULL
passions	NULL
into	NULL
discipline	NULL
and	NULL
clad	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
severe	NULL
robes	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
walked	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
devout	NULL
choir	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
terror	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
chant	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
threw	NULL
out	NULL
their	NULL
common	NULL
cries	NULL
for	NULL
safety	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
arrived	NULL

Contrary	NULL

Lydgate	NULL

looking	NULL
at	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
abrupt	NULL
question	NULL

which	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
uneasy	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

governing	NULL

with	NULL

"	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

You	NULL
have	NULL
some	NULL

instructions	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
chief	NULL
new	NULL
instruction	NULL
that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
administration	NULL

extremely	NULL
moderate	NULL

opium	NULL

in	NULL
case	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
precaution	NULL
of	NULL
bringing	NULL
opium	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
minute	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL

the	NULL
doses	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL

should	NULL

He	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
risk	NULL

not	NULL
ceasing	NULL
;	NULL

repeated	NULL
his	NULL
order	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
alcohol	NULL

be	NULL
given	NULL

From	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL

,	NULL
and	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
caring	NULL
for	NULL
earthly	NULL
consequences	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wished	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
begged	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
again	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
deliver	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
opinion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
Raffles	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
less	NULL
hopeful	NULL
state	NULL
.	NULL

Should	NULL
he	NULL
send	NULL
for	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
?	NULL

If	NULL
Raffles	NULL
were	NULL
really	NULL
getting	NULL
worse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
slowly	NULL
dying	NULL
,	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
sleep	NULL
in	NULL
gratitude	NULL
to	NULL
Providence	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
worse	NULL
?	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
might	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
simply	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
predict	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
by-and-by	NULL
fall	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
sending	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL
shrank	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
result	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
ideas	NULL
or	NULL
opinions	NULL
could	NULL
hinder	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
seeing	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
probability	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Raffles	NULL
recovered	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
man	NULL
as	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
strength	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
tormentor	NULL
renewed	NULL
,	NULL
obliging	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
drag	NULL
away	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
her	NULL
years	NULL
apart	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
and	NULL
native	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
carrying	NULL
an	NULL
alienating	NULL
suspicion	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
sat	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
conflict	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
firelight	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
thought	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
rise	NULL
and	NULL
light	NULL
the	NULL
bed-candle	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
thought	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
told	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Abel	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
doses	NULL
of	NULL
opium	NULL
must	NULL
cease	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
candlestick	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
stood	NULL
motionless	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
while	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
might	NULL
already	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
prescribed	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
excusable	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
forget	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
order	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
present	NULL
wearied	NULL
condition	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
up-stairs	NULL
,	NULL
candle	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
knowing	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
straightway	NULL
enter	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
turn	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
patient	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
rectify	NULL
his	NULL
omission	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
paused	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
turned	NULL
towards	NULL
Raffles	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL
him	NULL
moaning	NULL
and	NULL
murmuring	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
asleep	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
could	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
prescription	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
disobeyed	NULL
than	NULL
followed	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
no	NULL
sleep	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
quite	NULL
undressed	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Abel	NULL
rapped	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
opened	NULL
it	NULL
an	NULL
inch	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL

low	NULL

To	NULL
her	NULL

Mr.	NULL

did	NULL

A	NULL
struggle	NULL

again	NULL
Mr.	NULL

Early	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
--	NULL
about	NULL
six	NULL
--	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
rose	NULL
and	NULL
spent	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
prayer	NULL

Does	NULL
any	NULL

Private	NULL
prayer	NULL

inaudible	NULL

and	NULL

is	NULL
representative	NULL

himself	NULL
just	NULL

even	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
unravelled	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
confused	NULL
promptings	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
four-and-twenty	NULL
hours	NULL

He	NULL
listened	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL
hard	NULL
stertorous	NULL
breathing	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
rime	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
re-entered	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

he	NULL
felt	NULL
startled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Abel	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL

with	NULL
an	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
off	NULL

Would	NULL
you	NULL
please	NULL

"	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Raffles	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sleep	NULL
which	NULL
brings	NULL
revival	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sleep	NULL
which	NULL
streams	NULL
deeper	NULL
and	NULL
deeper	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
gulf	NULL
of	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
bottle	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
brandy	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
almost	NULL
empty	NULL
opium	NULL
phial	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
phial	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
sight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
carried	NULL
the	NULL
brandy-bottle	NULL
down-stairs	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
locking	NULL
it	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wine-cooler	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
breakfasting	NULL
he	NULL
considered	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
ride	NULL
to	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
wait	NULL
for	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
arrival	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
decided	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Abel	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
go	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
watch	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bed-chamber	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
there	NULL
and	NULL
beheld	NULL
the	NULL
enemy	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
peace	NULL
going	NULL
irrevocably	NULL
into	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
more	NULL
at	NULL
rest	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
months	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
conscience	NULL
was	NULL
soothed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
enfolding	NULL
wing	NULL
of	NULL
secrecy	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
angel	NULL
sent	NULL
down	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
drew	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
pocket-book	NULL
to	NULL
review	NULL
various	NULL
memoranda	NULL
there	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
arrangements	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
projected	NULL
and	NULL
partly	NULL
carried	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
quitting	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
considered	NULL
how	NULL
far	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
let	NULL
them	NULL
stand	NULL
or	NULL
recall	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
absence	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
brief	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
economies	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
desirable	NULL
might	NULL
still	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
suitable	NULL
occasion	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
temporary	NULL
withdrawal	NULL
from	NULL
management	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
hoped	NULL
still	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
share	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
expenses	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Hospital	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
that	NULL
way	NULL
the	NULL
moments	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
stertorous	NULL
breathing	NULL
was	NULL
marked	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
his	NULL
attention	NULL
wholly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
forced	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
departing	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
been	NULL
subservient	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
been	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
base	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
act	NULL
on	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
gladness	NULL
then	NULL
which	NULL
impelled	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
glad	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
Raffles	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
hastened	NULL
?	NULL

Who	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
saved	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
half-past	NULL
ten	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
witness	NULL
the	NULL
final	NULL
pause	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
breath	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
observed	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
expression	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
surprise	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
recognition	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
judged	NULL
correctly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
turned	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
dying	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
subdued	NULL
activity	NULL
of	NULL
expression	NULL
which	NULL
showed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
carrying	NULL
on	NULL
an	NULL
inward	NULL
debate	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
When	NULL
did	NULL
this	NULL
change	NULL
begin	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
watch	NULL
by	NULL
him	NULL
last	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
over-worn	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
under	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Abel	NULL
's	NULL
care	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
sank	NULL
into	NULL
sleep	NULL
between	NULL
three	NULL
and	NULL
four	NULL
o'clock	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
before	NULL
eight	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
condition	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
ask	NULL
another	NULL
question	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
watched	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

This	NULL
morning	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
recovered	NULL
hope	NULL
and	NULL
freedom	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
set	NULL
out	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
animation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
strong	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
deficiencies	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
married	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
benefactor	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
uneasy	NULL
about	NULL
this	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
expected	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
terminate	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
he	NULL
hardly	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
to	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
without	NULL
appearing	NULL
to	NULL
insult	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
examined	NULL
the	NULL
housekeeper	NULL
--	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
use	NULL
in	NULL
implying	NULL
that	NULL
somebody	NULL
's	NULL
ignorance	NULL
or	NULL
imprudence	NULL
had	NULL
killed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
himself	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
wrong	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
and	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
rode	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
talking	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL

On	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
visit	NULL
from	NULL
Mr.	NULL

The	NULL

had	NULL
not	NULL

in	NULL

the	NULL
news	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
execution	NULL
in	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
Lowick	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL

having	NULL
been	NULL
carried	NULL
by	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Spicer	NULL

who	NULL

it	NULL
from	NULL

with	NULL
Fred	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
's	NULL
thoughts	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
rather	NULL
gloomy	NULL
.	NULL

Playing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Green	NULL
Dragon	NULL
once	NULL
or	NULL
oftener	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
trifle	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
man	NULL

but	NULL
in	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
several	NULL
signs	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
unlike	NULL
his	NULL
former	NULL
self	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
things	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
formerly	NULL
even	NULL
an	NULL
excessive	NULL
scorn	NULL
.	NULL

Whatever	NULL
certain	NULL
dissatisfactions	NULL
in	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
some	NULL
silly	NULL
tinklings	NULL
of	NULL
gossip	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
hints	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
change	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
felt	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
chiefly	NULL
connected	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
debts	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
being	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
distinctly	NULL
reported	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
fear	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
notion	NULL
of	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
having	NULL
resources	NULL
or	NULL
friends	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
background	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
quite	NULL
illusory	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rebuff	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
win	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
confidence	NULL

disinclined	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL

but	NULL
this	NULL
news	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
execution	NULL
being	NULL
actually	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
determined	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
to	NULL
overcome	NULL
his	NULL
reluctance	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
dismissed	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
patient	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
interested	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
open	NULL
cheerfulness	NULL
which	NULL
surprised	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
.	NULL

Could	NULL
this	NULL
too	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
proud	NULL
rejection	NULL
of	NULL

help	NULL

Never	NULL
mind	NULL

the	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL

Lydgate	NULL

I	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL

you	NULL

the	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL

only	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
both	NULL
seated	NULL

this	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
answered	NULL
immediately	NULL

I	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL

falling	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL

and	NULL
speaking	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL

Mr.	NULL

silent	NULL

said	NULL
earnestly	NULL

Five	NULL
days	NULL
after	NULL

Mr.	NULL

standing	NULL
at	NULL

the	NULL

archway	NULL
leading	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
yard	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Green	NULL
Dragon	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
just	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL

the	NULL
house	NULL

any	NULL
human	NULL
figure	NULL
standing	NULL
at	NULL

the	NULL
early	NULL

no	NULL

the	NULL

reason	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
probability	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Hopkins	NULL

the	NULL

opposite	NULL

the	NULL
first	NULL

the	NULL
more	NULL

that	NULL

he	NULL
rode	NULL
past	NULL
the	NULL

was	NULL
trusting	NULL

He	NULL

gossip	NULL

spread	NULL
through	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Frank	NULL
Hawley	NULL
followed	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
information	NULL

sending	NULL
a	NULL
clerk	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
trust	NULL
to	NULL
Stone	NULL

on	NULL
a	NULL
pretext	NULL

inquiring	NULL

really	NULL

gather	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
learned	NULL
about	NULL
Raffles	NULL

his	NULL

from	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Abel	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
knowledge	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL

had	NULL
carried	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
Stone	NULL
Court	NULL
in	NULL

gig	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Hawley	NULL
in	NULL
consequence	NULL
took	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL

seeing	NULL
Caleb	NULL

calling	NULL
at	NULL

office	NULL

ask	NULL

Caleb	NULL
was	NULL
betrayed	NULL
into	NULL
no	NULL
word	NULL
injurious	NULL
to	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL

that	NULL

given	NULL
up	NULL

within	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL

Mr	NULL
Hawley	NULL
drew	NULL
his	NULL
inferences	NULL

feeling	NULL
convinced	NULL

told	NULL

that	NULL
Garth	NULL

a	NULL
few	NULL
hours	NULL

Mr.	NULL

The	NULL
statement	NULL

passed	NULL
on	NULL
until	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
quite	NULL
lost	NULL
the	NULL
stamp	NULL

an	NULL
inference	NULL

was	NULL
taken	NULL
as	NULL
information	NULL
coming	NULL
straight	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL

chief	NULL

Mr.	NULL

death	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
himself	NULL
ridden	NULL
to	NULL
Lowick	NULL
village	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
register	NULL

talk	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL

with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
surprised	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
lawyer	NULL
that	NULL
an	NULL
ugly	NULL
secret	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
light	NULL
about	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL

going	NULL
forward	NULL
in	NULL
Mr.	NULL

which	NULL
foreshadowed	NULL

the	NULL

flashed	NULL
the	NULL

resisted	NULL
the	NULL

consciously	NULL

in	NULL
any	NULL

himself	NULL

expressly	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Abel	NULL
in	NULL

that	NULL

clearly	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL

the	NULL

that	NULL
at	NULL

he	NULL

disposition	NULL

moreover	NULL

to	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
unscrupulous	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
absence	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
indisposition	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
easily	NULL
bribed	NULL
as	NULL
other	NULL
haughty-minded	NULL
men	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
found	NULL
themselves	NULL
in	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL

Even	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
given	NULL
merely	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL

his	NULL

about	NULL
the	NULL
scandal	NULL
of	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
's	NULL
earlier	NULL
life	NULL

threw	NULL
an	NULL
odious	NULL
light	NULL
on	NULL
Lydgate	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
been	NULL
sneered	NULL
at	NULL

making	NULL
himself	NULL
subservient	NULL
to	NULL

into	NULL

and	NULL
discrediting	NULL
the	NULL

Hence	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL

any	NULL

Mr.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL

to	NULL

he	NULL
avoided	NULL
saying	NULL

In	NULL
his	NULL

believed	NULL

suspected	NULL

nothing	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
betrayed	NULL

him	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL

history	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL

would	NULL

As	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL

that	NULL
a	NULL

method	NULL

treatment	NULL
would	NULL
either	NULL
save	NULL
or	NULL
kill	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
himself	NULL
was	NULL
constantly	NULL
arguing	NULL
against	NULL
such	NULL
dogmatism	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
every	NULL
motive	NULL
for	NULL
being	NULL
silent	NULL

Hence	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL

had	NULL
strongly	NULL
winced	NULL

who	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL

had	NULL
raised	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
with	NULL
mild	NULL
gravity	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
principal	NULL
townsmen	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
determination	NULL
was	NULL
growing	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL

A	NULL
meeting	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
held	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Town-Hall	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
sanitary	NULL
question	NULL

had	NULL
risen	NULL

pressing	NULL
importance	NULL

the	NULL
occurrence	NULL

case	NULL

Since	NULL
the	NULL
Act	NULL

which	NULL

passed	NULL

there	NULL
had	NULL

preparation	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
concurred	NULL
in	NULL
by	NULL

The	NULL
question	NULL
now	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
whether	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL

ground	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
secured	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
burial-ground	NULL
by	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
assessment	NULL
or	NULL
by	NULL
private	NULL
subscription	NULL

The	NULL
meeting	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
open	NULL

and	NULL
almost	NULL
everybody	NULL
of	NULL
importance	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
was	NULL
expected	NULL

there	NULL

Mr.	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL

just	NULL
before	NULL
twelve	NULL

he	NULL
started	NULL

the	NULL
Bank	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
intention	NULL

Under	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL

kept	NULL

he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL

this	NULL

resume	NULL

expected	NULL

end	NULL

days	NULL

Among	NULL

going	NULL

the	NULL

he	NULL
saw	NULL

entered	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL

after	NULL

took	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

slowly	NULL
rose	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
grasped	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chair	NULL
so	NULL
totteringly	NULL
that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
felt	NULL
sure	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
strength	NULL
enough	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL

away	NULL
without	NULL

What	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
do	NULL

him	NULL
for	NULL

He	NULL
rose	NULL

gave	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
to	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
way	NULL
led	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL

the	NULL

yet	NULL
this	NULL
act	NULL

which	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL

one	NULL

pure	NULL
compassion	NULL

was	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
unspeakably	NULL
bitter	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL

putting	NULL
his	NULL

that	NULL
association	NULL

himself	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL

of	NULL

he	NULL
now	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL

it	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
presented	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL

He	NULL
now	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
conviction	NULL

this	NULL
man	NULL

was	NULL
leaning	NULL
tremblingly	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL

had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
somehow	NULL
the	NULL
treatment	NULL

been	NULL
tampered	NULL

from	NULL
an	NULL

were	NULL
closely	NULL

town	NULL
knew	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
loan	NULL

believed	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
bribe	NULL

believed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
bribe	NULL

Poor	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
struggling	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
terrible	NULL
clutch	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
revelation	NULL

was	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
morally	NULL
forced	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
the	NULL
business	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
meeting	NULL
was	NULL
despatched	NULL

and	NULL
fringed	NULL
off	NULL
into	NULL
eager	NULL
discussion	NULL
among	NULL
various	NULL
groups	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL

Mr.	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
before	NULL

very	NULL
uneasy	NULL
that	NULL

"	NULL
gone	NULL

in	NULL
countenancing	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL

now	NULL
got	NULL
himself	NULL
fully	NULL
informed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
some	NULL
benevolent	NULL
sadness	NULL
in	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
ugly	NULL

which	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL

When	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
allayed	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
's	NULL
anxiety	NULL
by	NULL
telling	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
seized	NULL
with	NULL
faintness	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
meeting	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
trusted	NULL
soon	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
better	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
call	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
unless	NULL
she	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
earlier	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
directly	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
horse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rode	NULL
three	NULL
miles	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
reach	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
becoming	NULL
violent	NULL
and	NULL
unreasonable	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
raging	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
of	NULL
stings	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
curse	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
.	NULL

Everything	NULL
that	NULL
bad	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
there	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
preparation	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
hateful	NULL
fatality	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
blight	NULL

must	NULL
make	NULL
even	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
vulgar	NULL
standards	NULL
regard	NULL

reputation	NULL
as	NULL
irrevocably	NULL
damaged	NULL

In	NULL
such	NULL
moments	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
can	NULL
hardly	NULL
escape	NULL
being	NULL
unloving	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL

sufferer	NULL

and	NULL
of	NULL
others	NULL
as	NULL

agents	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
injured	NULL
his	NULL
lot	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
meant	NULL
everything	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
out	NULL
differently	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
others	NULL
had	NULL
thrust	NULL
themselves	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
thwarted	NULL
his	NULL
purposes	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
marriage	NULL
seemed	NULL
an	NULL
unmitigated	NULL
calamity	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
vented	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
solitary	NULL
rage	NULL
,	NULL
lest	NULL
the	NULL
mere	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
should	NULL
exasperate	NULL
him	NULL

make	NULL
him	NULL
behave	NULL
unwarrantably	NULL

men	NULL
's	NULL
lives	NULL

highest	NULL
qualities	NULL
can	NULL
only	NULL

objects	NULL

inward	NULL
vision	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
tenderheartedness	NULL
was	NULL
present	NULL

only	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
dread	NULL
lest	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
offend	NULL
against	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
emotion	NULL
that	NULL
swayed	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
tenderness	NULL

ennobling	NULL

can	NULL
understand	NULL
the	NULL
grief	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
falls	NULL
from	NULL

How	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL

about	NULL

For	NULL
that	NULL
scene	NULL

had	NULL
just	NULL
witnessed	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
particulars	NULL

had	NULL
been	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
situation	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
clear	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

been	NULL
in	NULL
dread	NULL
of	NULL
scandalous	NULL
disclosures	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL

case	NULL

came	NULL
the	NULL

That	NULL
the	NULL

had	NULL
come	NULL
ill	NULL
to	NULL
Stone	NULL
Court	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL

had	NULL
chosen	NULL

there	NULL

watch	NULL

of	NULL
benevolence	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
degraded	NULL

she	NULL

about	NULL

The	NULL

disturbed	NULL
when	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
home	NULL
ill	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
meeting	NULL

and	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
comforting	NULL
assurances	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
cried	NULL
in	NULL
private	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
suffering	NULL
from	NULL
bodily	NULL
illness	NULL
merely	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
from	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
afflicted	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
allow	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
scarcely	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
alleging	NULL
nervous	NULL
susceptibility	NULL
to	NULL
sounds	NULL
and	NULL
movements	NULL
;	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
suspected	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
shutting	NULL
himself	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
private	NULL
room	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
busy	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
papers	NULL
.	NULL

Something	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
some	NULL
great	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
kept	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL

Not	NULL
daring	NULL
to	NULL
question	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
fifth	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
meeting	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
left	NULL

go	NULL

"	NULL
Some	NULL
little	NULL
nervous	NULL

Lydgate	NULL

evasively	NULL

felt	NULL

him	NULL

the	NULL

But	NULL
what	NULL

it	NULL

said	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
directly	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
large	NULL
dark	NULL
eyes	NULL

is	NULL

"	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
satisfied	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
answer	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
belief	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
calamity	NULL
had	NULL
befallen	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
kept	NULL
in	NULL
ignorance	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
nature	NULL
strongly	NULL
to	NULL
object	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
concealment	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
begged	NULL
leave	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
daughters	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
drove	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
some	NULL
visits	NULL
,	NULL
conjecturing	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
anything	NULL
were	NULL
known	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
wrong	NULL
in	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
's	NULL
affairs	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
see	NULL
or	NULL
hear	NULL
some	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
called	NULL
on	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Thesiger	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
drove	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Hackbutt	NULL
's	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
churchyard	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Hackbutt	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
coming	NULL
from	NULL
an	NULL
up-stairs	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
remembering	NULL
her	NULL
former	NULL
alarm	NULL
lest	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
meet	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
felt	NULL
almost	NULL
bound	NULL
in	NULL
consistency	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
word	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
against	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
strong	NULL
desire	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
excitement	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
interview	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
determined	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
allusion	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

Hence	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
was	NULL
shown	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Hackbutt	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
tightness	NULL
of	NULL
lip	NULL
and	NULL
rubbing	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
than	NULL
was	NULL
usually	NULL
observable	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
these	NULL
being	NULL
precautions	NULL
adopted	NULL

freedom	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
resolved	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
how	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

not	NULL
been	NULL
anywhere	NULL

said	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
introductory	NULL
remarks	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL

taken	NULL
so	NULL
ill	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Hackbutt	NULL
rubbed	NULL

the	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL

"	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Hackbutt	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Hackbutt	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
sigh	NULL

"	NULL
Still	NULL

we	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Hackbutt	NULL
longed	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL

"	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
take	NULL
my	NULL
advice	NULL
you	NULL

part	NULL

but	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
clear	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
woman	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
thunder	NULL
ready	NULL

on	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
prepare	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
felt	NULL
suddenly	NULL
rather	NULL
chill	NULL
and	NULL
trembling	NULL
:	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
something	NULL
unusual	NULL
behind	NULL
this	NULL
speech	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Hackbutt	NULL
's	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
set	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
fully	NULL
informed	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
unable	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
pursue	NULL
her	NULL
brave	NULL
purpose	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turning	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
inquiry	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
Hackbutts	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
soon	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
leave	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Plymdale	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
thither	NULL
she	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
some	NULL
unusually	NULL
warm	NULL
sparring	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
meeting	NULL
between	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL

some	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
frequent	NULL
opponents	NULL

perhaps	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Hackbutt	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
would	NULL
account	NULL
for	NULL
everything	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Plymdale	NULL
that	NULL
comforting	NULL
explanation	NULL
seemed	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
tenable	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Selina	NULL
"	NULL
received	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pathetic	NULL
affectionateness	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
disposition	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
edifying	NULL
answers	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
commonest	NULL
topics	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
have	NULL
reference	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
ordinary	NULL
quarrel	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
important	NULL
consequence	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
perturbation	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
's	NULL
health	NULL
.	NULL

Beforehand	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
sooner	NULL
question	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Plymdale	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL

but	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
surprise	NULL
that	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
friend	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
the	NULL
person	NULL
whom	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
easiest	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
confidant	NULL
of	NULL
:	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
barrier	NULL
of	NULL
remembered	NULL
communication	NULL
under	NULL
other	NULL
circumstances	NULL
--	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
dislike	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
pitied	NULL
and	NULL
informed	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
long	NULL
wont	NULL
to	NULL
allow	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
superiority	NULL

For	NULL
certain	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
mysterious	NULL
appropriateness	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Plymdale	NULL
let	NULL
fall	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
resolution	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
convinced	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
some	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
misfortune	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
native	NULL
directness	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
What	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
in	NULL
your	NULL
mind	NULL

"	NULL

she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
away	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
anything	NULL
more	NULL
explicit	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
agitating	NULL
certainty	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
misfortune	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
mere	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
keenly	NULL
sensitive	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
Selina	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Hackbutt	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
avoided	NULL
noticing	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
avoided	NULL
noticing	NULL
a	NULL
personal	NULL
blemish	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
good-by	NULL
with	NULL
nervous	NULL
haste	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
the	NULL
coachman	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
's	NULL
warehouse	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
that	NULL
short	NULL
drive	NULL
her	NULL
dread	NULL
gathered	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
force	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
darkness	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
private	NULL
counting-house	NULL
where	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL
sat	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
desk	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
knees	NULL
trembled	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
usually	NULL
florid	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
deathly	NULL
pale	NULL
.	NULL

Something	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
effect	NULL
was	NULL
produced	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
rose	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
seat	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
impulsive	NULL
rashness	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
God	NULL
help	NULL
you	NULL

Harriet	NULL

That	NULL
moment	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
worse	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
which	NULL
came	NULL
after	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
contained	NULL
that	NULL
concentrated	NULL
experience	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
great	NULL
crises	NULL
of	NULL
emotion	NULL
reveals	NULL
the	NULL

is	NULL
prophetic	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ultimate	NULL
act	NULL
which	NULL
will	NULL
end	NULL
an	NULL

struggle	NULL

Without	NULL
that	NULL

Raffles	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
still	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL
only	NULL
of	NULL

now	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL

into	NULL
her	NULL

then	NULL

everything	NULL

She	NULL
locked	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
needed	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
maimed	NULL
consciousness	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
poor	NULL
lopped	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
walk	NULL
steadily	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
allotted	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
new	NULL
searching	NULL
light	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
judge	NULL
him	NULL
leniently	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
twenty	NULL
years	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
venerated	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
virtue	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
concealments	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
with	NULL
particulars	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
them	NULL
seem	NULL
an	NULL
odious	NULL
deceit	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
bad	NULL
past	NULL
life	NULL
hidden	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
faith	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
protest	NULL
his	NULL
innocence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
imputed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
honest	NULL
ostentatious	NULL
nature	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
sharing	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
merited	NULL
dishonor	NULL
as	NULL
bitter	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
mortal	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
imperfectly	NULL
taught	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
phrases	NULL
and	NULL
habits	NULL
were	NULL
an	NULL
odd	NULL
patchwork	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
loyal	NULL
spirit	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
man	NULL
whose	NULL
prosperity	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
shared	NULL
through	NULL
nearly	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
unvaryingly	NULL
cherished	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
punishment	NULL
had	NULL
befallen	NULL
him	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
sense	NULL
to	NULL
forsake	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
forsaking	NULL
which	NULL
still	NULL
sits	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
board	NULL
and	NULL
lies	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
couch	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
forsaken	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
withering	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
by	NULL
unloving	NULL
proximity	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
locked	NULL
her	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
unlock	NULL
it	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
unhappy	NULL
husband	NULL
and	NULL
espouse	NULL
his	NULL
sorrow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
guilt	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
mourn	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
reproach	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
needed	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
gather	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
strength	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
needed	NULL
to	NULL
sob	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
farewell	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
gladness	NULL
and	NULL
pride	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
prepared	NULL
herself	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
little	NULL
acts	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
seem	NULL
mere	NULL
folly	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
onlooker	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
expressing	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
spectators	NULL
visible	NULL
or	NULL
invisible	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
embraced	NULL
humiliation	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
ornaments	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
plain	NULL
black	NULL
gown	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
wearing	NULL
her	NULL
much-adorned	NULL
cap	NULL
and	NULL
large	NULL
bows	NULL
of	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
brushed	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
plain	NULL
bonnet-cap	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
look	NULL
suddenly	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
early	NULL
Methodist	NULL
.	NULL

Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
agitation	NULL
equal	NULL
to	NULL
hers	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
learning	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
from	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
acquiesced	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
probability	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
something	NULL
easier	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
confession	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
imagined	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
knowledge	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
awaited	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
in	NULL
anguish	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
daughters	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
consent	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
allowed	NULL
some	NULL
food	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
touched	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
perishing	NULL
slowly	NULL
in	NULL
unpitied	NULL
misery	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
never	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
affection	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
God	NULL
there	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
answer	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
pressure	NULL
of	NULL
retribution	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
eight	NULL
o'clock	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
opened	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
entered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
look	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
bent	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
smaller	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
withered	NULL
and	NULL
shrunken	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
movement	NULL
of	NULL
new	NULL
compassion	NULL
and	NULL
old	NULL
tenderness	NULL
went	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
wave	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
putting	NULL
one	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
which	NULL
rested	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
arm	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
shoulder	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
solemnly	NULL
but	NULL
kindly	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Look	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
Nicholas	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
raised	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
start	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
half	NULL
amazed	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
:	NULL
her	NULL
pale	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
changed	NULL
,	NULL
mourning	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
trembling	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
eyes	NULL
rested	NULL
gently	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
burst	NULL
out	NULL
crying	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
cried	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
sitting	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shame	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
bearing	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
acts	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
it	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
confession	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
promise	NULL
of	NULL
faithfulness	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

Open-minded	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
shrank	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
expressed	NULL
their	NULL
mutual	NULL
consciousness	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
shrunk	NULL
from	NULL
flakes	NULL
of	NULL
fire	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
How	NULL
much	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
slander	NULL
and	NULL
false	NULL
suspicion	NULL

"	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL

PASCAL	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
gleam	NULL
of	NULL
returning	NULL
cheerfulness	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
was	NULL
freed	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
threatening	NULL
figure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
creditors	NULL
were	NULL
paid	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
joyous	NULL
:	NULL
her	NULL
married	NULL
life	NULL
had	NULL
fulfilled	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
hopes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
quite	NULL
spoiled	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
imagination	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
brief	NULL
interval	NULL
of	NULL
calm	NULL
,	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
remembering	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
been	NULL
stormy	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hours	NULL
of	NULL
perturbation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
mindful	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
carefully	NULL
gentle	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
spirit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
still	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
refer	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
economical	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
living	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
reconcile	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
gradually	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
repressing	NULL
his	NULL
anger	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
by	NULL
wishing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
this	NULL
answer	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
listened	NULL
languidly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
living	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hard	NULL
and	NULL
contemptuous	NULL
words	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
anger	NULL
had	NULL
deeply	NULL
offended	NULL
that	NULL
vanity	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
called	NULL
into	NULL
active	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
regarded	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
perverse	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
kept	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
secret	NULL
repulsion	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
receive	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
tenderness	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
substitute	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
happiness	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
failed	NULL

give	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL

guessed	NULL
about	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

an	NULL

Better	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
sentimental	NULL
charm	NULL
which	NULL
diverted	NULL

She	NULL
constructed	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
romance	NULL

was	NULL
to	NULL

of	NULL
her	NULL

out	NULL

every	NULL

His	NULL
departure	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
proportionate	NULL
disappointment	NULL

and	NULL
had	NULL
sadly	NULL
increased	NULL
her	NULL

the	NULL

Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL

written	NULL
chatty	NULL
letters	NULL

half	NULL
to	NULL

half	NULL
to	NULL
Lydgate	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL

she	NULL
felt	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
final	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
she	NULL
now	NULL
most	NULL
longed	NULL
for	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
;	NULL
everything	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
agreeable	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
with	NULL
quiet	NULL
determination	NULL
to	NULL
win	NULL
this	NULL
result	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
,	NULL
delightful	NULL
promise	NULL
which	NULL
inspirited	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
came	NULL
shortly	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
memorable	NULL
meeting	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
town-hall	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
to	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
turned	NULL
indeed	NULL
chiefly	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
new	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
plans	NULL
of	NULL
colonization	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
mentioned	NULL
incidentally	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
find	NULL
it	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
a	NULL
visit	NULL
to	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
pleasant	NULL
necessity	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
good	NULL
as	NULL
holidays	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
schoolboy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hoped	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
place	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
rug	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
music	NULL
in	NULL
store	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
uncertain	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
reading	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
reviving	NULL
flower	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
grew	NULL
prettier	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
blooming	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
unendurable	NULL
now	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
debts	NULL
were	NULL
paid	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
persuaded	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
and	NULL
settle	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
"	NULL
so	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
provincial	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bright	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
soon	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
became	NULL
black	NULL
over	NULL
poor	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
gloom	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
entirely	NULL
reserved	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
dreaded	NULL
to	NULL
expose	NULL
his	NULL
lacerated	NULL
feeling	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
neutrality	NULL
and	NULL
misconception	NULL
--	NULL
soon	NULL
received	NULL
a	NULL
painfully	NULL
strange	NULL
explanation	NULL
,	NULL
alien	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
previous	NULL
notions	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
could	NULL
affect	NULL
her	NULL
happiness	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
gayety	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
spirits	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
merely	NULL
a	NULL
worse	NULL
fit	NULL
of	NULL
moodiness	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
causing	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
her	NULL
remarks	NULL
unanswered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
evidently	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
chose	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
meeting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
speaking	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
out	NULL
notes	NULL
of	NULL
invitation	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
evening	NULL
party	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
judicious	NULL
step	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
people	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
keeping	NULL
aloof	NULL
from	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wanted	NULL
restoring	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
intercourse	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
invitations	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
accepted	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
wise	NULL
admonition	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
how	NULL
a	NULL
medical	NULL
man	NULL
should	NULL
behave	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
neighbors	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
gravest	NULL
little	NULL
airs	NULL
possible	NULL
about	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
's	NULL
duties	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
invitations	NULL
were	NULL
declined	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
answer	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
This	NULL
is	NULL
Chichely	NULL

What	NULL
is	NULL
he	NULL
writing	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
about	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
wonderingly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
handed	NULL
the	NULL
note	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
severely	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Why	NULL
on	NULL
earth	NULL
have	NULL
you	NULL
been	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
you	NULL

thundered	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

certainly	NULL
I	NULL

said	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
aside	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
movement	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
graceful	NULL
long-necked	NULL
bird	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
tossed	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
grace	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL

feeling	NULL
himself	NULL
dangerous	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
thought	NULL

not	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL

growing	NULL
into	NULL
an	NULL

she	NULL

everything	NULL

pounds	NULL
except	NULL
that	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL

If	NULL
the	NULL
invitations	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
accepted	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
invite	NULL
her	NULL

the	NULL
rest	NULL

whom	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL

several	NULL
days	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
now	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL

inquire	NULL
what	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
dinner	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL

seated	NULL
together	NULL
alone	NULL

the	NULL

The	NULL

said	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Vincy	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
before	NULL
been	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
fault	NULL
with	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
shock	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
was	NULL
terrible	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
lot	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
cruelly	NULL
hard	NULL
as	NULL
hers	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
married	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
infamous	NULL
suspicions	NULL

In	NULL
many	NULL
cases	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
inevitable	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
shame	NULL
is	NULL
felt	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
crime	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
required	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL

such	NULL

never	NULL
entered	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

her	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL

feel	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL

was	NULL
less	NULL

if	NULL
her	NULL

had	NULL
been	NULL
certainly	NULL
known	NULL

done	NULL
something	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
shame	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
there	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
innocently	NULL
married	NULL
this	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
belief	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
glory	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
showed	NULL
her	NULL
usual	NULL

her	NULL

only	NULL
said	NULL

that	NULL

Mr.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
went	NULL

Why	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
everything	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
once	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
ask	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
go	NULL
home	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
dwelling	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
prospect	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
seem	NULL
utter	NULL
dreariness	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
:	NULL
a	NULL
married	NULL
woman	NULL
gone	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
parents	NULL
--	NULL
life	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
meaning	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
position	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
contemplate	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
next	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
observed	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
believed	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
bad	NULL
news	NULL
.	NULL

Would	NULL
she	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
would	NULL
she	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
forever	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
imply	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
believed	NULL
him	NULL
guilty	NULL
?	NULL

We	NULL
must	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
morbid	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
almost	NULL
all	NULL
contact	NULL
was	NULL
pain	NULL
.	NULL

Certainly	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
case	NULL
had	NULL
equal	NULL
reason	NULL
to	NULL
complain	NULL
of	NULL
reserve	NULL
and	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
confidence	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
part	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bitterness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
he	NULL
excused	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
--	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
justified	NULL
in	NULL
shrinking	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
task	NULL
of	NULL
telling	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
impulse	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

But	NULL
a	NULL
deeper-lying	NULL
consciousness	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
fault	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
restless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
became	NULL
intolerable	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
both	NULL
adrift	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
wreck	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
.	NULL

Have	NULL
n't	NULL
I	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
expecting	NULL
anything	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
married	NULL
care	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
you	NULL
heard	NULL
anything	NULL
that	NULL
distresses	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
laying	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
carrying	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
languid	NULL
semi-consciousness	NULL
,	NULL
most	NULL
unlike	NULL
her	NULL
usual	NULL
self	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
have	NULL
you	NULL
heard	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Everything	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
.	NULL

Papa	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
people	NULL
think	NULL
me	NULL
disgraced	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
faintly	NULL
,	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
sew	NULL
again	NULL
automatically	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
If	NULL
she	NULL
has	NULL
any	NULL
trust	NULL
in	NULL
me	NULL
--	NULL
any	NULL
notion	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
deserved	NULL
disgrace	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
moving	NULL
her	NULL
fingers	NULL
languidly	NULL
.	NULL

Whatever	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
she	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
Tertius	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
know	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
innocent	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
wrong	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
clear	NULL
himself	NULL
?	NULL

This	NULL
silence	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
brought	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
rush	NULL
of	NULL
gall	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
bitter	NULL
mood	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
saying	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
nobody	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
even	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
forward	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
question	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
intent	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
conversation	NULL
should	NULL
disperse	NULL
the	NULL
chill	NULL
fog	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
gathered	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
resolution	NULL
checked	NULL
by	NULL
despairing	NULL
resentment	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
this	NULL
trouble	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
regard	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
hers	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
being	NULL
apart	NULL
,	NULL
doing	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
objected	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
started	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
angry	NULL
impulse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thrusting	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pockets	NULL
,	NULL
walked	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
underlying	NULL
consciousness	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
master	NULL
this	NULL
anger	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
everything	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
convince	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
almost	NULL
learned	NULL
the	NULL
lesson	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
bend	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
short	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
sympathy	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
he	NULL
recurred	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
opening	NULL
himself	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
must	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
lost	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
bring	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
solemnity	NULL
that	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
slander	NULL
which	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
met	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
run	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
trouble	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
desperate	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
for	NULL
urging	NULL
powerfully	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
resolve	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
as	NULL
little	NULL
money	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
weather	NULL
the	NULL
bad	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
keep	NULL
themselves	NULL
independent	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
mention	NULL
the	NULL
definite	NULL
measures	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
desired	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
win	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
willing	NULL
spirit	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
this	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
else	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
long	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
walking	NULL
uneasily	NULL
backwards	NULL
and	NULL
forwards	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wished	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
sit	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
too	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
this	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL
for	NULL
urging	NULL
on	NULL
Tertius	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

Whatever	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
about	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
misery	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
dread	NULL
which	NULL
asserted	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
seated	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
nearer	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
leaning	NULL
aside	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
gravely	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
reopened	NULL
the	NULL
sad	NULL
subject	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
conquered	NULL
himself	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
solemnity	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
on	NULL
an	NULL
occasion	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
repeated	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
even	NULL
opened	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
letting	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
fall	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Surely	NULL
,	NULL
Tertius	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
"	NULL
Well	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Surely	NULL
now	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
staying	NULL
in	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
living	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
us	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
.	NULL

Papa	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
says	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

Whatever	NULL
misery	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
easier	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
felt	NULL
miserably	NULL
jarred	NULL
.	NULL

Instead	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
critical	NULL
outpouring	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
prepared	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
effort	NULL
,	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
round	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
gone	NULL
through	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
countenance	NULL
he	NULL
rose	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
strong	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
persist	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
determination	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
issue	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
his	NULL
energy	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
borne	NULL
down	NULL
that	NULL
check	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
still	NULL
have	NULL
wrought	NULL
on	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
vision	NULL
and	NULL
will	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
natures	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
inflexible	NULL
or	NULL
peculiar	NULL
,	NULL
will	NULL
resist	NULL
this	NULL
effect	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
massive	NULL
being	NULL
than	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
by	NULL
storm	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
converted	NULL
,	NULL
becoming	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
which	NULL
enwraps	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ardor	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
movement	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
poor	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
throbbing	NULL
pain	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
energy	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
short	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
task	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
mutual	NULL
understanding	NULL
and	NULL
resolve	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
off	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
;	NULL
nay	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
blocked	NULL
out	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
unsuccessful	NULL
effort	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
lived	NULL
on	NULL
from	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
day	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
thoughts	NULL
still	NULL
apart	NULL
,	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
going	NULL
about	NULL
what	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
mood	NULL

despair	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
feeling	NULL

with	NULL
some	NULL
justification	NULL

that	NULL

Some	NULL
days	NULL
later	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
riding	NULL
to	NULL
Lowick	NULL
Manor	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
consequence	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
summons	NULL
from	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
summons	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
unexpected	NULL

since	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
followed	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
stated	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
resumed	NULL
his	NULL

must	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL

It	NULL

before	NULL
taking	NULL

to	NULL
reopen	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
confident	NULL
hope	NULL
about	NULL
this	NULL
interview	NULL
with	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL

;	NULL
never	NULL
heeding	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
seemed	NULL
more	NULL
irrelevant	NULL
to	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
than	NULL
insistence	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
youth	NULL
and	NULL
sex	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
moved	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
her	NULL
human	NULL
fellowship	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
waiting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
live	NULL
through	NULL
again	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
scenes	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
memories	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
all	NULL
owed	NULL
their	NULL
significance	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
troubles	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
occasions	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
image	NULL
of	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
painfully	NULL
in	NULL
connection	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pain	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
allayed	NULL
for	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
an	NULL
awakened	NULL
conjecture	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
marriage	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
susceptibility	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
hint	NULL
about	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
thoughts	NULL
were	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
drama	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
bright	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
an	NULL
attitude	NULL
of	NULL
suspense	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
whole	NULL
frame	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
looking	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
brown	NULL
library	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
turf	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
bright	NULL
green	NULL
buds	NULL
which	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
relief	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
evergreens	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
shocked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
strikingly	NULL
perceptible	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
months	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
emaciation	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
effect	NULL
which	NULL
even	NULL
young	NULL
faces	NULL
will	NULL
very	NULL
soon	NULL
show	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
persistent	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
resentment	NULL
and	NULL
despondency	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
cordial	NULL
look	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
softened	NULL
his	NULL
expression	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
with	NULL
melancholy	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL

"	NULL

I	NULL
put	NULL
off	NULL
asking	NULL
you	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
applied	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
again	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
advantage	NULL

keeping	NULL
the	NULL

separate	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL

depends	NULL
on	NULL
you	NULL

at	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL

you	NULL
are	NULL
encouraged	NULL

it	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
sure	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
refuse	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL
think	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
want	NULL

whether	NULL
you	NULL

give	NULL
a	NULL
generous	NULL

Hospital	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
conscientiously	NULL

you	NULL

I	NULL
may	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
curtly	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
the	NULL
ache	NULL
of	NULL
despair	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
being	NULL
able	NULL

carry	NULL
out	NULL
any	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

set	NULL
her	NULL

Not	NULL

there	NULL
is	NULL

said	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
pouring	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
words	NULL
in	NULL
clearness	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
full	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL

You	NULL

never	NULL
done	NULL
anything	NULL

You	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL

"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
assurance	NULL
of	NULL
belief	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
on	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
ears	NULL

He	NULL
drew	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
breath	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Thank	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
say	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
very	NULL
new	NULL
and	NULL
strange	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
that	NULL
these	NULL
few	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
trust	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
beseech	NULL
you	NULL

fearlessly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
started	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
forgetting	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
gone	NULL
over	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
explaining	NULL
everything	NULL
without	NULL
aggravating	NULL
appearances	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
unfairly	NULL
,	NULL
against	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
decided	NULL
against	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
assertions	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
change	NULL
people	NULL
's	NULL
impressions	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
words	NULL
sounded	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
temptation	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
soberness	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
pronounced	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
unreasonable	NULL

"	NULL
Tell	NULL
me	NULL

pray	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
simple	NULL
earnestness	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
then	NULL
we	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
turned	NULL
,	NULL
remembering	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
looking	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sweet	NULL
trustful	NULL
gravity	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL

a	NULL

nature	NULL

generous	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
wishes	NULL

ardent	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
charity	NULL

changes	NULL
the	NULL
lights	NULL

us	NULL

we	NULL
begin	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
things	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
larger	NULL

quieter	NULL
masses	NULL

judged	NULL

the	NULL
wholeness	NULL

That	NULL
influence	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL

act	NULL
on	NULL
Lydgate	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL

all	NULL
life	NULL

dragged	NULL

struggling	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
throng	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
recovering	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
self	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
consciousness	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

only	NULL
a	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL

Dorothea	NULL

The	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
project	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL

and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
many	NULL
thoughts	NULL

both	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

which	NULL
gathered	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL

Until	NULL
yesterday	NULL
when	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
opened	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
glimpse	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
trouble	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL

the	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

when	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
meeting	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
interpreted	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
probable	NULL
allusion	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
towards	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
himself	NULL
off	NULL
from	NULL
indulging	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL

sad	NULL

excusing	NULL
vision	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
charm	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
constant	NULL
opportunities	NULL
of	NULL
companionship	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
fair	NULL
creature	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
most	NULL
likely	NULL
shared	NULL
his	NULL
other	NULL
tastes	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
evidently	NULL
did	NULL
his	NULL
delight	NULL
in	NULL
music	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
followed	NULL
his	NULL
parting	NULL
words	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
passionate	NULL
words	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
implied	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
held	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
dread	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
only	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
resolved	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
declare	NULL

to	NULL
carry	NULL
away	NULL
into	NULL
banishment	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
parting	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
believing	NULL
in	NULL
Will	NULL
's	NULL
love	NULL

believing	NULL

a	NULL
proud	NULL

his	NULL
delicate	NULL
sense	NULL

his	NULL
determination	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL

him	NULL
justly	NULL

felt	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
quite	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL
regard	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
regard	NULL
was	NULL
blameless	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
natures	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
love	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
baptism	NULL
and	NULL
consecration	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
bind	NULL
us	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
rectitude	NULL
and	NULL
purity	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
pure	NULL
belief	NULL
about	NULL

and	NULL
our	NULL
sins	NULL
become	NULL
that	NULL
worst	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
sacrilege	NULL
which	NULL
tears	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
invisible	NULL
altar	NULL
of	NULL
trust	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL

--	NULL
those	NULL
little	NULL
words	NULL
may	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
terrific	NULL
meaning	NULL
to	NULL
responsibility	NULL
,	NULL
may	NULL
hold	NULL
a	NULL
vitriolic	NULL
intensity	NULL
for	NULL
remorse	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
nature	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
kind	NULL
:	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
passionate	NULL
faults	NULL
lay	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
easily	NULL
counted	NULL
open	NULL
channels	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
ardent	NULL
character	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
pity	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
visible	NULL
mistakes	NULL
of	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
any	NULL
material	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL
experience	NULL
for	NULL
subtle	NULL
constructions	NULL
and	NULL
suspicions	NULL
of	NULL
hidden	NULL

.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
simplicity	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
,	NULL
holding	NULL
up	NULL
an	NULL
ideal	NULL
for	NULL
others	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
believing	NULL
conception	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
powers	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
womanhood	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
acted	NULL
strongly	NULL
on	NULL
Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
parted	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
brief	NULL
words	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
convey	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
his	NULL
feeling	NULL
about	NULL
herself	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
division	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
fortune	NULL
made	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
only	NULL
profit	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
brevity	NULL
when	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
interpret	NULL
them	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
his	NULL
highest	NULL
estimate	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
months	NULL
since	NULL
their	NULL
parting	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
delicious	NULL
though	NULL
sad	NULL
repose	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
relation	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
inwardly	NULL
whole	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
blemish	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
active	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
antagonism	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
antagonism	NULL
turned	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
defence	NULL
either	NULL
of	NULL
plans	NULL
or	NULL
persons	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
wrongs	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
Will	NULL
had	NULL
received	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
external	NULL
conditions	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
others	NULL
were	NULL
grounds	NULL
for	NULL
slighting	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
tenacity	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
affection	NULL
and	NULL
admiring	NULL
judgment	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
disclosures	NULL
about	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL

come	NULL
another	NULL
fact	NULL
affecting	NULL
Will	NULL

roused	NULL

Dorothea	NULL

Dorothea	NULL

the	NULL
animus	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
Will	NULL
's	NULL
part	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
painful	NULL
story	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
recalled	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL

but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
uttered	NULL
no	NULL

as	NULL
she	NULL

her	NULL

shrouded	NULL

something	NULL

strong	NULL
in	NULL

some	NULL

said	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Martha	NULL
moved	NULL
forward	NULL
intending	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL

then	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
up-stairs	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
if	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
returned	NULL
from	NULL

They	NULL
crossed	NULL
the	NULL
broader	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
entrance-hall	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
which	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL

The	NULL

was	NULL
unlatched	NULL

and	NULL
Martha	NULL
,	NULL
pushing	NULL
it	NULL
without	NULL

the	NULL

waited	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL

then	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
having	NULL
swung	NULL
open	NULL
and	NULL
swung	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
without	NULL
noise	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
had	NULL
less	NULL
of	NULL
outward	NULL
vision	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
images	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
without	NULL
seeing	NULL
anything	NULL
remarkable	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
immediately	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
voice	NULL
speaking	NULL
in	NULL
low	NULL
tones	NULL
which	NULL
startled	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
dreaming	NULL
in	NULL
daylight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
advancing	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
projecting	NULL
slab	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bookcase	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
terrible	NULL
illumination	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
certainty	NULL
which	NULL
filled	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
outlines	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
pause	NULL
,	NULL
motionless	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
self-possession	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

Seated	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
sofa	NULL
which	NULL
stood	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
line	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
entered	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
:	NULL
close	NULL
by	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
flushed	NULL
tearfulness	NULL
which	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
brilliancy	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
sat	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
bonnet	NULL
hanging	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Will	NULL
leaning	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
clasped	NULL
both	NULL
her	NULL
upraised	NULL
hands	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL

spoke	NULL
with	NULL
low-toned	NULL
fervor	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
agitated	NULL
absorption	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
noticed	NULL
the	NULL
silently	NULL
advancing	NULL
figure	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
immeasurable	NULL
instant	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
vision	NULL
,	NULL
moved	NULL
confusedly	NULL
backward	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
impeded	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
furniture	NULL
,	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
was	NULL
suddenly	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
presence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
spasmodic	NULL
movement	NULL
snatched	NULL
away	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
rose	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
necessarily	NULL
arrested	NULL
.	NULL

Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
,	NULL
starting	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
meeting	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
lightning	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
changing	NULL
to	NULL
marble	NULL
:	NULL
But	NULL
she	NULL
immediately	NULL
turned	NULL
them	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
firm	NULL
voice	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Excuse	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
servant	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
called	NULL
to	NULL
deliver	NULL
an	NULL
important	NULL
letter	NULL
for	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
into	NULL
your	NULL
own	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
laid	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
table	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
checked	NULL
her	NULL
retreat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
including	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
and	NULL
Will	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
distant	NULL
glance	NULL
and	NULL
bow	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
quickly	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
meeting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
the	NULL
surprised	NULL
Martha	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sorry	NULL
the	NULL
mistress	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
showed	NULL
the	NULL
strange	NULL
lady	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
inward	NULL
reflection	NULL
that	NULL
grand	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
probably	NULL
more	NULL
impatient	NULL
than	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
walked	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
most	NULL
elastic	NULL
step	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
quickly	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
carriage	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Drive	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
Freshitt	NULL
Hall	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
coachman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
paler	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
animated	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
self-possessed	NULL
energy	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
her	NULL
experience	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
drunk	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
draught	NULL
of	NULL
scorn	NULL
that	NULL
stimulated	NULL
her	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
susceptibility	NULL
to	NULL
other	NULL
feelings	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
something	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
below	NULL
her	NULL
belief	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
emotions	NULL
rushed	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
excited	NULL
throng	NULL
without	NULL
an	NULL
object	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
needed	NULL
something	NULL
active	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
her	NULL
excitement	NULL
out	NULL
upon	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
power	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
and	NULL
work	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
meat	NULL
or	NULL
drink	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
carry	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
purpose	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
started	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
Freshitt	NULL

Tipton	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
Sir	NULL
James	NULL

all	NULL
that	NULL

them	NULL

about	NULL
Lydgate	NULL

whose	NULL

under	NULL
his	NULL
trial	NULL
now	NULL
presented	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
new	NULL
significance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
more	NULL
ardent	NULL
in	NULL
readiness	NULL

be	NULL
his	NULL
champion	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
felt	NULL
anything	NULL

this	NULL

indignation	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

looking	NULL

him	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
an	NULL
endless	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
whose	NULL
inmost	NULL
soul	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
hardly	NULL

of	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Will	NULL

received	NULL
a	NULL
severe	NULL

she	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

with	NULL
an	NULL
utterance	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
cut	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
lash	NULL
,	NULL
darting	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
changing	NULL
from	NULL
pink	NULL
to	NULL
white	NULL

back	NULL
again	NULL

as	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
whole	NULL
frame	NULL
were	NULL
tingling	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL

at	NULL
a	NULL
point	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
inches	NULL
away	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
keenly	NULL

the	NULL

she	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
were	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
only	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
interpret	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
became	NULL
suddenly	NULL
quiet	NULL
and	NULL
seated	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
untying	NULL
her	NULL
hanging	NULL
bonnet	NULL
and	NULL
laying	NULL
it	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
shawl	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
little	NULL
hands	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
folded	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL

been	NULL
safer	NULL
for	NULL
Will	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
instance	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL

gone	NULL
away	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
no	NULL
impulse	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
horrible	NULL
inclination	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
and	NULL
shatter	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
anger	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
the	NULL
fatality	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
drawn	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
without	NULL
venting	NULL
his	NULL
fury	NULL

it	NULL

to	NULL

how	NULL

he	NULL
tell	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

What	NULL

When	NULL

forgiven	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL

no	NULL

he	NULL

no	NULL

After	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL

he	NULL
still	NULL
moved	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
in	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

At	NULL

up	NULL

some	NULL

irresolute	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL

a	NULL
way	NULL

the	NULL

going	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
without	NULL

,	NULL
he	NULL
shrank	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL

a	NULL
brutality	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
checked	NULL
and	NULL
stultified	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
anger	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
mantel-piece	NULL

leaned	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL

he	NULL
hardly	NULL

The	NULL

him	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL
utter	NULL
no	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL

found	NULL
calamity	NULL
seated	NULL
there	NULL

he	NULL

suddenly	NULL

him	NULL
a	NULL
trouble	NULL

lay	NULL
outside	NULL

And	NULL
what	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
foreboding	NULL
was	NULL
pressing	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
with	NULL
slow	NULL
pincers	NULL
:	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
might	NULL
come	NULL

enslaved	NULL

this	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
thrown	NULL
herself	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dreary	NULL
sadness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
gloomy	NULL
rebellion	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
quick	NULL
apprehensiveness	NULL
foreshadowed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL

him	NULL

And	NULL
so	NULL
they	NULL
remained	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

The	NULL

had	NULL
no	NULL

fling	NULL
out	NULL
any	NULL

collapse	NULL

the	NULL
illusion	NULL
towards	NULL
which	NULL
all	NULL

a	NULL
stroke	NULL

thoroughly	NULL
shaken	NULL
her	NULL

her	NULL
little	NULL

was	NULL
in	NULL

she	NULL
felt	NULL
herself	NULL
tottering	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL

Will	NULL
wished	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
speak	NULL
and	NULL
bring	NULL
some	NULL
mitigating	NULL
shadow	NULL
across	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
cruel	NULL
speech	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
both	NULL
in	NULL
mockery	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
attempt	NULL
at	NULL
revived	NULL
fellowship	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
desperate	NULL
effort	NULL
over	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Shall	NULL
I	NULL
come	NULL

see	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
this	NULL
evening	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL
like	NULL

"	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
audibly	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Will	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
Martha	NULL
never	NULL
knowing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
seat	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
fell	NULL
back	NULL
fainting	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
again	NULL

she	NULL
felt	NULL
too	NULL
ill	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
exertion	NULL

rising	NULL
to	NULL
ring	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL

she	NULL
remained	NULL
helpless	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL

surprised	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
long	NULL
absence	NULL

thought	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL

looking	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL

down-stairs	NULL
rooms	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
suddenly	NULL
sick	NULL
and	NULL
faint	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
helped	NULL
up-stairs	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
there	NULL
she	NULL
threw	NULL
herself	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
clothes	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL

as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
once	NULL
before	NULL
on	NULL

day	NULL

grief	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
came	NULL
home	NULL
earlier	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
half-past	NULL
five	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
perception	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
ill	NULL
threw	NULL
every	NULL
other	NULL
thought	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
background	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
her	NULL
pulse	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
rested	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
persistence	NULL
than	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL

a	NULL
long	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
some	NULL
content	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
perceived	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seating	NULL
himself	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
gently	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
bending	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
My	NULL
poor	NULL

has	NULL
something	NULL

Clinging	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
she	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
hysterical	NULL
sobbings	NULL
and	NULL
cries	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
hour	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
nothing	NULL

soothe	NULL

tend	NULL

imagined	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
Lydgate	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

already	NULL
depicted	NULL
to	NULL

who	NULL

Yes	NULL

sardonically	NULL

I	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL

him	NULL

Will	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
open	NULL
and	NULL
careless	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
personal	NULL
affairs	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
exquisite	NULL
touches	NULL
in	NULL
nature	NULL
's	NULL
modelling	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
delicate	NULL
generosity	NULL

warned	NULL
him	NULL

He	NULL
shrank	NULL

money	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

learning	NULL

it	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
misfortune	NULL

have	NULL
accepted	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
too	NULL
was	NULL
reticent	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
confidence	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
allusion	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
feeling	NULL
under	NULL
their	NULL
trouble	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL

Observing	NULL
a	NULL

Will	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
avoided	NULL
any	NULL
further	NULL
mention	NULL

himself	NULL

it	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
cause	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL
two	NULL

were	NULL
pitying	NULL
each	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
Will	NULL
who	NULL
guessed	NULL
the	NULL
extent	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
companion	NULL

When	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
spoke	NULL
with	NULL
desperate	NULL
resignation	NULL

going	NULL
to	NULL
settle	NULL
in	NULL
London	NULL

Will	NULL
felt	NULL
inexpressibly	NULL
mournful	NULL

and	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
entreated	NULL
him	NULL

urge	NULL
this	NULL

Lydgate	NULL

it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
beholding	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
magic	NULL

himself	NULL

the	NULL
small	NULL
solicitations	NULL

circumstance	NULL

which	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
commoner	NULL
history	NULL

perdition	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL

We	NULL
are	NULL
on	NULL

Poor	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
inwardly	NULL
groaning	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
margin	NULL

and	NULL
Will	NULL
was	NULL
arriving	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
this	NULL
evening	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
cruelty	NULL

When	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
dine	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
parsonage	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
return	NULL
from	NULL
Freshitt	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
frequent	NULL
interchange	NULL
of	NULL
visits	NULL
between	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Farebrother	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
enabled	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
lonely	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Manor	NULL

and	NULL
to	NULL
resist	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
the	NULL
severe	NULL
prescription	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
lady	NULL
companion	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
reached	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
remembered	NULL
her	NULL
engagement	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
finding	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
still	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
dress	NULL
for	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
straight	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
schoolhouse	NULL

entered	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
master	NULL

mistress	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
bell	NULL
,	NULL
giving	NULL
eager	NULL
attention	NULL

their	NULL
small	NULL
details	NULL

and	NULL
getting	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
dramatic	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
busy	NULL

She	NULL
paused	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
back	NULL

talk	NULL
to	NULL
old	NULL
Master	NULL
Bunney	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
putting	NULL

discoursed	NULL
wisely	NULL

Finding	NULL
that	NULL

her	NULL

rather	NULL

she	NULL
dressed	NULL
hastily	NULL

went	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
parsonage	NULL
rather	NULL
earlier	NULL
than	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL

house	NULL

never	NULL
dull	NULL

Mr.	NULL

like	NULL

something	NULL

whom	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
teaching	NULL

had	NULL
just	NULL
set	NULL
up	NULL

could	NULL
only	NULL

in	NULL

between	NULL

,	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
lost	NULL
belief	NULL
which	NULL

alive	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL

little	NULL

since	NULL

one	NULL

her	NULL

take	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL

as	NULL
a	NULL
yesterday	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
that	NULL

she	NULL
repeated	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL

solitude	NULL
have	NULL
looked	NULL
on	NULL
for	NULL
ages	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL
besought	NULL
hardness	NULL

to	NULL
bring	NULL
her	NULL
relief	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
her	NULL
anguish	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
lay	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bare	NULL
floor	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
grow	NULL
cold	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
while	NULL
her	NULL
grand	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
frame	NULL
was	NULL
shaken	NULL
by	NULL
sobs	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
despairing	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
images	NULL
--	NULL
two	NULL
living	NULL
forms	NULL
that	NULL
tore	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mother	NULL

her	NULL
child	NULL
divided	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sword	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presses	NULL
one	NULL
bleeding	NULL
half	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
breast	NULL
while	NULL
her	NULL
gaze	NULL
goes	NULL
forth	NULL
in	NULL
agony	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
half	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
carried	NULL
away	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
lying	NULL
woman	NULL
that	NULL

never	NULL
known	NULL
the	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL

Here	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
nearness	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
answering	NULL

here	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL

was	NULL
the	NULL

whom	NULL

her	NULL

morning	NULL

the	NULL

sat	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
a	NULL

life	NULL

and	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
full	NULL
consciousness	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
awakened	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
stretched	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
cried	NULL
with	NULL
bitter	NULL
cries	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
nearness	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
parting	NULL
vision	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
discovered	NULL
her	NULL
passion	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
unshrinking	NULL
utterance	NULL
of	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
aloof	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
persistently	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
moving	NULL
wherever	NULL
she	NULL
moved	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
changed	NULL
belief	NULL
exhausted	NULL
of	NULL

a	NULL
detected	NULL
illusion	NULL
--	NULL
no	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
living	NULL
man	NULL
towards	NULL
whom	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
struggle	NULL
any	NULL
wail	NULL
of	NULL
regretful	NULL
pity	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
scorn	NULL
and	NULL
indignation	NULL
and	NULL
jealous	NULL

The	NULL
fire	NULL
of	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
anger	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
easily	NULL
spent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
flamed	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
fitful	NULL
returns	NULL
of	NULL
spurning	NULL
reproach	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
come	NULL
obtruding	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
into	NULL
hers	NULL
,	NULL
hers	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
whole	NULL
enough	NULL
without	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

Why	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
brought	NULL
his	NULL
cheap	NULL
regard	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
lip-born	NULL
words	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
paltry	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
in	NULL
exchange	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
deluding	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
wished	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
farewell	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
price	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
it	NULL
half	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
stayed	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
crowd	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
nothing	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
prayed	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
less	NULL
contemptible	NULL
?	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
lost	NULL
energy	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
even	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
loud-whispered	NULL
cries	NULL
and	NULL
moans	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
subsided	NULL
into	NULL
helpless	NULL
sobs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
cold	NULL
floor	NULL
she	NULL
sobbed	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
chill	NULL
hours	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
twilight	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
dim	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
awoke	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
with	NULL
any	NULL
amazed	NULL
wondering	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
or	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
clearest	NULL
consciousness	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
sorrow	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
rose	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wrapped	NULL
warm	NULL
things	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seated	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
chair	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
watched	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
vigorous	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
borne	NULL
that	NULL
hard	NULL
night	NULL
without	NULL
feeling	NULL
ill	NULL
in	NULL
body	NULL
,	NULL
beyond	NULL
some	NULL
aching	NULL
and	NULL
fatigue	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
waked	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
condition	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
liberated	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
terrible	NULL
conflict	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
wrestling	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
grief	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
could	NULL
sit	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
lasting	NULL
companion	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
sharer	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
thoughts	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL
thoughts	NULL
came	NULL
thickly	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
longer	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
duration	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
paroxysm	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
narrow	NULL
cell	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
calamity	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
besotted	NULL
misery	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
consciousness	NULL
that	NULL
only	NULL
sees	NULL
another	NULL
's	NULL
lot	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
accident	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
began	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
through	NULL
that	NULL
yesterday	NULL
morning	NULL
deliberately	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
forcing	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
dwell	NULL
on	NULL
every	NULL
detail	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
possible	NULL
meaning	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
she	NULL
alone	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
scene	NULL
?	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
her	NULL
event	NULL
only	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
forced	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
bound	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
another	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
life	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
towards	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
set	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
longing	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
some	NULL
clearness	NULL
and	NULL
comfort	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
beclouded	NULL
youth	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
outleap	NULL
of	NULL
jealous	NULL
indignation	NULL
and	NULL
disgust	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
quitting	NULL
the	NULL
hateful	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
flung	NULL
away	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
mercy	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
undertaken	NULL
that	NULL
visit	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
enveloped	NULL
both	NULL
Will	NULL
and	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
burning	NULL
scorn	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
were	NULL
burned	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
sight	NULL
forever	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
base	NULL
prompting	NULL
which	NULL
makes	NULL
a	NULL
women	NULL
more	NULL
cruel	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
rival	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
faithless	NULL
lover	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
strength	NULL
of	NULL
recurrence	NULL
in	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
dominant	NULL
spirit	NULL
of	NULL
justice	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
overcome	NULL
the	NULL
tumult	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
shown	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
truer	NULL
measure	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
active	NULL
thought	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
before	NULL
been	NULL
representing	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
the	NULL
trials	NULL
of	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL

and	NULL
this	NULL
young	NULL
marriage	NULL
union	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
its	NULL
hidden	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
evident	NULL
troubles	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
vivid	NULL
sympathetic	NULL
experience	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
now	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
power	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
asserted	NULL
itself	NULL
as	NULL
acquired	NULL
knowledge	NULL
asserts	NULL
itself	NULL
and	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
us	NULL
see	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
ignorance	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
irremediable	NULL
grief	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
more	NULL
helpful	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
driving	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
effort	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
what	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
crisis	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
this	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
three	NULL
lives	NULL
whose	NULL
contact	NULL
with	NULL
hers	NULL
laid	NULL
an	NULL
obligation	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
suppliants	NULL
bearing	NULL
the	NULL
sacred	NULL
branch	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
objects	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
rescue	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sought	NULL
out	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
fancy	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
chosen	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
yearned	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
perfect	NULL
Right	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
throne	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rule	NULL
her	NULL
errant	NULL
will	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL

how	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
long	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
question	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
light	NULL
piercing	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
opened	NULL
her	NULL
curtains	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
out	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
road	NULL
that	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
view	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
fields	NULL
beyond	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
entrance-gates	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
bundle	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
carrying	NULL
her	NULL
baby	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
figures	NULL
moving	NULL
--	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
shepherd	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
dog	NULL
.	NULL

Far	NULL
off	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bending	NULL
sky	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
pearly	NULL
light	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
largeness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
manifold	NULL
wakings	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
to	NULL
labor	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
involuntary	NULL

palpitating	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
neither	NULL

her	NULL

shelter	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
spectator	NULL

nor	NULL
hide	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
in	NULL
selfish	NULL
complaining	NULL

What	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
resolve	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
seem	NULL
quite	NULL
clear	NULL

but	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
achieve	NULL
stirred	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
approaching	NULL
murmur	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
soon	NULL

distinctness	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
clothes	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL

have	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
weariness	NULL

a	NULL
hard	NULL
watching	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL

began	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
toilet	NULL

Presently	NULL
she	NULL
rang	NULL

Tantripp	NULL

her	NULL

Tantripp	NULL

When	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
again	NULL
at	NULL
Lydgate	NULL

door	NULL
speaking	NULL
to	NULL
Martha	NULL

he	NULL

close	NULL
by	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL

preparing	NULL
to	NULL

out	NULL

He	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL

and	NULL
immediately	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

reflected	NULL
that	NULL

leave	NULL
out	NULL

she	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
plain	NULL
that	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL

her	NULL
yesterday	NULL

,	NULL
he	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
carried	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
intention	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
prepared	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
note	NULL
asking	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL

given	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
servant	NULL

he	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
much	NULL
anxiety	NULL

After	NULL
leading	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
paused	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL

saying	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL

brightened	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
I	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
most	NULL
to	NULL

suddenly	NULL
doubting	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

the	NULL
check	NULL

going	NULL
to	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
to-day	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
went	NULL
up-stairs	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
but	NULL
lately	NULL
finished	NULL
dressing	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
languidly	NULL
wondering	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
do	NULL
next	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
habitual	NULL
industry	NULL
in	NULL
small	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
sadness	NULL

prompting	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
some	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
occupation	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
dragged	NULL
through	NULL
slowly	NULL
or	NULL
paused	NULL
in	NULL
from	NULL
lack	NULL
of	NULL
interest	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
ill	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
recovered	NULL
her	NULL
usual	NULL
quietude	NULL
of	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
had	NULL
feared	NULL
to	NULL
disturb	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
questions	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
letter	NULL
containing	NULL
the	NULL
check	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
afterwards	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL

sat	NULL

I	NULL
dare	NULL

he	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
here	NULL
again	NULL
to-day	NULL

I	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
rather	NULL
battered	NULL
and	NULL
depressed	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
reply	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
gently	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Rosy	NULL
,	NULL

you	NULL

"	NULL

That	NULL
she	NULL
colored	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
startled	NULL
movement	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
surprise	NULL
him	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
agitation	NULL
produced	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
interview	NULL
yesterday	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
beneficent	NULL
agitation	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
turn	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
no	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
tone	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
touch	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
of	NULL
yesterday	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
had	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
come	NULL
again	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
answer	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
blank	NULL
which	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
fill	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
dread	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
's	NULL
lacerating	NULL
words	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
every	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
a	NULL
fresh	NULL
smart	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
new	NULL
humiliating	NULL
uncertainty	NULL
she	NULL
dared	NULL
do	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
comply	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
rose	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
put	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
shawl	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
immediately	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
something	NULL
crossed	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
which	NULL
prompted	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Pray	NULL
tell	NULL
Martha	NULL
not	NULL

bring	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL

And	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
assented	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
fully	NULL
understood	NULL
this	NULL
wish	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
led	NULL
her	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
observing	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL

blundering	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

wrapping	NULL
her	NULL
soft	NULL
shawl	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL

walked	NULL
towards	NULL

was	NULL
inwardly	NULL
wrapping	NULL

soul	NULL

Had	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
anything	NULL

about	NULL

If	NULL
so	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
liberty	NULL
that	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
resented	NULL

she	NULL
prepared	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
every	NULL

polite	NULL

Will	NULL
had	NULL
bruised	NULL
her	NULL

for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
any	NULL
compunction	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
:	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
injury	NULL
seemed	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

the	NULL
"	NULL
preferred	NULL

woman	NULL

but	NULL
had	NULL
also	NULL
a	NULL
formidable	NULL
advantage	NULL
in	NULL

benefactor	NULL

and	NULL
to	NULL
poor	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
pained	NULL

it	NULL
seemed	NULL

this	NULL
Mrs.	NULL

Indeed	NULL

not	NULL
Rosamond	NULL

any	NULL

knowing	NULL
the	NULL

case	NULL

and	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
simple	NULL
inspiration	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
acted	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
well	NULL
have	NULL
wondered	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL

Looking	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
lovely	NULL
ghost	NULL
of	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
graceful	NULL
slimness	NULL
wrapped	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
soft	NULL
white	NULL
shawl	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
rounded	NULL
infantine	NULL
mouth	NULL
and	NULL
cheek	NULL
inevitably	NULL
suggesting	NULL
mildness	NULL
and	NULL
innocence	NULL
,	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
paused	NULL
at	NULL
three	NULL
yards	NULL
'	NULL
distance	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
visitor	NULL
and	NULL
bowed	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
gloves	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
an	NULL
impulse	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
resist	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
freedom	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
forward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sad	NULL
yet	NULL
sweet	NULL
openness	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
avoid	NULL
meeting	NULL
her	NULL
glance	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
avoid	NULL
putting	NULL
her	NULL
small	NULL
hand	NULL
into	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
clasped	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
gentle	NULL
motherliness	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
immediately	NULL
a	NULL
doubt	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
prepossessions	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
stir	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
eye	NULL
was	NULL
quick	NULL
for	NULL
faces	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
looked	NULL
pale	NULL
and	NULL
changed	NULL
since	NULL
yesterday	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
gentle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
firm	NULL
softness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
had	NULL
counted	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
strength	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
clearness	NULL
and	NULL
intensity	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mental	NULL
action	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
continuance	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
nervous	NULL
exaltation	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
frame	NULL
as	NULL
dangerously	NULL
responsive	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
finest	NULL
Venetian	NULL
crystal	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
suddenly	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
swelling	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
effort	NULL
was	NULL
required	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
back	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
emotion	NULL
only	NULL
passed	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
spirit	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sob	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
's	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
something	NULL
quite	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
imagined	NULL

So	NULL
they	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
without	NULL

the	NULL
two	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
yesterday	NULL

said	NULL
Dorothea	NULL

"	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
Lowick	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
me	NULL
his	NULL
opinion	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
affairs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Hospital	NULL

he	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
everything	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
conduct	NULL

feelings	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
sad	NULL
event	NULL
which	NULL
has	NULL
made	NULL
ignorant	NULL
people	NULL
cast	NULL
suspicions	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
reason	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
bold	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
believed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
acted	NULL
dishonorably	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
begged	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
the	NULL
history	NULL

He	NULL
confessed	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
told	NULL
it	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
dislike	NULL

say	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
wrong	NULL

proof	NULL

there	NULL
are	NULL
guilty	NULL
people	NULL

will	NULL
say	NULL
so	NULL

The	NULL
truth	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL

this	NULL
man	NULL
Raffles	NULL

or	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
any	NULL
bad	NULL
secrets	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL

he	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
offered	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
repented	NULL
,	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
kindness	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
refused	NULL
it	NULL
before	NULL

All	NULL
his	NULL
anxiety	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
patient	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
treat	NULL
him	NULL
rightly	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
end	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL

he	NULL
thought	NULL
then	NULL

still	NULL
thinks	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
no	NULL
wrong	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL

any	NULL
one	NULL

I	NULL

Mr.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL

you	NULL

Dorothea	NULL

her	NULL

and	NULL
are	NULL
unlikely	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
in	NULL
banishment	NULL
unless	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
obliged	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
exiled	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
placed	NULL
no	NULL
stronger	NULL
obstacle	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
return	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
resolve	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL
means	NULL
an	NULL
iron	NULL
barrier	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
simply	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
liable	NULL
to	NULL
melt	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
minuet	NULL
with	NULL
other	NULL
states	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
itself	NULL
bowing	NULL
,	NULL
smiling	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
giving	NULL
place	NULL
with	NULL
polite	NULL
facility	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
months	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
run	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
--	NULL
merely	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
hearing	NULL
something	NULL
about	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
on	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
flying	NULL
visit	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
chance	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
strange	NULL
coincidence	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
taken	NULL
an	NULL
innocent	NULL
journey	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
beforehand	NULL
supposed	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
hopelessly	NULL
divided	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
surely	NULL
venture	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
neighborhood	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
suspicious	NULL
friends	NULL
who	NULL
kept	NULL
a	NULL
dragon	NULL
watch	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
their	NULL
opinions	NULL
seemed	NULL
less	NULL
and	NULL
less	NULL
important	NULL
with	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
a	NULL
reason	NULL
quite	NULL
irrespective	NULL
of	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
journey	NULL
to	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
philanthropic	NULL
duty	NULL
.	NULL

Will	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
a	NULL
disinterested	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
intended	NULL
settlement	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
plan	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Far	NULL
West	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
need	NULL
for	NULL
funds	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
design	NULL
had	NULL
set	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
debating	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
laudable	NULL
use	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
claim	NULL
on	NULL
Bulstrode	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
urge	NULL
the	NULL
application	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
money	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
offered	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
carrying	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
scheme	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
largely	NULL
beneficial	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
question	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
dubious	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
Will	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
repugnance	NULL
to	NULL
again	NULL
entering	NULL
into	NULL
any	NULL
relation	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
banker	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
dismiss	NULL
it	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
arisen	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
the	NULL
probability	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
judgment	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
safely	NULL
determined	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
visit	NULL
to	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
object	NULL
which	NULL
Will	NULL
stated	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
coming	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
confide	NULL
in	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
discuss	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
question	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
amuse	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
evenings	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
stay	NULL
by	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
music	NULL
and	NULL
badinage	NULL
with	NULL
fair	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
neglecting	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
at	NULL
Lowick	NULL
Parsonage	NULL
:	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
Parsonage	NULL
was	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Manor	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
fault	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
neglected	NULL
the	NULL
Farebrothers	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
departure	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
proud	NULL
resistance	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
possible	NULL
accusation	NULL
of	NULL
indirectly	NULL
seeking	NULL
interviews	NULL
with	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
hunger	NULL
tames	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Will	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
very	NULL
hungry	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
vision	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
form	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
instead	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
opera	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
converse	NULL
of	NULL
zealous	NULL
politicians	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
flattering	NULL
reception	NULL
(	NULL
in	NULL
dim	NULL
corners	NULL
)	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
new	NULL
hand	NULL
in	NULL
leading	NULL
articles	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
foreseeing	NULL
with	NULL
confidence	NULL
how	NULL
almost	NULL
everything	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
familiar	NULL
little	NULL
world	NULL
;	NULL
fearing	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
surprises	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
visit	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
humdrum	NULL
world	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
terribly	NULL
dynamic	NULL
condition	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
even	NULL
badinage	NULL
and	NULL
lyrism	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
explosive	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
visit	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
fatal	NULL
epoch	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
so	NULL
harassed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
nightmare	NULL
of	NULL
consequences	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
dreaded	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
immediate	NULL
issues	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
seeing	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
breakfasted	NULL
the	NULL
arrival	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Riverston	NULL
coach	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
hurriedly	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
place	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
relieved	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
necessity	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
or	NULL
saying	NULL
anything	NULL
in	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
.	NULL

Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
tangled	NULL
crises	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
commoner	NULL
in	NULL
experience	NULL
than	NULL
one	NULL
might	NULL
imagine	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
shallow	NULL
absoluteness	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
's	NULL
judgments	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
sincerest	NULL
respect	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
circumstances	NULL
which	NULL
claimed	NULL
his	NULL
thorough	NULL
and	NULL
frankly	NULL
declared	NULL
sympathy	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
claim	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
better	NULL
for	NULL
Will	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
avoided	NULL
all	NULL
further	NULL
intimacy	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
contact	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
precisely	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
course	NULL
appear	NULL
impossible	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
a	NULL
creature	NULL
of	NULL
Will	NULL
's	NULL
susceptible	NULL
temperament	NULL
--	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
neutral	NULL
region	NULL
of	NULL
indifference	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
everything	NULL
that	NULL
befell	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
collisions	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
passionate	NULL
drama	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
revelation	NULL
that	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
happiness	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
way	NULL
dependent	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
difficulty	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
outburst	NULL
of	NULL
rage	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
had	NULL
immeasurably	NULL
increased	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hated	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
cruelty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
dreaded	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
the	NULL
fulness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
relenting	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
friendship	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
put	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
end	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
unhappiness	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
power	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
dreaded	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
foretaste	NULL
of	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
than	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
limbs	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
lopped	NULL
off	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
his	NULL
fresh	NULL
start	NULL
on	NULL
crutches	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
debated	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
coach	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
Riverston	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
a	NULL
note	NULL
to	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
makeshift	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
retreat	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
strong	NULL
cords	NULL
pulling	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
abrupt	NULL
departure	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
blight	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
happiness	NULL
in	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
crushing	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
chief	NULL
hope	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
acknowledged	NULL
necessity	NULL
for	NULL
renunciation	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
fresh	NULL
a	NULL
misery	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
resign	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
straightway	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
distance	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
decided	NULL
than	NULL
taking	NULL
the	NULL
Riverston	NULL
coach	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
by	NULL
it	NULL
while	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
daylight	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Rubicon	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
insignificant	NULL
stream	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
;	NULL
its	NULL
significance	NULL
lay	NULL
entirely	NULL
in	NULL
certain	NULL
invisible	NULL
conditions	NULL
.	NULL

Will	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
cross	NULL
his	NULL
small	NULL
boundary	NULL
ditch	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
beyond	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
empire	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
discontented	NULL
subjection	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
sometimes	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
every-day	NULL
life	NULL
to	NULL
witness	NULL
the	NULL
saving	NULL
influence	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
noble	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
divine	NULL
efficacy	NULL
of	NULL
rescue	NULL
that	NULL
may	NULL
lie	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
self-subduing	NULL
act	NULL
of	NULL
fellowship	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
night	NULL
's	NULL
anguish	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
taken	NULL
that	NULL
walk	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
--	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
perhaps	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
gained	NULL
a	NULL
higher	NULL
character	NULL
for	NULL
discretion	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
certainly	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
for	NULL
those	NULL
three	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
hearth	NULL
in	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
at	NULL
half-past	NULL
seven	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
Will	NULL
's	NULL
visit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
received	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
languid	NULL
coldness	NULL
which	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
accounted	NULL
for	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
nervous	NULL
exhaustion	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
relation	NULL
to	NULL
Will	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
bending	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
innocently	NULL
apologized	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
indirect	NULL
way	NULL
by	NULL
begging	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
lean	NULL
backward	NULL
and	NULL
rest	NULL
.	NULL

Will	NULL
was	NULL
miserable	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
necessity	NULL
for	NULL
playing	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
appearance	NULL
and	NULL
greeting	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
were	NULL
busy	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
feeling	NULL
since	NULL
that	NULL
scene	NULL
of	NULL
yesterday	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
still	NULL
inexorably	NULL
to	NULL
enclose	NULL
them	NULL
both	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
painful	NULL
vision	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
double	NULL
madness	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
happened	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
called	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Will	NULL
came	NULL
near	NULL
to	NULL
fetch	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
placed	NULL
a	NULL
tiny	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
folded	NULL
paper	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
saucer	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
secured	NULL
it	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
inn	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
eagerness	NULL
to	NULL
unfold	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
deepen	NULL
the	NULL
painful	NULL
impressions	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
opened	NULL
and	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
bed-candle	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
these	NULL
few	NULL
words	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
neatly	NULL
flowing	NULL
hand	NULL
:	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
told	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
under	NULL
any	NULL
mistake	NULL
about	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
me	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
kind	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
will	NULL
have	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
reproach	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
shall	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
any	NULL
difference	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
words	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
all	NULL
gladness	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
Will	NULL
dwelt	NULL
on	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
excited	NULL
imagination	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
cheeks	NULL
and	NULL
ears	NULL
burning	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
occurred	NULL
between	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
and	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
uncertainty	NULL
how	NULL
far	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
might	NULL
still	NULL
feel	NULL
her	NULL
dignity	NULL
wounded	NULL
in	NULL
having	NULL
an	NULL
explanation	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
conduct	NULL
offered	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
might	NULL
still	NULL
remain	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
a	NULL
changed	NULL
association	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
irremediable	NULL
difference	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
lasting	NULL
flaw	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
active	NULL
fancy	NULL
he	NULL
wrought	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
doubt	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
easy	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
escaped	NULL
from	NULL
wreck	NULL
by	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
stands	NULL
on	NULL
unknown	NULL
ground	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

Until	NULL
that	NULL
wretched	NULL
yesterday	NULL
--	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
vexation	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
morning	NULL
after	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
visit	NULL
to	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
two	NULL
nights	NULL
of	NULL
sound	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
lost	NULL
all	NULL
traces	NULL
of	NULL
fatigue	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
superfluous	NULL
strength	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
strength	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
manage	NULL
to	NULL
concentrate	NULL
on	NULL
any	NULL
occupation	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
long	NULL
walks	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
grounds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
paid	NULL
two	NULL
visits	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Parsonage	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
told	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
the	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
spent	NULL
her	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
fruitless	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
herself	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
childish	NULL
restlessness	NULL
.	NULL

To-day	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
spent	NULL
quite	NULL
differently	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
?	NULL

Oh	NULL
dear	NULL
!	NULL

nothing	NULL
.	NULL

Everybody	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
flannel	NULL
;	NULL
nobody	NULL
's	NULL
pig	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Saturday	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
scrubbing	NULL
of	NULL
doors	NULL
and	NULL
door-stones	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
useless	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
various	NULL
subjects	NULL
that	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
clear	NULL
upon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
herself	NULL
energetically	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
gravest	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
particular	NULL
little	NULL
heap	NULL
of	NULL
books	NULL
on	NULL
political	NULL
economy	NULL
and	NULL
kindred	NULL
matters	NULL
,	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
light	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
spending	NULL
money	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
injure	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
neighbors	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
--	NULL
what	NULL
comes	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
thing	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
them	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
weighty	NULL
subject	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
but	NULL
lay	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
certainly	NULL
keep	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
steady	NULL
.	NULL

Unhappily	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
slipped	NULL
off	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
whole	NULL
hour	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
reading	NULL
sentences	NULL
twice	NULL
over	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
intense	NULL
consciousness	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
contained	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
text	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
hopeless	NULL
.	NULL

Should	NULL
she	NULL
order	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
and	NULL
drive	NULL
to	NULL
Tipton	NULL
?	NULL

No	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
reason	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
she	NULL
preferred	NULL
staying	NULL
at	NULL
Lowick	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
her	NULL
vagrant	NULL
mind	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
reduced	NULL
to	NULL
order	NULL
:	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
art	NULL
in	NULL
self-discipline	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
round	NULL
and	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
brown	NULL
library	NULL
considering	NULL
by	NULL
what	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
manoeuvre	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
arrest	NULL
her	NULL
wandering	NULL
thoughts	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
task	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
means	NULL
--	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
doggedly	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
there	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
geography	NULL
of	NULL
Asia	NULL
Minor	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
slackness	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
been	NULL
rebuked	NULL
by	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
cabinet	NULL
of	NULL
maps	NULL
and	NULL
unrolled	NULL
one	NULL
:	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
make	NULL
herself	NULL
finally	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
Paphlagonia	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Levantine	NULL
coast	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fix	NULL
her	NULL
total	NULL
darkness	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
Chalybes	NULL
firmly	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
shores	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Euxine	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
map	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
study	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
of	NULL
names	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
turn	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
chime	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
set	NULL
earnestly	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
bending	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
map	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
uttering	NULL
the	NULL
names	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
audible	NULL
,	NULL
subdued	NULL
tone	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
often	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
chime	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
amusingly	NULL
girlish	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
deep	NULL
experience	NULL
--	NULL
nodding	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
marking	NULL
the	NULL
names	NULL
off	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
fingers	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
pursing	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
lip	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
breaking	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
dear	NULL
!	NULL

oh	NULL
dear	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
this	NULL
should	NULL
end	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
merry-go-round	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
interrupted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
opening	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
announcement	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Noble	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
little	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
bonnet	NULL
hardly	NULL
reached	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
shoulder	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
warmly	NULL
welcomed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
while	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
pressed	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
beaver-like	NULL
noises	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
something	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
sit	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
rolling	NULL
a	NULL
chair	NULL
forward	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Am	NULL
I	NULL
wanted	NULL
for	NULL
anything	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
stay	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Noble	NULL
,	NULL
putting	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
small	NULL
basket	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
holding	NULL
some	NULL
article	NULL
inside	NULL
it	NULL
nervously	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
left	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
churchyard	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
lapsed	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
inarticulate	NULL
sounds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
drew	NULL
forth	NULL
the	NULL
article	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
fingering	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
tortoise-shell	NULL
lozenge-box	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
color	NULL
mounting	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
continued	NULL
the	NULL
timid	NULL
little	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
fears	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
offended	NULL
you	NULL

has	NULL
begged	NULL

ask	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
answer	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
instant	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
crossing	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
receive	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
library	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
prohibition	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
dwell	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

Could	NULL
she	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
meet	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
grounds	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
sky	NULL
was	NULL
heavy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
shiver	NULL
as	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
coming	NULL
storm	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
shrank	NULL
from	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Casaubon	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Noble	NULL

pathetically	NULL

"	NULL
else	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL

back	NULL

No	NULL

that	NULL

hurt	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Pray	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL

"	NULL

What	NULL
else	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
?	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
longed	NULL
for	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
except	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Will	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
him	NULL
had	NULL
thrust	NULL
itself	NULL
insistently	NULL
between	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
other	NULL
object	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
throbbing	NULL
excitement	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
alarm	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
something	NULL
daringly	NULL
defiant	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
sake	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
lady	NULL
had	NULL
trotted	NULL
away	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
mission	NULL
,	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
falling	NULL
clasped	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
no	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
compose	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
attitude	NULL
of	NULL
dignified	NULL
unconsciousness	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
least	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
body	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL

likely	NULL

,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hard	NULL
feelings	NULL
that	NULL

had	NULL
had	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
any	NULL
duty	NULL
bind	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
hardness	NULL
?	NULL

Resistance	NULL
to	NULL
unjust	NULL
dispraise	NULL
had	NULL
mingled	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
feeling	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

now	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rebound	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
anguish	NULL

resistance	NULL
was	NULL
stronger	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
I	NULL
love	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL
--	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
voice	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL
saying	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
imagined	NULL
audience	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL

when	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
was	NULL
opened	NULL

she	NULL
saw	NULL
Will	NULL
before	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
move	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
doubt	NULL
and	NULL
timidity	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL

made	NULL
him	NULL
afraid	NULL

her	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
spell	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
keeping	NULL
her	NULL
motionless	NULL

her	NULL

while	NULL
some	NULL
intense	NULL
,	NULL
grave	NULL
yearning	NULL

imprisoned	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL

Seeing	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL

not	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
as	NULL

Will	NULL
paused	NULL
a	NULL
yard	NULL

her	NULL

the	NULL

But	NULL
amid	NULL
that	NULL
mass	NULL
ran	NULL
a	NULL
vein	NULL

which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
good	NULL

honorable	NULL

to	NULL

the	NULL

When	NULL

The	NULL

that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL

tribunal	NULL

he	NULL
shrank	NULL

His	NULL
equivocations	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL

Raffles	NULL
had	NULL
sustained	NULL
the	NULL
conception	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL

whom	NULL
he	NULL
prayed	NULL
to	NULL

yet	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL

him	NULL

his	NULL

which	NULL
he	NULL

washed	NULL
and	NULL
diluted	NULL
with	NULL
inward	NULL
argument	NULL

for	NULL

it	NULL
seemed	NULL
comparatively	NULL

his	NULL
acts	NULL
Murder	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
shrouded	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
doubt	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
strength	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL

Some	NULL
time	NULL

no	NULL
power	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL

care	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL

not	NULL
only	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
deprecated	NULL
any	NULL
harshness	NULL

because	NULL

Fred	NULL
remained	NULL
unswervingly	NULL
steady	NULL

Some	NULL
years	NULL
after	NULL

he	NULL
told	NULL

half	NULL

pull-up	NULL

can	NULL

money	NULL

horse	NULL

Fred	NULL

He	NULL
kept	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL

horsemanship	NULL

he	NULL
rarely	NULL
allowed	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
hunting	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
remarkable	NULL

he	NULL
submitted	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
three	NULL

Mary	NULL

brought	NULL
forth	NULL

when	NULL
Fred	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
like	NULL
her	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

laughingly	NULL

"	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vincy	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
declining	NULL
years	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
diminished	NULL
lustre	NULL

her	NULL
housekeeping	NULL

was	NULL
much	NULL
comforted	NULL

her	NULL
perception	NULL

two	NULL

But	NULL
Mary	NULL
secretly	NULL
rejoiced	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
youngest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
what	NULL

father	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
round	NULL
jacket	NULL

showed	NULL
a	NULL
marvellous	NULL
nicety	NULL

aim	NULL

playing	NULL

in	NULL
throwing	NULL

Ben	NULL

Letty	NULL
Garth	NULL

who	NULL
were	NULL
uncle	NULL
and	NULL
aunt	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
well	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
teens	NULL
,	NULL
disputed	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
whether	NULL
nephews	NULL
or	NULL
nieces	NULL
were	NULL
more	NULL
desirable	NULL
;	NULL
Ben	NULL
contending	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
girls	NULL
were	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
else	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
always	NULL
in	NULL
petticoats	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
showed	NULL
how	NULL
little	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
meant	NULL
for	NULL
;	NULL
whereupon	NULL
Letty	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
argued	NULL
much	NULL
from	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
got	NULL
angry	NULL
in	NULL
replying	NULL
that	NULL
God	NULL
made	NULL
coats	NULL
of	NULL
skins	NULL
for	NULL
both	NULL
Adam	NULL
and	NULL
Eve	NULL
alike	NULL

also	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
East	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
too	NULL
wore	NULL
petticoats	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
latter	NULL
argument	NULL
,	NULL
obscuring	NULL
the	NULL
majesty	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
former	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
too	NULL
many	NULL

for	NULL
Ben	NULL
answered	NULL
contemptuously	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
more	NULL
spooneys	NULL
they	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

and	NULL
immediately	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
whether	NULL
boys	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
girls	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Garth	NULL
pronounced	NULL
that	NULL
both	NULL
were	NULL
alike	NULL
naughty	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
boys	NULL
were	NULL
undoubtedly	NULL
stronger	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
run	NULL
faster	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
throw	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
precision	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
greater	NULL
distance	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
this	NULL
oracular	NULL
sentence	NULL
Ben	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
satisfied	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
minding	NULL
the	NULL
naughtiness	NULL

but	NULL
Letty	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
ill	NULL

her	NULL
feeling	NULL

superiority	NULL

stronger	NULL

her	NULL
muscles	NULL

Fred	NULL
never	NULL

his	NULL
hopefulness	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
led	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
expect	NULL

he	NULL
gradually	NULL
saved	NULL

To	NULL

for	NULL
that	NULL

he	NULL

you	NULL

On	NULL
inquiry	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL

be	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
Fred	NULL

Mary	NULL
still	NULL
inhabit	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL

Peter	NULL

had	NULL
often	NULL
been	NULL
ordered	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
.	NULL

Lydgate	NULL
's	NULL
hair	NULL
never	NULL
became	NULL
white	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
died	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
fifty	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
and	NULL
children	NULL
provided	NULL
for	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
insurance	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
gained	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
practice	NULL
,	NULL
alternating	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
,	NULL
between	NULL
London	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
Continental	NULL
bathing-place	NULL
;	NULL
having	NULL
written	NULL
a	NULL
treatise	NULL
on	NULL
Gout	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
disease	NULL
which	NULL
has	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
wealth	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
skill	NULL
was	NULL
relied	NULL
on	NULL
by	NULL
many	NULL
paying	NULL
patients	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
regarded	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
failure	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
done	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
once	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
acquaintances	NULL
thought	NULL
him	NULL
enviable	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
so	NULL
charming	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
nothing	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
shake	NULL
their	NULL
opinion	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
never	NULL
committed	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
compromising	NULL
indiscretion	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
simply	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
mild	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
temper	NULL
,	NULL
inflexible	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
judgment	NULL
,	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
admonish	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
frustrate	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
stratagem	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
years	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
he	NULL
opposed	NULL
her	NULL
less	NULL
and	NULL
less	NULL
,	NULL
whence	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
concluded	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
the	NULL
value	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
opinion	NULL
;	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
thorough	NULL
conviction	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
talents	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
gained	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
income	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
threatened	NULL
cage	NULL
in	NULL
Bride	NULL
Street	NULL
provided	NULL
one	NULL
all	NULL
flowers	NULL
and	NULL
gilding	NULL
,	NULL
fit	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
bird	NULL
of	NULL
paradise	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
resembled	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
brief	NULL
,	NULL
Lydgate	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
successful	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
died	NULL
prematurely	NULL
of	NULL
diphtheria	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
afterwards	NULL
married	NULL
an	NULL
elderly	NULL
and	NULL
wealthy	NULL
physician	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
took	NULL
kindly	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
four	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
pretty	NULL
show	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
daughters	NULL
,	NULL
driving	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
carriage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
often	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
happiness	NULL
as	NULL
"	NULL
a	NULL
reward	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
probably	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
reward	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
patience	NULL
with	NULL
Tertius	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
temper	NULL
never	NULL
became	NULL
faultless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
occasionally	NULL
let	NULL
slip	NULL
a	NULL
bitter	NULL
speech	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
memorable	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
signs	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
repentance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
once	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
his	NULL
basil	NULL
plant	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
explanation	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
basil	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
plant	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
flourished	NULL
wonderfully	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
murdered	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
brains	NULL
.	NULL

Rosamond	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
placid	NULL
but	NULL
strong	NULL
answer	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
speeches	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
then	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
chosen	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pity	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
had	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
praising	NULL
and	NULL
placing	NULL
above	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
thus	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
ended	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
advantage	NULL
on	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
's	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
unjust	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
uttered	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
in	NULL
depreciation	NULL
of	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
,	NULL
keeping	NULL
in	NULL
religious	NULL
remembrance	NULL
the	NULL
generosity	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
aid	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sharpest	NULL
crisis	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
herself	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
dreams	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
praised	NULL
above	NULL
other	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
something	NULL
better	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
been	NULL
better	NULL
and	NULL
known	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
repented	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
position	NULL
and	NULL
fortune	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
held	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
shame	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
sorrow	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
repented	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
love	NULL
stronger	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
impulses	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
marred	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
life	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
emotion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
a	NULL
life	NULL
filled	NULL
also	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
beneficent	NULL
activity	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
doubtful	NULL
pains	NULL
of	NULL
discovering	NULL
and	NULL
marking	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Will	NULL
became	NULL
an	NULL
ardent	NULL
public	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
working	NULL
well	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
times	NULL
when	NULL
reforms	NULL
were	NULL
begun	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
hopefulness	NULL
of	NULL
immediate	NULL
good	NULL
which	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
much	NULL
checked	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
getting	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
Parliament	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
constituency	NULL
who	NULL
paid	NULL
his	NULL
expenses	NULL
.	NULL

Dorothea	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL
nothing	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
wrongs	NULL
existed	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
thick	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
struggle	NULL
against	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
wifely	NULL
help	NULL
.	NULL

Many	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
pity	NULL
that	NULL
so	NULL
substantive	NULL
and	NULL
rare	NULL
a	NULL
creature	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
absorbed	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
only	NULL
known	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
circle	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
stated	NULL
exactly	NULL
what	NULL
else	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
power	NULL
she	NULL
ought	NULL
rather	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
Sir	NULL
James	NULL
Chettam	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
went	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
negative	NULL
prescription	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
ought	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
married	NULL
Will	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
opinion	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
cause	NULL
a	NULL
lasting	NULL
alienation	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
whole	NULL
again	NULL
was	NULL
characteristic	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
concerned	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
resist	NULL
the	NULL
pleasure	NULL
of	NULL
corresponding	NULL
with	NULL
Will	NULL
and	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
morning	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
pen	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
remarkably	NULL
fluent	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
prospects	NULL
of	NULL
Municipal	NULL
Reform	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
ran	NULL
off	NULL
into	NULL
an	NULL
invitation	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Grange	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
once	NULL
written	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
at	NULL
less	NULL
cost	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
(	NULL
hardly	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
conceived	NULL
)	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
valuable	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
months	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
correspondence	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
had	NULL
continually	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
talk	NULL
with	NULL
Sir	NULL
James	NULL
Chettam	NULL
,	NULL
been	NULL
presupposing	NULL
or	NULL
hinting	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
cutting	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
entail	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
maintained	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
pen	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
daring	NULL
invitation	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Freshitt	NULL
expressly	NULL
to	NULL
intimate	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
stronger	NULL
sense	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
reasons	NULL
for	NULL
taking	NULL
that	NULL
energetic	NULL
step	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
precaution	NULL
against	NULL
any	NULL
mixture	NULL
of	NULL
low	NULL
blood	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
heir	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Brookes	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
something	NULL
exciting	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Hall	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
letter	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
Celia	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
cry	NULL
silently	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Sir	NULL
James	NULL
,	NULL
unused	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
tears	NULL
,	NULL
asked	NULL
anxiously	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
burst	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
wail	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
heard	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
has	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
sure	NULL
she	NULL
wants	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
will	NULL
do	NULL
wrong	NULL
things	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
they	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
die	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
dreadful	NULL
!	NULL

Suppose	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
me	NULL
and	NULL
little	NULL
Arthur	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Dodo	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
hindered	NULL
from	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
me	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
wish	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
less	NULL
unkind	NULL
,	NULL
James	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Good	NULL
heavens	NULL
,	NULL
Celia	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Sir	NULL
James	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
wrought	NULL
upon	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
what	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
wish	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
you	NULL
like	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
take	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
wish	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
Celia	NULL
did	NULL
wish	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
after	NULL
this	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
meeting	NULL
the	NULL
Baronet	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
grounds	NULL
,	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
chat	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
ignorance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Sir	NULL
James	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
reason	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
immediately	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
entail	NULL
was	NULL
touched	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
My	NULL
dear	NULL
sir	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
dictate	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
my	NULL
part	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
let	NULL
that	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
would	NULL
let	NULL
things	NULL
remain	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
felt	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
surprised	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
relieved	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
in	NULL
particular	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
bent	NULL
of	NULL
Celia	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
inevitable	NULL
that	NULL
Sir	NULL
James	NULL
should	NULL
consent	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
reconciliation	NULL
with	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

Where	NULL
women	NULL
love	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
men	NULL
learn	NULL
to	NULL
smother	NULL
their	NULL
mutual	NULL
dislike	NULL
.	NULL

Sir	NULL
James	NULL
never	NULL
liked	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Will	NULL
always	NULL
preferred	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
Sir	NULL
James	NULL
's	NULL
company	NULL
mixed	NULL
with	NULL
another	NULL
kind	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
footing	NULL
of	NULL
reciprocal	NULL
tolerance	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
quite	NULL
easy	NULL
only	NULL
when	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
and	NULL
Celia	NULL
were	NULL
present	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
became	NULL
an	NULL
understood	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Ladislaw	NULL
should	NULL
pay	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
two	NULL
visits	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Grange	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
gradually	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
row	NULL
of	NULL
cousins	NULL
at	NULL
Freshitt	NULL
who	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
playing	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
cousins	NULL
visiting	NULL
Tipton	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
lived	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
old	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
estate	NULL
was	NULL
inherited	NULL
by	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
represented	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
declined	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
opinions	NULL
had	NULL
less	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
stifled	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
remained	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
doors	NULL
.	NULL

Sir	NULL
James	NULL
never	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
regard	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
's	NULL
second	NULL
marriage	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
mistake	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
indeed	NULL
this	NULL
remained	NULL
the	NULL
tradition	NULL
concerning	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
Middlemarch	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
spoken	NULL
of	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
younger	NULL
generation	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
girl	NULL
who	NULL
married	NULL
a	NULL
sickly	NULL
clergyman	NULL
,	NULL
old	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
death	NULL
gave	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
estate	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
his	NULL
cousin	NULL
--	NULL
young	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
property	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
well-born	NULL
.	NULL

Those	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
anything	NULL
of	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
usually	NULL
observed	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
"	NULL
a	NULL
nice	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
else	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
married	NULL
either	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

Certainly	NULL
those	NULL
determining	NULL
acts	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
ideally	NULL
beautiful	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
mixed	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
young	NULL
and	NULL
noble	NULL
impulse	NULL
struggling	NULL
amidst	NULL
the	NULL
conditions	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
imperfect	NULL
social	NULL
state	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
great	NULL
feelings	NULL
will	NULL
often	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
aspect	NULL
of	NULL
error	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
great	NULL
faith	NULL
the	NULL
aspect	NULL
of	NULL
illusion	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
creature	NULL
whose	NULL
inward	NULL
being	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
strong	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
greatly	NULL
determined	NULL
by	NULL
what	NULL
lies	NULL
outside	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
new	NULL
Theresa	NULL
will	NULL
hardly	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
of	NULL
reforming	NULL
a	NULL
conventual	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
Antigone	NULL
will	NULL
spend	NULL
her	NULL
heroic	NULL
piety	NULL
in	NULL
daring	NULL
all	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
brother	NULL
's	NULL
burial	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
medium	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
their	NULL
ardent	NULL
deeds	NULL
took	NULL
shape	NULL
is	NULL
forever	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
we	NULL
insignificant	NULL
people	NULL
with	NULL
our	NULL
daily	NULL
words	NULL
and	NULL
acts	NULL
are	NULL
preparing	NULL
the	NULL
lives	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
Dorotheas	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
may	NULL
present	NULL
a	NULL
far	NULL
sadder	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Dorothea	NULL
whose	NULL
story	NULL
we	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
finely	NULL
touched	NULL
spirit	NULL
had	NULL
still	NULL
its	NULL
fine	NULL
issues	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
widely	NULL
visible	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
full	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
river	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
Cyrus	NULL
broke	NULL
the	NULL
strength	NULL
,	NULL
spent	NULL
itself	NULL
in	NULL
channels	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
great	NULL
name	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
being	NULL
on	NULL
those	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
was	NULL
incalculably	NULL
diffusive	NULL
:	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
growing	NULL
good	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
is	NULL
partly	NULL
dependent	NULL
on	NULL
unhistoric	NULL
acts	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
things	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
ill	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
and	NULL
me	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
half	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
number	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
faithfully	NULL
a	NULL
hidden	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rest	NULL
in	NULL
unvisited	NULL
tombs	NULL
