in	NULL
that	NULL

on	NULL
capitally	NULL

when	NULL
they	NULL
talked	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL

their	NULL
way	NULL

At	NULL
nine	NULL
they	NULL
stopped	NULL

out	NULL

she	NULL

a	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
TWO	NULL
A	NULL
MERRY	NULL
CHRISTMAS	NULL
Jo	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
to	NULL
wake	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
dawn	NULL
of	NULL
Christmas	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
stockings	NULL
hung	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
fireplace	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
disappointed	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
sock	NULL
fell	NULL
down	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
crammed	NULL
so	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
goodies	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
remembered	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
promise	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
slipping	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
pillow	NULL
,	NULL
drew	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
crimson-covered	NULL
book	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
beautiful	NULL
old	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
life	NULL
ever	NULL
lived	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Jo	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
true	NULL
guidebook	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
pilgrim	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
journey	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
woke	NULL
Meg	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
Merry	NULL
Christmas	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
bade	NULL
her	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
pillow	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
green-covered	NULL
book	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
picture	NULL
inside	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
words	NULL
written	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
their	NULL
one	NULL
present	NULL
very	NULL
precious	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
Beth	NULL
and	NULL
Amy	NULL
woke	NULL
to	NULL
rummage	NULL
and	NULL
find	NULL
their	NULL
little	NULL
books	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
dove-colored	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
blue	NULL

and	NULL
all	NULL
sat	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
and	NULL
talking	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
east	NULL
grew	NULL
rosy	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
coming	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
small	NULL
vanities	NULL
,	NULL
Margaret	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
sweet	NULL
and	NULL
pious	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
influenced	NULL
her	NULL
sisters	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
tenderly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
obeyed	NULL
her	NULL
because	NULL
her	NULL

gently	NULL
given	NULL

Mother	NULL
wants	NULL
us	NULL

we	NULL

We	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
opened	NULL
her	NULL

began	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL

Jo	NULL
put	NULL

leaning	NULL

one	NULL
bed	NULL
to	NULL

no	NULL

There	NULL
is	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
over	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
oldest	NULL
boy	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
suffering	NULL
hunger	NULL
and	NULL
cold	NULL

My	NULL

will	NULL
you	NULL

them	NULL
your	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
unusually	NULL
hungry	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
waited	NULL
nearly	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
spoke	NULL

only	NULL

for	NULL
Jo	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
impetuously	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

came	NULL
before	NULL
we	NULL
began	NULL

May	NULL
I	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
help	NULL
carry	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL

asked	NULL
Beth	NULL
eagerly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
cream	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
muffings	NULL

added	NULL
Amy	NULL
,	NULL
heroically	NULL
giving	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
article	NULL
she	NULL
most	NULL
liked	NULL
.	NULL

Meg	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
covering	NULL
the	NULL
buckwheats	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
piling	NULL
the	NULL
bread	NULL
into	NULL
one	NULL
big	NULL
plate	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
'd	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
,	NULL
smiling	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
satisfied	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
shall	NULL
all	NULL
go	NULL

help	NULL
me	NULL

we	NULL

we	NULL

bread	NULL

milk	NULL
for	NULL
breakfast	NULL

make	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
dinnertime	NULL

"	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
soon	NULL
ready	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
procession	NULL
set	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Fortunately	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
early	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
through	NULL
back	NULL
streets	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
few	NULL
people	NULL
saw	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
queer	NULL
party	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
bare	NULL
,	NULL
miserable	NULL
room	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
broken	NULL
windows	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
ragged	NULL
bedclothes	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sick	NULL
mother	NULL

wailing	NULL
baby	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
pale	NULL

hungry	NULL
children	NULL
cuddled	NULL
under	NULL
one	NULL
old	NULL
quilt	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
warm	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
eyes	NULL
stared	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
lips	NULL
smiled	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ach	NULL

the	NULL

crying	NULL
for	NULL
joy	NULL

said	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
set	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
laughing	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
it	NULL
really	NULL
did	NULL
seem	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
kind	NULL
spirits	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
work	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

Hannah	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
carried	NULL
wood	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
fire	NULL

and	NULL
stopped	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
broken	NULL
panes	NULL
with	NULL
old	NULL
hats	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL

cloak	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
mother	NULL
tea	NULL

gruel	NULL

and	NULL
comforted	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
promises	NULL
of	NULL

she	NULL
dressed	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
baby	NULL
as	NULL
tenderly	NULL
as	NULL

The	NULL

spread	NULL
the	NULL

set	NULL
the	NULL

round	NULL
the	NULL

cried	NULL
the	NULL

as	NULL
they	NULL
ate	NULL
and	NULL
warmed	NULL
their	NULL
purple	NULL
hands	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL
girls	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL

thought	NULL
it	NULL

Jo	NULL

upstairs	NULL

about	NULL

the	NULL

Beth	NULL

Amy	NULL
threw	NULL
open	NULL
the	NULL

Meg	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
was	NULL
both	NULL
surprised	NULL

touched	NULL

and	NULL
smiled	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
full	NULL

she	NULL
examined	NULL
her	NULL

read	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL

on	NULL
at	NULL

a	NULL

slipped	NULL

Amy	NULL

the	NULL
rose	NULL

fastened	NULL

her	NULL
bosom	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
nice	NULL
gloves	NULL
were	NULL
pronounced	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
laughing	NULL

kissing	NULL

explaining	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

all	NULL

The	NULL

took	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL

that	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL

devoted	NULL
to	NULL
preparations	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL

Being	NULL
still	NULL
too	NULL
young	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
often	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
theater	NULL

and	NULL
not	NULL
rich	NULL
enough	NULL

any	NULL

the	NULL

and	NULL
necessity	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
mother	NULL
of	NULL
invention	NULL

made	NULL
whatever	NULL
they	NULL
needed	NULL
.	NULL

Very	NULL
clever	NULL
were	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
productions	NULL
,	NULL
pasteboard	NULL
guitars	NULL
,	NULL
antique	NULL
lamps	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
butter	NULL

The	NULL

chamber	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
innocent	NULL
revels	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
gentleman	NULL
were	NULL
admitted	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
Jo	NULL
played	NULL
male	NULL
parts	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
's	NULL
content	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
immense	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
russet	NULL
leather	NULL
boots	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
a	NULL
lady	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
an	NULL
actor	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
boots	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
foil	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
slashed	NULL
doublet	NULL
once	NULL
used	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
artist	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
picture	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
chief	NULL
treasures	NULL
and	NULL
appeared	NULL
on	NULL
all	NULL
occasions	NULL

The	NULL
smallness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
principal	NULL
actors	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
several	NULL
parts	NULL
apiece	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
certainly	NULL
deserved	NULL
some	NULL
credit	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
hard	NULL
work	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
in	NULL
learning	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
different	NULL
parts	NULL
,	NULL
whisking	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
various	NULL
costumes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
managing	NULL
the	NULL
stage	NULL
besides	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
excellent	NULL
drill	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
memories	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
harmless	NULL
amusement	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
employed	NULL
many	NULL
hours	NULL
which	NULL
otherwise	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
idle	NULL
,	NULL
lonely	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
spent	NULL
in	NULL
less	NULL
profitable	NULL
society	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
Christmas	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
girls	NULL
piled	NULL
onto	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
dress	NULL
circle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
and	NULL
yellow	NULL
chintz	NULL
curtains	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
flattering	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
expectancy	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
rustling	NULL
and	NULL
whispering	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
curtain	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
trifle	NULL
of	NULL
lamp	NULL
smoke	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
occasional	NULL
giggle	NULL
from	NULL
Amy	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
hysterical	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
excitement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
a	NULL
bell	NULL
sounded	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
curtains	NULL
flew	NULL
apart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
operatic	NULL
tragedy	NULL
_	NULL
began	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
A	NULL
gloomy	NULL
wood	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
playbill	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
represented	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
shrubs	NULL
in	NULL
pots	NULL
,	NULL
green	NULL
baize	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
cave	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
cave	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
clothes	NULL
horse	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
roof	NULL
,	NULL
bureaus	NULL
for	NULL
walls	NULL

and	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
furnace	NULL
in	NULL
full	NULL
blast	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
pot	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
witch	NULL
bending	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
stage	NULL
was	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
glow	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
furnace	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
effect	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
as	NULL
real	NULL
steam	NULL
issued	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
kettle	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
witch	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
cover	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
moment	NULL
was	NULL
allowed	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
thrill	NULL
to	NULL
subside	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
Hugo	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
villain	NULL
,	NULL
stalked	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
clanking	NULL
sword	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
slouching	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
black	NULL
beard	NULL
,	NULL
mysterious	NULL
cloak	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
boots	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
pacing	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
fro	NULL
in	NULL
much	NULL
agitation	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
struck	NULL
his	NULL
forehead	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
burst	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
wild	NULL
strain	NULL
,	NULL
singing	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
hatred	NULL
for	NULL
Roderigo	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
Zara	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
pleasing	NULL
resolution	NULL
to	NULL
kill	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
and	NULL
win	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
gruff	NULL
tones	NULL
of	NULL
Hugo	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
occasional	NULL
shout	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
feelings	NULL
overcame	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
impressive	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
audience	NULL
applauded	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
paused	NULL
for	NULL
breath	NULL
.	NULL

Bowing	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
public	NULL
praise	NULL

he	NULL
stole	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

with	NULL

a	NULL

sounded	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cave	NULL
appeared	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
figure	NULL
in	NULL
cloudy	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
glittering	NULL
wings	NULL
,	NULL
golden	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
garland	NULL
of	NULL
roses	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

Waving	NULL
a	NULL
wand	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
sang	NULL
...	NULL
Hither	NULL
I	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
From	NULL
my	NULL
airy	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
Afar	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
silver	NULL
moon	NULL
.	NULL

Take	NULL
the	NULL
magic	NULL
spell	NULL

And	NULL
use	NULL
it	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
Or	NULL
its	NULL
power	NULL
will	NULL
vanish	NULL
soon	NULL
!	NULL

And	NULL
dropping	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
,	NULL
gilded	NULL
bottle	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
witch	NULL
's	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
spirit	NULL
vanished	NULL
.	NULL

Another	NULL
chant	NULL
from	NULL
Hagar	NULL
produced	NULL
another	NULL
apparition	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
lovely	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
bang	NULL
an	NULL
ugly	NULL
black	NULL
imp	NULL
appeared	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
croaked	NULL
a	NULL
reply	NULL
,	NULL
tossed	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
bottle	NULL
at	NULL
Hugo	NULL
and	NULL
disappeared	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
mocking	NULL
laugh	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
warbled	NULL
his	NULL
thanks	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
potions	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
boots	NULL
,	NULL
Hugo	NULL
departed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Hagar	NULL
informed	NULL
the	NULL
audience	NULL
that	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
killed	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
in	NULL
times	NULL
past	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
cursed	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
intends	NULL
to	NULL
thwart	NULL
his	NULL
plans	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
revenged	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
curtain	NULL
fell	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
audience	NULL
reposed	NULL
and	NULL
ate	NULL
candy	NULL
while	NULL
discussing	NULL
the	NULL
merits	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
hammering	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
curtain	NULL
rose	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
became	NULL
evident	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
masterpiece	NULL
of	NULL
stage	NULL
carpentery	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
murmured	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
delay	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
truly	NULL
superb	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
tower	NULL
rose	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ceiling	NULL
,	NULL
halfway	NULL
up	NULL
appeared	NULL
a	NULL
window	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
lamp	NULL
burning	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
curtain	NULL
appeared	NULL
Zara	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
lovely	NULL
blue	NULL
and	NULL
silver	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
Roderigo	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
gorgeous	NULL
array	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
plumed	NULL
cap	NULL
,	NULL
red	NULL
cloak	NULL
,	NULL
chestnut	NULL
lovelocks	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
guitar	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
boots	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
.	NULL

Kneeling	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tower	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
sang	NULL
a	NULL
serenade	NULL
in	NULL
melting	NULL
tones	NULL
.	NULL

Zara	NULL
replied	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
musical	NULL
dialogue	NULL
,	NULL
consented	NULL
to	NULL
fly	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
grand	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
play	NULL
.	NULL

Roderigo	NULL
produced	NULL
a	NULL
rope	NULL
ladder	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
five	NULL
steps	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
threw	NULL
up	NULL
one	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
invited	NULL
Zara	NULL
to	NULL
descend	NULL
.	NULL

Timidly	NULL
she	NULL
crept	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
lattice	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
Roderigo	NULL
's	NULL
shoulder	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
leap	NULL
gracefully	NULL
down	NULL
when	NULL
"	NULL
Alas	NULL
!	NULL

Alas	NULL
for	NULL
Zara	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
forgot	NULL
her	NULL
train	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
caught	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
tower	NULL
tottered	NULL
,	NULL
leaned	NULL
forward	NULL
,	NULL
fell	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
crash	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
buried	NULL
the	NULL
unhappy	NULL
lovers	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ruins	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
universal	NULL
shriek	NULL
arose	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
russet	NULL
boots	NULL
waved	NULL
wildly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
wreck	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
golden	NULL
head	NULL
emerged	NULL
,	NULL
exclaiming	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
told	NULL
you	NULL
so	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
told	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

With	NULL
wonderful	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
Don	NULL
Pedro	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
cruel	NULL
sire	NULL
,	NULL
rushed	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
dragged	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
daughter	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
hasty	NULL
aside	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL

"	NULL

and	NULL
,	NULL
ordering	NULL
Roderigo	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
banished	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
kingdom	NULL
with	NULL
wrath	NULL
and	NULL
scorn	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
decidedly	NULL
shaken	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fall	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
tower	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
Roderigo	NULL
defied	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
and	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
stir	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
dauntless	NULL
example	NULL
fired	NULL
Zara	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
also	NULL
defied	NULL
her	NULL
sire	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
ordered	NULL
them	NULL
both	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
deepest	NULL
dungeons	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
castle	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
stout	NULL
little	NULL
retainer	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
chains	NULL
and	NULL
led	NULL
them	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
frightened	NULL
and	NULL
evidently	NULL
forgetting	NULL
the	NULL
speech	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
.	NULL

Act	NULL
third	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
castle	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
Hagar	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
free	NULL
the	NULL
lovers	NULL
and	NULL
finish	NULL
Hugo	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
hears	NULL
him	NULL
coming	NULL
and	NULL
hides	NULL
,	NULL
sees	NULL
him	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
potions	NULL
into	NULL
two	NULL
cups	NULL
of	NULL
wine	NULL
and	NULL
bid	NULL
the	NULL
timid	NULL
little	NULL
servant	NULL

"	NULL
Bear	NULL
them	NULL

The	NULL
servant	NULL
takes	NULL
Hugo	NULL
aside	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Hagar	NULL
changes	NULL
the	NULL
cups	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
others	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
harmless	NULL
.	NULL

Ferdinando	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
minion	NULL

carries	NULL
them	NULL
away	NULL

Hagar	NULL
puts	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
cup	NULL
which	NULL
holds	NULL
the	NULL
poison	NULL
meant	NULL
for	NULL
Roderigo	NULL

Hugo	NULL
,	NULL
getting	NULL
thirsty	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
warble	NULL
,	NULL
drinks	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
loses	NULL
his	NULL
wits	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
clutching	NULL
and	NULL
stamping	NULL
,	NULL
falls	NULL
flat	NULL
and	NULL
dies	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Hagar	NULL
informs	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
has	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
song	NULL
of	NULL
exquisite	NULL
power	NULL
and	NULL
melody	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
truly	NULL
thrilling	NULL
scene	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
some	NULL
persons	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
sudden	NULL
tumbling	NULL
down	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
quantity	NULL
of	NULL
long	NULL
red	NULL
hair	NULL
rather	NULL
marred	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
villain	NULL

death	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
curtain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
propriety	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
leading	NULL
Hagar	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
singing	NULL
was	NULL
considered	NULL
more	NULL
wonderful	NULL
than	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
performance	NULL
put	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

Act	NULL
fourth	NULL
displayed	NULL
the	NULL
despairing	NULL
Roderigo	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
stabbing	NULL
himself	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
told	NULL
that	NULL
Zara	NULL
has	NULL
deserted	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
dagger	NULL
is	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
lovely	NULL
song	NULL
is	NULL
sung	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
informing	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
Zara	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
danger	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
can	NULL
save	NULL
her	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
key	NULL
is	NULL
thrown	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
unlocks	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
spasm	NULL
of	NULL
rapture	NULL
he	NULL
tears	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
chains	NULL
and	NULL
rushes	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
and	NULL
rescue	NULL
his	NULL
lady	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

Act	NULL
fifth	NULL
opened	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
stormy	NULL
scene	NULL
between	NULL
Zara	NULL
and	NULL
Don	NULL
Pedro	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wishes	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
convent	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
hear	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
touching	NULL
appeal	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
faint	NULL
when	NULL
Roderigo	NULL
dashes	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
demands	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

Don	NULL
Pedro	NULL
refuses	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
rich	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
shout	NULL
and	NULL
gesticulate	NULL
tremendously	NULL
but	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
agree	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Rodrigo	NULL
is	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
exhausted	NULL
Zara	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
timid	NULL
servant	NULL
enters	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
bag	NULL
from	NULL
Hagar	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
mysteriously	NULL
disappeared	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
latter	NULL
informs	NULL
the	NULL
party	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
bequeaths	NULL
untold	NULL
wealth	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
pair	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
awful	NULL
doom	NULL
to	NULL
Don	NULL
Pedro	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL
make	NULL
them	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bag	NULL
is	NULL
opened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
several	NULL
quarts	NULL
of	NULL
tin	NULL
money	NULL
shower	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
stage	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
quite	NULL
glorified	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
glitter	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
entirely	NULL
softens	NULL
the	NULL
stern	NULL
sire	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
consents	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
murmur	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
join	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
joyful	NULL
chorus	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
curtain	NULL
falls	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
lovers	NULL
kneeling	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
Don	NULL
Pedro	NULL
's	NULL
blessing	NULL
in	NULL
attitudes	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
romantic	NULL
grace	NULL
.	NULL

Tumultuous	NULL
applause	NULL
followed	NULL
but	NULL
received	NULL
an	NULL
unexpected	NULL
check	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
cot	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
dress	NULL
circle	NULL
was	NULL
built	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
shut	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
extinguished	NULL
the	NULL
enthusiastic	NULL
audience	NULL
.	NULL

Roderigo	NULL
and	NULL
Don	NULL
Pedro	NULL
flew	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rescue	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
were	NULL
taken	NULL
out	NULL
unhurt	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
many	NULL
were	NULL
speechless	NULL
with	NULL
laughter	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
excitement	NULL
had	NULL
hardly	NULL
subsided	NULL
when	NULL
Hannah	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
"	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL

compliments	NULL

and	NULL
would	NULL
the	NULL
ladies	NULL
walk	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
supper	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
surprise	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
actors	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
in	NULL
rapturous	NULL
amazement	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
Marmee	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
treat	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
anything	NULL

fine	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
unheard	NULL
of	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
departed	NULL
days	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL

four	NULL

It	NULL
quite	NULL
took	NULL
their	NULL
breath	NULL
away	NULL

they	NULL
stared	NULL
first	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL

then	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
mother	NULL

stood	NULL
about	NULL

with	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
carefully	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL

felt	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
out	NULL

Half	NULL
a	NULL

talking	NULL

one	NULL

She	NULL
telegraphed	NULL
her	NULL
wish	NULL

Meg	NULL

the	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
so	NULL
alarmingly	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL

away	NULL

She	NULL

amuse	NULL
herself	NULL

the	NULL

breadth	NULL

so	NULL
she	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
people	NULL
rather	NULL
forlornly	NULL

the	NULL

Meg	NULL
was	NULL
asked	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL

the	NULL

tripped	NULL
about	NULL

briskly	NULL
that	NULL
none	NULL

have	NULL
guessed	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
their	NULL
wearer	NULL
suffered	NULL
smilingly	NULL

Jo	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL

youth	NULL
approaching	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
fearing	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL

engage	NULL
her	NULL

she	NULL
slipped	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
curtained	NULL
recess	NULL

intending	NULL

herself	NULL
in	NULL
peace	NULL

Unfortunately	NULL
,	NULL
another	NULL

chosen	NULL
the	NULL

behind	NULL

Jo	NULL

preparing	NULL

back	NULL
out	NULL
as	NULL
speedily	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
bounced	NULL
in	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
laughed	NULL

said	NULL
pleasantly	NULL

he	NULL
looked	NULL
a	NULL

The	NULL

sat	NULL
down	NULL
again	NULL

looked	NULL

yawning	NULL

A	NULL
low	NULL
hedge	NULL
parted	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
estates	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
brown	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
rather	NULL
bare	NULL
and	NULL
shabby	NULL
,	NULL
robbed	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vines	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
summer	NULL
covered	NULL
its	NULL
walls	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
flowers	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
then	NULL
surrounded	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
stately	NULL
stone	NULL
mansion	NULL
,	NULL
plainly	NULL
betokening	NULL
every	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
comfort	NULL
and	NULL
luxury	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
coach	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
well-kept	NULL
grounds	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conservatory	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
glimpses	NULL
of	NULL
lovely	NULL
things	NULL
one	NULL
caught	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
rich	NULL
curtains	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
lonely	NULL
,	NULL
lifeless	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
children	NULL
frolicked	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
lawn	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
motherly	NULL
face	NULL
ever	NULL
smiled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
few	NULL
people	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
grandson	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
lively	NULL
fancy	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
fine	NULL
house	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
enchanted	NULL
palace	NULL
,	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
splendors	NULL
and	NULL
delights	NULL
which	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
behold	NULL
these	NULL
hidden	NULL
glories	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
Laurence	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
known	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
the	NULL
party	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
eager	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
planned	NULL
many	NULL
ways	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
friends	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
seen	NULL
lately	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Jo	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
spied	NULL
a	NULL
brown	NULL
face	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
upper	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
wistfully	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
their	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
Beth	NULL
and	NULL
Amy	NULL
were	NULL
snow-balling	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
boy	NULL
is	NULL
suffering	NULL
for	NULL
society	NULL
and	NULL
fun	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
His	NULL
grandpa	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
's	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
keeps	NULL
him	NULL
shut	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL

He	NULL
needs	NULL
a	NULL
party	NULL
of	NULL
jolly	NULL
boys	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
somebody	NULL
young	NULL

lively	NULL

I	NULL
've	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL

!	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
idea	NULL
amused	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
daring	NULL
things	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
scandalizing	NULL
Meg	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
queer	NULL
performances	NULL

The	NULL
plan	NULL
of	NULL
'	NULL
going	NULL
over	NULL

was	NULL
not	NULL
forgotten	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
snowy	NULL
afternoon	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
what	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Lawrence	NULL
drive	NULL
off	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
sallied	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
dig	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hedge	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
paused	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
survey	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
quiet	NULL
,	NULL
curtains	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
windows	NULL
,	NULL
servants	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
sight	NULL

and	NULL
nothing	NULL
human	NULL
visible	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
curly	NULL
black	NULL
head	NULL
leaning	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
thin	NULL
hand	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
upper	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
he	NULL

thought	NULL
Jo	NULL

Up	NULL
went	NULL
a	NULL
handful	NULL
of	NULL
soft	NULL
snow	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
turned	NULL
at	NULL

lost	NULL

the	NULL

Jo	NULL
nodded	NULL

With	NULL
that	NULL

Jo	NULL
shouldered	NULL

into	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

wondering	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL

all	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
flutter	NULL

excitement	NULL

the	NULL

having	NULL

flew	NULL
about	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

Laurie	NULL

her	NULL

a	NULL

that	NULL

there	NULL

Mr.	NULL

The	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL

as	NULL
he	NULL
drank	NULL
his	NULL
four	NULL
cups	NULL

he	NULL

thought	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Laurence	NULL

as	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL

listened	NULL

He	NULL
liked	NULL
Jo	NULL

for	NULL
her	NULL
odd	NULL

blunt	NULL
ways	NULL
suited	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
one	NULL
herself	NULL

If	NULL
the	NULL
Laurences	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
what	NULL
Jo	NULL
called	NULL
'	NULL
prim	NULL

poky	NULL
'	NULL

she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
such	NULL
people	NULL
always	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
shy	NULL
and	NULL
awkward	NULL

But	NULL
finding	NULL
them	NULL
free	NULL
and	NULL
easy	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
impression	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
rose	NULL
she	NULL
proposed	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Laurie	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
something	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
conservatory	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
lighted	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
benefit	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
quite	NULL
fairylike	NULL
to	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
walks	NULL
,	NULL
enjoying	NULL
the	NULL
blooming	NULL
walls	NULL
on	NULL
either	NULL
side	NULL

the	NULL
soft	NULL
light	NULL

the	NULL
damp	NULL
sweet	NULL
air	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
wonderful	NULL
vines	NULL
and	NULL
trees	NULL
that	NULL
hung	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL

while	NULL
her	NULL
new	NULL
friend	NULL
cut	NULL
the	NULL
finest	NULL
flowers	NULL
till	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
were	NULL
full	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
tied	NULL
them	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
happy	NULL
look	NULL
Jo	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL

"	NULL

They	NULL
found	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Laurence	NULL
standing	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
drawing	NULL
room	NULL

but	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
attention	NULL
was	NULL
entirely	NULL
absorbed	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
grand	NULL
piano	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
stood	NULL
open	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
you	NULL
play	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL

turning	NULL
to	NULL
Laurie	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
respectful	NULL
expression	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Sometimes	NULL

he	NULL
answered	NULL
modestly	NULL

"	NULL

So	NULL
Laurie	NULL
played	NULL

Jo	NULL
listened	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
SIX	NULL
BETH	NULL
FINDS	NULL
THE	NULL
PALACE	NULL
BEAUTIFUL	NULL
The	NULL
big	NULL
house	NULL
did	NULL
prove	NULL
a	NULL
Palace	NULL
Beautiful	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Beth	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
the	NULL
lions	NULL
.	NULL

Old	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Laurence	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
biggest	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
called	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL
something	NULL
funny	NULL
or	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
talked	NULL
over	NULL
old	NULL
times	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
nobody	NULL
felt	NULL
much	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
timid	NULL
Beth	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
other	NULL
lion	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
poor	NULL
and	NULL
Laurie	NULL
rich	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
made	NULL
them	NULL
shy	NULL
of	NULL
accepting	NULL
favors	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
return	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
considered	NULL
them	NULL
the	NULL
benefactors	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
how	NULL
grateful	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
's	NULL
motherly	NULL
welcome	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
cheerful	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
comfort	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
humble	NULL
home	NULL
of	NULL
theirs	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
they	NULL
soon	NULL
forgot	NULL
their	NULL
pride	NULL
and	NULL
interchanged	NULL
kindnesses	NULL
without	NULL
stopping	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
pleasant	NULL
things	NULL
happened	NULL
about	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
friendship	NULL
flourished	NULL
like	NULL
grass	NULL
in	NULL
spring	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
one	NULL
liked	NULL
Laurie	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
privately	NULL
informed	NULL
his	NULL
tutor	NULL
that	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
Marches	NULL
were	NULL
regularly	NULL
splendid	NULL
girls	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

With	NULL
the	NULL
delightful	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
of	NULL
youth	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
solitary	NULL
boy	NULL
into	NULL
their	NULL
midst	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
something	NULL
very	NULL
charming	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
innocent	NULL
companionship	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
simple-hearted	NULL
girls	NULL
.	NULL

Never	NULL
having	NULL
known	NULL
mother	NULL
or	NULL
sisters	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
quick	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
the	NULL
influences	NULL
they	NULL
brought	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
busy	NULL
,	NULL
lively	NULL
ways	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
indolent	NULL
life	NULL
he	NULL
led	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
people	NULL
so	NULL
interesting	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
very	NULL
unsatisfactory	NULL
reports	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Laurie	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
playing	NULL
truant	NULL
and	NULL
running	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Marches	NULL

Never	NULL

take	NULL

holiday	NULL

such	NULL

parties	NULL
at	NULL

Meg	NULL

walk	NULL
in	NULL

conservatory	NULL
whenever	NULL
she	NULL

revel	NULL
in	NULL
bouquets	NULL

Jo	NULL

Beth	NULL

though	NULL
yearning	NULL
for	NULL

the	NULL

not	NULL

stared	NULL

so	NULL
hard	NULL
from	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL

and	NULL
said	NULL
"	NULL

so	NULL
loud	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL
frightened	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL

Mr.	NULL

ear	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL

set	NULL
about	NULL

During	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
made	NULL

he	NULL
artfully	NULL
led	NULL
the	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL

her	NULL

she	NULL
spoke	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL

Beth	NULL
blushed	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
rose	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
friendly	NULL
look	NULL
he	NULL
wore	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
frightened	NULL
now	NULL

and	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
a	NULL
grateful	NULL
squeeze	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
words	NULL
to	NULL
thank	NULL
him	NULL

the	NULL
precious	NULL
gift	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
softly	NULL
stroked	NULL
the	NULL
hair	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
forehead	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
stooping	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL

saying	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
tone	NULL
few	NULL
people	NULL
ever	NULL
heard	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL

once	NULL

And	NULL
away	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
hurry	NULL
.	NULL

Beth	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
rapture	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
rushed	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
impart	NULL
the	NULL
glorious	NULL
news	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
family	NULL
of	NULL
invalids	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
home	NULL

How	NULL
blithely	NULL
she	NULL
sang	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
woke	NULL
Amy	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
by	NULL
playing	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
seen	NULL
both	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
and	NULL
young	NULL
gentleman	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
Beth	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
retreats	NULL
,	NULL
fairly	NULL
got	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
as	NULL
noiselessly	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
mouse	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
drawing	NULL
room	NULL
where	NULL
her	NULL
idol	NULL
stood	NULL
.	NULL

Quite	NULL
by	NULL
accident	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
pretty	NULL
,	NULL
easy	NULL
music	NULL
lay	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
trembling	NULL
fingers	NULL
and	NULL
frequent	NULL
stops	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
Beth	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
touched	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
instrument	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
straightway	NULL
forgot	NULL
her	NULL
fear	NULL
,	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
everything	NULL
else	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
unspeakable	NULL
delight	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
music	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
beloved	NULL
friend	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stayed	NULL
till	NULL
Hannah	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
home	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
appetite	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
sit	NULL
and	NULL
smile	NULL
upon	NULL
everyone	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
beatitude	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
brown	NULL
hood	NULL
slipped	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
hedge	NULL
nearly	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
drawing	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
haunted	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
tuneful	NULL
spirit	NULL
that	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
unseen	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
never	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Laurence	NULL
opened	NULL
his	NULL
study	NULL
door	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
airs	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
never	NULL
saw	NULL
Laurie	NULL
mount	NULL
guard	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
to	NULL
warn	NULL
the	NULL
servants	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
never	NULL
suspected	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
exercise	NULL
books	NULL
and	NULL
new	NULL
songs	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rack	NULL
were	NULL
put	NULL
there	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
especial	NULL
benefit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
about	NULL
music	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
only	NULL
thought	NULL
how	NULL
kind	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
helped	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
she	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
herself	NULL
heartily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
always	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
granted	NULL
wish	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
hoped	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
grateful	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
blessing	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
greater	NULL
was	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
she	NULL
deserved	NULL
both	NULL

asked	NULL
Beth	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
eventful	NULL
call	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

replied	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
took	NULL
peculiar	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
granting	NULL
Beth	NULL
's	NULL
requests	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
so	NULL
seldom	NULL
asked	NULL
anything	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
many	NULL
serious	NULL
discussions	NULL
with	NULL
Meg	NULL
and	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
pattern	NULL
was	NULL
chosen	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
materials	NULL
bought	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
slippers	NULL
begun	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
cluster	NULL
of	NULL
grave	NULL
yet	NULL
cheerful	NULL
pansies	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
deeper	NULL
purple	NULL
ground	NULL
was	NULL
pronounced	NULL
very	NULL
appropriate	NULL
and	NULL
pretty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Beth	NULL
worked	NULL
away	NULL
early	NULL
and	NULL
late	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
occasional	NULL
lifts	NULL
over	NULL
hard	NULL
parts	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
nimble	NULL
little	NULL
needlewoman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
finished	NULL
before	NULL
anyone	NULL
got	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
wrote	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
simple	NULL
note	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
Laurie	NULL
's	NULL
help	NULL
,	NULL
got	NULL
them	NULL
smuggled	NULL
onto	NULL
the	NULL
study	NULL
table	NULL
one	NULL
morning	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
was	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
this	NULL
excitement	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
Beth	NULL
waited	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
happen	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
day	NULL
passed	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
before	NULL
any	NULL
acknowledgement	NULL
arrived	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
fear	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
offended	NULL
her	NULL
crochety	NULL
friend	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
an	NULL
errand	NULL

and	NULL
give	NULL
poor	NULL
Joanna	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
invalid	NULL
doll	NULL

her	NULL
daily	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
return	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
three	NULL
,	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
four	NULL
heads	NULL
popping	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
parlor	NULL
windows	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
they	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
several	NULL
hands	NULL
were	NULL
waved	NULL

and	NULL
several	NULL
joyful	NULL
voices	NULL
screamed	NULL

began	NULL
Amy	NULL

gesticulating	NULL
with	NULL
unseemly	NULL
energy	NULL

she	NULL
got	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL

for	NULL
Jo	NULL
quenched	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
slamming	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

Beth	NULL
hurried	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
flutter	NULL
of	NULL
suspense	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
her	NULL
sisters	NULL
seized	NULL

bore	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
parlor	NULL
in	NULL

Beth	NULL
did	NULL
look	NULL

turned	NULL
pale	NULL
with	NULL
delight	NULL

surprise	NULL

for	NULL
there	NULL
stood	NULL
a	NULL

cabinet	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
lying	NULL
on	NULL

Beth	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
finish	NULL

he	NULL
looked	NULL
so	NULL
friendly	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
forgot	NULL

only	NULL

both	NULL

off	NULL

the	NULL

by	NULL

that	NULL
all	NULL

vanished	NULL

he	NULL
just	NULL
set	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL

laid	NULL
his	NULL

feeling	NULL
as	NULL

Beth	NULL
ceased	NULL

he	NULL
walked	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL

her	NULL

shook	NULL

cordially	NULL

touched	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Davis	NULL
had	NULL
evidently	NULL
taken	NULL
his	NULL
coffee	NULL
too	NULL
strong	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
east	NULL

which	NULL
always	NULL
affected	NULL

and	NULL
his	NULL
pupils	NULL

not	NULL
done	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
credit	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
he	NULL
deserved	NULL

Therefore	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
the	NULL

language	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL

He	NULL

as	NULL
nervous	NULL

"	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
word	NULL
'	NULL
limes	NULL
'	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
fire	NULL
to	NULL
powder	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
yellow	NULL
face	NULL
flushed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
rapped	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
desk	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
energy	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
Jenny	NULL
skip	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
seat	NULL
with	NULL
unusual	NULL
rapidity	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
stern	NULL
order	NULL
the	NULL
buzz	NULL
ceased	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fifty	NULL
pairs	NULL
of	NULL
blue	NULL

gray	NULL

were	NULL

Amy	NULL
rose	NULL
to	NULL
comply	NULL
with	NULL
outward	NULL
composure	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
secret	NULL
fear	NULL
oppressed	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
limes	NULL
weighed	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
conscience	NULL

Bring	NULL
with	NULL

the	NULL
limes	NULL

"	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
unexpected	NULL
command	NULL
which	NULL
arrested	NULL
her	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
seat	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL

whispered	NULL
her	NULL
neighbor	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
lady	NULL
of	NULL
great	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
hastily	NULL
shook	NULL
out	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
and	NULL
laid	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
down	NULL
before	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Davis	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
man	NULL
possessing	NULL
a	NULL
human	NULL
heart	NULL
would	NULL
relent	NULL
when	NULL
that	NULL
delicious	NULL
perfume	NULL
met	NULL
his	NULL
nose	NULL
.	NULL

Unfortunately	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Davis	NULL
particularly	NULL
detested	NULL
the	NULL
odor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fashionable	NULL
pickle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
disgust	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
wrath	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
quite	NULL

"	NULL
stammered	NULL
Amy	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Bring	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
immediately	NULL

"	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
despairing	NULL
glance	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
set	NULL

she	NULL
obeyed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL
So	NULL
I	NULL

Now	NULL
take	NULL
these	NULL

throw	NULL
them	NULL
out	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
simultaneous	NULL
sigh	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
created	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
gust	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL

fled	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
treat	NULL

from	NULL
their	NULL
longing	NULL

Scarlet	NULL
with	NULL
shame	NULL

anger	NULL

Amy	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL

fro	NULL
six	NULL
dreadful	NULL
times	NULL

as	NULL
each	NULL
doomed	NULL
couple	NULL

oh	NULL

so	NULL
plump	NULL
and	NULL
juicy	NULL

fell	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
reluctant	NULL
hands	NULL

a	NULL
shout	NULL
from	NULL

street	NULL

the	NULL
anguish	NULL

for	NULL

told	NULL

This	NULL

flashed	NULL

the	NULL

one	NULL

As	NULL

Mr.	NULL

gave	NULL
a	NULL
portentous	NULL

turning	NULL

him	NULL

Amy	NULL

bore	NULL
without	NULL

several	NULL

on	NULL
her	NULL

neither	NULL

that	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Davis	NULL
,	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
dreadful	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
bad	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
seat	NULL

and	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
pitying	NULL
faces	NULL

her	NULL
friends	NULL

the	NULL
satisfied	NULL
ones	NULL

to	NULL
face	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
shame	NULL
fresh	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
impossible	NULL

and	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
drop	NULL
down	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
break	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
with	NULL
crying	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
bitter	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
wrong	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Jenny	NULL
Snow	NULL
helped	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
taking	NULL
the	NULL
ignominious	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
fixed	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stove	NULL
funnel	NULL
above	NULL
what	NULL
now	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
sea	NULL
of	NULL
faces	NULL

stood	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
motionless	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
study	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
pathetic	NULL
figure	NULL
before	NULL
them	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
fifteen	NULL
minutes	NULL
that	NULL
followed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
proud	NULL
and	NULL
sensitive	NULL
little	NULL
girl	NULL
suffered	NULL
a	NULL
shame	NULL
and	NULL
pain	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
forgot	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
others	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
seem	NULL
a	NULL
ludicrous	NULL
or	NULL
trivial	NULL
affair	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
experience	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
twelve	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
governed	NULL
by	NULL
love	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
blow	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
touched	NULL
her	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
smart	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
ache	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
were	NULL
forgotten	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sting	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

The	NULL
fifteen	NULL

seemed	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL

they	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL

Mr.	NULL

did	NULL

Meg	NULL
bathed	NULL

Hannah	NULL
shook	NULL

Amy	NULL
had	NULL
soothed	NULL
her	NULL

by	NULL
turning	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
top	NULL
drawer	NULL
upside	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
.	NULL

Everything	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
hasty	NULL
glance	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
various	NULL
closets	NULL
,	NULL
bags	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
boxes	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
Amy	NULL
had	NULL
forgiven	NULL
and	NULL
forgotten	NULL
her	NULL
wrongs	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
Jo	NULL
was	NULL
mistaken	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
discovery	NULL
which	NULL
produced	NULL
a	NULL
tempest	NULL
.	NULL

Meg	NULL
,	NULL
Beth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Amy	NULL
were	NULL
sitting	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
late	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Jo	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
excited	NULL
and	NULL
demanding	NULL
breathlessly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Has	NULL
anyone	NULL
taken	NULL

"	NULL

Meg	NULL
and	NULL
Beth	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
No	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
surprised	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
poked	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
color	NULL
rise	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Amy	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL

"	NULL

cried	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
taking	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looking	NULL
fierce	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
frighten	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
braver	NULL
child	NULL
than	NULL
Amy	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL

And	NULL
Jo	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
shake	NULL

"	NULL
Scold	NULL

cried	NULL
Amy	NULL

getting	NULL

said	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
very	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
kindled	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
clutched	NULL
Amy	NULL
nervously	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

Amy	NULL
got	NULL
no	NULL
farther	NULL

for	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
hot	NULL
temper	NULL
mastered	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
shook	NULL
Amy	NULL
till	NULL
her	NULL
teeth	NULL
chattered	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
crying	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
of	NULL
grief	NULL

anger	NULL

Meg	NULL
flew	NULL
to	NULL
rescue	NULL
Amy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Beth	NULL
to	NULL
pacify	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Jo	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
beside	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
parting	NULL
box	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
ear	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
rushed	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
sofa	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garret	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finished	NULL
her	NULL
fight	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
storm	NULL
cleared	NULL
up	NULL
below	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
came	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
,	NULL
soon	NULL
brought	NULL
Amy	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
's	NULL
book	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
pride	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
regarded	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
family	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
literary	NULL
sprout	NULL
of	NULL
great	NULL
promise	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
little	NULL
fairy	NULL
tales	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Jo	NULL
had	NULL
worked	NULL
over	NULL
them	NULL
patiently	NULL
,	NULL
putting	NULL
her	NULL
whole	NULL
heart	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
hoping	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
something	NULL
good	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
print	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
copied	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
care	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
destroyed	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
manuscript	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
Amy	NULL
's	NULL
bonfire	NULL
had	NULL
consumed	NULL
the	NULL
loving	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
several	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
loss	NULL
to	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
Jo	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dreadful	NULL
calamity	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
never	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Beth	NULL
mourned	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
departed	NULL
kitten	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Meg	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
defend	NULL
her	NULL
pet	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
looked	NULL
grave	NULL
and	NULL
grieved	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Amy	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
love	NULL
her	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
pardon	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
act	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
now	NULL
regretted	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
tea	NULL
bell	NULL
rang	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
so	NULL
grim	NULL
and	NULL
unapproachable	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
all	NULL
Amy	NULL
's	NULL
courage	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
meekly	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
Please	NULL
forgive	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL
very	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
sorry	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
shall	NULL
forgive	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
was	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
stern	NULL
answer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
ignored	NULL
Amy	NULL
entirely	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
trouble	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
by	NULL
experience	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
Jo	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
mood	NULL
words	NULL
were	NULL
wasted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
wisest	NULL
course	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
till	NULL
some	NULL
little	NULL
accident	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
generous	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
softened	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
resentment	NULL
and	NULL
healed	NULL
the	NULL
breach	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
happy	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
sewed	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
their	NULL
mother	NULL
read	NULL
aloud	NULL
from	NULL
Bremer	NULL
,	NULL
Scott	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
Edgeworth	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
was	NULL
wanting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sweet	NULL
home	NULL
peace	NULL
was	NULL
disturbed	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
felt	NULL
this	NULL
most	NULL
when	NULL
singing	NULL
time	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Beth	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
play	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
stood	NULL
dumb	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
stone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Amy	NULL
broke	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
Meg	NULL
and	NULL
Mother	NULL
sang	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
efforts	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
cheery	NULL
as	NULL
larks	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
flutelike	NULL
voices	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
chord	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
felt	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
tune	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
Jo	NULL
received	NULL
her	NULL
good-night	NULL
kiss	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
whispered	NULL
gently	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
My	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
your	NULL
anger	NULL
.	NULL

Forgive	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
help	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
begin	NULL
again	NULL
tomorrow	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Jo	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
lay	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
motherly	NULL
bosom	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cry	NULL
her	NULL
grief	NULL
and	NULL
anger	NULL
all	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
tears	NULL
were	NULL
an	NULL
unmanly	NULL
weakness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
so	NULL
deeply	NULL
injured	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
really	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
quite	NULL
forgive	NULL
yet	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
she	NULL
winked	NULL
hard	NULL
,	NULL
shook	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
gruffly	NULL
because	NULL
Amy	NULL
was	NULL
listening	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
abominable	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL
deserve	NULL

be	NULL
forgiven	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

With	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
marched	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
merry	NULL
or	NULL
confidential	NULL
gossip	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
offended	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
overtures	NULL
of	NULL
peace	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
repulsed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
wish	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
humbled	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
more	NULL
injured	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
plume	NULL
herself	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
superior	NULL
virtue	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
particularly	NULL
exasperating	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
still	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
thunder	NULL
cloud	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
nothing	NULL
went	NULL
well	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
bitter	NULL
cold	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
dropped	NULL
her	NULL
precious	NULL
turnover	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
gutter	NULL
,	NULL
Aunt	NULL
March	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
attack	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fidgets	NULL
,	NULL
Meg	NULL
was	NULL
sensitive	NULL
,	NULL
Beth	NULL
would	NULL
look	NULL
grieved	NULL
and	NULL
wistful	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
home	NULL

and	NULL
Amy	NULL
kept	NULL
making	NULL
remarks	NULL
about	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
always	NULL
talking	NULL
about	NULL
being	NULL
good	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
even	NULL
try	NULL
when	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
set	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL

Jo	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL

off	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL

Amy	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL

looked	NULL
out	NULL

wrapping	NULL

Shivering	NULL

Amy	NULL
home	NULL

Jo	NULL

looking	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL

said	NULL
Meg	NULL
,	NULL
cheering	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
glanced	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
half-filled	NULL
trunk	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
many	NULL
times	NULL
pressed	NULL
and	NULL
mended	NULL
white	NULL
tarlaton	NULL

which	NULL
she	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
'	NULL

'	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
important	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
was	NULL
fine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Meg	NULL
departed	NULL
in	NULL
style	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
of	NULL
novelty	NULL
and	NULL
pleasure	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
had	NULL
consented	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
visit	NULL
rather	NULL
reluctantly	NULL
,	NULL
fearing	NULL
that	NULL
Margaret	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
more	NULL
discontented	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
begged	NULL
so	NULL
hard	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Sallie	NULL
had	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
good	NULL
care	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
pleasure	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
delightful	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
winter	NULL
of	NULL
irksome	NULL
work	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
mother	NULL
yielded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
daughter	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
taste	NULL
of	NULL
fashionable	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Moffats	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
fashionable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
simple	NULL
Meg	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
daunted	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
splendor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
elegance	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
occupants	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
kindly	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
frivolous	NULL
life	NULL
they	NULL
led	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
put	NULL
their	NULL
guest	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
ease	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
Meg	NULL
felt	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
understanding	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
particularly	NULL
cultivated	NULL
or	NULL
intelligent	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
their	NULL
gilding	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
conceal	NULL
the	NULL
ordinary	NULL
material	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
made	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
certainly	NULL
was	NULL
agreeable	NULL
to	NULL
fare	NULL
sumptuously	NULL
,	NULL
drive	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
carriage	NULL
,	NULL
wear	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
frock	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
do	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
enjoy	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
suited	NULL
her	NULL
exactly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
imitate	NULL
the	NULL
manners	NULL
and	NULL
conversation	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
little	NULL
airs	NULL
and	NULL
graces	NULL
,	NULL
use	NULL
French	NULL
phrases	NULL
,	NULL
crimp	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
take	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
dresses	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
fashions	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
more	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
of	NULL
Annie	NULL
Moffat	NULL
's	NULL
pretty	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
she	NULL
envied	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
sighed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
rich	NULL
.	NULL

Home	NULL
now	NULL
looked	NULL
bare	NULL
and	NULL
dismal	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
work	NULL
grew	NULL
harder	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
destitute	NULL
and	NULL
much-injured	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
gloves	NULL
and	NULL
silk	NULL
stockings	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
repining	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
young	NULL
girls	NULL
were	NULL
busily	NULL
employed	NULL
in	NULL
'	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
time	NULL
'	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
shopped	NULL
,	NULL
walked	NULL
,	NULL
rode	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
theaters	NULL
and	NULL
operas	NULL
or	NULL
frolicked	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Annie	NULL
had	NULL
many	NULL
friends	NULL
and	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
entertain	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
older	NULL
sisters	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
fine	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
engaged	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
extremely	NULL
interesting	NULL
and	NULL
romantic	NULL
,	NULL
Meg	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Moffat	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fat	NULL
,	NULL
jolly	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Moffat	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
fat	NULL
,	NULL
jolly	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
took	NULL
as	NULL
great	NULL
a	NULL
fancy	NULL
to	NULL
Meg	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
daughter	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

Everyone	NULL
petted	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
'	NULL
Daisey	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fair	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
turned	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
party	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
poplin	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
do	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
girls	NULL
were	NULL
putting	NULL
on	NULL
thin	NULL
dresses	NULL
and	NULL
making	NULL
themselves	NULL
very	NULL
fine	NULL
indeed	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
out	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
tarlatan	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
older	NULL
,	NULL
limper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shabbier	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
beside	NULL
Sallie	NULL
's	NULL
crisp	NULL
new	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

Meg	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
glance	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
burn	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
gentleness	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
proud	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
said	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Sallie	NULL
offered	NULL
to	NULL
dress	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Annie	NULL
to	NULL
tie	NULL
her	NULL
sash	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Belle	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
engaged	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
praised	NULL
her	NULL
white	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
kindness	NULL
Meg	NULL
saw	NULL
only	NULL
pity	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
poverty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
felt	NULL
very	NULL
heavy	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
by	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
laughed	NULL
,	NULL
chattered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
flew	NULL
about	NULL
like	NULL
gauzy	NULL
butterflies	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hard	NULL
,	NULL
bitter	NULL
feeling	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
pretty	NULL
bad	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
box	NULL
of	NULL
flowers	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
speak	NULL
,	NULL
Annie	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
cover	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
were	NULL
exclaiming	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
lovely	NULL
roses	NULL
,	NULL
heath	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fern	NULL
within	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
for	NULL
Belle	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
George	NULL
always	NULL
sends	NULL

these	NULL

ravishing	NULL

cried	NULL
Annie	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
sniff	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
are	NULL

Miss	NULL

a	NULL
note	NULL

put	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL

holding	NULL
it	NULL

Meg	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
fun	NULL

cried	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
fluttering	NULL
about	NULL
Meg	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
high	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
curiosity	NULL
and	NULL
surprise	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
note	NULL

said	NULL
Meg	NULL
simply	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
much	NULL
gratified	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
forgotten	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL

said	NULL
Annie	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
funny	NULL
look	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Meg	NULL
slipped	NULL
the	NULL
note	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
pocket	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
talisman	NULL
against	NULL
envy	NULL
,	NULL
vanity	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
false	NULL
pride	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
loving	NULL
words	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
her	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
flowers	NULL
cheered	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

Feeling	NULL
almost	NULL
happy	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
laid	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
ferns	NULL
and	NULL
roses	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
quickly	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
in	NULL
dainty	NULL
bouquets	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
breasts	NULL
,	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
skirts	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
offering	NULL
them	NULL
so	NULL
prettily	NULL
that	NULL
Clara	NULL

the	NULL
elder	NULL

told	NULL
her	NULL

saw	NULL
'	NULL

and	NULL
they	NULL
looked	NULL
quite	NULL
charmed	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
small	NULL
attention	NULL

Somehow	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL

finished	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
themselves	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Moffat	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
bright-eyed	NULL
face	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mirror	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
laid	NULL
her	NULL
ferns	NULL
against	NULL
her	NULL
rippling	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
fastened	NULL
the	NULL
roses	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dress	NULL
that	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
strike	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
shabby	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
herself	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
danced	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
's	NULL
content	NULL

Everyone	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
three	NULL
compliments	NULL
.	NULL

Annie	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
sing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
remarkably	NULL
fine	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

Major	NULL
Lincoln	NULL
asked	NULL
who	NULL
'	NULL
the	NULL
fresh	NULL
little	NULL
girl	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
eyes	NULL
'	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Moffat	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
dancing	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
'	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
dawdle	NULL

had	NULL
some	NULL

her	NULL

he	NULL
gracefully	NULL
expressed	NULL
it	NULL

So	NULL
altogether	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL
time	NULL

till	NULL
she	NULL
overheard	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
conversation	NULL

disturbed	NULL
her	NULL
extremely	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
just	NULL
inside	NULL

waiting	NULL
for	NULL

As	NULL
that	NULL

impossible	NULL

she	NULL
did	NULL
her	NULL

she	NULL
succeeded	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL

dreamed	NULL
what	NULL

She	NULL

very	NULL
glad	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL

all	NULL
over	NULL

she	NULL

quiet	NULL

her	NULL

her	NULL
hot	NULL

were	NULL
cooled	NULL
by	NULL

few	NULL
natural	NULL
tears	NULL

Those	NULL
foolish	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
well	NULL
meant	NULL
words	NULL

had	NULL
opened	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
world	NULL
to	NULL
Meg	NULL

much	NULL
disturbed	NULL
the	NULL
peace	NULL

the	NULL

one	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
till	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
as	NULL
happily	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
innocent	NULL
friendship	NULL
with	NULL
Laurie	NULL
was	NULL
spoiled	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
silly	NULL
speeches	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
overheard	NULL

Her	NULL
faith	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
shaken	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
worldly	NULL
plans	NULL
attributed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Moffat	NULL

who	NULL
judged	NULL
others	NULL

herself	NULL

the	NULL
sensible	NULL
resolution	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
contented	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
simple	NULL
wardrobe	NULL
which	NULL
suited	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
daughter	NULL
was	NULL
weakened	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
unnecessary	NULL

of	NULL
girls	NULL
who	NULL
thought	NULL
a	NULL

one	NULL

the	NULL

Poor	NULL
Meg	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
restless	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
heavy-eyed	NULL
,	NULL
unhappy	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
resentful	NULL
toward	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
half	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
herself	NULL
for	NULL
not	NULL
speaking	NULL
out	NULL
frankly	NULL
and	NULL
setting	NULL
everything	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

Everybody	NULL
dawdled	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
noon	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
found	NULL
energy	NULL
enough	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
up	NULL
their	NULL
worsted	NULL
work	NULL

Something	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
struck	NULL
Meg	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL

They	NULL
treated	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
respect	NULL

she	NULL
thought	NULL

took	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
tender	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
eyes	NULL
that	NULL
plainly	NULL
betrayed	NULL
curiosity	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
surprised	NULL

flattered	NULL
her	NULL

though	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
it	NULL
till	NULL
Miss	NULL
Belle	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
writing	NULL

said	NULL

Beth	NULL
began	NULL
by	NULL
rummaging	NULL
everything	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
closet	NULL
where	NULL
her	NULL
family	NULL
resided	NULL

but	NULL
getting	NULL
tired	NULL
before	NULL
half	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
establishment	NULL
topsy-turvy	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
music	NULL
,	NULL
rejoicing	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
dishes	NULL
to	NULL
wash	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
arranged	NULL
her	NULL
bower	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
white	NULL
frock	NULL
,	NULL
smoothed	NULL
her	NULL
curls	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
honeysuckle	NULL
,	NULL
hoping	NULL
someone	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
and	NULL
inquire	NULL
who	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
artist	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
appeared	NULL

an	NULL
inquisitive	NULL

who	NULL
examined	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL

she	NULL
went	NULL

walk	NULL

got	NULL
caught	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
shower	NULL

and	NULL
came	NULL
home	NULL
dripping	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
teatime	NULL
they	NULL
compared	NULL
notes	NULL

all	NULL
agreed	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
delightful	NULL

though	NULL
unusually	NULL
long	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Meg	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
went	NULL
shopping	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL

got	NULL
a	NULL
'	NULL
sweet	NULL

had	NULL
discovered	NULL

after	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
cut	NULL
the	NULL
breadths	NULL
off	NULL

that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
wash	NULL

which	NULL
mishap	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
slightly	NULL
cross	NULL

Jo	NULL
had	NULL
burned	NULL
the	NULL
skin	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
nose	NULL
boating	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
raging	NULL
headache	NULL
by	NULL
reading	NULL
too	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

Beth	NULL
was	NULL
worried	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
confusion	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
closet	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
difficulty	NULL
of	NULL
learning	NULL
three	NULL

four	NULL
songs	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Amy	NULL
deeply	NULL
regretted	NULL
the	NULL
damage	NULL
done	NULL
her	NULL
frock	NULL

for	NULL
Katy	NULL
Brown	NULL
's	NULL
party	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
like	NULL
Flora	NULL
McFlimsey	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
'	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
wear	NULL
'	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
these	NULL
were	NULL
mere	NULL
trifles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
assured	NULL
their	NULL
mother	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
experiment	NULL
was	NULL
working	NULL
finely	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
smiled	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
Hannah	NULL
's	NULL
help	NULL
did	NULL
their	NULL
neglected	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
keeping	NULL
home	NULL
pleasant	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
domestic	NULL
machinery	NULL
running	NULL
smoothly	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
astonishing	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
and	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
was	NULL
produced	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
resting	NULL

The	NULL
days	NULL
kept	NULL
getting	NULL
longer	NULL

longer	NULL

the	NULL
weather	NULL
was	NULL
unusually	NULL
variable	NULL

so	NULL
were	NULL
tempers	NULL

an	NULL
unsettled	NULL
feeling	NULL

everyone	NULL

Satan	NULL
found	NULL
plenty	NULL

the	NULL
idle	NULL
hands	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
height	NULL
of	NULL
luxury	NULL

Meg	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
sewing	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
found	NULL
time	NULL
hang	NULL
so	NULL
heavily	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
fell	NULL
to	NULL
snipping	NULL

spoiling	NULL
her	NULL
clothes	NULL

attempts	NULL

her	NULL
eyes	NULL
gave	NULL
out	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
sick	NULL
of	NULL

got	NULL
so	NULL
fidgety	NULL
that	NULL
even	NULL
good-natured	NULL
Laurie	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
quarrel	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
so	NULL
reduced	NULL
in	NULL
spirits	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
desperately	NULL
wished	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
with	NULL
Aunt	NULL

Beth	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
pretty	NULL

that	NULL
it	NULL

no	NULL
work	NULL

and	NULL
fell	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
ways	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
affected	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
her	NULL
tranquility	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
disturbed	NULL

that	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

This	NULL

gladly	NULL
accepted	NULL

Margaret	NULL
retired	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
parlor	NULL

she	NULL
hastily	NULL

her	NULL

taking	NULL
the	NULL

Jo	NULL

beginning	NULL

as	NULL

Leaving	NULL

Beth	NULL

departed	NULL

the	NULL
kitchen	NULL

was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL

Putting	NULL

slamming	NULL
the	NULL
stove	NULL
door	NULL
open	NULL

poking	NULL
vigorously	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
cinders	NULL

Having	NULL
rekindled	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL

she	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
market	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
heated	NULL

The	NULL
walk	NULL
revived	NULL
her	NULL
spirits	NULL

flattering	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL

bargains	NULL

she	NULL
trudged	NULL
home	NULL
again	NULL

after	NULL
buying	NULL
a	NULL

some	NULL

two	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL

cleared	NULL
up	NULL

the	NULL
dinner	NULL
arrived	NULL

the	NULL
stove	NULL

Hannah	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
a	NULL

bread	NULL

Meg	NULL

when	NULL
the	NULL

Sallie	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
laugh	NULL

but	NULL
Meg	NULL
nodded	NULL
and	NULL
lifted	NULL
her	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
as	NULL
high	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL

which	NULL
caused	NULL
the	NULL

vanish	NULL

put	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
oven	NULL
without	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
peeping	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
matters	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
also	NULL
saying	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
of	NULL
comfort	NULL
to	NULL
Beth	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
sat	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
winding	NULL
sheet	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
dear	NULL
departed	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
state	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
domino	NULL
box	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
straLanguage	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
describe	NULL
nge	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
helplessness	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
bonnet	NULL
vanished	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
despair	NULL
seized	NULL
them	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
later	NULL
Miss	NULL
Crocker	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
'd	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
this	NULL
lady	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
yellow	NULL
spinster	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sharp	NULL
nose	NULL
and	NULL
inquisitive	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
saw	NULL
everything	NULL
and	NULL
gossiped	NULL
about	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
disliked	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
taught	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
simply	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
old	NULL
and	NULL
poor	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
few	NULL
friends	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
Meg	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
easy	NULL
chair	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
entertain	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
questions	NULL
,	NULL
criticized	NULL
everything	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
stories	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
.	NULL

Language	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
describe	NULL
the	NULL
anxieties	NULL

experiences	NULL

exertions	NULL
which	NULL
Jo	NULL
underwent	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
dinner	NULL
she	NULL
served	NULL
up	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
standing	NULL
joke	NULL
.	NULL

Fearing	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
advice	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
energy	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
will	NULL
is	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
cook	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
boiled	NULL
the	NULL
asparagus	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
grieved	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
heads	NULL
cooked	NULL
off	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
stalks	NULL
harder	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bread	NULL
burned	NULL
black	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
salad	NULL
dressing	NULL
so	NULL
aggravated	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
fit	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lobster	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
scarlet	NULL
mystery	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
hammered	NULL
and	NULL
poked	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
unshelled	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
meager	NULL
proportions	NULL
concealed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
grove	NULL
of	NULL
lettuce	NULL
leaves	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
potatoes	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
hurried	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
the	NULL
asparagus	NULL
waiting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
done	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
blanc	NULL
mange	NULL
was	NULL
lumpy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
strawberries	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
ripe	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
looked	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
skilfully	NULL
'	NULL
deaconed	NULL
'	NULL

eat	NULL
beef	NULL

Jo	NULL

as	NULL
she	NULL
rang	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
later	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL

and	NULL
stood	NULL
,	NULL
hot	NULL

tired	NULL

dispirited	NULL

surveying	NULL
the	NULL
feast	NULL
spread	NULL
before	NULL
Laurie	NULL

accustomed	NULL

all	NULL

elegance	NULL

Miss	NULL
Crocker	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
tattling	NULL
tongue	NULL
would	NULL
report	NULL
them	NULL
far	NULL

Jo	NULL

was	NULL
the	NULL
fruit	NULL

for	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
sugared	NULL
it	NULL
well	NULL

and	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
pitcher	NULL
of	NULL
rich	NULL
cream	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
hot	NULL
cheeks	NULL
cooled	NULL
a	NULL
trifle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
drew	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
breath	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
pretty	NULL
glass	NULL
plates	NULL
went	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
everyone	NULL
looked	NULL
graciously	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
rosy	NULL
islands	NULL
floating	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sea	NULL
of	NULL
cream	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Crocker	NULL
tasted	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
wry	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
drank	NULL
some	NULL
water	NULL
hastily	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
refused	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
dwindled	NULL
sadly	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
picking	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
Laurie	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
eating	NULL
away	NULL
manfully	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
pucker	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
his	NULL
eye	NULL
fixed	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
plate	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
delicate	NULL
fare	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
heaping	NULL
spoonful	NULL
,	NULL
choked	NULL
,	NULL
hid	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
napkin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
precipitately	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

exclaimed	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
trembling	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Salt	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
sugar	NULL
,	NULL

the	NULL
cream	NULL

"	NULL
replied	NULL
Meg	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
tragic	NULL
gesture	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
uttered	NULL
a	NULL
groan	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
remembering	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
a	NULL
last	NULL
hasty	NULL
powdering	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
berries	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
boxes	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
neglected	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
milk	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
refrigerator	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
scarlet	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
verge	NULL
of	NULL
crying	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
met	NULL
Laurie	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
look	NULL
merry	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
heroic	NULL
efforts	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
comical	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
suddenly	NULL
struck	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
laughed	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
tears	NULL
ran	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
did	NULL
everyone	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
'	NULL
Croaker	NULL

as	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
called	NULL

the	NULL

ended	NULL
gaily	NULL

with	NULL
bread	NULL

olives	NULL
and	NULL
fun	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

said	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
rose	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Crocker	NULL
made	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL

to	NULL
tell	NULL

at	NULL
another	NULL

They	NULL
did	NULL
sober	NULL
themselves	NULL
for	NULL
Beth	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
.	NULL

Laurie	NULL
dug	NULL
a	NULL
grave	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
ferns	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
grove	NULL
,	NULL
little	NULL
Pip	NULL
was	NULL
laid	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
many	NULL
tears	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
tender-hearted	NULL
mistress	NULL

and	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
moss	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
a	NULL
wreath	NULL
of	NULL
violets	NULL
and	NULL
chickweed	NULL
was	NULL
hung	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stone	NULL
which	NULL
bore	NULL
his	NULL
epitaph	NULL
,	NULL
composed	NULL
by	NULL
Jo	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
struggled	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
dinner	NULL

Here	NULL
lies	NULL
Pip	NULL
March	NULL
,	NULL
Who	NULL
died	NULL
the	NULL
7th	NULL
of	NULL
June	NULL
;	NULL
Loved	NULL
and	NULL
lamented	NULL
sore	NULL
,	NULL
And	NULL
not	NULL
forgotten	NULL
soon	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ceremonies	NULL
,	NULL
Beth	NULL
retired	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
overcome	NULL
with	NULL
emotion	NULL
and	NULL
lobster	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
repose	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
beds	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
made	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
grief	NULL
much	NULL
assuaged	NULL
by	NULL
beating	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
pillows	NULL
and	NULL
putting	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
.	NULL

Meg	NULL
helped	NULL
Jo	NULL
clear	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
remains	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
feast	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
took	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
them	NULL
so	NULL
tired	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
agreed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
contented	NULL
with	NULL
tea	NULL
and	NULL
toast	NULL
for	NULL
supper	NULL
.	NULL

Laurie	NULL
took	NULL
Amy	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
deed	NULL
of	NULL
charity	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sour	NULL
cream	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
effect	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
temper	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
came	NULL
home	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
older	NULL
girls	NULL
hard	NULL
at	NULL
work	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
closet	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
success	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
experiment	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
the	NULL
housewives	NULL
could	NULL
rest	NULL
,	NULL
several	NULL
people	NULL
called	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
scramble	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
tea	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
got	NULL
,	NULL
errands	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
necessary	NULL
bits	NULL
of	NULL
sewing	NULL
neglected	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
minute	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
twilight	NULL
fell	NULL
,	NULL
dewy	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
they	NULL
gathered	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
porch	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
June	NULL
roses	NULL
were	NULL
budding	NULL
beautifully	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
each	NULL
groaned	NULL
or	NULL
sighed	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
tired	NULL
or	NULL
troubled	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
a	NULL
dreadful	NULL
day	NULL
this	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL

"	NULL

began	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
usually	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
has	NULL
seemed	NULL
shorter	NULL

said	NULL
Meg	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL

It	NULL

sighed	NULL
Beth	NULL
,	NULL
glancing	NULL
with	NULL
full	NULL
eyes	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
empty	NULL
cage	NULL
above	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL

"	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
place	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL

looking	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL

as	NULL
Beth	NULL
nestled	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
turned	NULL
toward	NULL
her	NULL

Laurie	NULL
lay	NULL
luxuriously	NULL
swinging	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
fro	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hammock	NULL
one	NULL
warm	NULL
September	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
wondering	NULL
what	NULL

neighbors	NULL
were	NULL
about	NULL

too	NULL
lazy	NULL
to	NULL

some	NULL
fancied	NULL
neglect	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
horse	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
flung	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
hammock	NULL
to	NULL
fume	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
stupidity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
peace	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lovely	NULL
day	NULL
quieted	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL

Staring	NULL
up	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
gloom	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
horse-chestnut	NULL
trees	NULL
above	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
dreamed	NULL
dreams	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
imagining	NULL
himself	NULL
tossing	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ocean	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
voyage	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
voices	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
ashore	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
flash	NULL
.	NULL

Peeping	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
meshes	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hammock	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL

Marches	NULL
coming	NULL
out	NULL

opening	NULL
his	NULL
sleepy	NULL
eyes	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
look	NULL

for	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
rather	NULL
peculiar	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
appearance	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
neighbors	NULL
.	NULL

Each	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
,	NULL
flapping	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
brown	NULL
linen	NULL
pouch	NULL
slung	NULL
over	NULL
one	NULL
shoulder	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
carried	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
staff	NULL
.	NULL

Meg	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
cushion	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
,	NULL
Beth	NULL
a	NULL
basket	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Amy	NULL
a	NULL
portfolio	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
walked	NULL
quietly	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
back	NULL
gate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
climb	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL
that	NULL
lay	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
river	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

that	NULL
's	NULL

Laurie	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL

forgot	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL

it	NULL

Though	NULL
possessed	NULL
of	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
hats	NULL

it	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
one	NULL

then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
hunt	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
key	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
discovered	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
were	NULL
quite	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
sight	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
leaped	NULL
the	NULL
fence	NULL

ran	NULL
after	NULL
them	NULL

Taking	NULL
the	NULL
shortest	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
boathouse	NULL

he	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
appear	NULL

no	NULL

came	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL

take	NULL
an	NULL
observation	NULL

A	NULL
grove	NULL

from	NULL

came	NULL
a	NULL
clearer	NULL

Laurie	NULL

peeping	NULL

It	NULL

Meg	NULL
sat	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL

sewing	NULL
daintily	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
FOURTEEN	NULL
SECRETS	NULL
Jo	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
busy	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garret	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
October	NULL
days	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
chilly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
afternoons	NULL
were	NULL
short	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
hours	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
lay	NULL
warmly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
showing	NULL
Jo	NULL
seated	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
sofa	NULL
,	NULL
writing	NULL
busily	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
papers	NULL
spread	NULL
out	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
trunk	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Scrabble	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
pet	NULL
rat	NULL
,	NULL
promenaded	NULL
the	NULL
beams	NULL
overhead	NULL
,	NULL
accompanied	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
oldest	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
young	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
very	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
whiskers	NULL
.	NULL

Quite	NULL
absorbed	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
scribbled	NULL
away	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
page	NULL
was	NULL
filled	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
signed	NULL
her	NULL
name	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
flourish	NULL
and	NULL
threw	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
pen	NULL
,	NULL
exclaiming	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
There	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
done	NULL
my	NULL
best	NULL
!	NULL

If	NULL
this	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
suit	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
till	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Lying	NULL
back	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
manuscript	NULL
carefully	NULL
through	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
dashes	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
putting	NULL
in	NULL
many	NULL
exclamation	NULL
points	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
little	NULL
balloons	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
tied	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smart	NULL
red	NULL
ribbon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sober	NULL
,	NULL
wistful	NULL
expression	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
plainly	NULL
showed	NULL
how	NULL
earnest	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
's	NULL
desk	NULL
up	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
tin	NULL
kitchen	NULL
which	NULL
hung	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
it	NULL
she	NULL
kept	NULL
her	NULL
papers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
safely	NULL
shut	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
Scrabble	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
likewise	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
literary	NULL
turn	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
circulating	NULL
library	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
books	NULL
as	NULL
were	NULL
left	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
by	NULL
eating	NULL
the	NULL
leaves	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
this	NULL
tin	NULL
receptacle	NULL
Jo	NULL
produced	NULL
another	NULL
manuscript	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
putting	NULL
both	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
pocket	NULL
,	NULL
crept	NULL
quietly	NULL
downstairs	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
to	NULL
nibble	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
pens	NULL
and	NULL
taste	NULL
her	NULL
ink	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
jacket	NULL
as	NULL
noiselessly	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
entry	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
roof	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
porch	NULL
,	NULL
swung	NULL
herself	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
grassy	NULL
bank	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
roundabout	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
composed	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
hailed	NULL
a	NULL
passing	NULL
omnibus	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rolled	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
very	NULL
merry	NULL
and	NULL
mysterious	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
anyone	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
watching	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL
her	NULL
movements	NULL
decidedly	NULL
peculiar	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
on	NULL
alighting	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
off	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
pace	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
reached	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
number	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
busy	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
difficulty	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
doorway	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
dirty	NULL
stairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
standing	NULL
stock	NULL
still	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
dived	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
away	NULL
as	NULL
rapidly	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
maneuver	NULL
she	NULL
repeated	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
amusement	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
black-eyed	NULL
young	NULL
gentleman	NULL
lounging	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
building	NULL
opposite	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
returning	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
gave	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL
shake	NULL
,	NULL
pulled	NULL
her	NULL
hat	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
teeth	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dentist	NULL
's	NULL
sign	NULL
,	NULL
among	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
adorned	NULL
the	NULL
entrance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
staring	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
artificial	NULL
jaws	NULL
which	NULL
slowly	NULL
opened	NULL
and	NULL
shut	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
set	NULL
of	NULL
teeth	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
gentleman	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
coat	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
post	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
opposite	NULL
doorway	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
shiver	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
like	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
has	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
'll	NULL
need	NULL
someone	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
her	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

In	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
Jo	NULL
came	NULL
running	NULL
downstairs	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
red	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
appearance	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
trying	NULL
ordeal	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
sort	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
gentleman	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
anything	NULL
but	NULL
pleased	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
nod	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
followed	NULL
,	NULL
asking	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
sympathy	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Did	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL

looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
friend	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
laugh	NULL

In	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
SEVENTEEN	NULL
LITTLE	NULL
FAITHFUL	NULL
For	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
the	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
virtue	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
house	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
supplied	NULL
the	NULL
neighborhood	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
amazing	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
everyone	NULL
seemed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
heavenly	NULL
frame	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
self-denial	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
fashion	NULL
.	NULL

Relieved	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
first	NULL
anxiety	NULL
about	NULL
their	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
insensibly	NULL
relaxed	NULL
their	NULL
praiseworthy	NULL
efforts	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
fall	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
old	NULL
ways	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
forget	NULL
their	NULL
motto	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
hoping	NULL
and	NULL
keeping	NULL
busy	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
easier	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
such	NULL
tremendous	NULL
exertions	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
Endeavor	NULL
deserved	NULL
a	NULL
holiday	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
many	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
caught	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
cold	NULL
through	NULL
neglect	NULL
to	NULL
cover	NULL
the	NULL
shorn	NULL
head	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
ordered	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Aunt	NULL
March	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
people	NULL
read	NULL
with	NULL
colds	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
liked	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
an	NULL
energetic	NULL
rummage	NULL
from	NULL
garret	NULL
to	NULL
cellar	NULL
,	NULL
subsided	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
to	NULL
nurse	NULL
her	NULL
cold	NULL
with	NULL
arsenicum	NULL
and	NULL
books	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
housework	NULL
and	NULL
art	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
well	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mud	NULL
pies	NULL
.	NULL

Meg	NULL
went	NULL
daily	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
pupils	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sewed	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
much	NULL
time	NULL
was	NULL
spent	NULL
in	NULL
writing	NULL
long	NULL
letters	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
reading	NULL
the	NULL
Washington	NULL
dispatches	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

Beth	NULL
kept	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
only	NULL
slight	NULL
relapses	NULL
into	NULL
idleness	NULL
or	NULL
grieving	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
duties	NULL
were	NULL
faithfully	NULL
done	NULL
each	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
sisters	NULL
'	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
forgetful	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
seemed	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
clock	NULL
whose	NULL
pendulum	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
a-visiting	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
got	NULL
heavy	NULL
with	NULL
longings	NULL
for	NULL
Mother	NULL
or	NULL
fears	NULL
for	NULL
Father	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
closet	NULL
,	NULL
hid	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
folds	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
dear	NULL
old	NULL
gown	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
moan	NULL
and	NULL
prayed	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
prayer	NULL
quietly	NULL
by	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Nobody	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
cheered	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
sober	NULL
fit	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
everyone	NULL
felt	NULL
how	NULL
sweet	NULL
and	NULL
helpful	NULL
Beth	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
comfort	NULL
or	NULL
advice	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
small	NULL
affairs	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
were	NULL
unconscious	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
experience	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
test	NULL
of	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
excitement	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
well	NULL
and	NULL
deserved	NULL
praise	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
their	NULL
mistake	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
ceasing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
learned	NULL
this	NULL
lesson	NULL
through	NULL
much	NULL
anxiety	NULL
and	NULL
regret	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Meg	NULL

I	NULL

there	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL

during	NULL
the	NULL

Amy	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL

be	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
work	NULL
for	NULL
Beth	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
service	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
hard	NULL

irksome	NULL

and	NULL
remembering	NULL

with	NULL

how	NULL

Laurie	NULL
haunted	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
restless	NULL
ghost	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Laurence	NULL
locked	NULL
the	NULL
grand	NULL
piano	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
reminded	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
neighbor	NULL
who	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
twilight	NULL
pleasant	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Everyone	NULL
missed	NULL
Beth	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
milkman	NULL
,	NULL
baker	NULL
,	NULL
grocer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
butcher	NULL
inquired	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Hummel	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
beg	NULL
pardon	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
thoughtlessness	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
shroud	NULL
for	NULL
Minna	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
neighbors	NULL
sent	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
comforts	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
wishes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
were	NULL
surprised	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
how	NULL
many	NULL
friends	NULL
shy	NULL
little	NULL
Beth	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
.	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
she	NULL
lay	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
bed	NULL
with	NULL
old	NULL
Joanna	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
wanderings	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
forget	NULL
her	NULL
forlorn	NULL
protege	NULL

She	NULL
longed	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
cats	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
them	NULL
brought	NULL
,	NULL
lest	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
get	NULL
sick	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
quiet	NULL
hours	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
anxiety	NULL
about	NULL
Jo	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sent	NULL
loving	NULL
messages	NULL
to	NULL
Amy	NULL
,	NULL
bade	NULL
them	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
write	NULL
soon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
often	NULL
begged	NULL
for	NULL
pencil	NULL
and	NULL
paper	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Father	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
neglected	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
soon	NULL
even	NULL
these	NULL
intervals	NULL
of	NULL
consciousness	NULL
ended	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
lay	NULL
hour	NULL
after	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
tossing	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
fro	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
incoherent	NULL
words	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
sank	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
sleep	NULL
which	NULL
brought	NULL
her	NULL
no	NULL
refreshment	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Bangs	NULL
came	NULL
twice	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
Hannah	NULL
sat	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
Meg	NULL
kept	NULL
a	NULL
telegram	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
desk	NULL
all	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
off	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Jo	NULL
never	NULL
stirred	NULL
from	NULL
Beth	NULL
's	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
of	NULL
December	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
wintry	NULL
day	NULL
indeed	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
bitter	NULL
wind	NULL
blew	NULL
,	NULL
snow	NULL
fell	NULL
fast	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
seemed	NULL
getting	NULL
ready	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Dr.	NULL
Bangs	NULL
came	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
long	NULL
at	NULL
Beth	NULL
,	NULL
held	NULL
the	NULL
hot	NULL
hand	NULL
in	NULL
both	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
laid	NULL
it	NULL
gently	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
voice	NULL
to	NULL
Hannah	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
If	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL

"	NULL

Hannah	NULL
nodded	NULL
without	NULL
speaking	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
twitched	NULL
nervously	NULL
,	NULL
Meg	NULL
dropped	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
chair	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
strength	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
limbs	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
standing	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pale	NULL
face	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
ran	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
parlor	NULL
,	NULL
snatched	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
telegram	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
throwing	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
rushed	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
storm	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
soon	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
noiselessly	NULL
taking	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
cloak	NULL
,	NULL
Laurie	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
March	NULL
was	NULL
mending	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
thankfully	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
heavy	NULL
weight	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
lifted	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
misery	NULL
that	NULL
Laurie	NULL
asked	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
What	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL

Is	NULL
Beth	NULL
worse	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

said	NULL
Jo	NULL

tugging	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
rubber	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
tragic	NULL
expression	NULL

asked	NULL
Laurie	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
seated	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
chair	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
rebellious	NULL
boots	NULL

seeing	NULL
how	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
shook	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

it	NULL

cried	NULL
Laurie	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
startled	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

it	NULL
is	NULL

she	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL
even	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL

She	NULL

there	NULL
's	NULL
nobody	NULL

"	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
tears	NULL
streamed	NULL
fast	NULL
down	NULL
poor	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
cheeks	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
stretched	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
helpless	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
groping	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL

Laurie	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL

whispering	NULL

he	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL

she	NULL
did	NULL
'	NULL
hold	NULL
on	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
warm	NULL
grasp	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
friendly	NULL
human	NULL
hand	NULL
comforted	NULL
her	NULL
sore	NULL
heart	NULL

and	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
lead	NULL
her	NULL
nearer	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Divine	NULL
arm	NULL
which	NULL
alone	NULL
could	NULL
uphold	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
trouble	NULL

Laurie	NULL
longed	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
something	NULL
tender	NULL
and	NULL
comfortable	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
fitting	NULL
words	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
gently	NULL
stroking	NULL
her	NULL
bent	NULL
head	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
thing	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL

far	NULL
more	NULL
soothing	NULL

the	NULL
most	NULL

words	NULL

for	NULL
Jo	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
unspoken	NULL
sympathy	NULL

and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
learned	NULL
the	NULL
sweet	NULL
solace	NULL
which	NULL
affection	NULL
administers	NULL
to	NULL
sorrow	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
she	NULL
dried	NULL
the	NULL
tears	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
relieved	NULL
her	NULL

looked	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

Jo	NULL

Down	NULL
went	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL

into	NULL
the	NULL
wet	NULL
handkerchief	NULL

she	NULL
cried	NULL
despairingly	NULL

never	NULL

Laurie	NULL
drew	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
across	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL

but	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL

he	NULL

Presently	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

again	NULL

laughed	NULL
hysterically	NULL

trembled	NULL

clung	NULL

her	NULL

He	NULL
patted	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
soothingly	NULL

finding	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
recovering	NULL

followed	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL

a	NULL
bashful	NULL

two	NULL

Jo	NULL

she	NULL

him	NULL

away	NULL

Why	NULL

you	NULL

I	NULL
got	NULL
fidgety	NULL

did	NULL
Grandpa	NULL

We	NULL

with	NULL

relief	NULL

the	NULL

A	NULL

something	NULL

Beth	NULL

Every	NULL

rejoiced	NULL

Beth	NULL

She	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL

the	NULL

pretty	NULL

well-kept	NULL
hair	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL

All	NULL
day	NULL
she	NULL

All	NULL
day	NULL
Jo	NULL

Mr.	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
rug	NULL

pretending	NULL

rest	NULL

staring	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
thoughtful	NULL
look	NULL

made	NULL
his	NULL
black	NULL
eyes	NULL
beautifully	NULL
soft	NULL

clear	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girls	NULL
never	NULL
forgot	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
sleep	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
kept	NULL
their	NULL
watch	NULL

with	NULL
that	NULL
dreadful	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
powerlessness	NULL

us	NULL

added	NULL
her	NULL

despondently	NULL

Here	NULL
the	NULL
clock	NULL
struck	NULL
twelve	NULL

both	NULL

themselves	NULL

over	NULL
her	NULL

The	NULL
house	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
as	NULL
death	NULL

and	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
wailing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
broke	NULL
the	NULL
deep	NULL
hush	NULL

Weary	NULL
Hannah	NULL
slept	NULL
on	NULL

and	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL

the	NULL
sisters	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
pale	NULL
shadow	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
fall	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
bed	NULL

An	NULL
hour	NULL
went	NULL
by	NULL

and	NULL
nothing	NULL
happened	NULL
except	NULL
Laurie	NULL
's	NULL
quiet	NULL
departure	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL

Another	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
no	NULL

came	NULL

and	NULL
anxious	NULL
fears	NULL
of	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
past	NULL

Jo	NULL

who	NULL
stood	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL

how	NULL
dreary	NULL
the	NULL

its	NULL
winding	NULL
sheet	NULL

heard	NULL
a	NULL
movement	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL

turning	NULL
quickly	NULL

saw	NULL
Meg	NULL
kneeling	NULL
before	NULL
their	NULL
mother	NULL

with	NULL
her	NULL

A	NULL
dreadful	NULL

to	NULL
her	NULL

the	NULL

pain	NULL
were	NULL
gone	NULL

the	NULL

so	NULL
pale	NULL

peaceful	NULL
in	NULL

utter	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
NINETEEN	NULL
AMY	NULL
'S	NULL
WILL	NULL
While	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
happening	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
Amy	NULL
was	NULL
having	NULL
hard	NULL
times	NULL
at	NULL
Aunt	NULL
March	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
her	NULL
exile	NULL
deeply	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
realized	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
beloved	NULL
and	NULL
petted	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

Aunt	NULL
March	NULL
never	NULL
petted	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
approve	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
well-behaved	NULL
little	NULL
girl	NULL
pleased	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Aunt	NULL
March	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
soft	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
heart	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
nephew	NULL
's	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
proper	NULL
to	NULL
confess	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
really	NULL
did	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
Amy	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
dear	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
mistakes	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
old	NULL
people	NULL
keep	NULL
young	NULL
at	NULL
heart	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
wrinkles	NULL
and	NULL
gray	NULL
hairs	NULL
,	NULL
can	NULL
sympathize	NULL
with	NULL
children	NULL
's	NULL
little	NULL
cares	NULL
and	NULL
joys	NULL
,	NULL
make	NULL
them	NULL
feel	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
can	NULL
hide	NULL
wise	NULL
lessons	NULL
under	NULL
pleasant	NULL
plays	NULL
,	NULL
giving	NULL
and	NULL
receiving	NULL
friendship	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sweetest	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Aunt	NULL
March	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
this	NULL
gift	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
worried	NULL
Amy	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
rules	NULL
and	NULL
orders	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
prim	NULL
ways	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
prosy	NULL
talks	NULL
.	NULL

Finding	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
more	NULL
docile	NULL
and	NULL
amiable	NULL
than	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
and	NULL
counteract	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
bad	NULL
effects	NULL
of	NULL
home	NULL
freedom	NULL
and	NULL
indulgence	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
Amy	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
taught	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
taught	NULL
sixty	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
process	NULL
which	NULL
carried	NULL
dismay	NULL
to	NULL
Amy	NULL
's	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
feel	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
fly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
web	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
strict	NULL
spider	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
wash	NULL
the	NULL
cups	NULL
every	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
polish	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
spoons	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
fat	NULL
silver	NULL
teapot	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
glasses	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
shone	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
dust	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
trying	NULL
job	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
a	NULL
speck	NULL
escaped	NULL
Aunt	NULL
March	NULL
's	NULL
eye	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
furniture	NULL
had	NULL
claw	NULL
legs	NULL
and	NULL
much	NULL
carving	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
dusted	NULL
to	NULL
suit	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Polly	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
fed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
lap	NULL
dog	NULL
combed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
trips	NULL
upstairs	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
things	NULL
or	NULL
deliver	NULL
orders	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
lame	NULL
and	NULL
seldom	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
big	NULL
chair	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
these	NULL
tiresome	NULL
labors	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
do	NULL
her	NULL
lessons	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
daily	NULL
trial	NULL
of	NULL
every	NULL
virtue	NULL
she	NULL
possessed	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
allowed	NULL
one	NULL
hour	NULL
for	NULL
exercise	NULL
or	NULL
play	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
she	NULL
enjoy	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

Laurie	NULL
came	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wheedled	NULL
Aunt	NULL
March	NULL
till	NULL
Amy	NULL
was	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
and	NULL
rode	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
capital	NULL
times	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
aloud	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sit	NULL
still	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
slept	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
usually	NULL
did	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
dropped	NULL
off	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
page	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
patchwork	NULL
or	NULL
towels	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Amy	NULL
sewed	NULL
with	NULL
outward	NULL
meekness	NULL
and	NULL
inward	NULL
rebellion	NULL
till	NULL
dusk	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
amuse	NULL
herself	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
till	NULL
teatime	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
evenings	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Aunt	NULL
March	NULL
fell	NULL
to	NULL
telling	NULL
long	NULL
stories	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
youth	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
unutterably	NULL
dull	NULL
that	NULL
Amy	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
intending	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
hard	NULL
fate	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
usually	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
squeezed	NULL
out	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
tear	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
Laurie	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
old	NULL
Esther	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
through	NULL
that	NULL
dreadful	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
parrot	NULL
alone	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
her	NULL
distracted	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
soon	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
admire	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
revenged	NULL
himself	NULL
by	NULL
being	NULL
as	NULL
mischievous	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
pulled	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
whenever	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
near	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
upset	NULL
his	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
milk	NULL
to	NULL
plague	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
newly	NULL
cleaned	NULL
his	NULL
cage	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
Mop	NULL
bark	NULL
by	NULL
pecking	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
while	NULL
Madam	NULL
dozed	NULL
,	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
names	NULL
before	NULL
company	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
behaved	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
respects	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
reprehensible	NULL
old	NULL
bird	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
endure	NULL
the	NULL
dog	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
fat	NULL
,	NULL
cross	NULL
beast	NULL
who	NULL
snarled	NULL
and	NULL
yelped	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
toilet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
lay	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
legs	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
idiotic	NULL
expression	NULL
of	NULL
countenance	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
times	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
cook	NULL
was	NULL
bad-tempered	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
coachman	NULL
was	NULL
deaf	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Esther	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
ever	NULL
took	NULL
any	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
lady	NULL
.	NULL

Esther	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Frenchwoman	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
with	NULL
'	NULL
Madame	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
mistress	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
rather	NULL
tyrannized	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
along	NULL
without	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
real	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
Estelle	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Aunt	NULL
March	NULL
ordered	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
obeyed	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
condition	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
her	NULL
religion	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
fancy	NULL
to	NULL
Mademoiselle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
amused	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
with	NULL
odd	NULL
stories	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
France	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Amy	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
Madame	NULL
's	NULL
laces	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
also	NULL
allowed	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
roam	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
examine	NULL
the	NULL
curious	NULL
and	NULL
pretty	NULL
things	NULL
stored	NULL
away	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
wardrobes	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
ancient	NULL
chests	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Aunt	NULL
March	NULL
hoarded	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
magpie	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
's	NULL
chief	NULL
delight	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
Indian	NULL
cabinet	NULL
,	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
queer	NULL
drawers	NULL
,	NULL
little	NULL
pigeonholes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
secret	NULL
places	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
kept	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
ornaments	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
precious	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
merely	NULL
curious	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
antique	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
examine	NULL
and	NULL
arrange	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
gave	NULL
Amy	NULL
great	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
the	NULL
jewel	NULL
cases	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
on	NULL
velvet	NULL
cushions	NULL
reposed	NULL
the	NULL
ornaments	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
adorned	NULL
a	NULL
belle	NULL
forty	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
garnet	NULL

Aunt	NULL
March	NULL
wore	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL

the	NULL

complacently	NULL

Esther	NULL

Esther	NULL

her	NULL
a	NULL

Amy	NULL
hung	NULL

The	NULL

was	NULL
very	NULL
sincere	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL

for	NULL
being	NULL
left	NULL
alone	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
need	NULL

some	NULL
kind	NULL
hand	NULL

hold	NULL
by	NULL
so	NULL
sorely	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
instinctively	NULL
turned	NULL

Friend	NULL

whose	NULL
fatherly	NULL
love	NULL
most	NULL
closely	NULL

She	NULL
missed	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
help	NULL

rule	NULL
herself	NULL

but	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
taught	NULL
where	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
and	NULL
walk	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
confidingly	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
Amy	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
pilgrim	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
now	NULL
her	NULL
burden	NULL
seemed	NULL
very	NULL
heavy	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
forget	NULL
herself	NULL

to	NULL
keep	NULL
cheerful	NULL

and	NULL
be	NULL
satisfied	NULL
with	NULL
doing	NULL
right	NULL

though	NULL
no	NULL

her	NULL

In	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
effort	NULL
at	NULL
being	NULL
very	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
decided	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Aunt	NULL
March	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
fall	NULL
ill	NULL
and	NULL
die	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
possessions	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
justly	NULL
and	NULL
generously	NULL
divided	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
cost	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
pang	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
giving	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
treasures	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
precious	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
's	NULL
jewels	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
play	NULL
hours	NULL
she	NULL
wrote	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
important	NULL
document	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
help	NULL
from	NULL
Esther	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
certain	NULL
legal	NULL
terms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
good-natured	NULL
Frenchwoman	NULL
had	NULL
signed	NULL
her	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
Amy	NULL
felt	NULL
relieved	NULL
and	NULL
laid	NULL
it	NULL
by	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
Laurie	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
witness	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
rainy	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
upstairs	NULL
to	NULL
amuse	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
chambers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
Polly	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
company	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
room	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
wardrobe	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
costumes	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
Esther	NULL
allowed	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
favorite	NULL
amusement	NULL
to	NULL
array	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
faded	NULL
brocades	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
parade	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
mirror	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
stately	NULL
curtsies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sweeping	NULL
her	NULL
train	NULL
about	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
rustle	NULL
which	NULL
delighted	NULL
her	NULL
ears	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
busy	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
day	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
hear	NULL
Laurie	NULL
's	NULL
ring	NULL
nor	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
peeping	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
gravely	NULL
promenaded	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
fro	NULL
,	NULL
flirting	NULL
her	NULL
fan	NULL
and	NULL
tossing	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
pink	NULL
turban	NULL
,	NULL
contrasting	NULL
oddly	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
blue	NULL
brocade	NULL
dress	NULL
and	NULL
yellow	NULL
quilted	NULL
petticoat	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
carefully	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
on	NULL
high-heeled	NULL
shoes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Laurie	NULL
told	NULL
Jo	NULL
afterward	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
comical	NULL
sight	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
mince	NULL
along	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
gay	NULL
suit	NULL

with	NULL
Polly	NULL
sidling	NULL
and	NULL
bridling	NULL
just	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
imitating	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
occasionally	NULL
stopping	NULL
to	NULL
laugh	NULL
or	NULL
exclaim	NULL

added	NULL
it	NULL

TWENTY	NULL
CONFIDENTIAL	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL

I	NULL

any	NULL
words	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL

Such	NULL
hours	NULL
are	NULL
beautiful	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
very	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
describe	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
leave	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
imagination	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
readers	NULL
,	NULL
merely	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
genuine	NULL
happiness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
Meg	NULL
's	NULL
tender	NULL
hope	NULL
was	NULL
realized	NULL

for	NULL

Beth	NULL
woke	NULL

healing	NULL

the	NULL
first	NULL

her	NULL

the	NULL

Too	NULL
weak	NULL
to	NULL
wonder	NULL
at	NULL
anything	NULL

she	NULL
only	NULL
smiled	NULL

nestled	NULL
close	NULL

about	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
hungry	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
slept	NULL
again	NULL

the	NULL
girls	NULL
waited	NULL
upon	NULL

mother	NULL

up	NULL
'	NULL
an	NULL
astonishing	NULL
breakfast	NULL

Meg	NULL

fed	NULL

the	NULL

Laurie	NULL
's	NULL

arrived	NULL

out	NULL

fatigue	NULL

anxiety	NULL

What	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
yet	NULL
pleasant	NULL
day	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL

So	NULL
brilliant	NULL

gay	NULL
without	NULL

for	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL

abroad	NULL

So	NULL
quiet	NULL

reposeful	NULL
within	NULL

for	NULL
everyone	NULL
slept	NULL

spent	NULL
with	NULL
watching	NULL

a	NULL
Sabbath	NULL
stillness	NULL
reigned	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

while	NULL
nodding	NULL
Hannah	NULL
mounted	NULL
guard	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
blissful	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
burdens	NULL
lifted	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
Meg	NULL
and	NULL
Jo	NULL
closed	NULL
their	NULL
weary	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lay	NULL
at	NULL
rest	NULL

like	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
would	NULL

leave	NULL

often	NULL

brood	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL

like	NULL

Laurie	NULL
meanwhile	NULL
posted	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
comfort	NULL
Amy	NULL

and	NULL
told	NULL
his	NULL
story	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
that	NULL
Aunt	NULL
March	NULL
actually	NULL
'	NULL
sniffed	NULL
'	NULL
herself	NULL

never	NULL
once	NULL
said	NULL

Amy	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
so	NULL
strong	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
occasion	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
thoughts	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
chapel	NULL
really	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
fruit	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
dried	NULL
her	NULL
tears	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
restrained	NULL
her	NULL
impatience	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
even	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
turquoise	NULL
ring	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
heartily	NULL
agreed	NULL
in	NULL
Laurie	NULL
's	NULL
opinion	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
behaved	NULL
'	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
capital	NULL
little	NULL
woman	NULL
'	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
Polly	NULL
seemed	NULL
impressed	NULL

for	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
blessed	NULL
her	NULL
buttons	NULL

begged	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL

"	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
most	NULL
affable	NULL
tone	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
very	NULL
gladly	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
enjoy	NULL
the	NULL
bright	NULL
wintry	NULL
weather	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
discovering	NULL
that	NULL
Laurie	NULL
was	NULL
dropping	NULL
with	NULL
sleep	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
manful	NULL
efforts	NULL
to	NULL
conceal	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
persuaded	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
rest	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
wrote	NULL
a	NULL
note	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL

both	NULL

while	NULL
Aunt	NULL
March	NULL
had	NULL
pulled	NULL
down	NULL

curtains	NULL

sat	NULL
doing	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
unusual	NULL
fit	NULL
of	NULL
benignity	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
wake	NULL
up	NULL
till	NULL
night	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
sure	NULL

by	NULL
Amy	NULL
's	NULL

about	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
TWENTY-TWO	NULL
PLEASANT	NULL
MEADOWS	NULL
Like	NULL
sunshine	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
storm	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
peaceful	NULL
weeks	NULL
which	NULL
followed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
invalids	NULL
improved	NULL
rapidly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
March	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
returning	NULL
early	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

Beth	NULL
was	NULL
soon	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
lie	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
study	NULL
sofa	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
amusing	NULL
herself	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
well-beloved	NULL
cats	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
with	NULL
doll	NULL
's	NULL
sewing	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
sadly	NULL
behind-hand	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
once	NULL
active	NULL
limbs	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
stiff	NULL
and	NULL
feeble	NULL
that	NULL
Jo	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
daily	NULL
airing	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
strong	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

Meg	NULL
cheerfully	NULL
blackened	NULL
and	NULL
burned	NULL
her	NULL
white	NULL
hands	NULL
cooking	NULL
delicate	NULL
messes	NULL
for	NULL
'	NULL
the	NULL
dear	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Amy	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
loyal	NULL
slave	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ring	NULL
,	NULL
celebrated	NULL
her	NULL
return	NULL
by	NULL
giving	NULL
away	NULL
as	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
treasures	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
prevail	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
sisters	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
Christmas	NULL
approached	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
mysteries	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
haunt	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Jo	NULL
frequently	NULL
convulsed	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
by	NULL
proposing	NULL
utterly	NULL
impossible	NULL
or	NULL
magnificently	NULL
absurd	NULL
ceremonies	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
honor	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
unusually	NULL
merry	NULL
Christmas	NULL
.	NULL

Laurie	NULL
was	NULL
equally	NULL
impracticable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
bonfires	NULL
,	NULL
skyrockets	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
triumphal	NULL
arches	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
many	NULL
skirmishes	NULL
and	NULL
snubbings	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
ambitious	NULL
pair	NULL
were	NULL
considered	NULL
effectually	NULL
quenched	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
about	NULL
with	NULL
forlorn	NULL
faces	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
rather	NULL
belied	NULL
by	NULL
explosions	NULL
of	NULL
laughter	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
got	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

Several	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
unusually	NULL
mild	NULL
weather	NULL
fitly	NULL
ushered	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
splendid	NULL
Christmas	NULL
Day	NULL
.	NULL

Hannah	NULL
'	NULL
felt	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
bones	NULL
'	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
an	NULL
unusually	NULL
fine	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
proved	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL
true	NULL
prophetess	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
everybody	NULL
and	NULL
everything	NULL
seemed	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
produce	NULL
a	NULL
grand	NULL
success	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
begin	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
March	NULL
wrote	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
soon	NULL
be	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
Beth	NULL
felt	NULL
uncommonly	NULL
well	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
dressed	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
gift	NULL

a	NULL
soft	NULL
crimson	NULL
merino	NULL
wrapper	NULL

was	NULL
borne	NULL
in	NULL
high	NULL
triumph	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
to	NULL
behold	NULL
the	NULL
offering	NULL
of	NULL
Jo	NULL

Laurie	NULL

The	NULL
Unquenchables	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
their	NULL
best	NULL

elves	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
worked	NULL
by	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
conjured	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
comical	NULL
surprise	NULL

Out	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

stood	NULL
a	NULL

crowned	NULL

How	NULL
Beth	NULL
laughed	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL

how	NULL
Laurie	NULL
ran	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

what	NULL

said	NULL
Beth	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
sighing	NULL
with	NULL
contentment	NULL
as	NULL
Jo	NULL
carried	NULL
her	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
study	NULL
to	NULL
rest	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
excitement	NULL

and	NULL
to	NULL
refresh	NULL
herself	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

poring	NULL
over	NULL

the	NULL

cried	NULL
Meg	NULL

smoothing	NULL
the	NULL
silvery	NULL
folds	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
silk	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Laurence	NULL

it	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
can	NULL

said	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
gratefully	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
went	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
Beth	NULL
's	NULL
smiling	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
caressed	NULL
the	NULL
brooch	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
gray	NULL
and	NULL
golden	NULL
,	NULL
chestnut	NULL
and	NULL
dark	NULL
brown	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
fastened	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
breast	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
workaday	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
things	NULL
do	NULL
happen	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
delightful	NULL
storybook	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
comfort	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
.	NULL

Half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
after	NULL
everyone	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
happy	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
hold	NULL
one	NULL
drop	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
drop	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL

Laurie	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
parlor	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
popped	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
in	NULL
very	NULL
quietly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
might	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
have	NULL
turned	NULL
a	NULL
somersault	NULL
and	NULL
uttered	NULL
an	NULL
Indian	NULL
war	NULL
whoop	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
suppressed	NULL
excitement	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
so	NULL
treacherously	NULL
joyful	NULL
that	NULL
everyone	NULL
jumped	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
,	NULL
breathless	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Here	NULL
's	NULL
another	NULL
Christmas	NULL
present	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
March	NULL
family	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Before	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
were	NULL
well	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
whisked	NULL
away	NULL
somehow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
place	NULL
appeared	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
muffled	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
leaning	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
arm	NULL
of	NULL
another	NULL
tall	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
something	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
stampede	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
several	NULL
minutes	NULL
everybody	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
lose	NULL
their	NULL
wits	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
strangest	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
said	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
March	NULL
became	NULL
invisible	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
embrace	NULL
of	NULL
four	NULL
pairs	NULL
of	NULL
loving	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
disgraced	NULL
herself	NULL
by	NULL
nearly	NULL
fainting	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
doctored	NULL
by	NULL
Laurie	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
china	NULL
closet	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
kissed	NULL
Meg	NULL
entirely	NULL
by	NULL
mistake	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
somewhat	NULL
incoherently	NULL
explained	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Amy	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
dignified	NULL
,	NULL
tumbled	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
stool	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
stopping	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
hugged	NULL
and	NULL
cried	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
boots	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
touching	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
to	NULL
recover	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
held	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
warning	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Hush	NULL
!	NULL

Remember	NULL
Beth	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
study	NULL
door	NULL
flew	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
red	NULL
wrapper	NULL
appeared	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
threshold	NULL
,	NULL
joy	NULL
put	NULL
strength	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
feeble	NULL
limbs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Beth	NULL
ran	NULL
straight	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

Never	NULL
mind	NULL
what	NULL
happened	NULL
just	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL
hearts	NULL
overflowed	NULL
,	NULL
washing	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
bitterness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
and	NULL
leaving	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
sweetness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
romantic	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
hearty	NULL
laugh	NULL
set	NULL
everybody	NULL
straight	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Hannah	NULL
was	NULL
discovered	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
sobbing	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
fat	NULL
turkey	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
down	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
rushed	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
laugh	NULL
subsided	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
thank	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
faithful	NULL
care	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
suddenly	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
March	NULL
needed	NULL
rest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seizing	NULL
Laurie	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
precipitately	NULL
retired	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
invalids	NULL
were	NULL
ordered	NULL
to	NULL
repose	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
both	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
big	NULL
chair	NULL
and	NULL
talking	NULL
hard	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
March	NULL
told	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
longed	NULL
to	NULL
surprise	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
fine	NULL
weather	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
allowed	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
doctor	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
devoted	NULL
Brooke	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
altogether	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
estimable	NULL
and	NULL
upright	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
Mr.	NULL
March	NULL
paused	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
just	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
at	NULL
Meg	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
violently	NULL
poking	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
inquiring	NULL
lift	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
leave	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
.	NULL

Also	NULL
why	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
gently	NULL
nodded	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
abruptly	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
saw	NULL
and	NULL
understood	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
stalked	NULL
grimly	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
wine	NULL
and	NULL
beef	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
muttering	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
slammed	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
hate	NULL
estimable	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
with	NULL
brown	NULL
eyes	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

There	NULL
never	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
Christmas	NULL
dinner	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fat	NULL
turkey	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sight	NULL
to	NULL
behold	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Hannah	NULL
sent	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
stuffed	NULL
,	NULL
browned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
decorated	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
plum	NULL
pudding	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
melted	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
likewise	NULL
the	NULL
jellies	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Amy	NULL
reveled	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
fly	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
honeypot	NULL
.	NULL

Everything	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mercy	NULL
,	NULL
Hannah	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL

Mr.	NULL

all	NULL

another	NULL

Fifteen	NULL
minutes	NULL
after	NULL
Aunt	NULL
March	NULL

Jo	NULL
came	NULL
softly	NULL
downstairs	NULL

paused	NULL
an	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL
parlor	NULL

and	NULL
hearing	NULL
no	NULL

within	NULL

nodded	NULL

smiled	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
satisfied	NULL
expression	NULL

saying	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL

But	NULL
poor	NULL
Jo	NULL
never	NULL
got	NULL
her	NULL
laugh	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
transfixed	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
threshold	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
spectacle	NULL
which	NULL
held	NULL
her	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
staring	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
nearly	NULL
as	NULL
wide	NULL
open	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL

Going	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
exult	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
fallen	NULL
enemy	NULL

to	NULL
praise	NULL
a	NULL
strong-minded	NULL
sister	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
banishment	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
objectionable	NULL
lover	NULL

it	NULL
certainly	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
shock	NULL
to	NULL
behold	NULL
the	NULL

enemy	NULL
serenely	NULL
sitting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL

enthroned	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
knee	NULL

wearing	NULL
an	NULL
expression	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
abject	NULL
submission	NULL

Jo	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
gasp	NULL

as	NULL
if	NULL

for	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL

turning	NULL
of	NULL

her	NULL
breath	NULL
away	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
odd	NULL
sound	NULL
the	NULL
lovers	NULL
turned	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Meg	NULL
jumped	NULL
up	NULL

looking	NULL
both	NULL

'	NULL
that	NULL

Jo	NULL

kissed	NULL

"	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
adding	NULL
insult	NULL
to	NULL
injury	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
altogether	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL

making	NULL
some	NULL
wild	NULL
demonstration	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
vanished	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

Rushing	NULL
upstairs	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
startled	NULL
the	NULL
invalids	NULL
by	NULL
exclaiming	NULL
tragically	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL

Mr.	NULL

March	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL

casting	NULL
herself	NULL
upon	NULL

Jo	NULL
cried	NULL

tempestuously	NULL

told	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL
little	NULL

however	NULL

considered	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL

interesting	NULL

Jo	NULL
got	NULL
little	NULL
comfort	NULL
from	NULL

she	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

confided	NULL

Nobody	NULL
ever	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
parlor	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL

was	NULL
done	NULL

quiet	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
astonished	NULL
his	NULL

spirit	NULL
with	NULL

he	NULL
pleaded	NULL
his	NULL
suit	NULL

persuaded	NULL
them	NULL

arrange	NULL
everything	NULL
just	NULL

he	NULL
wanted	NULL
it	NULL

The	NULL
tea	NULL
bell	NULL
rang	NULL
before	NULL

describing	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
proudly	NULL

secretly	NULL
wishing	NULL

have	NULL
the	NULL

But	NULL
somehow	NULL
envy	NULL
and	NULL
discontent	NULL
soon	NULL
vanished	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
patient	NULL

labor	NULL
John	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL

awaiting	NULL
her	NULL

when	NULL

sat	NULL
together	NULL

the	NULL

always	NULL
grew	NULL
so	NULL
beautiful	NULL

bright	NULL
that	NULL

Jo	NULL
never	NULL

The	NULL
'	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL

were	NULL
heroes	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL

who	NULL
never	NULL
wearied	NULL

were	NULL
frequently	NULL

bask	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
these	NULL

creatures	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Laurie	NULL
brought	NULL
them	NULL
home	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
especially	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
this	NULL
high	NULL
honor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
became	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
belle	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL

for	NULL
her	NULL
ladyship	NULL
early	NULL
felt	NULL

learned	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
the	NULL
gift	NULL
of	NULL
fascination	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
endowed	NULL
.	NULL

Meg	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
absorbed	NULL
in	NULL

particular	NULL
John	NULL
to	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL

lords	NULL
of	NULL

and	NULL
Beth	NULL
too	NULL
shy	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
peep	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
wonder	NULL
how	NULL
Amy	NULL
dared	NULL
to	NULL
order	NULL
them	NULL
about	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Jo	NULL
felt	NULL
quite	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
element	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
refrain	NULL
from	NULL
imitating	NULL
the	NULL
gentlemanly	NULL
attitudes	NULL
,	NULL
phrases	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
feats	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
more	NULL
natural	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
decorums	NULL
prescribed	NULL
for	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
all	NULL
liked	NULL
Jo	NULL
immensely	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
never	NULL
fell	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
very	NULL
few	NULL
escaped	NULL
without	NULL
paying	NULL
the	NULL
tribute	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sentimental	NULL
sigh	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
at	NULL
Amy	NULL
's	NULL
shrine	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
speaking	NULL
of	NULL
sentiment	NULL
brings	NULL
us	NULL
very	NULL
naturally	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
Dovecote	NULL
'	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
brown	NULL
house	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL
had	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
Meg	NULL
's	NULL
first	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

Laurie	NULL
had	NULL
christened	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
highly	NULL
appropriate	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
gentle	NULL
lovers	NULL
who	NULL
'	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
together	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
turtledoves	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
first	NULL
a	NULL
bill	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
a	NULL
coo	NULL
'	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
tiny	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
garden	NULL
behind	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
lawn	NULL
about	NULL
as	NULL
big	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
pocket	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
Meg	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
fountain	NULL
,	NULL
shrubbery	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
profusion	NULL
of	NULL
lovely	NULL
flowers	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
just	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
the	NULL
fountain	NULL
was	NULL
represented	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
weather-beaten	NULL
urn	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
dilapidated	NULL
slopbowl	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
shrubbery	NULL
consisted	NULL
of	NULL
several	NULL
young	NULL
larches	NULL
,	NULL
undecided	NULL
whether	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
or	NULL
die	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
profusion	NULL
of	NULL
flowers	NULL
was	NULL
merely	NULL
hinted	NULL
by	NULL
regiments	NULL
of	NULL
sticks	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
where	NULL
seeds	NULL
were	NULL
planted	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
inside	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
altogether	NULL
charming	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
happy	NULL
bride	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
fault	NULL
from	NULL
garret	NULL
to	NULL
cellar	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
narrow	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
fortunate	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
piano	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
never	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
got	NULL
in	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
dining	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
small	NULL
that	NULL
six	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
tight	NULL
fit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
stairs	NULL
seemed	NULL
built	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
express	NULL
purpose	NULL
of	NULL
precipitating	NULL
both	NULL
servants	NULL
and	NULL
china	NULL
pell-mell	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
coalbin	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
once	NULL
get	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
these	NULL
slight	NULL
blemishes	NULL
and	NULL
nothing	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
complete	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
good	NULL
sense	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
taste	NULL
had	NULL
presided	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
furnishing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
was	NULL
highly	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
marble-topped	NULL

,	NULL

,	NULL
or	NULL
lace	NULL

in	NULL

In	NULL
vain	NULL
Meg	NULL
begged	NULL
him	NULL

stop	NULL

John	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL

Jo	NULL
called	NULL
him	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
TWENTY-FIVE	NULL
THE	NULL
FIRST	NULL
WEDDING	NULL
The	NULL
June	NULL
roses	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
porch	NULL
were	NULL
awake	NULL
bright	NULL
and	NULL
early	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
rejoicing	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
their	NULL
hearts	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cloudless	NULL
sunshine	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
friendly	NULL
little	NULL
neighbors	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
.	NULL

Quite	NULL
flushed	NULL
with	NULL
excitement	NULL
were	NULL
their	NULL
ruddy	NULL
faces	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
swung	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
,	NULL
whispering	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
peeped	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
dining	NULL
room	NULL
windows	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
feast	NULL
was	NULL
spread	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
climbed	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
nod	NULL
and	NULL
smile	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sisters	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
dressed	NULL
the	NULL
bride	NULL
,	NULL
others	NULL
waved	NULL
a	NULL
welcome	NULL
to	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
various	NULL
errands	NULL
in	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
porch	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
rosiest	NULL
full-blown	NULL
flower	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
palest	NULL
baby	NULL
bud	NULL
,	NULL
offered	NULL
their	NULL
tribute	NULL
of	NULL
beauty	NULL
and	NULL
fragrance	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
gentle	NULL
mistress	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
loved	NULL
and	NULL
tended	NULL
them	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

Meg	NULL
looked	NULL
very	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
rose	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
best	NULL
and	NULL
sweetest	NULL
in	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
soul	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
bloom	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
it	NULL
fair	NULL
and	NULL
tender	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
charm	NULL
more	NULL
beautiful	NULL
than	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
silk	NULL
,	NULL
lace	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
orange	NULL
flowers	NULL
would	NULL
she	NULL
have	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
a	NULL
fashionable	NULL
wedding	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
those	NULL
about	NULL
me	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
my	NULL
familiar	NULL
self	NULL

So	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
wedding	NULL
gown	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
sewing	NULL
into	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
tender	NULL
hopes	NULL
and	NULL
innocent	NULL
romances	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
girlish	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
sisters	NULL
braided	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
pretty	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
ornaments	NULL
she	NULL
wore	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
lilies	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
valley	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
'	NULL
her	NULL
John	NULL
'	NULL
liked	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
flowers	NULL
that	NULL
grew	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
do	NULL
look	NULL
just	NULL
like	NULL
our	NULL
own	NULL

Meg	NULL

only	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL

lovely	NULL

Amy	NULL

surveying	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL

all	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL

and	NULL
Meg	NULL
opened	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
sisters	NULL

who	NULL
clung	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
April	NULL
faces	NULL

a	NULL
minute	NULL

feeling	NULL

and	NULL
Meg	NULL
ran	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
perform	NULL
these	NULL
little	NULL
ceremonies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL

conscious	NULL

stand	NULL

a	NULL

in	NULL
their	NULL
appearance	NULL

for	NULL
all	NULL
are	NULL

Jo	NULL
's	NULL
angles	NULL
are	NULL

has	NULL
learned	NULL

herself	NULL

The	NULL

lengthened	NULL

more	NULL
becoming	NULL
to	NULL

gentle	NULL
words	NULL
fall	NULL
from	NULL

sharp	NULL

Beth	NULL
has	NULL
grown	NULL
slender	NULL
,	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
quiet	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
beautiful	NULL

kind	NULL

are	NULL

in	NULL
them	NULL
lies	NULL
an	NULL

although	NULL
it	NULL

Beth	NULL
seldom	NULL

Amy	NULL
is	NULL
with	NULL
truth	NULL
considered	NULL

the	NULL
flower	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL

for	NULL
at	NULL
sixteen	NULL

the	NULL
air	NULL

bearing	NULL
of	NULL

full-grown	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
beautiful	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
possessed	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
indescribable	NULL
charm	NULL
called	NULL
grace	NULL

One	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lines	NULL

her	NULL
figure	NULL

the	NULL
make	NULL

motion	NULL

her	NULL
hands	NULL

the	NULL
flow	NULL

her	NULL
dress	NULL

the	NULL
droop	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL

unconscious	NULL

harmonious	NULL

as	NULL
attractive	NULL

many	NULL
as	NULL
beauty	NULL
itself	NULL

Amy	NULL
's	NULL
nose	NULL
still	NULL
afflicted	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
never	NULL
would	NULL
grow	NULL
Grecian	NULL

so	NULL
did	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
too	NULL
wide	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
decided	NULL
chin	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
offending	NULL
features	NULL
gave	NULL
character	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
whole	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL

consoled	NULL
herself	NULL

her	NULL
wonderfully	NULL
fair	NULL
complexion	NULL

keen	NULL
blue	NULL

,	NULL
and	NULL
curls	NULL
more	NULL

abundant	NULL

ever	NULL

All	NULL
three	NULL

with	NULL
blush	NULL

a	NULL

silence	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL

Mr.	NULL
March	NULL

the	NULL

their	NULL

gathered	NULL
close	NULL

as	NULL
if	NULL

Meg	NULL
up	NULL

The	NULL

voice	NULL
broke	NULL
more	NULL

which	NULL
only	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL

was	NULL
only	NULL
saved	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
demonstration	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
consciousness	NULL
that	NULL
Laurie	NULL

staring	NULL
fixedly	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
comical	NULL
mixture	NULL
of	NULL
merriment	NULL

emotion	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
wicked	NULL
black	NULL
eyes	NULL

Beth	NULL
kept	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
hidden	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
shoulder	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Amy	NULL
stood	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
graceful	NULL
statue	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
becoming	NULL
ray	NULL

sunshine	NULL
touching	NULL
her	NULL
white	NULL

the	NULL

It	NULL

all	NULL

the	NULL

looked	NULL
more	NULL

ever	NULL

Everybody	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
TWENTY-SIX	NULL
ARTISTIC	NULL
ATTEMPTS	NULL
It	NULL
takes	NULL
people	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL
talent	NULL
and	NULL
genius	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
ambitious	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
women	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
was	NULL
learning	NULL
this	NULL
distinction	NULL
through	NULL
much	NULL
tribulation	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
mistaking	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
for	NULL
inspiration	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
attempted	NULL
every	NULL
branch	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL
with	NULL
youthful	NULL
audacity	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lull	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
mud-pie	NULL
'	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
devoted	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
finest	NULL
pen-and-ink	NULL
drawing	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
showed	NULL
such	NULL
taste	NULL
and	NULL
skill	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
graceful	NULL
handiwork	NULL
proved	NULL
both	NULL
pleasant	NULL
and	NULL
profitable	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
over-strained	NULL
eyes	NULL
caused	NULL
pen	NULL

ink	NULL

be	NULL

While	NULL

undertook	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL

one	NULL

bumping	NULL

screaming	NULL

Amy	NULL
subsided	NULL

a	NULL
mania	NULL

A	NULL

quenched	NULL
the	NULL

answered	NULL
Amy	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL

beginning	NULL

fail	NULL

Shrouded	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
thick	NULL
veil	NULL

armed	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
genteel	NULL
traveling	NULL
basket	NULL

she	NULL
departed	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
cool	NULL

would	NULL
soothe	NULL
her	NULL
ruffled	NULL
spirit	NULL
and	NULL
fit	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
labors	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
some	NULL
delay	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
desire	NULL
was	NULL
procured	NULL
,	NULL
likewise	NULL
a	NULL
bottle	NULL

dressing	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
further	NULL

at	NULL

off	NULL
she	NULL

As	NULL

contained	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL

passenger	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sleepy	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL

Amy	NULL
pocketed	NULL
her	NULL
veil	NULL

beguiled	NULL
the	NULL
tedium	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
by	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
where	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL

So	NULL
busy	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
card	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
refractory	NULL
figures	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
observe	NULL
a	NULL
newcomer	NULL

who	NULL
entered	NULL
without	NULL
stopping	NULL
the	NULL
vehicle	NULL

till	NULL
a	NULL

looking	NULL
up	NULL

she	NULL
beheld	NULL
one	NULL

Laurie	NULL

Fervently	NULL
hoping	NULL
that	NULL

would	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
Amy	NULL
utterly	NULL
ignored	NULL
the	NULL
basket	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL

and	NULL
congratulating	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL

returned	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

poking	NULL
the	NULL

with	NULL

Amy	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL

nearly	NULL

as	NULL
her	NULL

said	NULL
Tudor	NULL

with	NULL
great	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL

and	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
sober	NULL
interest	NULL
that	NULL
did	NULL
credit	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
breeding	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
recovered	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
breath	NULL
,	NULL
set	NULL
her	NULL
basket	NULL
boldly	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
seat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
laughing	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL

thought	NULL
Amy	NULL

departed	NULL

went	NULL
through	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL

at	NULL
twelve	NULL

all	NULL
was	NULL

Feeling	NULL
that	NULL

she	NULL
wished	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
TWENTY-SEVEN	NULL
LITERARY	NULL
LESSONS	NULL
Fortune	NULL
suddenly	NULL
smiled	NULL
upon	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dropped	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
luck	NULL
penny	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
path	NULL

Not	NULL
a	NULL
golden	NULL
penny	NULL
,	NULL
exactly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
doubt	NULL
if	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
million	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
more	NULL
real	NULL
happiness	NULL
then	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
sum	NULL
that	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
wise	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
shut	NULL
herself	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
scribbling	NULL
suit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
'	NULL
fall	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
vortex	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
expressed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
writing	NULL

at	NULL
her	NULL

all	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
till	NULL
that	NULL

finished	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
no	NULL
peace	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
'	NULL
scribbling	NULL
suit	NULL
'	NULL
consisted	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
woolen	NULL
pinafore	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
wipe	NULL
her	NULL
pen	NULL
at	NULL
will	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
cap	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

material	NULL
,	NULL
adorned	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
cheerful	NULL
red	NULL
bow	NULL
,	NULL
into	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
bundled	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
decks	NULL
were	NULL
cleared	NULL
for	NULL
action	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
cap	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
beacon	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
inquiring	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
during	NULL
these	NULL
periods	NULL
kept	NULL
their	NULL
distance	NULL
,	NULL
merely	NULL
popping	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
semi-occasionally	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
interest	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Does	NULL

Jo	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
venture	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
this	NULL
question	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
took	NULL
an	NULL
observation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cap	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
judged	NULL
accordingly	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
this	NULL
expressive	NULL
article	NULL
of	NULL
dress	NULL
was	NULL
drawn	NULL
low	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
forehead	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sign	NULL
that	NULL
hard	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
exciting	NULL
moments	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
pushed	NULL
rakishly	NULL
askew	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
despair	NULL
seized	NULL
the	NULL
author	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
plucked	NULL
wholly	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cast	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
such	NULL
times	NULL
the	NULL
intruder	NULL
silently	NULL
withdrew	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
red	NULL
bow	NULL
was	NULL
seen	NULL
gaily	NULL
erect	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
gifted	NULL
brow	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
anyone	NULL
dare	NULL
address	NULL
Jo	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL
genius	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
means	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
writing	NULL
fit	NULL
came	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
herself	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
entire	NULL
abandon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
led	NULL
a	NULL
blissful	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
unconscious	NULL
of	NULL
want	NULL
,	NULL
care	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
bad	NULL
weather	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
safe	NULL
and	NULL
happy	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
imaginary	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
friends	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
real	NULL
and	NULL
dear	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
flesh	NULL
.	NULL

Sleep	NULL
forsook	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
meals	NULL
stood	NULL
untasted	NULL
,	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
night	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
too	NULL
short	NULL
to	NULL
enjoy	NULL
the	NULL
happiness	NULL
which	NULL
blessed	NULL
her	NULL
only	NULL
at	NULL
such	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
these	NULL
hours	NULL
worth	NULL
living	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
bore	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
fruit	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
divine	NULL
afflatus	NULL
usually	NULL
lasted	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
emerged	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
'	NULL
vortex	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
hungry	NULL
,	NULL
sleepy	NULL
,	NULL
cross	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
despondent	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
recovering	NULL
from	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
attacks	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
prevailed	NULL
upon	NULL
to	NULL
escort	NULL
Miss	NULL
Crocker	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
lecture	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
return	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
virtue	NULL
was	NULL
rewarded	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
idea	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
People	NULL
's	NULL
Course	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
lecture	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Pyramids	NULL

and	NULL
Jo	NULL
rather	NULL
wondered	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
choice	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
subject	NULL
for	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
audience	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
granted	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
great	NULL
social	NULL
evil	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
remedied	NULL
or	NULL
some	NULL
great	NULL
want	NULL
supplied	NULL
by	NULL
unfolding	NULL
the	NULL
glories	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Pharaohs	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
audience	NULL
whose	NULL
thoughts	NULL
were	NULL
busy	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
price	NULL
of	NULL
coal	NULL
and	NULL
flour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whose	NULL
lives	NULL
were	NULL
spent	NULL
in	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
solve	NULL
harder	NULL
riddles	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Sphinx	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
early	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
Miss	NULL
Crocker	NULL
set	NULL
the	NULL
heel	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
stocking	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
amused	NULL
herself	NULL
by	NULL
examining	NULL
the	NULL
faces	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
occupied	NULL
the	NULL
seat	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
her	NULL
left	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
matrons	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
massive	NULL
foreheads	NULL
and	NULL
bonnets	NULL
to	NULL
match	NULL
,	NULL
discussing	NULL
Women	NULL
's	NULL
Rights	NULL
and	NULL
making	NULL
tatting	NULL

Beyond	NULL
sat	NULL
a	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
humble	NULL
lovers	NULL
,	NULL
artlessly	NULL
holding	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
somber	NULL
spinster	NULL
eating	NULL
peppermints	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
paper	NULL

and	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
taking	NULL
his	NULL
preparatory	NULL
nap	NULL
behind	NULL
a	NULL
yellow	NULL

On	NULL
her	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
only	NULL
neighbor	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
studious	NULL
looking	NULL
lad	NULL
absorbed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
newspaper	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pictorial	NULL
sheet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Jo	NULL
examined	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL
nearest	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
idly	NULL
wondering	NULL
what	NULL
fortuitous	NULL
concatenation	NULL
of	NULL
circumstances	NULL
needed	NULL
the	NULL
melodramatic	NULL
illustration	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
Indian	NULL
in	NULL

tumbling	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL

with	NULL

while	NULL
two	NULL
infuriated	NULL
young	NULL
gentlemen	NULL

with	NULL
unnaturally	NULL
small	NULL
feet	NULL

big	NULL
eyes	NULL

were	NULL
stabbing	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
close	NULL
by	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
disheveled	NULL
female	NULL
was	NULL
flying	NULL
away	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
background	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
wide	NULL
open	NULL

Pausing	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
a	NULL
page	NULL

the	NULL
lad	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
looking	NULL

,	NULL
with	NULL
boyish	NULL

offered	NULL

accepted	NULL

for	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
outgrown	NULL
her	NULL

soon	NULL
found	NULL

Here	NULL
the	NULL

began	NULL

Jo	NULL
heard	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL

it	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
covertly	NULL
taking	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

was	NULL
already	NULL
deep	NULL

Her	NULL

did	NULL
both	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
ever	NULL
seeing	NULL
her	NULL
manuscript	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
arrived	NULL

almost	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
breath	NULL
away	NULL

opening	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
check	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL

into	NULL
her	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL

she	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL

been	NULL
a	NULL
snake	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
read	NULL
her	NULL
letter	NULL

began	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL

I	NULL

has	NULL
any	NULL

Jo	NULL
valued	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL

because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
encouraging	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
effort	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
a	NULL
sensation	NULL

A	NULL
prouder	NULL
young	NULL

was	NULL
seldom	NULL
seen	NULL

she	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
composed	NULL
herself	NULL

she	NULL
electrified	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
by	NULL
appearing	NULL
before	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL

in	NULL
one	NULL

the	NULL
check	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

announcing	NULL
that	NULL

won	NULL
the	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
came	NULL
everyone	NULL
read	NULL

praised	NULL
it	NULL

though	NULL
after	NULL

the	NULL
romance	NULL
fresh	NULL

the	NULL
tragedy	NULL
quite	NULL
thrilling	NULL

he	NULL
shook	NULL
his	NULL

To	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
earn	NULL
several	NULL

began	NULL

feel	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL

its	NULL

comes	NULL

Jo	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
a	NULL
taste	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL

ceased	NULL

envy	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
TWENTY-EIGHT	NULL
DOMESTIC	NULL
EXPERIENCES	NULL
Like	NULL
most	NULL
other	NULL
young	NULL
matrons	NULL
,	NULL
Meg	NULL
began	NULL
her	NULL
married	NULL
life	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
determination	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
model	NULL
housekeeper	NULL
.	NULL

John	NULL
should	NULL
find	NULL
home	NULL
a	NULL
paradise	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
always	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
smiling	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
fare	NULL
sumptuously	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
button	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
brought	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
energy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cheerfulness	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
but	NULL
succeed	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
obstacles	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
paradise	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
tranquil	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
woman	NULL
fussed	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
over-anxious	NULL
to	NULL
please	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
bustled	NULL
about	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
true	NULL
Martha	NULL
,	NULL
cumbered	NULL
with	NULL
many	NULL
cares	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
tired	NULL
,	NULL
sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
John	NULL
grew	NULL
dyspeptic	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
dainty	NULL
dishes	NULL
and	NULL
ungratefully	NULL
demanded	NULL
plain	NULL
fare	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
buttons	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
soon	NULL
learned	NULL
to	NULL
wonder	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
shake	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
carelessness	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
threaten	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
sew	NULL
them	NULL
on	NULL
himself	NULL

and	NULL
see	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
would	NULL
stand	NULL
impatient	NULL
and	NULL
clumsy	NULL
fingers	NULL
any	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
hers	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
after	NULL
they	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
live	NULL
on	NULL
love	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

John	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
Meg	NULL
's	NULL
beauty	NULL
diminished	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
beamed	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
familiar	NULL
coffee	NULL
pot	NULL
.	NULL

Nor	NULL
did	NULL
Meg	NULL
miss	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
romance	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
daily	NULL
parting	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
followed	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
kiss	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
tender	NULL
inquiry	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Shall	NULL

or	NULL
mutton	NULL

dinner	NULL

The	NULL
little	NULL
house	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
glorified	NULL
bower	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
couple	NULL
soon	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
they	NULL
played	NULL
keep-house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
frolicked	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
like	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
John	NULL
took	NULL
steadily	NULL
to	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
the	NULL
cares	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Meg	NULL
laid	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
cambric	NULL
wrappers	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
big	NULL
apron	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
before	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
energy	NULL
than	NULL
discretion	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
the	NULL
cooking	NULL
mania	NULL
lasted	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
through	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cornelius	NULL
's	NULL
Receipt	NULL
Book	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
mathematical	NULL
exercise	NULL

working	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
problems	NULL
with	NULL
patience	NULL

care	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
her	NULL
family	NULL
were	NULL
invited	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
eat	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
too	NULL
bounteous	NULL
feast	NULL

Lotty	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
privately	NULL
dispatched	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

failures	NULL

which	NULL
were	NULL

concealed	NULL
from	NULL
all	NULL

the	NULL
convenient	NULL

the	NULL
little	NULL

An	NULL
evening	NULL
with	NULL
John	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
account	NULL
books	NULL
usually	NULL
produced	NULL
a	NULL
temporary	NULL
lull	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
culinary	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
frugal	NULL
fit	NULL
would	NULL
ensue	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
put	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
bread	NULL
pudding	NULL
,	NULL
hash	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
warmed-over	NULL
coffee	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
tried	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
he	NULL
bore	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
praiseworthy	NULL
fortitude	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
the	NULL
golden	NULL
mean	NULL
was	NULL
found	NULL

however	NULL
,	NULL
Meg	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
domestic	NULL

what	NULL
young	NULL
couples	NULL
seldom	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
long	NULL
without	NULL

jar	NULL

Fired	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
housewifely	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
storeroom	NULL
stocked	NULL
with	NULL
homemade	NULL
preserves	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
undertook	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
currant	NULL
jelly	NULL
.	NULL

John	NULL
was	NULL
requested	NULL
to	NULL
order	NULL
home	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
of	NULL
little	NULL
pots	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
extra	NULL
quantity	NULL
of	NULL
sugar	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
currants	NULL
were	NULL
ripe	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
attended	NULL
to	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
John	NULL
firmly	NULL
believed	NULL
that	NULL
'	NULL
my	NULL
wife	NULL
'	NULL
was	NULL
equal	NULL
to	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
natural	NULL
pride	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
skill	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
resolved	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
gratified	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
only	NULL
crop	NULL
of	NULL
fruit	NULL
laid	NULL
by	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
pleasing	NULL
form	NULL
for	NULL
winter	NULL
use	NULL
.	NULL

Home	NULL
came	NULL
four	NULL
dozen	NULL
delightful	NULL
little	NULL
pots	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
barrel	NULL
of	NULL
sugar	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
boy	NULL
to	NULL
pick	NULL
the	NULL
currants	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
her	NULL
pretty	NULL
hair	NULL
tucked	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
cap	NULL
,	NULL
arms	NULL
bared	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
elbow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
checked	NULL
apron	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
coquettish	NULL
look	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bib	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
housewife	NULL
fell	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL

feeling	NULL
no	NULL
doubts	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
success	NULL

for	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
she	NULL
seen	NULL
Hannah	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
hundreds	NULL
of	NULL
times	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
array	NULL
of	NULL
pots	NULL
rather	NULL
amazed	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
John	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
jelly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
nice	NULL
little	NULL
jars	NULL
would	NULL
look	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
shelf	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Meg	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
fill	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
spent	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
day	NULL
picking	NULL
,	NULL
boiling	NULL
,	NULL
straining	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fussing	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
jelly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
advice	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cornelius	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
racked	NULL
her	NULL
brain	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
what	NULL
Hannah	NULL
did	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
left	NULL
undone	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
reboiled	NULL
,	NULL
resugared	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
restrained	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
dreadful	NULL
stuff	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
'	NULL
jell	NULL
'	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
longed	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
bib	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ask	NULL
Mother	NULL
to	NULL
lend	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
John	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
agreed	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
annoy	NULL
anyone	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
private	NULL
worries	NULL
,	NULL
experiments	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
quarrels	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
laughed	NULL
over	NULL
that	NULL
last	NULL
word	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
it	NULL
suggested	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
preposterous	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
held	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
resolve	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whenever	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
without	NULL
help	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
interfered	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
had	NULL
advised	NULL
the	NULL
plan	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
Meg	NULL
wrestled	NULL
alone	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
refractory	NULL
sweetmeats	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
hot	NULL
summer	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
five	NULL
o'clock	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
topsy-turvey	NULL
kitchen	NULL
,	NULL
wrung	NULL
her	NULL
bedaubed	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
lifted	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
and	NULL
wept	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
flush	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
My	NULL
husband	NULL
shall	NULL
always	NULL
feel	NULL
free	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL

shall	NULL

There	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL

flurry	NULL

but	NULL
a	NULL
neat	NULL
house	NULL

a	NULL
good	NULL
dinner	NULL

John	NULL
,	NULL
dear	NULL

never	NULL
stop	NULL

ask	NULL
my	NULL

"	NULL

How	NULL
charming	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
!	NULL

John	NULL
quite	NULL
glowed	NULL
with	NULL
pride	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
her	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
blessed	NULL
thing	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
superior	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
company	NULL
from	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
never	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
unexpected	NULL

and	NULL
Meg	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
opportunity	NULL
to	NULL
distinguish	NULL
herself	NULL
till	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
always	NULL
happens	NULL
so	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
vale	NULL
of	NULL
tears	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
an	NULL
inevitability	NULL
about	NULL
such	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL

wonder	NULL
at	NULL
,	NULL
deplore	NULL

bear	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL

If	NULL
John	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
forgotten	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
jelly	NULL

it	NULL
really	NULL
would	NULL

that	NULL
Meg	NULL
would	NULL
cry	NULL
herself	NULL

softened	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL

sent	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
quicker	NULL
pace	NULL
,	NULL
resolving	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
calm	NULL

kind	NULL
,	NULL

firm	NULL

quite	NULL
firm	NULL

show	NULL
her	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL

Meg	NULL
likewise	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
'	NULL
calm	NULL
and	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
firm	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
show	NULL
him	NULL

She	NULL
longed	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
beg	NULL
pardon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
kissed	NULL
and	NULL
comforted	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL

but	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
John	NULL
coming	NULL
,	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
hum	NULL
quite	NULL
naturally	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
rocked	NULL
and	NULL
sewed	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
lady	NULL
of	NULL
leisure	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL

John	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
disappointed	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
tender	NULL
Niobe	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
dignity	NULL
demanded	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
apology	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
none	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
came	NULL
leisurely	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
laid	NULL
himself	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
singularly	NULL
relevant	NULL
remark	NULL

"	NULL

Meg	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL

introduced	NULL
by	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Brooke	NULL

wet-blanketed	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Brooke	NULL

conversation	NULL
languished	NULL

John	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
unfolded	NULL
his	NULL
paper	NULL

and	NULL
wrapped	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL

Meg	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

sewed	NULL

rosettes	NULL

the	NULL

Neither	NULL

Both	NULL
looked	NULL
quite	NULL
'	NULL
calm	NULL

both	NULL

thought	NULL
Meg	NULL

John	NULL

bear	NULL

He	NULL

that	NULL

"	NULL

These	NULL
words	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Meg	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
sewing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sunset	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
serious	NULL
disagreement	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
hasty	NULL
speeches	NULL
sounded	NULL
both	NULL
silly	NULL

unkind	NULL

as	NULL
she	NULL
recalled	NULL
them	NULL

her	NULL
own	NULL
anger	NULL
looked	NULL
childish	NULL
now	NULL

and	NULL
thoughts	NULL
of	NULL
poor	NULL
John	NULL
coming	NULL
home	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
scene	NULL
quite	NULL
melted	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
tears	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
and	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL

the	NULL
first	NULL

Forgive	NULL
me	NULL

"	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
very	NULL
slowly	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
pride	NULL
was	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
swallow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
by	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
turn	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
really	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL

then	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL

"	NULL
This	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
stooping	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
softly	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
forehead	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
that	NULL
settled	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
penitent	NULL
kiss	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
world	NULL
of	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
John	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
knee	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
tenderly	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
bad	NULL
to	NULL
laugh	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
little	NULL

Forgive	NULL
me	NULL

dear	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
will	NULL
again	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
oh	NULL
bless	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
hundreds	NULL
of	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
did	NULL
Meg	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
declaring	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
sweetest	NULL
jelly	NULL
they	NULL
ever	NULL
made	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
family	NULL
peace	NULL
was	NULL
preserved	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
little	NULL
family	NULL
jar	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
Meg	NULL
had	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Scott	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
by	NULL
special	NULL
invitation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
served	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
feast	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
cooked	NULL
wife	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
occasion	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
gay	NULL
and	NULL
gracious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
everything	NULL
go	NULL
off	NULL
so	NULL
charmingly	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Scott	NULL
told	NULL
John	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lucky	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shook	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
hardships	NULL
of	NULL
bachelorhood	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
autumn	NULL
,	NULL
new	NULL
trials	NULL
and	NULL
experiences	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
Meg	NULL
.	NULL

Sallie	NULL
Moffat	NULL
renewed	NULL
her	NULL
friendship	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
running	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
dish	NULL
of	NULL
gossip	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
inviting	NULL
'	NULL
that	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
'	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
spend	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
pleasant	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
in	NULL
dull	NULL
weather	NULL
Meg	NULL
often	NULL
felt	NULL
lonely	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
were	NULL
busy	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
John	NULL
absent	NULL
till	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
but	NULL
sew	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
read	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
potter	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
it	NULL
naturally	NULL
fell	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
Meg	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
gadding	NULL
and	NULL
gossiping	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
friend	NULL
.	NULL

Seeing	NULL
Sallie	NULL
's	NULL
pretty	NULL
things	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
long	NULL
for	NULL
such	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pity	NULL
herself	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
got	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Sallie	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
often	NULL
offered	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
coveted	NULL
trifles	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Meg	NULL
declined	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
that	NULL
John	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
this	NULL
foolish	NULL
little	NULL
woman	NULL
went	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
what	NULL
John	NULL
disliked	NULL
even	NULL
worse	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
income	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
trusted	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
happiness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
what	NULL
some	NULL
men	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
value	NULL
more	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
free	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
keep	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
every	NULL
penny	NULL
,	NULL
pay	NULL
bills	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

Till	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
been	NULL
prudent	NULL
and	NULL
exact	NULL
,	NULL
kept	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
account	NULL
books	NULL
neatly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
showed	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
monthly	NULL
without	NULL
fear	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
autumn	NULL
the	NULL
serpent	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
Meg	NULL
's	NULL
paradise	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tempted	NULL
her	NULL
like	NULL
many	NULL
a	NULL
modern	NULL
Eve	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
with	NULL
apples	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
dress	NULL
.	NULL

Meg	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
pitied	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
poor	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
irritated	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
ashamed	NULL
to	NULL
confess	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
console	NULL
herself	NULL
by	NULL
buying	NULL
something	NULL
pretty	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
Sallie	NULL
need	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
economize	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
always	NULL
felt	NULL
wicked	NULL
after	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
pretty	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
seldom	NULL
necessaries	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
they	NULL
cost	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
worth	NULL
worrying	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
the	NULL
trifles	NULL
increased	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shopping	NULL
excursions	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
a	NULL
passive	NULL
looker-on	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
trifles	NULL
cost	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
imagine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
cast	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
accounts	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
month	NULL
the	NULL
sum	NULL
total	NULL
rather	NULL
scared	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

John	NULL
was	NULL
busy	NULL
that	NULL
month	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
bills	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
month	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
absent	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
grand	NULL
quarterly	NULL
settling	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Meg	NULL
never	NULL
forgot	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
a	NULL
dreadful	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
weighed	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
conscience	NULL
.	NULL

Sallie	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
buying	NULL
silks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Meg	NULL
longed	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
handsome	NULL
light	NULL
one	NULL
for	NULL
parties	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
black	NULL
silk	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
common	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thin	NULL
things	NULL
for	NULL
evening	NULL
wear	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
proper	NULL
for	NULL
girls	NULL
.	NULL

Aunt	NULL
March	NULL
usually	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
sisters	NULL
a	NULL
present	NULL
of	NULL
twenty-five	NULL
dollars	NULL
apiece	NULL
at	NULL
New	NULL
Year	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lovely	NULL
violet	NULL
silk	NULL
going	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
bargain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
only	NULL
dared	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

John	NULL
always	NULL
said	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
was	NULL
hers	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
would	NULL
he	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
prospective	NULL
five-and-twenty	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
another	NULL
five-and-twenty	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
household	NULL
fund	NULL
?	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
.	NULL

Sallie	NULL
had	NULL
urged	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
offered	NULL
to	NULL
lend	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
intentions	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
had	NULL
tempted	NULL
Meg	NULL
beyond	NULL
her	NULL
strength	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
an	NULL
evil	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
shopman	NULL
held	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
lovely	NULL
,	NULL
shimmering	NULL
folds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
A	NULL
bargain	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
assure	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
ma'am	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL
and	NULL
paid	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Sallie	NULL
had	NULL
exulted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
laughed	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
consequence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
driven	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
stolen	NULL
something	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL

her	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
assuage	NULL
the	NULL
pangs	NULL
of	NULL
remorse	NULL
by	NULL
spreading	NULL
forth	NULL
the	NULL
lovely	NULL
silk	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
looked	NULL
less	NULL
silvery	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
become	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
'	NULL
fifty	NULL
dollars	NULL
'	NULL
seemed	NULL
stamped	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
pattern	NULL
down	NULL
each	NULL
breadth	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
haunted	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
delightfully	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
dress	NULL
should	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
ghost	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
folly	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
easily	NULL
laid	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
John	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
books	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
Meg	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
sank	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
married	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
brown	NULL
eyes	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
stern	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
unusually	NULL
merry	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
fancied	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
know	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
house	NULL
bills	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
paid	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
books	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
.	NULL

John	NULL
had	NULL
praised	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
undoing	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
pocketbook	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
bank	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Meg	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
empty	NULL
,	NULL
stopped	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
nervously	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL
seen	NULL
my	NULL

John	NULL
never	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
always	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
enjoy	NULL
his	NULL
masculine	NULL
amazement	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
queer	NULL
things	NULL
women	NULL
wanted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
guess	NULL
what	NULL
piping	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
demand	NULL
fiercely	NULL
the	NULL
meaning	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hug-me-tight	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
wonder	NULL
how	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
thing	NULL
composed	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
rosebuds	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
velvet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
strings	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
possibly	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
bonnet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cost	NULL
six	NULL
dollars	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
night	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
fun	NULL
of	NULL
quizzing	NULL
her	NULL
figures	NULL
and	NULL
pretending	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
horrified	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
extravagance	NULL

as	NULL
he	NULL
often	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
particularly	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
prudent	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
little	NULL
book	NULL
was	NULL
brought	NULL
slowly	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
laid	NULL
down	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Meg	NULL
got	NULL
behind	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
under	NULL
pretense	NULL
of	NULL
smoothing	NULL
the	NULL
wrinkles	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
tired	NULL
forehead	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
standing	NULL
there	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

her	NULL
panic	NULL
increasing	NULL
with	NULL
every	NULL
word	NULL

That	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL

John	NULL

she	NULL

the	NULL

reduced	NULL
her	NULL

a	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
talk	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL

Meg	NULL
learned	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
better	NULL

his	NULL
poverty	NULL

because	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL

her	NULL

went	NULL

Sallie	NULL

The	NULL
good-natured	NULL
Mrs.	NULL

Meg	NULL

him	NULL

imagine	NULL
what	NULL

how	NULL
he	NULL
received	NULL

what	NULL
a	NULL

John	NULL
came	NULL
home	NULL
early	NULL

Meg	NULL
gadded	NULL
no	NULL

that	NULL

morning	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
THIRTY	NULL
CONSEQUENCES	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Chester	NULL
's	NULL
fair	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
elegant	NULL
and	NULL
select	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
considered	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
honor	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
neighborhood	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
invited	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
everyone	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
was	NULL
asked	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Jo	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
fortunate	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
parties	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
elbows	NULL
were	NULL
decidedly	NULL
akimbo	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
period	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
many	NULL
hard	NULL
knocks	NULL
to	NULL
teach	NULL
her	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
easily	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
'	NULL
haughty	NULL
,	NULL
uninteresting	NULL
creature	NULL
'	NULL
was	NULL
let	NULL
severely	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Amy	NULL
's	NULL
talent	NULL
and	NULL
taste	NULL
were	NULL
duly	NULL
complimented	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
offer	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
art	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
exerted	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
prepare	NULL
and	NULL
secure	NULL
appropriate	NULL
and	NULL
valuable	NULL
contributions	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Everything	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
smoothly	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
fair	NULL
opened	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
there	NULL
occurred	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
skirmishes	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
almost	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
some	NULL
five-and-twenty	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
old	NULL
and	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
their	NULL
private	NULL
piques	NULL
and	NULL
prejudices	NULL
,	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

May	NULL
Chester	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
jealous	NULL
of	NULL
Amy	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
greater	NULL
favorite	NULL
than	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
several	NULL
trifling	NULL
circumstances	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
increase	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
's	NULL
dainty	NULL
pen-and-ink	NULL
work	NULL
entirely	NULL
eclipsed	NULL
May	NULL
's	NULL
painted	NULL
vases	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
thorn	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
all	NULL
conquering	NULL
Tudor	NULL
had	NULL
danced	NULL
four	NULL
times	NULL
with	NULL
Amy	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
late	NULL
party	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
once	NULL
with	NULL
May	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
thorn	NULL
number	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
chief	NULL
grievance	NULL
that	NULL
rankled	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
an	NULL
excuse	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
unfriendly	NULL
conduct	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
rumor	NULL
which	NULL
some	NULL
obliging	NULL
gossip	NULL
had	NULL
whispered	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
March	NULL
girls	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
fun	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Lambs	NULL
'	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
blame	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
fallen	NULL
upon	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
naughty	NULL
imitation	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL
lifelike	NULL
to	NULL
escape	NULL
detection	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
frolicsome	NULL
Lambs	NULL
had	NULL
permitted	NULL
the	NULL
joke	NULL
to	NULL
escape	NULL

Amy	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

her	NULL

with	NULL

In	NULL

Amy	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL

bent	NULL
on	NULL
conquering	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
began	NULL
well	NULL

thanks	NULL

a	NULL
silent	NULL
reminder	NULL
that	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
unexpectedly	NULL

but	NULL
most	NULL
opportunely	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
arranged	NULL
her	NULL
table	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
girls	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
anteroom	NULL
filling	NULL
the	NULL
baskets	NULL

she	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
pet	NULL

a	NULL
little	NULL
book	NULL

the	NULL
antique	NULL

of	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL

among	NULL
his	NULL
treasures	NULL

in	NULL
which	NULL
on	NULL
leaves	NULL
of	NULL
vellum	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
beautifully	NULL
illuminated	NULL
different	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
the	NULL

with	NULL
very	NULL
pardonable	NULL
pride	NULL

her	NULL
eye	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
one	NULL

that	NULL
made	NULL

stop	NULL

in	NULL

Amy	NULL

went	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

that	NULL
could	NULL

the	NULL
vacancies	NULL
her	NULL
pretty	NULL

once	NULL

Amy	NULL
stood	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
the	NULL
leaves	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
reading	NULL

Many	NULL

are	NULL
preached	NULL
us	NULL
every	NULL

by	NULL
unconscious	NULL
ministers	NULL

Even	NULL
a	NULL

may	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
pulpit	NULL

if	NULL
it	NULL
can	NULL
offer	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL

words	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
never	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL

.	NULL

Amy	NULL
's	NULL
conscience	NULL
preached	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
sermon	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
text	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
what	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
sermon	NULL
to	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
straightway	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
practice	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
girls	NULL
were	NULL
standing	NULL
about	NULL
May	NULL
's	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
admiring	NULL
the	NULL
pretty	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
talking	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
saleswomen	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
dropped	NULL
their	NULL
voices	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Amy	NULL
knew	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
speaking	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
hearing	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
and	NULL
judging	NULL
accordingly	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
pleasant	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
spirit	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
offered	NULL
for	NULL
proving	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
heard	NULL
May	NULL
say	NULL
sorrowfully	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
too	NULL
bad	NULL

for	NULL
there	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL

up	NULL
with	NULL
odds	NULL

The	NULL

was	NULL
just	NULL

Now	NULL
it	NULL

someone	NULL

How	NULL

after	NULL
all	NULL

began	NULL
May	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
finish	NULL

for	NULL
Amy	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
came	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
pleasantly	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
may	NULL

them	NULL

was	NULL

me	NULL

them	NULL
away	NULL
last	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
,	NULL
Amy	NULL
returned	NULL
her	NULL
contribution	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
nod	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hurried	NULL
away	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
easier	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
a	NULL
friendly	NULL
thing	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
thanked	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL

I	NULL
call	NULL
that	NULL
lovely	NULL

n't	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

cried	NULL
one	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

May	NULL
's	NULL
answer	NULL
was	NULL
inaudible	NULL

but	NULL
another	NULL
young	NULL
lady	NULL

whose	NULL
temper	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
soured	NULL
by	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
hard	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
we	NULL
make	NULL
little	NULL
sacrifices	NULL
we	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
them	NULL
appreciated	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL

and	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
Amy	NULL
was	NULL
sorry	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
virtue	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
reward	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
presently	NULL
discovered	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
spirits	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
rise	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
table	NULL
to	NULL
blossom	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
skillful	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
little	NULL
act	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
cleared	NULL
the	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
amazingly	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
long	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
one	NULL
for	NULL
Amy	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
often	NULL
quite	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
girls	NULL
deserted	NULL
very	NULL
soon	NULL
.	NULL

Few	NULL
cared	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
flowers	NULL
in	NULL
summer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
bouquets	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
droop	NULL
long	NULL
before	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
art	NULL
table	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
attractive	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
crowd	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tenders	NULL
were	NULL
constantly	NULL
flying	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
fro	NULL
with	NULL
important	NULL
faces	NULL
and	NULL
rattling	NULL
money	NULL
boxes	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
often	NULL
looked	NULL
wistfully	NULL
across	NULL
,	NULL
longing	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
corner	NULL
with	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
might	NULL
seem	NULL
no	NULL
hardship	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
,	NULL
blithe	NULL
young	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
tedious	NULL

but	NULL
very	NULL
trying	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Laurie	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
martyrdom	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
home	NULL
till	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
so	NULL
pale	NULL
and	NULL
quiet	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
one	NULL

though	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
complaint	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
tell	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
mother	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
an	NULL
extra	NULL
cordial	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
tea	NULL

Beth	NULL
helped	NULL
her	NULL
dress	NULL

made	NULL
a	NULL
charming	NULL
little	NULL
wreath	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL

while	NULL
Jo	NULL
astonished	NULL
her	NULL
family	NULL
by	NULL
getting	NULL
herself	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
unusual	NULL
care	NULL

and	NULL
hinting	NULL
darkly	NULL
that	NULL

Amy	NULL

departed	NULL
early	NULL

Jo	NULL

leaning	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL

Jo	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

off	NULL

up	NULL
very	NULL

the	NULL

Amy	NULL
likewise	NULL

just	NULL

about	NULL

it	NULL
suddenly	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL
sent	NULL
a	NULL

from	NULL
Halifax	NULL

when	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
pretty	NULL
miserable	NULL

but	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
delightfully	NULL

seldom	NULL

on	NULL
deck	NULL
all	NULL

as	NULL
they	NULL

nothing	NULL

it	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
mercy	NULL

make	NULL
them	NULL

otherwise	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
smoke	NULL
themselves	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL

Aunt	NULL

Flo	NULL
were	NULL
poorly	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL

and	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL

alone	NULL

so	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL

I	NULL
went	NULL

walks	NULL

such	NULL
sunsets	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL

horse	NULL

when	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
rushing	NULL
on	NULL
so	NULL
grandly	NULL

I	NULL
wish	NULL
Beth	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL

it	NULL
would	NULL

done	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Jo	NULL

she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
up	NULL

sat	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
maintop	NULL
jib	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
whatever	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
thing	NULL
is	NULL
called	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
friends	NULL

engineers	NULL

tooted	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
captain	NULL

she	NULL
'd	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
rapture	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
heavenly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
Irish	NULL
coast	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
lovely	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
green	NULL
and	NULL
sunny	NULL

with	NULL
brown	NULL
cabins	NULL
here	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
early	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
regret	NULL
getting	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL
bay	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL

it	NULL

At	NULL
Queenstown	NULL
one	NULL

my	NULL

acquaintances	NULL
left	NULL
us	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Lennox	NULL

when	NULL
I	NULL
said	NULL
something	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
Lakes	NULL
of	NULL
Killarney	NULL

he	NULL
sighed	NULL

sung	NULL

Was	NULL
n't	NULL
that	NULL
nonsensical	NULL

We	NULL
only	NULL
stopped	NULL
at	NULL
Liverpool	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
hours	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
dirty	NULL

noisy	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Uncle	NULL
rushed	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
bought	NULL
a	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
dogskin	NULL

some	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
flattered	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
true	NULL
Briton	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
mud	NULL
cleaned	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
shoes	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL

knew	NULL
that	NULL
an	NULL

stood	NULL

was	NULL
like	NULL
riding	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
picture	NULL
gallery	NULL
,	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
lovely	NULL
landscapes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
farmhouses	NULL
were	NULL
my	NULL
delight	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
thatched	NULL
roofs	NULL
,	NULL
ivy	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
eaves	NULL
,	NULL
latticed	NULL
windows	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stout	NULL
women	NULL
with	NULL
rosy	NULL
children	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
doors	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
very	NULL
cattle	NULL
looked	NULL
more	NULL
tranquil	NULL
than	NULL
ours	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
stood	NULL
knee-deep	NULL
in	NULL
clover	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
hens	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
contented	NULL
cluck	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
never	NULL
got	NULL
nervous	NULL
like	NULL
Yankee	NULL
biddies	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
perfect	NULL
color	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
saw	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
so	NULL
green	NULL
,	NULL
sky	NULL
so	NULL
blue	NULL
,	NULL
grain	NULL
so	NULL
yellow	NULL
,	NULL
woods	NULL
so	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
rapture	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
was	NULL
Flo	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
kept	NULL
bouncing	NULL
from	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
everything	NULL
while	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
whisking	NULL
along	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
rate	NULL
of	NULL
sixty	NULL
miles	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
.	NULL

Aunt	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Uncle	NULL
read	NULL
his	NULL
guidebook	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
astonished	NULL
at	NULL
anything	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL

flying	NULL
up	NULL

Oh	NULL

returns	NULL
Uncle	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
tone	NULL
that	NULL
keeps	NULL
us	NULL
quiet	NULL
till	NULL
Flo	NULL
settles	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
enjoy	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
Flirtations	NULL

Captain	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
_	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
scenery	NULL
all	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
it	NULL
rained	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
but	NULL
fog	NULL
and	NULL
umbrellas	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
rested	NULL
,	NULL
unpacked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shopped	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
showers	NULL
.	NULL

Aunt	NULL
Mary	NULL
got	NULL
me	NULL
some	NULL
new	NULL
things	NULL

for	NULL
I	NULL
came	NULL
off	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
hurry	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
half	NULL
ready	NULL

A	NULL
white	NULL
hat	NULL

blue	NULL
feather	NULL

a	NULL

dress	NULL
to	NULL
match	NULL

the	NULL
loveliest	NULL

you	NULL
ever	NULL
saw	NULL

Shopping	NULL
in	NULL
Regent	NULL
Street	NULL
is	NULL
perfectly	NULL
splendid	NULL

Things	NULL
seem	NULL
so	NULL
cheap	NULL

nice	NULL

only	NULL
sixpence	NULL

I	NULL
laid	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL

shall	NULL
get	NULL
my	NULL

Does	NULL
n't	NULL
that	NULL
sound	NULL
sort	NULL

elegant	NULL

rich	NULL
?	NULL

Flo	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
fun	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
ordered	NULL
a	NULL
hansom	NULL
cab	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Aunt	NULL
and	NULL
Uncle	NULL
were	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
drive	NULL

though	NULL
we	NULL
learned	NULL
afterward	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
for	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
to	NULL
ride	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
droll	NULL
!	NULL

For	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
shut	NULL
in	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
wooden	NULL
apron	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
drove	NULL
so	NULL
fast	NULL
that	NULL
Flo	NULL
was	NULL
frightened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
stop	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
up	NULL
outside	NULL
behind	NULL
somewhere	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
get	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
hear	NULL
me	NULL
call	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
see	NULL
me	NULL
flap	NULL
my	NULL
parasol	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
helpless	NULL
,	NULL
rattling	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whirling	NULL
around	NULL
corners	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
breakneck	NULL
pace	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
despair	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
door	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
roof	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
poking	NULL
it	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
red	NULL
eye	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
beery	NULL
voice	NULL
said	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
Now	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
mum	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
gave	NULL
my	NULL
order	NULL
as	NULL
soberly	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
slamming	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
"	NULL
Aye	NULL
,	NULL
aye	NULL
,	NULL
mum	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
horse	NULL
walk	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
funeral	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
poked	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
A	NULL
little	NULL
faster	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
then	NULL
off	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
helter-skelter	NULL
as	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
resigned	NULL
ourselves	NULL
to	NULL
our	NULL
fate	NULL
.	NULL

Today	NULL
was	NULL
fair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Hyde	NULL
Park	NULL
,	NULL
close	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
more	NULL
aristocratic	NULL
than	NULL
we	NULL
look	NULL

The	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL

ask	NULL
us	NULL

meet	NULL
us	NULL
in	NULL
Rome	NULL
next	NULL
winter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
disappointed	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Grace	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
are	NULL
great	NULL
friends	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL
fellows	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
Fred	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
were	NULL
hardly	NULL
settled	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
up	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
holiday	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
Switzerland	NULL
.	NULL

Aunt	NULL
looked	NULL
sober	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
cool	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
say	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
we	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
nicely	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
are	NULL
very	NULL
glad	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
speaks	NULL
French	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
native	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
do	NULL
without	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Uncle	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
ten	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
insists	NULL
on	NULL
talking	NULL
English	NULL
very	NULL
loud	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
people	NULL
understand	NULL
him	NULL

Aunt	NULL
's	NULL
pronunciation	NULL
is	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL

Flo	NULL

I	NULL

we	NULL
flattered	NULL
ourselves	NULL

The	NULL
sail	NULL

At	NULL
Coblentz	NULL
we	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
lovely	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
students	NULL
from	NULL
Bonn	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
Fred	NULL
got	NULL
acquainted	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
boat	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
us	NULL
a	NULL
serenade	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
moonlight	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
about	NULL
one	NULL
o'clock	NULL
Flo	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
were	NULL
waked	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
delicious	NULL
music	NULL
under	NULL
our	NULL
windows	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
flew	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hid	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
curtains	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
sly	NULL
peeps	NULL
showed	NULL
us	NULL
Fred	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
students	NULL
singing	NULL
away	NULL
down	NULL
below	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
romantic	NULL
thing	NULL
I	NULL
ever	NULL
saw	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
bridge	NULL
of	NULL
boats	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
fortress	NULL
opposite	NULL
,	NULL
moonlight	NULL
everywhere	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
music	NULL
fit	NULL
to	NULL
melt	NULL
a	NULL
heart	NULL
of	NULL
stone	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
done	NULL
we	NULL
threw	NULL
down	NULL
some	NULL
flowers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
them	NULL
scramble	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
kiss	NULL
their	NULL
hands	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
invisible	NULL
ladies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
laughing	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
smoke	NULL
and	NULL
drink	NULL
beer	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
morning	NULL
Fred	NULL
showed	NULL
me	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
crumpled	NULL
flowers	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
vest	NULL
pocket	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
very	NULL
sentimental	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
throw	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Flo	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
disgust	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
tossed	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
sensible	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL
afraid	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
trouble	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL

begins	NULL

look	NULL

The	NULL
baths	NULL
at	NULL
Nassau	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
gay	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
was	NULL
Baden-Baden	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
Fred	NULL
lost	NULL
some	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
scolded	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
needs	NULL
someone	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
Frank	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Kate	NULL
said	NULL
once	NULL
she	NULL
hoped	NULL
he	NULL
'd	NULL
marry	NULL
soon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
quite	NULL
agree	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
well	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Frankfurt	NULL
was	NULL
delightful	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
saw	NULL
Goethe	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
Schiller	NULL
's	NULL
statue	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Dannecker	NULL
's	NULL
famous	NULL
'	NULL
Ariadne	NULL
.	NULL
'	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
lovely	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
it	NULL
more	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
everyone	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
or	NULL
pretended	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wish	NULL
Jo	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
read	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
find	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
mortifies	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
comes	NULL
the	NULL
serious	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Fred	NULL
has	NULL
just	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
kind	NULL
and	NULL
jolly	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
all	NULL
got	NULL
quite	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
traveling	NULL
friendship	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
serenade	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
then	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
moonlight	NULL
walks	NULL
,	NULL
balcony	NULL
talks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
daily	NULL
adventures	NULL
were	NULL
something	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
than	NULL
fun	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL
flirted	NULL
,	NULL
Mother	NULL
,	NULL
truly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
remembered	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
my	NULL
very	NULL
best	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
if	NULL
people	NULL
like	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
worries	NULL
me	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
Jo	NULL
says	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL
got	NULL
any	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
Mother	NULL
will	NULL
shake	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
mercenary	NULL
little	NULL
wretch	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
Fred	NULL
asks	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
accept	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
madly	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
like	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
comfortably	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
handsome	NULL
,	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
clever	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
rich	NULL
--	NULL
ever	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
richer	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
Laurences	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL
would	NULL
object	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
all	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
well-bred	NULL
,	NULL
generous	NULL

and	NULL
they	NULL
like	NULL

Fred	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
eldest	NULL
twin	NULL
,	NULL
will	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
estate	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
splendid	NULL
one	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
!	NULL

city	NULL
house	NULL

a	NULL
fashionable	NULL
street	NULL

not	NULL
so	NULL
showy	NULL
as	NULL
our	NULL
big	NULL
houses	NULL

but	NULL
twice	NULL
as	NULL
comfortable	NULL
and	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
solid	NULL
luxury	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
English	NULL
people	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL

I	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
genuine	NULL

I	NULL
've	NULL
seen	NULL

Fred	NULL

very	NULL
well	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL

but	NULL
little	NULL
things	NULL
showed	NULL
it	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
goes	NULL

always	NULL
gets	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL

Yesterday	NULL
at	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
an	NULL
Austrian	NULL
officer	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
us	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
said	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
friend	NULL

a	NULL
rakish-looking	NULL
baron	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
'	NULL

Fred	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
fierce	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
lion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cut	NULL
his	NULL
meat	NULL
so	NULL
savagely	NULL
it	NULL
nearly	NULL
flew	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
plate	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cool	NULL
,	NULL
stiff	NULL
Englishmen	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
is	NULL
rather	NULL
peppery	NULL

for	NULL
he	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
last	NULL
evening	NULL
we	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
castle	NULL
about	NULL
sunset	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
but	NULL
Fred	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
us	NULL
there	NULL
after	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Post	NULL
Restante	NULL
for	NULL
letters	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
charming	NULL
time	NULL
poking	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
ruins	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
vaults	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
monster	NULL
tun	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
gardens	NULL
made	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
elector	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
English	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
liked	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
terrace	NULL
best	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
view	NULL
was	NULL
divine	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL
inside	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
sat	NULL
there	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
sketch	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
stone	NULL
lion	NULL
's	NULL
head	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
scarlet	NULL
woodbine	NULL
sprays	NULL
hanging	NULL
round	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
romance	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
Neckar	NULL
rolling	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
valley	NULL
,	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
music	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Austrian	NULL
band	NULL
below	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
my	NULL
lover	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
storybook	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
happen	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
feel	NULL
blushy	NULL
or	NULL
quakey	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
quite	NULL
cool	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
excited	NULL
.	NULL

By-and-by	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
Fred	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
hurrying	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
arch	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
so	NULL
troubled	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
forgot	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
'd	NULL
just	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
begging	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Frank	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
ill	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
train	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
had	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
good-by	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
sorry	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
disappointed	NULL
for	NULL
myself	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL

mistake	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
promise	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
satisfied	NULL

and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
anything	NULL
but	NULL
messages	NULL
and	NULL
good-byes	NULL

for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
off	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL

we	NULL
all	NULL
miss	NULL
him	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
something	NULL
he	NULL
once	NULL
hinted	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
promised	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sort	NULL
yet	NULL
a	NULL

for	NULL

rash	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
dreads	NULL
a	NULL
foreign	NULL

.	NULL

We	NULL
shall	NULL
soon	NULL
meet	NULL
in	NULL
Rome	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL

I	NULL

Beth	NULL
started	NULL
,	NULL
leaned	NULL
forward	NULL
,	NULL
smiled	NULL
and	NULL
nodded	NULL
,	NULL
watched	NULL
the	NULL
passer-by	NULL
till	NULL
his	NULL
quick	NULL
tramp	NULL
died	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
said	NULL
softly	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
How	NULL
strong	NULL
and	NULL
well	NULL
and	NULL
happy	NULL
that	NULL
dear	NULL
boy	NULL
looks	NULL

said	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
intent	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
bright	NULL
color	NULL
faded	NULL
as	NULL
quickly	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
smile	NULL
vanished	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
a	NULL
tear	NULL
lay	NULL
shining	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
ledge	NULL
.	NULL

Beth	NULL
whisked	NULL
it	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
half-averted	NULL
face	NULL
read	NULL
a	NULL
tender	NULL
sorrow	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
eyes	NULL
fill	NULL
.	NULL

Fearing	NULL
to	NULL
betray	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
slipped	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
murmuring	NULL
something	NULL
about	NULL
needing	NULL
more	NULL
paper	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mercy	NULL
on	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
Beth	NULL

"	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
pale	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
shock	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
discovery	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
believed	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
made	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
dreamed	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
will	NULL
Mother	NULL
say	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
wonder	NULL
if	NULL
her	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
there	NULL
Jo	NULL
stopped	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
scarlet	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
n't	NULL
love	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
dreadful	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
shook	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
threateningly	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
picture	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mischievous-looking	NULL
boy	NULL
laughing	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
growing	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
vengeance	NULL

Here	NULL
's	NULL
Meg	NULL
married	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
mamma	NULL
,	NULL
Amy	NULL
flourishing	NULL
away	NULL
at	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Beth	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
that	NULL
has	NULL
sense	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
mischief	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Jo	NULL
thought	NULL
intently	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
fixed	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
picture	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
smoothed	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
wrinkled	NULL
forehead	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
decided	NULL
nod	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
opposite	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
No	NULL
thank	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
very	NULL
charming	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
you	NULL
've	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
stability	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
weathercock	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
you	NULL
need	NULL
n't	NULL
write	NULL
touching	NULL
notes	NULL
and	NULL
smile	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
insinuating	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
do	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
sighed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
reverie	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
wake	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
twilight	NULL
sent	NULL
her	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
new	NULL
observations	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
only	NULL
confirmed	NULL
her	NULL
suspicion	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
Laurie	NULL
flirted	NULL
with	NULL
Amy	NULL
and	NULL
joked	NULL
with	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
manner	NULL
to	NULL
Beth	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
peculiarly	NULL
kind	NULL
and	NULL
gentle	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
so	NULL
was	NULL
everybody	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

Therefore	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
imagining	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
cared	NULL
more	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
than	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
impression	NULL
had	NULL
prevailed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
that	NULL
'	NULL
our	NULL
boy	NULL
'	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
fonder	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
of	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
hear	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
and	NULL
scolded	NULL
violently	NULL
if	NULL
anyone	NULL
dared	NULL
to	NULL
suggest	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
the	NULL
various	NULL
tender	NULL
passages	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
nipped	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bud	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
immense	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
of	NULL
saying	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
told	NULL
you	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
Jo	NULL
hated	NULL
'	NULL
philandering	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
allow	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
always	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
joke	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
ready	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
impending	NULL
danger	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Laurie	NULL
first	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
college	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
fell	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
about	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
these	NULL
small	NULL
flames	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
brief	NULL
as	NULL
ardent	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
no	NULL
damage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
much	NULL
amused	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
took	NULL
great	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
alternations	NULL
of	NULL
hope	NULL
,	NULL
despair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
resignation	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
confided	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
weekly	NULL
conferences	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
Laurie	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
worship	NULL
at	NULL
many	NULL
shrines	NULL
,	NULL
hinted	NULL
darkly	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
all-absorbing	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
indulged	NULL
occasionally	NULL
in	NULL
Byronic	NULL
fits	NULL
of	NULL
gloom	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
avoided	NULL
the	NULL
tender	NULL
subject	NULL
altogether	NULL
,	NULL
wrote	NULL
philosophical	NULL
notes	NULL
to	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
turned	NULL
studious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
'	NULL
dig	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
intending	NULL
to	NULL
graduate	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
blaze	NULL
of	NULL
glory	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
suited	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
lady	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
twilight	NULL
confidences	NULL
,	NULL
tender	NULL
pressures	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
eloquent	NULL
glances	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
with	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
brain	NULL
developed	NULL
earlier	NULL
than	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
preferred	NULL
imaginary	NULL
heroes	NULL
to	NULL
real	NULL
ones	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
when	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
former	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
shut	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tin	NULL
kitchen	NULL
till	NULL
called	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL
were	NULL
less	NULL
manageable	NULL
.	NULL

Things	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
state	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
grand	NULL
discovery	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Jo	NULL
watched	NULL
Laurie	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
done	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
idea	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
nothing	NULL
unusual	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
Beth	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
quiet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Laurie	NULL
very	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
having	NULL
given	NULL
the	NULL
rein	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
lively	NULL
fancy	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
galloped	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
pace	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
common	NULL
sense	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
rather	NULL
weakened	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
romance	NULL
writing	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rescue	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
usual	NULL
Beth	NULL
lay	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
and	NULL
Laurie	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
chair	NULL
close	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
amusing	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
gossip	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
depended	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
weekly	NULL
'	NULL
spin	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
disappointed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
Jo	NULL
fancied	NULL
that	NULL
Beth	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
rested	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
lively	NULL
,	NULL
dark	NULL
face	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
peculiar	NULL
pleasure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
listened	NULL
with	NULL
intense	NULL
interest	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
exciting	NULL
cricket	NULL
match	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
phrases	NULL
,	NULL
'	NULL
caught	NULL
off	NULL
a	NULL
tice	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
'	NULL
stumped	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
ground	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
'	NULL
the	NULL
leg	NULL
hit	NULL
for	NULL
three	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
intelligible	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
Sanskrit	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
also	NULL
fancied	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
set	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
upon	NULL
seeing	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
increase	NULL
of	NULL
gentleness	NULL
in	NULL
Laurie	NULL
's	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
dropped	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
laughed	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
absent-minded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
settled	NULL
the	NULL
afghan	NULL
over	NULL
Beth	NULL
's	NULL
feet	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
assiduity	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
almost	NULL
tender	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Who	NULL
knows	NULL
?	NULL

Stranger	NULL
things	NULL
have	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
thought	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
fussed	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
will	NULL
make	NULL
quite	NULL
an	NULL
angel	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
make	NULL
life	NULL
delightfully	NULL
easy	NULL
and	NULL
pleasant	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
only	NULL
love	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
can	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
believe	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
were	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

As	NULL
everyone	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
but	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
dispose	NULL
of	NULL
herself	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
speed	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
where	NULL
should	NULL
she	NULL
go	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
burning	NULL
to	NULL
lay	NULL
herself	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
shrine	NULL
of	NULL
sisterly	NULL
devotion	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
settle	NULL
that	NULL
point	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
sofa	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
regular	NULL
patriarch	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sofa	NULL
--	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
broad	NULL
,	NULL
well-cushioned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
low	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
trifle	NULL
shabby	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
had	NULL
slept	NULL
and	NULL
sprawled	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
babies	NULL
,	NULL
fished	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
rode	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
menageries	NULL
under	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rested	NULL
tired	NULL
heads	NULL
,	NULL
dreamed	NULL
dreams	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
tender	NULL
talk	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
young	NULL
women	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
all	NULL
loved	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
refuge	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
corner	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
favorite	NULL
lounging	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

Among	NULL
the	NULL
many	NULL
pillows	NULL
that	NULL
adorned	NULL
the	NULL
venerable	NULL
couch	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
hard	NULL
,	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
prickly	NULL
horsehair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
furnished	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
knobby	NULL
button	NULL
at	NULL
each	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
repulsive	NULL
pillow	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
especial	NULL
property	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
used	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
weapon	NULL
of	NULL
defense	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
barricade	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
stern	NULL
preventive	NULL
of	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
slumber	NULL
.	NULL

Laurie	NULL
knew	NULL
this	NULL
pillow	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
cause	NULL
to	NULL
regard	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
deep	NULL
aversion	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
unmercifully	NULL
pummeled	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
former	NULL
days	NULL
when	NULL
romping	NULL
was	NULL
allowed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
frequently	NULL
debarred	NULL
by	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
seat	NULL
he	NULL
most	NULL
coveted	NULL
next	NULL
to	NULL
Jo	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
corner	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
'	NULL
the	NULL
sausage	NULL
'	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
called	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sign	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
approach	NULL
and	NULL
repose	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
lay	NULL
flat	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL

woe	NULL
to	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
child	NULL
who	NULL
dared	NULL
disturb	NULL
it	NULL

That	NULL
evening	NULL
Jo	NULL
forgot	NULL
to	NULL
barricade	NULL
her	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
seat	NULL
five	NULL
minutes	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
a	NULL
massive	NULL
form	NULL
appeared	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
both	NULL
arms	NULL
spread	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
long	NULL
legs	NULL
stretched	NULL
out	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
Laurie	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
of	NULL
satisfaction	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
slang	NULL

"	NULL
snapped	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
slamming	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
pillow	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
room	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL

and	NULL
coasting	NULL
onto	NULL
the	NULL

I	NULL

on	NULL

bustled	NULL

leaving	NULL
me	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
downstairs	NULL
soon	NULL
after	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
something	NULL
I	NULL
liked	NULL

The	NULL

very	NULL
long	NULL

this	NULL

I	NULL

a	NULL
little	NULL
servant	NULL

I	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL

along	NULL
behind	NULL

take	NULL
the	NULL

hod	NULL

The	NULL

Was	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL
good	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL

I	NULL
like	NULL
such	NULL
things	NULL

for	NULL
as	NULL
Father	NULL
says	NULL
,	NULL
trifles	NULL
show	NULL
character	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
mentioned	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
K.	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
laughed	NULL

and	NULL
said	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
K.	NULL
told	NULL
me	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
from	NULL
Berlin	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
learned	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
poor	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
church	NULL
mouse	NULL

and	NULL
gives	NULL
lessons	NULL
to	NULL
support	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
little	NULL
orphan	NULL
nephews	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
educating	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
wishes	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
married	NULL
an	NULL
American	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
romantic	NULL
story	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
interested	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
K.	NULL
lends	NULL
him	NULL
her	NULL
parlor	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
scholars	NULL

There	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL
door	NULL
between	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
nursery	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
peep	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
looks	NULL

He	NULL
's	NULL
almost	NULL
forty	NULL

so	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
no	NULL

After	NULL
tea	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
go-to-bed	NULL
romp	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
attacked	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
workbasket	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
evening	NULL
chatting	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
new	NULL
friend	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
shall	NULL
keep	NULL
a	NULL
journal-letter	NULL

send	NULL
it	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
goodnight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
tomorrow	NULL
.	NULL

Tuesday	NULL
Eve	NULL
Had	NULL
a	NULL
lively	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
seminary	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
acted	NULL
like	NULL
Sancho	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
time	NULL
I	NULL
really	NULL
thought	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
shake	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
good	NULL
angel	NULL
inspired	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
gymnastics	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
kept	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
keep	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
luncheon	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
took	NULL
them	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
walk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
needlework	NULL
like	NULL
little	NULL
Mabel	NULL
'	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
willing	NULL
mind	NULL
'	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
thanking	NULL
my	NULL
stars	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
learned	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
nice	NULL
buttonholes	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
parlor	NULL
door	NULL
opened	NULL
and	NULL
shut	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
someone	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
hum	NULL
,	NULL
Kennst	NULL
Du	NULL
Das	NULL
Land	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
big	NULL
bumblebee	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
improper	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
resist	NULL
the	NULL
temptation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lifting	NULL
one	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
curtain	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
glass	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
peeped	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Professor	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
arranged	NULL
his	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
regular	NULL
German	NULL
--	NULL
rather	NULL
stout	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
brown	NULL
hair	NULL
tumbled	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
bushy	NULL
beard	NULL
,	NULL
good	NULL
nose	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
kindest	NULL
eyes	NULL
I	NULL
ever	NULL
saw	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
splendid	NULL
big	NULL
voice	NULL
that	NULL
does	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
ears	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
our	NULL
sharp	NULL
or	NULL
slipshod	NULL
American	NULL
gabble	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
clothes	NULL
were	NULL
rusty	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
were	NULL
large	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
a	NULL
really	NULL
handsome	NULL
feature	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
his	NULL
beautiful	NULL
teeth	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
I	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
linen	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
two	NULL
buttons	NULL
were	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
coat	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
patch	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
shoe	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
sober	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
humming	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
the	NULL
hyacinth	NULL
bulbs	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stroke	NULL
the	NULL
cat	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
received	NULL
him	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
friend	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
smiled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
tap	NULL
came	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
called	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
loud	NULL
,	NULL
brisk	NULL
tone	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Herein	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
caught	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
morsel	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
carrying	NULL
a	NULL
big	NULL
book	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stopped	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Me	NULL
wants	NULL
me	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
mite	NULL
,	NULL
slamming	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
book	NULL
and	NULL
running	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Thou	NULL
shalt	NULL
haf	NULL
thy	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
.	NULL

Come	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
goot	NULL
hug	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
Tina	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
Professor	NULL
,	NULL
catching	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
laugh	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
holding	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
high	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
stoop	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
face	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
me	NULL
mus	NULL
tuddy	NULL
my	NULL
lessin	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
funny	NULL
little	NULL
thing	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
dictionary	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
paper	NULL
and	NULL
pencil	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
scribbled	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
a	NULL
leaf	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
passing	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
fat	NULL
finger	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
page	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
finding	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
soberly	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
nearly	NULL
betrayed	NULL
myself	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
laugh	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
stood	NULL
stroking	NULL
her	NULL
pretty	NULL
hair	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
fatherly	NULL
look	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
me	NULL
think	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
more	NULL
French	NULL
than	NULL
German	NULL
.	NULL

Another	NULL
knock	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
appearance	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
sent	NULL
me	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
I	NULL
virtuously	NULL
remained	NULL
through	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
noise	NULL
and	NULL
gabbling	NULL
that	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
next	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
kept	NULL
laughing	NULL
affectedly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saying	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Now	NULL
Professor	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
coquettish	NULL
tone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
pronounced	NULL
her	NULL
German	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
accent	NULL
that	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
hard	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
sober	NULL
.	NULL

Both	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
his	NULL
patience	NULL
sorely	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
say	NULL
emphatically	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
haf	NULL
not	NULL
attend	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
once	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
loud	NULL
rap	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
struck	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
book	NULL
,	NULL
followed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
despairing	NULL
exclamation	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Prut	NULL
!	NULL

It	NULL
all	NULL
goes	NULL
bad	NULL
this	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Poor	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
pitied	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
were	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
just	NULL
one	NULL
more	NULL
peep	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
survived	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
thrown	NULL
himself	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
tired	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
there	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
shut	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
clock	NULL
struck	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
jumped	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
books	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
ready	NULL
for	NULL
another	NULL
lesson	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
taking	NULL
little	NULL
Tina	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
asleep	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
carried	NULL
her	NULL
quietly	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
fancy	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Kirke	NULL
asked	NULL
me	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
five	NULL
o'clock	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
feeling	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
bit	NULL
homesick	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
people	NULL
are	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
roof	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
I	NULL
made	NULL
myself	NULL
respectable	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
slip	NULL
in	NULL
behind	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Kirke	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
is	NULL
short	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
efforts	NULL
at	NULL
concealment	NULL
were	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
failure	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
seat	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
my	NULL
face	NULL
cooled	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
plucked	NULL
up	NULL
courage	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
about	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
long	NULL
table	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
intent	NULL
on	NULL
getting	NULL
their	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
especially	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
eating	NULL
on	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
bolted	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
vanishing	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
assortment	NULL
of	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
absorbed	NULL
in	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
young	NULL
couples	NULL
absorbed	NULL
in	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL

married	NULL
ladies	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
babies	NULL

and	NULL
old	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
in	NULL
politics	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
care	NULL

have	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
any	NULL

maiden	NULL
lady	NULL

who	NULL
looks	NULL

something	NULL

her	NULL

Cast	NULL
away	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL

inquisitive	NULL

old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
talking	NULL
philosophy	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
Frenchman	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Amy	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
'd	NULL
have	NULL
turned	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
forever	NULL
because	NULL
,	NULL
sad	NULL
to	NULL
relate	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
appetite	NULL

and	NULL
shoveled	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
manner	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
horrified	NULL
'	NULL
her	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL

for	NULL
I	NULL
like	NULL

to	NULL
see	NULL
folks	NULL
eat	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

'	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Hannah	NULL
says	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL

must	NULL
have	NULL
needed	NULL
a	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
food	NULL
after	NULL
teaching	NULL
idiots	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
upstairs	NULL
after	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
settling	NULL
their	NULL
hats	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
one	NULL
say	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

I	NULL
felt	NULL
angry	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
care	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
governess	NULL

as	NULL
good	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL

I	NULL
've	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL

which	NULL
is	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
some	NULL

judging	NULL

the	NULL

clattered	NULL

Thursday	NULL
Yesterday	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
day	NULL
spent	NULL
in	NULL
teaching	NULL
,	NULL
sewing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
writing	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
little	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
cozy	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
and	NULL
fire	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
picked	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
bits	NULL
of	NULL
news	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
introduced	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Professor	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seems	NULL
that	NULL
Tina	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Frenchwoman	NULL
who	NULL
does	NULL
the	NULL
fine	NULL
ironing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
laundry	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
little	NULL
thing	NULL
has	NULL
lost	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
follows	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
dog	NULL
whenever	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
delights	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
a	NULL
'	NULL
bacheldore	NULL
'	NULL
.	NULL

Kitty	NULL
and	NULL
Minnie	NULL
Kirke	NULL
likewise	NULL
regard	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
affection	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tell	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
stories	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
plays	NULL
he	NULL
invents	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
presents	NULL
he	NULL
brings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
splendid	NULL
tales	NULL
he	NULL
tells	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
younger	NULL
men	NULL
quiz	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seems	NULL
,	NULL
call	NULL
him	NULL
Old	NULL
Fritz	NULL
,	NULL
Lager	NULL
Beer	NULL
,	NULL
Ursa	NULL
Major	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
all	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
jokes	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
enjoys	NULL
it	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Kirke	NULL
says	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
takes	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
good-naturedly	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
like	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
foreign	NULL
ways	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
maiden	NULL
lady	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
Miss	NULL
Norton	NULL
,	NULL
rich	NULL
,	NULL
cultivated	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
kind	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
at	NULL
dinner	NULL
today	NULL
(	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
table	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
such	NULL
fun	NULL
to	NULL
watch	NULL
people	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
has	NULL
fine	NULL
books	NULL
and	NULL
pictures	NULL
,	NULL
knows	NULL
interesting	NULL
persons	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seems	NULL
friendly	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
make	NULL
myself	NULL
agreeable	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
into	NULL
good	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
sort	NULL
that	NULL
Amy	NULL
likes	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
parlor	NULL
last	NULL
evening	NULL
when	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
newspapers	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Kirke	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Minnie	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
old	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
introduced	NULL
me	NULL
very	NULL
prettily	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
This	NULL
is	NULL
Mamma	NULL
's	NULL
friend	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
March	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
's	NULL
jolly	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
like	NULL
her	NULL
lots	NULL

"	NULL
added	NULL
Kitty	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
an	NULL
'	NULL
enfant	NULL
terrible	NULL
'	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
both	NULL
bowed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
we	NULL
laughed	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
prim	NULL
introduction	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
blunt	NULL
addition	NULL
were	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
comical	NULL
contrast	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ah	NULL
,	NULL
yes	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
hear	NULL
these	NULL
naughty	NULL
ones	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
vex	NULL
you	NULL

Mees	NULL

If	NULL
so	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
call	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
threatening	NULL
frown	NULL
that	NULL
delighted	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
wretches	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
promised	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
departed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
seems	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
doomed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
today	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
passed	NULL
his	NULL
door	NULL
on	NULL
my	NULL
way	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
accident	NULL
I	NULL
knocked	NULL
against	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
umbrella	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
flew	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
dressing	NULL
gown	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
big	NULL
blue	NULL
sock	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
darning	NULL
needle	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
seem	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
explained	NULL
and	NULL
hurried	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
waved	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
sock	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
loud	NULL
,	NULL
cheerful	NULL
way	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
haf	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
your	NULL
walk	NULL

Bon	NULL
voyage	NULL
,	NULL
Mademoiselle	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
laughed	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
downstairs	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
pathetic	NULL
,	NULL
also	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
man	NULL
having	NULL
to	NULL
mend	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
clothes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
German	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
embroider	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL

but	NULL
darning	NULL
hose	NULL
is	NULL
another	NULL
thing	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
pretty	NULL

Saturday	NULL
Nothing	NULL
has	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
about	NULL

except	NULL
a	NULL
call	NULL
on	NULL
Miss	NULL
Norton	NULL

who	NULL
has	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
pretty	NULL
things	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
charming	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
showed	NULL
me	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
treasures	NULL

and	NULL
asked	NULL
me	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
sometimes	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
lectures	NULL
and	NULL
concerts	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
escort	NULL

if	NULL
I	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
them	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
favor	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
sure	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Kirke	NULL
has	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
about	NULL
us	NULL

it	NULL
out	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
back	NULL

the	NULL

was	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
uproar	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

I	NULL
looked	NULL

left	NULL

I	NULL
went	NULL

I	NULL
looked	NULL

Half-finished	NULL

Dirty	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL

three	NULL

laughed	NULL

put	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
dreadful	NULL

I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
scold	NULL

He	NULL
's	NULL
so	NULL
absent-minded	NULL
and	NULL
goodnatured	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
lets	NULL
those	NULL
boys	NULL
ride	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
roughshod	NULL

I	NULL
agreed	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
his	NULL
washing	NULL

he	NULL
forgets	NULL

give	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
things	NULL

I	NULL
forget	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
them	NULL
over	NULL

he	NULL
comes	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
me	NULL

said	NULL
I.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL

I	NULL
'd	NULL

So	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
his	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL

and	NULL
knit	NULL
heels	NULL
into	NULL
two	NULL
pairs	NULL

the	NULL

for	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
boggled	NULL
out	NULL

his	NULL
queer	NULL

Nothing	NULL
was	NULL
said	NULL

I	NULL
hoped	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
find	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
last	NULL
week	NULL
he	NULL
caught	NULL
me	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Hearing	NULL
the	NULL
lessons	NULL
he	NULL
gives	NULL
to	NULL
others	NULL
has	NULL
interested	NULL

amused	NULL
me	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
fancy	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Tina	NULL
runs	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
open	NULL

I	NULL
can	NULL
hear	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sitting	NULL
near	NULL
this	NULL
door	NULL

finishing	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
sock	NULL

and	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
scholar	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
as	NULL
stupid	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
still	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
busily	NULL
gabbling	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL

rocking	NULL

a	NULL
most	NULL
absurd	NULL

when	NULL
a	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
Mr.	NULL

laughing	NULL
quietly	NULL

him	NULL

"	NULL
So	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

I	NULL
stopped	NULL

stared	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
say	NULL
anything	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL

and	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
really	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
splendid	NULL
opportunity	NULL

I	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
bargain	NULL

and	NULL
we	NULL
began	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
took	NULL
four	NULL
lessons	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
I	NULL
stuck	NULL
fast	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
grammatical	NULL
bog	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Professor	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
patient	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
torment	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
'd	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
expression	NULL
of	NULL
mild	NULL
despair	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
toss-up	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
whether	NULL
to	NULL
laugh	NULL
or	NULL
cry	NULL

I	NULL
tried	NULL
both	NULL
ways	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
sniff	NULL
or	NULL
utter	NULL
mortification	NULL
and	NULL
woe	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
just	NULL
threw	NULL
the	NULL
grammar	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
and	NULL
marched	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
felt	NULL
myself	NULL
disgraced	NULL
and	NULL
deserted	NULL
forever	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
blame	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
particle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
scrambling	NULL
my	NULL
papers	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
meaning	NULL
to	NULL
rush	NULL
upstairs	NULL
and	NULL
shake	NULL
myself	NULL
hard	NULL

when	NULL
in	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
brisk	NULL
and	NULL
beaming	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
covered	NULL
myself	NULL
in	NULL
glory	NULL

Now	NULL
we	NULL
shall	NULL
try	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
way	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
read	NULL
these	NULL
pleasant	NULL
little	NULL
_	NULL
marchen	NULL

together	NULL

and	NULL
dig	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
dry	NULL
book	NULL

that	NULL
goes	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
for	NULL
making	NULL
us	NULL
trouble	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
so	NULL
kindly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
opened	NULL
Hans	NULL
Anderson	NULL
's	NULL
fairy	NULL
tales	NULL
so	NULL
invitingly	NULL
before	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
ashamed	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL

and	NULL
went	NULL
at	NULL
my	NULL
lesson	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
neck-or-nothing	NULL
style	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
amuse	NULL
him	NULL
immensely	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
forgot	NULL
my	NULL
bashfulness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pegged	NULL
away	NULL
(	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
word	NULL
will	NULL
express	NULL
it	NULL
)	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
my	NULL
might	NULL

tumbling	NULL
over	NULL
long	NULL
words	NULL

pronouncing	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
inspiration	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
doing	NULL
my	NULL
very	NULL
best	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
I	NULL
finished	NULL
reading	NULL
my	NULL
first	NULL
page	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stopped	NULL
for	NULL
breath	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
clapped	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
cried	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hearty	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Das	NULL
ist	NULL
gut	NULL

Now	NULL
we	NULL
go	NULL
well	NULL

My	NULL
turn	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
German	NULL
,	NULL
gif	NULL
me	NULL
your	NULL
ear	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
away	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
rumbling	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
strong	NULL
voice	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
relish	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
good	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
hear	NULL
.	NULL

Fortunately	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
was	NULL
_	NULL
The	NULL
Constant	NULL
Tin	NULL
Soldier	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
droll	NULL

you	NULL
know	NULL

so	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
laugh	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
understand	NULL
half	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL

for	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
earnest	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
so	NULL
excited	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
thing	NULL
so	NULL
comical	NULL

After	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
better	NULL

now	NULL
I	NULL
read	NULL
my	NULL
lessons	NULL
pretty	NULL
well	NULL

for	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
studying	NULL
suits	NULL
me	NULL

I	NULL
can	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
grammar	NULL
gets	NULL
tucked	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
tales	NULL
and	NULL
poetry	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
gives	NULL
pills	NULL
in	NULL
jelly	NULL

I	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL
seem	NULL
tired	NULL

it	NULL

which	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL

give	NULL
him	NULL
something	NULL

'm	NULL

up	NULL

his	NULL

see	NULL

manages	NULL
him	NULL
better	NULL

I	NULL
got	NULL
several	NULL

put	NULL
them	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL

where	NULL
he	NULL

I	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL

It	NULL
took	NULL

he	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
mantlepiece	NULL
as	NULL

article	NULL

virtue	NULL

so	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
failure	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL

Poor	NULL
as	NULL

did	NULL
n't	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
glad	NULL

that	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
masquerade	NULL

had	NULL
a	NULL

I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL

at	NULL

So	NULL
I	NULL
dressed	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
Mrs.	NULL

sailed	NULL
in	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
THIRTY-FOUR	NULL
FRIEND	NULL
Though	NULL
very	NULL
happy	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
social	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
busy	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
daily	NULL
work	NULL
that	NULL
earned	NULL
her	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
sweeter	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
effort	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
still	NULL
found	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
literary	NULL
labors	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
purpose	NULL
which	NULL
now	NULL
took	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
natural	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
and	NULL
ambitious	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
means	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
to	NULL
gain	NULL
her	NULL
end	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
money	NULL
conferred	NULL
power	NULL
,	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
power	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
used	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
those	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dream	NULL
of	NULL
filling	NULL
home	NULL
with	NULL
comforts	NULL
,	NULL
giving	NULL
Beth	NULL
everything	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
strawberries	NULL
in	NULL
winter	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
organ	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
bedroom	NULL
,	NULL
going	NULL
abroad	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
always	NULL
having	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
indulge	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
luxury	NULL
of	NULL
charity	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
most	NULL
cherished	NULL
castle	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
prize-story	NULL
experience	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
open	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
long	NULL
traveling	NULL
and	NULL
much	NULL
uphill	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
lead	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
delightful	NULL
chateau	NULL
en	NULL
Espagne	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
novel	NULL
disaster	NULL
quenched	NULL
her	NULL
courage	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
public	NULL
opinion	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
giant	NULL
which	NULL
has	NULL
frightened	NULL
stouter-hearted	NULL
Jacks	NULL
on	NULL
bigger	NULL
beanstalks	NULL
than	NULL
hers	NULL
.	NULL

Like	NULL
that	NULL
immortal	NULL
hero	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
reposed	NULL
awhile	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
attempt	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
resulted	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
tumble	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
lovely	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
giant	NULL
's	NULL
treasures	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
remember	NULL
rightly	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
up	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
take	NULL
another	NULL
'	NULL
spirit	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
strong	NULL
in	NULL
Jo	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
Jack	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
she	NULL
scrambled	NULL
up	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
shady	NULL
side	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
got	NULL
more	NULL
booty	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
nearly	NULL
left	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
far	NULL
more	NULL
precious	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
moneybags	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
to	NULL
writing	NULL
sensation	NULL
stories	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
dark	NULL
ages	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
all-perfect	NULL
America	NULL
read	NULL
rubbish	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
concocted	NULL
a	NULL
'	NULL
thrilling	NULL
tale	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
boldly	NULL
carried	NULL
it	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Dashwood	NULL
,	NULL
editor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Weekly	NULL
Volcano	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
read	NULL
Sartor	NULL
Resartus	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
womanly	NULL
instinct	NULL
that	NULL
clothes	NULL
possess	NULL
an	NULL
influence	NULL
more	NULL
powerful	NULL
over	NULL
many	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
worth	NULL
of	NULL
character	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
magic	NULL
of	NULL
manners	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
she	NULL
dressed	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
persuade	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
neither	NULL
excited	NULL
nor	NULL
nervous	NULL
,	NULL
bravely	NULL
climbed	NULL
two	NULL
pairs	NULL
of	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
dirty	NULL
stairs	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
disorderly	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
cloud	NULL
of	NULL
cigar	NULL
smoke	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
heels	NULL
rather	NULL
higher	NULL
than	NULL
their	NULL
hats	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
articles	NULL
of	NULL
dress	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
remove	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
appearance	NULL
.	NULL

Somewhat	NULL
daunted	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
reception	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
hesitated	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
threshold	NULL
,	NULL
murmuring	NULL
in	NULL
much	NULL
embarrassment	NULL
...	NULL

Down	NULL
went	NULL
the	NULL

up	NULL
rose	NULL
the	NULL

carefully	NULL

his	NULL

advanced	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
nod	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
countenance	NULL
expressive	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL

sleep	NULL

Feeling	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
get	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL

somehow	NULL

Jo	NULL
produced	NULL
her	NULL
manuscript	NULL

,	NULL
blushing	NULL
redder	NULL

redder	NULL
with	NULL
each	NULL

blundered	NULL
out	NULL

Now	NULL

Jo	NULL

like	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Dashwood	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
suit	NULL

all	NULL

under	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL

looking	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
apt	NULL

Just	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
both	NULL

perfectly	NULL

that	NULL
her	NULL

fiction	NULL

considered	NULL
a	NULL

produced	NULL

closed	NULL

Half	NULL
resolving	NULL
never	NULL

she	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL

worked	NULL
off	NULL

in	NULL

surely	NULL

One	NULL

disturbed	NULL

that	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL

preferred	NULL

it	NULL
out	NULL
very	NULL
soon	NULL

promised	NULL

for	NULL
a	NULL

thought	NULL

no	NULL

sincerely	NULL
meant	NULL

rejected	NULL

few	NULL

so	NULL
regarding	NULL
it	NULL

she	NULL
set	NULL
about	NULL
supplying	NULL
her	NULL
deficiencies	NULL
with	NULL
characteristic	NULL
energy	NULL

Eager	NULL

find	NULL
material	NULL

searched	NULL

crimes	NULL

She	NULL
excited	NULL
the	NULL
suspicions	NULL

asking	NULL

delved	NULL

so	NULL
old	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL

introduced	NULL
herself	NULL

and	NULL
misery	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
limited	NULL
opportunities	NULL
allowed	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
prospering	NULL
finely	NULL

but	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
desecrate	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
womanliest	NULL
attributes	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
character	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
living	NULL
in	NULL
bad	NULL
society	NULL

and	NULL
imaginary	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
influence	NULL
affected	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
feeding	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
fancy	NULL
on	NULL
dangerous	NULL

unsubstantial	NULL
food	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
fast	NULL
brushing	NULL
the	NULL
innocent	NULL
bloom	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
nature	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
premature	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
darker	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
comes	NULL
soon	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
see	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
much	NULL
describing	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL

passions	NULL

feelings	NULL
set	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
studying	NULL

speculating	NULL

a	NULL
morbid	NULL
amusement	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
healthy	NULL
young	NULL
minds	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
voluntarily	NULL
indulge	NULL

when	NULL
Jo	NULL
most	NULL
needed	NULL

got	NULL

every	NULL
perfection	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
was	NULL
discovering	NULL
a	NULL
live	NULL
hero	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
interested	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
human	NULL
imperfections	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
conversations	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
advised	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
study	NULL
simple	NULL
,	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lovely	NULL
characters	NULL
,	NULL
wherever	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
good	NULL
training	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
writer	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
coolly	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
and	NULL
studied	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
proceeding	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
much	NULL
surprised	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
known	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
worthy	NULL
Professor	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
humble	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
conceit	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
everybody	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
puzzled	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
neither	NULL
rich	NULL
nor	NULL
great	NULL
,	NULL
young	NULL
nor	NULL
handsome	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
no	NULL
respect	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
called	NULL
fascinating	NULL
,	NULL
imposing	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
brilliant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
attractive	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
genial	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
people	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
gather	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
naturally	NULL
as	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
warm	NULL
hearth	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
always	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
giving	NULL
something	NULL
away	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
stranger	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
everyone	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
friend	NULL
;	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
happy-hearted	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
;	NULL
plain	NULL
and	NULL
peculiar	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
looked	NULL
beautiful	NULL
to	NULL
many	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
oddities	NULL
were	NULL
freely	NULL
forgiven	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
sake	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
often	NULL
watched	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
discover	NULL
the	NULL
charm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
benevolence	NULL
which	NULL
worked	NULL
the	NULL
miracle	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
sorrow	NULL
,	NULL
'	NULL
it	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
head	NULL
under	NULL
its	NULL
wing	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
only	NULL
his	NULL
sunny	NULL
side	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
lines	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
forehead	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Time	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
touched	NULL
him	NULL
gently	NULL
,	NULL
remembering	NULL
how	NULL
kind	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pleasant	NULL
curves	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
memorials	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
friendly	NULL
words	NULL
and	NULL
cheery	NULL
laughs	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
never	NULL
cold	NULL
or	NULL
hard	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
big	NULL
hand	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
warm	NULL
,	NULL
strong	NULL
grasp	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
expressive	NULL
than	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
very	NULL
clothes	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
partake	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hospitable	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wearer	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
ease	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
comfortable	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
capacious	NULL
waistcoat	NULL
was	NULL
suggestive	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
heart	NULL
underneath	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
rusty	NULL
coat	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
social	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
baggy	NULL
pockets	NULL
plainly	NULL
proved	NULL
that	NULL
little	NULL
hands	NULL
often	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
empty	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
full	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
very	NULL
boots	NULL
were	NULL
benevolent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
collars	NULL
never	NULL
stiff	NULL
and	NULL
raspy	NULL
like	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
's	NULL
it	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Jo	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
genuine	NULL
good	NULL
will	NULL
toward	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
fellow	NULL
men	NULL
could	NULL
beautify	NULL
and	NULL
dignify	NULL
even	NULL
a	NULL
stout	NULL
German	NULL
teacher	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
shoveled	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
darned	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
socks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
burdened	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
valued	NULL
goodness	NULL
highly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
also	NULL
possessed	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
feminine	NULL
respect	NULL
for	NULL
intellect	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
discovery	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
Professor	NULL
added	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
regard	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
ever	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
native	NULL
city	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
much	NULL
honored	NULL
and	NULL
esteemed	NULL
for	NULL
learning	NULL
and	NULL
integrity	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
a	NULL
countryman	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
Miss	NULL
Norton	NULL
divulged	NULL
the	NULL
pleasing	NULL
fact	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
her	NULL
Jo	NULL
learned	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
liked	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
because	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
told	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
proud	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
honored	NULL
Professor	NULL
in	NULL
Berlin	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
language-master	NULL
in	NULL
America	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
homely	NULL
,	NULL
hard-working	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
beautified	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
spice	NULL
of	NULL
romance	NULL
which	NULL
this	NULL
discovery	NULL
gave	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Another	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
gift	NULL
than	NULL
intellect	NULL
was	NULL
shown	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
unexpected	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Norton	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
entree	NULL
into	NULL
most	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Jo	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
solitary	NULL
woman	NULL
felt	NULL
an	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ambitious	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
kindly	NULL
conferred	NULL
many	NULL
favors	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
sort	NULL
both	NULL
on	NULL
Jo	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Professor	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
one	NULL
night	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
select	NULL
symposium	NULL
,	NULL
held	NULL
in	NULL
honor	NULL
of	NULL
several	NULL
celebrities	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
went	NULL
prepared	NULL
to	NULL
bow	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
adore	NULL
the	NULL
mighty	NULL
ones	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
worshiped	NULL
with	NULL
youthful	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
afar	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
her	NULL
reverence	NULL
for	NULL
genius	NULL
received	NULL
a	NULL
severe	NULL
shock	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
recover	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
discovery	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
creatures	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
women	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Imagine	NULL
her	NULL
dismay	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
stealing	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
of	NULL
timid	NULL
admiration	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
poet	NULL
whose	NULL
lines	NULL
suggested	NULL
an	NULL
ethereal	NULL
being	NULL
fed	NULL
on	NULL
'	NULL
spirit	NULL
,	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dew	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
behold	NULL
him	NULL
devouring	NULL
his	NULL
supper	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
ardor	NULL
which	NULL
flushed	NULL
his	NULL
intellectual	NULL
countenance	NULL
.	NULL

Turning	NULL
as	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
fallen	NULL
idol	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
other	NULL
discoveries	NULL
which	NULL
rapidly	NULL
dispelled	NULL
her	NULL
romantic	NULL
illusions	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
great	NULL
novelist	NULL
vibrated	NULL
between	NULL
two	NULL
decanters	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
regularity	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
pendulum	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
famous	NULL
divine	NULL
flirted	NULL
openly	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Madame	NULL
de	NULL
Staels	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
looked	NULL
daggers	NULL
at	NULL
another	NULL
Corinne	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
amiably	NULL
satirizing	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
outmaneuvering	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
efforts	NULL
to	NULL
absorb	NULL
the	NULL
profound	NULL
philosopher	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
imbibed	NULL
tea	NULL
Johnsonianly	NULL
and	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
slumber	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
loquacity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
rendering	NULL
speech	NULL
impossible	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
scientific	NULL
celebrities	NULL
,	NULL
forgetting	NULL
their	NULL
mollusks	NULL
and	NULL
glacial	NULL
periods	NULL
,	NULL
gossiped	NULL
about	NULL
art	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
devoting	NULL
themselves	NULL
to	NULL
oysters	NULL
and	NULL
ices	NULL
with	NULL
characteristic	NULL
energy	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
musician	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
charming	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
Orpheus	NULL
,	NULL
talked	NULL
horses	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
specimen	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
British	NULL
nobility	NULL
present	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
ordinary	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
party	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
was	NULL
half	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
felt	NULL
so	NULL
completely	NULL
disillusioned	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
corner	NULL
to	NULL
recover	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
soon	NULL
joined	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
rather	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
element	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
several	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
philosophers	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
mounted	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
hobby	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
ambling	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
an	NULL
intellectual	NULL
tournament	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
recess	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
conversations	NULL
were	NULL
miles	NULL
beyond	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
comprehension	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
Kant	NULL
and	NULL
Hegel	NULL
were	NULL
unknown	NULL
gods	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Subjective	NULL
and	NULL
Objective	NULL
unintelligible	NULL
terms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
'	NULL
evolved	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
inner	NULL
consciousness	NULL
'	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
headache	NULL
after	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
dawned	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
gradually	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
picked	NULL
to	NULL
pieces	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
together	NULL
on	NULL
new	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
talkers	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
infinitely	NULL
better	NULL
principles	NULL
than	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
religion	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fair	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
reasoned	NULL
into	NULL
nothingness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
intellect	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
God	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
philosophy	NULL
or	NULL
metaphysics	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
sort	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
excitement	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
pleasurable	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
painful	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
listened	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
turned	NULL
adrift	NULL
into	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
space	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
balloon	NULL
out	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
holiday	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
Professor	NULL
liked	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
grimmest	NULL
expression	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
wear	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
shook	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
beckoned	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
fascinated	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
freedom	NULL
of	NULL
Speculative	NULL
Philosophy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
kept	NULL
her	NULL
seat	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
wise	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
intended	NULL
to	NULL
rely	NULL
upon	NULL
after	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
annihilated	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
beliefs	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
diffident	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
slow	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
opinions	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
unsettled	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
too	NULL
sincere	NULL
and	NULL
earnest	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
lightly	NULL
spoken	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
glanced	NULL
from	NULL
Jo	NULL
to	NULL
several	NULL
other	NULL
young	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
attracted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
brilliancy	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
philosophic	NULL
pyrotechnics	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knit	NULL
his	NULL
brows	NULL
and	NULL
longed	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
,	NULL
fearing	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
inflammable	NULL
young	NULL
soul	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
led	NULL
astray	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
rockets	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
display	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
an	NULL
empty	NULL
stick	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
scorched	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
bore	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
opinion	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
blazed	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
honest	NULL
indignation	NULL
and	NULL
defended	NULL
religion	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
eloquence	NULL
of	NULL
truth	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
eloquence	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
broken	NULL
English	NULL
musical	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
plain	NULL
face	NULL
beautiful	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
fight	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
wise	NULL
men	NULL
argued	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
beaten	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
colors	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

Somehow	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
talked	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
got	NULL
right	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
Jo	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
beliefs	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
lasted	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
.	NULL

God	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
blind	NULL
force	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
immortality	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
fable	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
blessed	NULL
fact	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
solid	NULL
ground	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
paused	NULL
,	NULL
outtalked	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
one	NULL
whit	NULL
convinced	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
clap	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
thank	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
neither	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
remembered	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
Professor	NULL
her	NULL
heartiest	NULL
respect	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
cost	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
out	NULL
then	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
his	NULL
conscience	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
be	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
character	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
possession	NULL
than	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
rank	NULL
,	NULL
intellect	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
beauty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
greatness	NULL
is	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
wise	NULL
man	NULL
has	NULL
defined	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
'	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
reverence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
will	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
her	NULL
friend	NULL
Friedrich	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
great	NULL

daily	NULL

She	NULL
valued	NULL
his	NULL

coveted	NULL
his	NULL
respect	NULL

she	NULL
wanted	NULL

just	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
wish	NULL
was	NULL
sincerest	NULL

she	NULL
came	NULL
near	NULL
to	NULL
losing	NULL
everything	NULL

It	NULL
all	NULL
grew	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cocked	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
evening	NULL
the	NULL
Professor	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
Jo	NULL
her	NULL
lesson	NULL

a	NULL
paper	NULL

thought	NULL
Jo	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL

as	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
"	NULL
Goot	NULL
efening	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
soberly	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
unconscious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ludicrous	NULL
contrast	NULL
between	NULL
his	NULL
subject	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
headgear	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
Death	NULL
of	NULL
Wallenstein	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
him	NULL
laugh	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
big	NULL

hearty	NULL
laugh	NULL
when	NULL
anything	NULL
funny	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
she	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
discover	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
forgot	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL

for	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
a	NULL
German	NULL
read	NULL
Schiller	NULL

rather	NULL
an	NULL
absorbing	NULL
occupation	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
the	NULL
reading	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
lesson	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lively	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Jo	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
gay	NULL
mood	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
cocked	NULL
hat	NULL
kept	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
dancing	NULL
with	NULL
merriment	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Professor	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stopped	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL

that	NULL
was	NULL

said	NULL
Jo	NULL
.	NULL

Lifting	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
absent-minded	NULL
Professor	NULL
gravely	NULL
felt	NULL
and	NULL
removed	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
cocked	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
threw	NULL
back	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
laughed	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
merry	NULL
bass	NULL
viol	NULL

"	NULL
Ah	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL

it	NULL

nothing	NULL

this	NULL

you	NULL
too	NULL

him	NULL

"	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
lesson	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
because	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
caught	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
picture	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
unfolding	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
disgust	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
these	NULL
papers	NULL

"	NULL

Jo	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sheet	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
pleasing	NULL
illustration	NULL
composed	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
lunatic	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
corpse	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
villain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
viper	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
impulse	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
turn	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
displeasure	NULL
but	NULL
fear	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
she	NULL
fancied	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
Volcano	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
panic	NULL
subsided	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
tales	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
no	NULL
name	NULL
to	NULL
betray	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
betrayed	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
blush	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
though	NULL
an	NULL
absent	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Professor	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
people	NULL
fancied	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Jo	NULL
wrote	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
her	NULL
down	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
newspaper	NULL
offices	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
no	NULL
questions	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
ashamed	NULL
to	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
troubled	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
business	NULL

I	NULL
've	NULL
no	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
as	NULL
many	NULL
people	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
only	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
young	NULL
and	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
far	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
love	NULL

father	NULL
's	NULL
care	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
moved	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
impulse	NULL
as	NULL
quick	NULL
and	NULL
natural	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
prompt	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
a	NULL
baby	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
puddle	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
flashed	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
trace	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
appeared	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL

and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
was	NULL
turned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
needle	NULL
threaded	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL

very	NULL
gravely	NULL

Jo	NULL

energetically	NULL

Mr.	NULL

warmly	NULL

walked	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL

crumpling	NULL
the	NULL

Jo	NULL
sat	NULL
still	NULL

looking	NULL

come	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

for	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
burned	NULL
long	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL

had	NULL
turned	NULL

gone	NULL
harmlessly	NULL
up	NULL

muttered	NULL
the	NULL
Professor	NULL

coming	NULL
back	NULL

a	NULL
relieved	NULL
air	NULL

Jo	NULL
thought	NULL
what	NULL

the	NULL

she	NULL

out	NULL
her	NULL

Mr.	NULL

sometimes	NULL

Jo	NULL
wrote	NULL
no	NULL

deciding	NULL
that	NULL

course	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Sherwood	NULL

Miss	NULL
Edgeworth	NULL

and	NULL
Hannah	NULL
More	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
produced	NULL
a	NULL
tale	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
properly	NULL
called	NULL
an	NULL
essay	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
sermon	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
intensely	NULL
moral	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
doubts	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
lively	NULL
fancy	NULL
and	NULL
girlish	NULL
romance	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
ill	NULL
at	NULL
ease	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
style	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
masquerading	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
stiff	NULL
and	NULL
cumbrous	NULL
costume	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
century	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sent	NULL
this	NULL
didactic	NULL
gem	NULL
to	NULL
several	NULL
markets	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
found	NULL
no	NULL
purchaser	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
agree	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Dashwood	NULL
that	NULL
morals	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
sell	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
tried	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
's	NULL
story	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
easily	NULL
have	NULL
disposed	NULL
of	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
mercenary	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
demand	NULL
filthy	NULL
lucre	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
person	NULL
who	NULL
offered	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
worth	NULL
her	NULL
while	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
juvenile	NULL
literature	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
worthy	NULL
gentleman	NULL
who	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
his	NULL
mission	NULL
to	NULL
convert	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
particular	NULL
belief	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
for	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
consent	NULL
to	NULL
depict	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
naughty	NULL
boys	NULL
as	NULL
being	NULL
eaten	NULL
by	NULL
bears	NULL
or	NULL
tossed	NULL
by	NULL
mad	NULL
bulls	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
particular	NULL
Sabbath	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
infants	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
go	NULL
as	NULL
rewarded	NULL
by	NULL
every	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
bliss	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
gilded	NULL
gingerbread	NULL
to	NULL
escorts	NULL
of	NULL
angels	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
departed	NULL
this	NULL
life	NULL
with	NULL
psalms	NULL
or	NULL
sermons	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
lisping	NULL
tongues	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
nothing	NULL
came	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
trials	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Jo	NULL
corked	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
inkstand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fit	NULL
of	NULL
very	NULL
wholesome	NULL
humility	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
anything	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
wait	NULL
until	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
before	NULL
I	NULL
try	NULL
again	NULL

and	NULL
meantime	NULL
,	NULL
'	NULL

if	NULL
I	NULL

n't	NULL

,	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL

at	NULL

"	NULL

Which	NULL
decision	NULL
proved	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
second	NULL
tumble	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
beanstalk	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
her	NULL
some	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
these	NULL
internal	NULL
revolutions	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
external	NULL
life	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
as	NULL
busy	NULL
and	NULL
uneventful	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
sometimes	NULL
looked	NULL
serious	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
sad	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
observed	NULL
it	NULL
but	NULL
Professor	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
quietly	NULL
that	NULL
Jo	NULL
never	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
watching	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
accept	NULL
and	NULL
profit	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
reproof	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
the	NULL
test	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
satisfied	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
though	NULL
no	NULL
words	NULL
passed	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
writing	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
only	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
guess	NULL
it	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
finger	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
right	NULL
hand	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
inky	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
spent	NULL
her	NULL
evenings	NULL
downstairs	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
met	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
among	NULL
newspaper	NULL
offices	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
studied	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
dogged	NULL
patience	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
assured	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
bent	NULL
on	NULL
occupying	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
with	NULL
something	NULL
useful	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
pleasant	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
helped	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
many	NULL
ways	NULL
,	NULL
proving	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
true	NULL
friend	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Jo	NULL
was	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
while	NULL
her	NULL
pen	NULL
lay	NULL
idle	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
learning	NULL
other	NULL
lessons	NULL
besides	NULL
German	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
laying	NULL
a	NULL
foundation	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sensation	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
winter	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
leave	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Kirke	NULL
till	NULL
June	NULL
.	NULL

Everyone	NULL
seemed	NULL
sorry	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
children	NULL
were	NULL
inconsolable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
's	NULL
hair	NULL
stuck	NULL
straight	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
rumpled	NULL
it	NULL
wildly	NULL
when	NULL
disturbed	NULL
in	NULL
mind	NULL

"	NULL
Going	NULL

Ah	NULL

you	NULL
are	NULL
happy	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
silently	NULL
pulling	NULL
his	NULL
beard	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
held	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
levee	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
last	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
early	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
she	NULL
bade	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
goodbye	NULL
overnight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
turn	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
warmly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Now	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL

Shall	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
eager	NULL
expression	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

Laurie	NULL
graduates	NULL

you	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL

your	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
altered	NULL
tone	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

boy	NULL

"	NULL

Jo	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
unconscious	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
showing	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

Something	NULL
in	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
suddenly	NULL
recalled	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
find	NULL
Laurie	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
'	NULL
best	NULL
friend	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
simply	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
particularly	NULL
wished	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
anything	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
involuntarily	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
blush	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
she	NULL
tried	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
redder	NULL
she	NULL
grew	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
Tina	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
knee	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
become	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Fortunately	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
was	NULL
moved	NULL
to	NULL
hug	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
she	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
,	NULL
hoping	NULL
the	NULL
Professor	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
changed	NULL
again	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
momentary	NULL
anxiety	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
usual	NULL
expression	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
cordially	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
fear	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
the	NULL
friend	NULL
much	NULL
success	NULL

and	NULL
you	NULL
all	NULL
happiness	NULL

Gott	NULL
bless	NULL
you	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
warmly	NULL
,	NULL
shouldered	NULL
Tina	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
were	NULL
abed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
long	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
fire	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
tired	NULL
look	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
heimweh	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
homesickness	NULL
,	NULL
lying	NULL
heavy	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
remembered	NULL
Jo	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
child	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
lap	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
new	NULL
softness	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
leaned	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
roamed	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
in	NULL
search	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

not	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL

I	NULL
must	NULL
not	NULL
hope	NULL
it	NULL
now	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
a	NULL
groan	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
reproaching	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
longing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
repress	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
tousled	NULL
heads	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
pillow	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
seldom-used	NULL
meerschaum	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
opened	NULL
his	NULL
Plato	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
his	NULL
best	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
manfully	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL

were	NULL
very	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
substitutes	NULL
for	NULL

at	NULL

Early	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
to	NULL

Jo	NULL
off	NULL

thanks	NULL

Evening	NULL
meditation	NULL

morning	NULL
work	NULL
somewhat	NULL
allayed	NULL
her	NULL
fears	NULL

enough	NULL

she	NULL
set	NULL

hoping	NULL

still	NULL
further	NULL
fortified	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL

tete-a-tete	NULL

when	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
stalwart	NULL
figure	NULL
looming	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
desire	NULL

turn	NULL

run	NULL
away	NULL

cried	NULL
Laurie	NULL

as	NULL

was	NULL
within	NULL

I	NULL

And	NULL
Jo	NULL
took	NULL
heart	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
salutation	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
called	NULL
lover-like	NULL

She	NULL
always	NULL
used	NULL

take	NULL
his	NULL

on	NULL
these	NULL

now	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
complaint	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
sign	NULL

but	NULL
talked	NULL
on	NULL
rapidly	NULL
about	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL

till	NULL
they	NULL
turned	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
path	NULL
that	NULL
led	NULL
homeward	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
grove	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
more	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
lost	NULL
his	NULL
fine	NULL
flow	NULL
of	NULL
language	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
a	NULL
dreadful	NULL
pause	NULL
occurred	NULL

To	NULL
rescue	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
from	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL

silence	NULL
into	NULL

it	NULL
kept	NULL
falling	NULL

Jo	NULL

Something	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
resolute	NULL
tone	NULL
made	NULL
Jo	NULL
look	NULL
up	NULL
quickly	NULL

him	NULL

Laurie	NULL

began	NULL
Laurie	NULL

who	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL

but	NULL
much	NULL
preferred	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
perfectly	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
particularly	NULL
desired	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
it	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL
mood	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
his	NULL
grandson	NULL

him	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
wise	NULL

So	NULL
,	NULL
stifling	NULL
a	NULL
natural	NULL
regret	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

A	NULL
restless	NULL

from	NULL
Laurie	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL

not	NULL

that	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL

you	NULL

leave	NULL
you	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL

Now	NULL

Laurie	NULL
felt	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
entirely	NULL
broken	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL
howling	NULL
wilderness	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
certain	NULL
words	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
artfully	NULL
introduced	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
closing	NULL
sentence	NULL

the	NULL
broken	NULL
heart	NULL
gave	NULL
an	NULL
unexpected	NULL
leap	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
green	NULL
oasis	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
suddenly	NULL
appeared	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
howling	NULL
wilderness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sighed	NULL

then	NULL
said	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
spiritless	NULL
tone	NULL

"	NULL

Being	NULL
an	NULL
energetic	NULL
individual	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Laurence	NULL
struck	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
iron	NULL
was	NULL
hot	NULL

and	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
blighted	NULL
being	NULL
recovered	NULL
spirit	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
rebel	NULL

they	NULL
were	NULL
off	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
preparation	NULL

Laurie	NULL
bore	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
young	NULL
gentleman	NULL
usually	NULL
do	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
cases	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
moody	NULL
,	NULL
irritable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pensive	NULL
by	NULL
turns	NULL
,	NULL
lost	NULL
his	NULL
appetite	NULL
,	NULL
neglected	NULL
his	NULL
dress	NULL
and	NULL
devoted	NULL
much	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
playing	NULL
tempestuously	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
piano	NULL
,	NULL
avoided	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
consoled	NULL
himself	NULL
by	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
tragic	NULL
face	NULL
that	NULL
haunted	NULL
her	NULL
dreams	NULL
by	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
oppressed	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
guilt	NULL
by	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Unlike	NULL
some	NULL
sufferers	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
unrequited	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
allow	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
attempt	NULL
consolation	NULL
or	NULL
offer	NULL
sympathy	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
some	NULL
accounts	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
relief	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
weeks	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
departure	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
everyone	NULL
rejoiced	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
dear	NULL
fellow	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
forget	NULL
his	NULL
trouble	NULL

come	NULL
home	NULL
happy	NULL
'	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
smiled	NULL
darkly	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
delusion	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
passed	NULL
it	NULL
by	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sad	NULL
superiority	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
fidelity	NULL

his	NULL
love	NULL
was	NULL
unalterable	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
parting	NULL
came	NULL
he	NULL
affected	NULL
high	NULL
spirits	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
conceal	NULL
certain	NULL
inconvenient	NULL
emotions	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
assert	NULL
themselves	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
gaiety	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
impose	NULL
upon	NULL
anybody	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
sake	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
March	NULL
kissed	NULL
him	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
whisper	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
motherly	NULL
solicitude	NULL

Then	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
very	NULL
fast	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
hastily	NULL
embraced	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
forgetting	NULL
the	NULL
afflicted	NULL
Hannah	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ran	NULL
downstairs	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
followed	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
after	NULL
to	NULL
wave	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
look	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
step	NULL
above	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
face	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
short	NULL
appeal	NULL
eloquent	NULL

pathetic	NULL

Laurie	NULL

It	NULL

went	NULL

Ah	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
weight	NULL
fell	NULL
on	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
paler	NULL
and	NULL
but	NULL
littler	NULL
thinner	NULL
than	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
autumn	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
,	NULL
transparent	NULL
look	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
mortal	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
slowly	NULL
refined	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
immortal	NULL
shining	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
frail	NULL
flesh	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
indescribably	NULL
pathetic	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
saw	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
impression	NULL
lost	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
power	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Beth	NULL
seemed	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
in	NULL
other	NULL
cares	NULL
Jo	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
forgot	NULL
her	NULL
fear	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
Laurie	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
peace	NULL
prevailed	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
vague	NULL
anxiety	NULL
returned	NULL
and	NULL
haunted	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
confessed	NULL
her	NULL
sins	NULL
and	NULL
been	NULL
forgiven	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
showed	NULL
her	NULL
savings	NULL
and	NULL
proposed	NULL
a	NULL
mountain	NULL
trip	NULL
,	NULL
Beth	NULL
had	NULL
thanked	NULL
her	NULL
heartily	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
begged	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

Another	NULL
little	NULL
visit	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
seashore	NULL
would	NULL
suit	NULL
her	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
Grandma	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
prevailed	NULL
upon	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
babies	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
took	NULL
Beth	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
quiet	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
live	NULL
much	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
fresh	NULL
sea	NULL
breezes	NULL
blow	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
color	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
pale	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
fashionable	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
even	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
pleasant	NULL
people	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
made	NULL
few	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
preferring	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

Beth	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
shy	NULL
to	NULL
enjoy	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Jo	NULL
too	NULL
wrapped	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
anyone	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
unconscious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
interest	NULL
they	NULL
excited	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
watched	NULL
with	NULL
sympathetic	NULL
eyes	NULL
the	NULL
strong	NULL
sister	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
feeble	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
always	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
felt	NULL
instinctively	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
separation	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
far	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
did	NULL
feel	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
neither	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
often	NULL
between	NULL
ourselves	NULL
and	NULL
those	NULL
nearest	NULL
and	NULL
dearest	NULL
to	NULL
us	NULL
there	NULL
exists	NULL
a	NULL
reserve	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
overcome	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
veil	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
between	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
Beth	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
lift	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
seemed	NULL
something	NULL
sacred	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
Beth	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wondered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
thankful	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
parents	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
quiet	NULL
weeks	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
shadows	NULL
grew	NULL
so	NULL
plain	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
those	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
believing	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
itself	NULL
when	NULL
Beth	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
no	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wondered	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
if	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
really	NULL
guessed	NULL
the	NULL
hard	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
thoughts	NULL
were	NULL
passing	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
hours	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
lay	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
warm	NULL
rocks	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
in	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
lap	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
winds	NULL
blew	NULL
healthfully	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
made	NULL
music	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL
Beth	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
asleep	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
lay	NULL
so	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
putting	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
book	NULL
,	NULL
sat	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
wistful	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
signs	NULL
of	NULL
hope	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
faint	NULL
color	NULL
on	NULL
Beth	NULL
's	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
satisfy	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
cheeks	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
seemed	NULL
too	NULL
feeble	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
rosy	NULL
little	NULL
shells	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
collecting	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
then	NULL
more	NULL
bitterly	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
that	NULL
Beth	NULL
was	NULL
slowly	NULL
drifting	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
instinctively	NULL
tightened	NULL
their	NULL
hold	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
dearest	NULL
treasure	NULL
she	NULL
possessed	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
too	NULL
dim	NULL
for	NULL
seeing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
cleared	NULL
,	NULL
Beth	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
tenderly	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
hardly	NULL
any	NULL
need	NULL

her	NULL

say	NULL

Along	NULL
this	NULL

on	NULL
Christmas	NULL

,	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
walked	NULL
slowly	NULL

with	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
somewhat	NULL
absent	NULL
expression	NULL
of	NULL
countenance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
Italian	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
dressed	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
Englishman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
independent	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
American	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
combination	NULL
which	NULL
caused	NULL
sundry	NULL
pairs	NULL
of	NULL
feminine	NULL
eyes	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
approvingly	NULL
after	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sundry	NULL

shrug	NULL
their	NULL
shoulders	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
envy	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
inches	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
pretty	NULL
faces	NULL
to	NULL
admire	NULL

but	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
took	NULL
little	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL

except	NULL
to	NULL
glance	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
at	NULL
some	NULL
blonde	NULL
girl	NULL
in	NULL
blue	NULL

Presently	NULL
he	NULL
strolled	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
promenade	NULL

stood	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
crossing	NULL

The	NULL
quick	NULL
trot	NULL
of	NULL
ponies	NULL

made	NULL
him	NULL
look	NULL
up	NULL

one	NULL

came	NULL
rapidly	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL
lady	NULL
was	NULL
young	NULL

blonde	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dressed	NULL
in	NULL
blue	NULL

He	NULL
stared	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
his	NULL
whole	NULL
face	NULL
woke	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
waving	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL

a	NULL

party	NULL
at	NULL
our	NULL
hotel	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
many	NULL
Americans	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
give	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
honor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
'll	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
?	NULL

Aunt	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
charmed	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Thank	NULL
you	NULL

Where	NULL
now	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Laurie	NULL
,	NULL
leaning	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
folding	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
proceeding	NULL
which	NULL
suited	NULL
Amy	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
preferred	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
parasol	NULL
whip	NULL
and	NULL
blue	NULL
reins	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
ponies	NULL
'	NULL
backs	NULL
afforded	NULL
her	NULL
infinite	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bankers	NULL
first	NULL
for	NULL
letters	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
to	NULL
Castle	NULL
Hill	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
view	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
lovely	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
feed	NULL
the	NULL
peacocks	NULL
.	NULL

Have	NULL
you	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
there	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Often	NULL
,	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL

but	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
yourself	NULL

The	NULL
last	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
your	NULL
grandfather	NULL
wrote	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
expected	NULL
you	NULL
from	NULL
Berlin	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
spent	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
there	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
joined	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
settled	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
has	NULL
friends	NULL
there	NULL
and	NULL
finds	NULL
plenty	NULL
to	NULL
amuse	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
capitally	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
sociable	NULL
arrangement	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Amy	NULL
,	NULL
missing	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
Laurie	NULL
's	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
tell	NULL
what	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
hates	NULL
to	NULL
travel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
hate	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
we	NULL
each	NULL
suit	NULL
ourselves	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
trouble	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
often	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
enjoys	NULL
my	NULL
adventures	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
I	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
someone	NULL
is	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
me	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
get	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
my	NULL
wanderings	NULL
.	NULL

Dirty	NULL
old	NULL
hole	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
added	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
disgust	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
drove	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
boulevard	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Place	NULL
Napoleon	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
city	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
dirt	NULL
is	NULL
picturesque	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
river	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
hills	NULL
are	NULL
delicious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
these	NULL
glimpses	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
narrow	NULL

streets	NULL
are	NULL
my	NULL
delight	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
we	NULL
shall	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
procession	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
of	NULL
St.	NULL
John	NULL

"	NULL

While	NULL
Laurie	NULL
listlessly	NULL
watched	NULL
the	NULL
procession	NULL
of	NULL
priests	NULL
under	NULL
their	NULL
canopies	NULL
,	NULL
white-veiled	NULL
nuns	NULL
bearing	NULL
lighted	NULL
tapers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
brotherhood	NULL
in	NULL
blue	NULL
chanting	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
,	NULL
Amy	NULL
watched	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
shyness	NULL
steal	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
changed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
merry-faced	NULL
boy	NULL
she	NULL
left	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
moody-looking	NULL
man	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
handsomer	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
and	NULL
greatly	NULL
improved	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
flush	NULL
of	NULL
pleasure	NULL
at	NULL
meeting	NULL
her	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
tired	NULL
and	NULL
spiritless	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
sick	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
exactly	NULL
unhappy	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
older	NULL
and	NULL
graver	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
prosperous	NULL
life	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
understand	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
venture	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
questions	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
she	NULL
shook	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
touched	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
ponies	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
procession	NULL
wound	NULL
away	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
arches	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Paglioni	NULL
bridge	NULL
and	NULL
vanished	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Que	NULL
pensez-vous	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
airing	NULL
her	NULL
French	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
improved	NULL
in	NULL
quantity	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
quality	NULL

since	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
abroad	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
mademoiselle	NULL
has	NULL
made	NULL
good	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
time	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
is	NULL
charming	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
replied	NULL
Laurie	NULL
,	NULL
bowing	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
admiring	NULL
look	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
blushed	NULL
with	NULL
pleasure	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
somehow	NULL
the	NULL
compliment	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
satisfy	NULL
her	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
blunt	NULL
praises	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
promenaded	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
festival	NULL
occasions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
'	NULL
altogether	NULL
jolly	NULL

,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
hearty	NULL
smile	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
approving	NULL
pat	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
tone	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
though	NULL
not	NULL
blase	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
sounded	NULL
indifferent	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
he	NULL
's	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
he	NULL
'd	NULL
stay	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
disappointment	NULL
and	NULL
discomfort	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
meantime	NULL
to	NULL
seem	NULL
quite	NULL
easy	NULL
and	NULL
gay	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
Avigdor	NULL
's	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
precious	NULL
home	NULL
letters	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
giving	NULL
the	NULL
reins	NULL
to	NULL
Laurie	NULL
,	NULL
read	NULL
them	NULL
luxuriously	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
wound	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
shady	NULL
road	NULL
between	NULL
green	NULL
hedges	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
tea	NULL
roses	NULL
bloomed	NULL
as	NULL
freshly	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
June	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Beth	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
poorly	NULL

Mother	NULL
says	NULL

I	NULL
often	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
say	NULL
'	NULL
stay	NULL

.	NULL

So	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
another	NULL
chance	NULL
like	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Amy	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
sober	NULL
over	NULL
one	NULL
page	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
right	NULL

there	NULL

You	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
nothing	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
comfort	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
drew	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
nearer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
more	NULL
like	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
self	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fear	NULL
that	NULL
sometimes	NULL
weighed	NULL
on	NULL
Amy	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
lightened	NULL

look	NULL

the	NULL
brotherly	NULL
'	NULL
my	NULL

seemed	NULL
to	NULL
assure	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL

any	NULL

did	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
alone	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
land	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
she	NULL
laughed	NULL
and	NULL
showed	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
sketch	NULL
of	NULL
Jo	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
scribbling	NULL

with	NULL

words	NULL

Laurie	NULL
smiled	NULL

took	NULL
it	NULL

put	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
vest	NULL
pocket	NULL
'	NULL
to	NULL

it	NULL
from	NULL
blowing	NULL
away	NULL

and	NULL
listened	NULL
with	NULL
interest	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
lively	NULL
letter	NULL
Amy	NULL
read	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

regularly	NULL

said	NULL
Amy	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
alighted	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
ruins	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
fort	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
flock	NULL
of	NULL
splendid	NULL
peacocks	NULL
came	NULL
trooping	NULL
about	NULL

tamely	NULL
waiting	NULL

While	NULL
Amy	NULL
stood	NULL
laughing	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bank	NULL
above	NULL
him	NULL

scattered	NULL
crumbs	NULL

a	NULL
natural	NULL
curiosity	NULL

what	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
perplex	NULL

disappoint	NULL

much	NULL

admire	NULL

approve	NULL

for	NULL
overlooking	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
little	NULL
affectations	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL

ever	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
addition	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL

something	NULL
in	NULL
dress	NULL

which	NULL
we	NULL
call	NULL
elegance	NULL

Always	NULL
mature	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
age	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
gained	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
aplomb	NULL
in	NULL
both	NULL
carriage	NULL

conversation	NULL

which	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
seem	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL

the	NULL
world	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL

now	NULL

then	NULL
showed	NULL
itself	NULL

her	NULL
strong	NULL
will	NULL
still	NULL
held	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL

her	NULL
native	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL

watched	NULL
her	NULL
feed	NULL
the	NULL
peacocks	NULL

he	NULL
saw	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
satisfy	NULL

interest	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
carried	NULL
away	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
little	NULL
picture	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
bright-faced	NULL
girl	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sunshine	NULL

which	NULL
brought	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL

hue	NULL

her	NULL
dress	NULL

the	NULL

color	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL

the	NULL
golden	NULL

her	NULL

Amy	NULL
knew	NULL
her	NULL

made	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL

which	NULL

a	NULL
fortune	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL

woman	NULL

Tarlatan	NULL

were	NULL
cheap	NULL
at	NULL

so	NULL
she	NULL
enveloped	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL

following	NULL
the	NULL
sensible	NULL
English	NULL
fashion	NULL

both	NULL

It	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
confessed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

we	NULL

out	NULL

her	NULL

Having	NULL

for	NULL
this	NULL

Amy	NULL
looped	NULL
her	NULL

down	NULL

she	NULL

surveying	NULL
herself	NULL

she	NULL
looked	NULL
unusually	NULL

She	NULL
seldom	NULL

thought	NULL

for	NULL

the	NULL

more	NULL

walked	NULL
up	NULL

down	NULL
the	NULL

waiting	NULL
for	NULL
Laurie	NULL

and	NULL
once	NULL
arranged	NULL
herself	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
chandelier	NULL

which	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL

upon	NULL
her	NULL

she	NULL
thought	NULL
better	NULL

Amy	NULL

strolled	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
rushed	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
claim	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
glorious	NULL
polka	NULL
redowa	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
polite	NULL
regrets	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
impose	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
galloped	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Count	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
Laurie	NULL
sit	NULL
down	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
actual	NULL
expression	NULL
of	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
unpardonable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Amy	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
chaperon	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
dances	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
necessary	NULL
pin	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
's	NULL
rest	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
anger	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
effect	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
hid	NULL
it	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
smiling	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seemed	NULL
unusually	NULL
blithe	NULL
and	NULL
brilliant	NULL
.	NULL

Laurie	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
followed	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
pleasure	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
neither	NULL
romped	NULL
nor	NULL
sauntered	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
danced	NULL
with	NULL
spirit	NULL
and	NULL
grace	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
the	NULL
delightsome	NULL
pastime	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
very	NULL
naturally	NULL
fell	NULL
to	NULL
studying	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
new	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
was	NULL
half	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
'	NULL
little	NULL
Amy	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
charming	NULL
woman	NULL
'	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lively	NULL
scene	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
soon	NULL
the	NULL
spirit	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
social	NULL
season	NULL
took	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
everyone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Christmas	NULL
merriment	NULL
made	NULL
all	NULL
faces	NULL
shine	NULL
,	NULL
hearts	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
heels	NULL
light	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
musicians	NULL
fiddled	NULL
,	NULL
tooted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
banged	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
everybody	NULL
danced	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
admired	NULL
their	NULL
neighbors	NULL
with	NULL
uncommon	NULL
warmth	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
air	NULL
was	NULL
dark	NULL
with	NULL
Davises	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
many	NULL
Joneses	NULL
gamboled	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
flock	NULL
of	NULL
young	NULL
giraffes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
golden	NULL
secretary	NULL
darted	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
meteor	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
dashing	NULL
French-woman	NULL
who	NULL
carpeted	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
pink	NULL
satin	NULL
train	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
serene	NULL
Teuton	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
supper-table	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
eating	NULL
steadily	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
bill	NULL
of	NULL
fare	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dismayed	NULL
the	NULL
garcons	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
ravages	NULL
he	NULL
committed	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
Emperor	NULL
's	NULL
friend	NULL
covered	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
glory	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
danced	NULL
everything	NULL
,	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
introduced	NULL
impromptu	NULL
pirouettes	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
figures	NULL
bewildered	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boyish	NULL
abandon	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
stout	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
charming	NULL
to	NULL
behold	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
'	NULL
carried	NULL
weight	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
danced	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
India-rubber	NULL
ball	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
ran	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
flew	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
pranced	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
glowed	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
bald	NULL
head	NULL
shown	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
coattails	NULL
waved	NULL
wildly	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
pumps	NULL
actually	NULL
twinkled	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
music	NULL
stopped	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wiped	NULL
the	NULL
drops	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
brow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
beamed	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
fellow	NULL
men	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
French	NULL
Pickwick	NULL
without	NULL
glasses	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
Pole	NULL
distinguished	NULL
themselves	NULL
by	NULL
equal	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
but	NULL
more	NULL
graceful	NULL
agility	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Laurie	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
involuntarily	NULL
keeping	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rhythmic	NULL
rise	NULL
and	NULL
fall	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
slippers	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
flew	NULL
by	NULL
as	NULL
indefatigably	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL

When	NULL
little	NULL
Vladimir	NULL
finally	NULL
relinquished	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
assurances	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
'	NULL
desolated	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
so	NULL
early	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
rest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
her	NULL
recreant	NULL
knight	NULL
had	NULL
borne	NULL
his	NULL
punishment	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL

a	NULL

healthy	NULL

the	NULL

Laurie	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL

he	NULL
rose	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
his	NULL
seat	NULL

when	NULL
he	NULL
hurried	NULL
away	NULL

the	NULL

Meg	NULL
did	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL

found	NULL
it	NULL
good	NULL

and	NULL
acted	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL

though	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
attempt	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
made	NULL
exactly	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
planned	NULL

it	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
tyrannized	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL

ruled	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL

they	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
kicking	NULL

squalling	NULL
brought	NULL
them	NULL
whatever	NULL
they	NULL
wanted	NULL

Mamma	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
abject	NULL
slave	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
caprices	NULL

Papa	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
easily	NULL
subjugated	NULL

and	NULL
occasionally	NULL
afflicted	NULL
his	NULL
tender	NULL
spouse	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
attempt	NULL
at	NULL
paternal	NULL
discipline	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
obstreperous	NULL
son	NULL

For	NULL
Demi	NULL
inherited	NULL
a	NULL
trifle	NULL

his	NULL
sire	NULL

firmness	NULL
of	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
call	NULL
it	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
little	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL

to	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL
king	NULL

not	NULL

Mamma	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
dear	NULL
too	NULL
young	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
taught	NULL
to	NULL
conquer	NULL
his	NULL

Papa	NULL
believed	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
never	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
soon	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
obedience	NULL

So	NULL
Master	NULL
Demi	NULL
early	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
undertook	NULL

he	NULL
always	NULL
got	NULL

the	NULL
Englishman	NULL

more	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
talk	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
Meg	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
a	NULL
social	NULL
evening	NULL
with	NULL
John	NULL

so	NULL
she	NULL
ordered	NULL
a	NULL
nice	NULL
supper	NULL

set	NULL
the	NULL
parlor	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL

dressed	NULL
herself	NULL
prettily	NULL

put	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
early	NULL

that	NULL
nothing	NULL

But	NULL
unfortunately	NULL
Demi	NULL
's	NULL
most	NULL
unconquerable	NULL
prejudice	NULL
was	NULL
against	NULL
going	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
he	NULL
decided	NULL

go	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
rampage	NULL

So	NULL
poor	NULL
Meg	NULL
sang	NULL

rocked	NULL

told	NULL

tried	NULL

softly	NULL
closed	NULL

Meg	NULL
slipped	NULL
away	NULL

down	NULL

lay	NULL
fast	NULL
asleep	NULL

John	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
revolution	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
kind	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
wisely	NULL
asked	NULL
no	NULL
questions	NULL

knowing	NULL
that	NULL
Meg	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
transparent	NULL
little	NULL
person	NULL

she	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
keep	NULL

save	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL

and	NULL
therefore	NULL
the	NULL
clue	NULL
would	NULL
soon	NULL
appear	NULL

He	NULL
read	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
debate	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
amiable	NULL
readiness	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
explained	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
most	NULL
lucid	NULL
manner	NULL

while	NULL
Meg	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
deeply	NULL
interested	NULL

ask	NULL

keep	NULL
her	NULL

from	NULL
wandering	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
state	NULL

the	NULL
state	NULL

her	NULL

In	NULL
her	NULL
secret	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
politics	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
bad	NULL

mathematics	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
mission	NULL
of	NULL

seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
calling	NULL
each	NULL

she	NULL
kept	NULL
these	NULL
feminine	NULL
ideas	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
John	NULL
paused	NULL

shook	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
THIRTY-NINE	NULL
LAZY	NULL
LAURENCE	NULL
Laurie	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Nice	NULL
intending	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
remained	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
wandering	NULL
about	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Amy	NULL
's	NULL
familiar	NULL
presence	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
homelike	NULL
charm	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
foreign	NULL
scenes	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
bore	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
rather	NULL
missed	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
petting	NULL
'	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
a	NULL
taste	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
attentions	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
flattering	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
strangers	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
half	NULL
so	NULL
pleasant	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
sisterly	NULL
adoration	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
never	NULL
would	NULL
pet	NULL
him	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
quite	NULL
clung	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
representative	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dear	NULL
family	NULL
for	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
longed	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
confess	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
naturally	NULL
took	NULL
comfort	NULL
in	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
's	NULL
society	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
much	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
riding	NULL
,	NULL
walking	NULL
,	NULL
dancing	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
dawdling	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
at	NULL
Nice	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
industrious	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
gay	NULL
season	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
apparently	NULL
amusing	NULL
themselves	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
careless	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
half-consciously	NULL
making	NULL
discoveries	NULL
and	NULL
forming	NULL
opinions	NULL
about	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
rose	NULL
daily	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
estimation	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
friend	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
sank	NULL
in	NULL
hers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
each	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
before	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
was	NULL
spoken	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
please	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
succeeded	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
grateful	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
many	NULL
pleasures	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
repaid	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
services	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
womanly	NULL
women	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
lend	NULL
an	NULL
indescribable	NULL
charm	NULL
.	NULL

Laurie	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
effort	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
just	NULL
let	NULL
himself	NULL
drift	NULL
along	NULL
as	NULL
comfortably	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
forget	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
women	NULL
owed	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
word	NULL
because	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
cold	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
cost	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
effort	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
generous	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
Amy	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
trinkets	NULL
in	NULL
Nice	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
change	NULL
the	NULL
opinion	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
forming	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
rather	NULL
dreaded	NULL
the	NULL
keen	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
watch	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
half-sorrowful	NULL
,	NULL
half-scornful	NULL
surprise	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
Monaco	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
preferred	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
write	NULL
letters	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
are	NULL
done	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
Valrosa	NULL
to	NULL
sketch	NULL
,	NULL
will	NULL
you	NULL
come	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Amy	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
joined	NULL
Laurie	NULL
one	NULL
lovely	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
lounged	NULL
in	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
noon	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

yes	NULL

is	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL
rather	NULL
warm	NULL
for	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
walk	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
answered	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
shaded	NULL
salon	NULL
looked	NULL
inviting	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
glare	NULL
without	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL

Baptiste	NULL
can	NULL
drive	NULL

so	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL
have	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
but	NULL
hold	NULL
your	NULL
umbrella	NULL

and	NULL
keep	NULL
your	NULL
gloves	NULL
nice	NULL

"	NULL
returned	NULL
Amy	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sarcastic	NULL
glance	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
immaculate	NULL
kids	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
weak	NULL
point	NULL
with	NULL
Laurie	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
pleasure	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
sketchbook	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
tucked	NULL
it	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
arm	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sharp	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
trouble	NULL
yourself	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
no	NULL

me	NULL

you	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
look	NULL

Laurie	NULL
lifted	NULL
his	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
and	NULL
followed	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
leisurely	NULL
pace	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
ran	NULL
downstairs	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
reins	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
little	NULL
Baptiste	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
but	NULL
fold	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
and	NULL
fall	NULL
asleep	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
perch	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
two	NULL
never	NULL
quarreled	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
well-bred	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
now	NULL
Laurie	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
lazy	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
he	NULL
peeped	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
hatbrim	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
inquiring	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
answered	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
amicable	NULL
manner	NULL

was	NULL

the	NULL

little	NULL
Baptiste	NULL

up	NULL
behind	NULL
,	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
monsieur	NULL
and	NULL
madamoiselle	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
charming	NULL
spirits	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
both	NULL
felt	NULL
ill	NULL
at	NULL
ease	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
friendly	NULL
frankness	NULL
was	NULL
disturbed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sunshine	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
shadow	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL

and	NULL
despite	NULL
their	NULL
apparent	NULL
gaiety	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
secret	NULL
discontent	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

"	NULL

you	NULL
this	NULL
evening	NULL

asked	NULL
Amy	NULL

as	NULL
they	NULL
parted	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL

door	NULL

"	NULL
Unfortunately	NULL

and	NULL
Laurie	NULL
bent	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
foreign	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
became	NULL
him	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
many	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

Something	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
made	NULL
Amy	NULL
say	NULL
quickly	NULL

warmly	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
No	NULL

I	NULL
'd	NULL
rather	NULL

all	NULL

Goodbye	NULL

with	NULL
these	NULL
words	NULL

uttered	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tone	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL

Laurie	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL

after	NULL
a	NULL
handshake	NULL
almost	NULL
painful	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
heartiness	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
call	NULL

Amy	NULL
received	NULL
a	NULL
note	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
smile	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL

sigh	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL

Amy	NULL

with	NULL
an	NULL

The	NULL
next	NULL

her	NULL

fell	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
glanced	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
FORTY	NULL
THE	NULL
VALLEY	NULL
OF	NULL
THE	NULL
SHADOW	NULL
When	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
bitterness	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
accepted	NULL
the	NULL
inevitable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
it	NULL
cheerfully	NULL
,	NULL
helping	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
increased	NULL
affection	NULL
which	NULL
comes	NULL
to	NULL
bind	NULL
households	NULL
tenderly	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
times	NULL
of	NULL
trouble	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
put	NULL
away	NULL
their	NULL
grief	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
each	NULL
did	NULL
his	NULL
or	NULL
her	NULL
part	NULL
toward	NULL
making	NULL
that	NULL
last	NULL
year	NULL
a	NULL
happy	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pleasantest	NULL
room	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
was	NULL
set	NULL
apart	NULL
for	NULL
Beth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
gathered	NULL
everything	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
most	NULL
loved	NULL
,	NULL
flowers	NULL
,	NULL
pictures	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
piano	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
worktable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
beloved	NULL
pussies	NULL
.	NULL

Father	NULL
's	NULL
best	NULL
books	NULL
found	NULL
their	NULL
way	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
Mother	NULL
's	NULL
easy	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
desk	NULL
,	NULL
Amy	NULL
's	NULL
finest	NULL
sketches	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
Meg	NULL
brought	NULL
her	NULL
babies	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
loving	NULL
pilgrimage	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
sunshine	NULL
for	NULL
Aunty	NULL
Beth	NULL
.	NULL

John	NULL
quietly	NULL
set	NULL
apart	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
sum	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
enjoy	NULL
the	NULL
pleasure	NULL
of	NULL
keeping	NULL
the	NULL
invalid	NULL
supplied	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
fruit	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
and	NULL
longed	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

Old	NULL
Hannah	NULL
never	NULL
wearied	NULL
of	NULL
concocting	NULL
dainty	NULL
dishes	NULL
to	NULL
tempt	NULL
a	NULL
capricious	NULL
appetite	NULL
,	NULL
dropping	NULL
tears	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
worked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
came	NULL
little	NULL
gifts	NULL
and	NULL
cheerful	NULL
letters	NULL
,	NULL
seeming	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
breaths	NULL
of	NULL
warmth	NULL
and	NULL
fragrance	NULL
from	NULL
lands	NULL
that	NULL
know	NULL
no	NULL
winter	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
,	NULL
cherished	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
household	NULL
saint	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
shrine	NULL
,	NULL
sat	NULL
Beth	NULL
,	NULL
tranquil	NULL
and	NULL
busy	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
nothing	NULL
could	NULL
change	NULL
the	NULL
sweet	NULL
,	NULL
unselfish	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
while	NULL
preparing	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
happier	NULL
for	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
should	NULL
remain	NULL
behind	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
feeble	NULL
fingers	NULL
were	NULL
never	NULL
idle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
pleasures	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
little	NULL
things	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
children	NULL
daily	NULL
passing	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
fro	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
drop	NULL
a	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
mittens	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
window	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
purple	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
needlebook	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
small	NULL
mother	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
dolls	NULL
,	NULL
penwipers	NULL
for	NULL
young	NULL
penmen	NULL
toiling	NULL
through	NULL
forests	NULL
of	NULL
pothooks	NULL
,	NULL
scrapbooks	NULL
for	NULL
picture-loving	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
pleasant	NULL
devices	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
reluctant	NULL
climbers	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ladder	NULL
of	NULL
learning	NULL
found	NULL
their	NULL
way	NULL
strewn	NULL
with	NULL
flowers	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
regard	NULL
the	NULL
gentle	NULL
giver	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
fairy	NULL
godmother	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
sat	NULL
above	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
showered	NULL
down	NULL
gifts	NULL
miraculously	NULL
suited	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
tastes	NULL
and	NULL
needs	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Beth	NULL
had	NULL
wanted	NULL
any	NULL
reward	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bright	NULL
little	NULL
faces	NULL
always	NULL
turned	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
nods	NULL

smiles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
droll	NULL
little	NULL
letters	NULL
which	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
blots	NULL
and	NULL
gratitude	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
few	NULL
months	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
happy	NULL
ones	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Beth	NULL
often	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
"	NULL
How	NULL
beautiful	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

as	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
sat	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
sunny	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
babies	NULL
kicking	NULL
and	NULL
crowing	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
mother	NULL
and	NULL
sisters	NULL
working	NULL
near	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
father	NULL
reading	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pleasant	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
wise	NULL
old	NULL
books	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
rich	NULL
in	NULL
good	NULL
and	NULL
comfortable	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
applicable	NULL
now	NULL
as	NULL
when	NULL
written	NULL
centuries	NULL

,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
chapel	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
a	NULL
paternal	NULL
priest	NULL
taught	NULL
his	NULL
flock	NULL
the	NULL
hard	NULL
lessons	NULL
all	NULL

trying	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
hope	NULL
can	NULL
comfort	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
faith	NULL
make	NULL
resignation	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

Simple	NULL
sermons	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
went	NULL
straight	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
souls	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
listened	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
minister	NULL
's	NULL
religion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
frequent	NULL
falter	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
double	NULL
eloquence	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
or	NULL
read	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
peaceful	NULL
time	NULL
was	NULL
given	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
preparation	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sad	NULL
hours	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
by-and-by	NULL
,	NULL
Beth	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
needle	NULL
was	NULL
'	NULL
so	NULL
heavy	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
down	NULL
forever	NULL
.	NULL

Talking	NULL
wearied	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
faces	NULL
troubled	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
pain	NULL
claimed	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
tranquil	NULL
spirit	NULL
was	NULL
sorrowfully	NULL
perturbed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
ills	NULL
that	NULL
vexed	NULL
her	NULL
feeble	NULL
flesh	NULL
.	NULL

Ah	NULL
me	NULL
!	NULL

Such	NULL
heavy	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
long	NULL
nights	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
aching	NULL
hearts	NULL
and	NULL
imploring	NULL
prayers	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
were	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
thin	NULL
hands	NULL
stretched	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
beseechingly	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
bitter	NULL
cry	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Help	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
help	NULL
me	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

and	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
help	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
sad	NULL
eclipse	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
serene	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sharp	NULL
struggle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
life	NULL
with	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
both	NULL
were	NULL
mercifully	NULL
brief	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
natural	NULL
rebellion	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
peace	NULL
returned	NULL
more	NULL
beautiful	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
the	NULL
wreck	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
frail	NULL
body	NULL
,	NULL
Beth	NULL
's	NULL
soul	NULL
grew	NULL
strong	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
those	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
,	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
pilgrim	NULL
called	NULL
was	NULL
likewise	NULL
the	NULL
fittest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
shore	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
Shining	NULL
Ones	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
crossed	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
never	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
since	NULL
Beth	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
feel	NULL
stronger	NULL
when	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
slept	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
couch	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
waking	NULL
often	NULL
to	NULL
renew	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
feed	NULL
,	NULL
lift	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
wait	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
patient	NULL
creature	NULL
who	NULL
seldom	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
'	NULL
tried	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
trouble	NULL
'	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
day	NULL
she	NULL
haunted	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
jealous	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
nurse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
prouder	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
chosen	NULL
then	NULL
than	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
honor	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
ever	NULL
brought	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Precious	NULL
and	NULL
helpful	NULL
hours	NULL
to	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
now	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
received	NULL
the	NULL
teaching	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
needed	NULL
.	NULL

Lessons	NULL
in	NULL
patience	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
sweetly	NULL
taught	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
fail	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
charity	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
lovely	NULL
spirit	NULL
that	NULL
can	NULL
forgive	NULL
and	NULL
truly	NULL
forget	NULL
unkindness	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
loyalty	NULL
to	NULL
duty	NULL
that	NULL
makes	NULL
the	NULL
hardest	NULL
easy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sincere	NULL
faith	NULL
that	NULL
fears	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
trusts	NULL
undoubtingly	NULL
.	NULL

Often	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
woke	NULL
Jo	NULL
found	NULL
Beth	NULL
reading	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
well-worn	NULL
little	NULL
book	NULL
,	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
singing	NULL
softly	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
beguile	NULL
the	NULL
sleepless	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
lean	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
slow	NULL
tears	NULL
dropped	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
transparent	NULL
fingers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Jo	NULL
would	NULL
lie	NULL
watching	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
thoughts	NULL
too	NULL
deep	NULL
for	NULL
tears	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
Beth	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
simple	NULL
,	NULL
unselfish	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
wean	NULL
herself	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
dear	NULL
old	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fit	NULL
herself	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
sacred	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
comfort	NULL
,	NULL
quiet	NULL
prayers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
music	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

Seeing	NULL
this	NULL
did	NULL
more	NULL
for	NULL
Jo	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
wisest	NULL
sermons	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
saintliest	NULL
hymns	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
fervent	NULL
prayers	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
voice	NULL
could	NULL
utter	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
with	NULL
eyes	NULL
made	NULL
clear	NULL
by	NULL
many	NULL
tears	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
heart	NULL
softened	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
tenderest	NULL
sorrow	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
recognized	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
life	NULL
--	NULL
uneventful	NULL
,	NULL
unambitious	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
genuine	NULL
virtues	NULL
which	NULL
'	NULL
smell	NULL
sweet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
blossom	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dust	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
self-forgetfulness	NULL
that	NULL
makes	NULL
the	NULL
humblest	NULL
on	NULL
earth	NULL
remembered	NULL
soonest	NULL
in	NULL
heaven	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
true	NULL
success	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL

One	NULL
night	NULL
when	NULL
Beth	NULL
looked	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
books	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
forget	NULL
the	NULL
mortal	NULL
weariness	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL

as	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
the	NULL
leaves	NULL

With	NULL
tears	NULL

prayers	NULL
and	NULL
tender	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
Mother	NULL

made	NULL
her	NULL
ready	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
FORTY-ONE	NULL
LEARNING	NULL
TO	NULL
FORGET	NULL
Amy	NULL
's	NULL
lecture	NULL
did	NULL
Laurie	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
own	NULL
it	NULL
till	NULL
long	NULL
afterward	NULL
.	NULL

Men	NULL
seldom	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
when	NULL
women	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
advisers	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
lords	NULL
of	NULL
creation	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
advice	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
persuaded	NULL
themselves	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
just	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
intended	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
act	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
succeeds	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
weaker	NULL
vessel	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
credit	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
fails	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
generously	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
.	NULL

Laurie	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
grandfather	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
dutifully	NULL
devoted	NULL
for	NULL
several	NULL
weeks	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
declared	NULL
the	NULL
climate	NULL
of	NULL
Nice	NULL
had	NULL
improved	NULL
him	NULL
wonderfully	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
try	NULL
it	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
gentleman	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
elephants	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
dragged	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
scolding	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
received	NULL
.	NULL

Pride	NULL
forbid	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whenever	NULL
the	NULL
longing	NULL
grew	NULL
very	NULL
strong	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
fortified	NULL
his	NULL
resolution	NULL
by	NULL
repeating	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
deepest	NULL
impression	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
despise	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Go	NULL
and	NULL
do	NULL
something	NULL
splendid	NULL
that	NULL
will	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
love	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Laurie	NULL
turned	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
over	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
soon	NULL
brought	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
confess	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
selfish	NULL
and	NULL
lazy	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
has	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
sorrow	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
indulged	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
vagaries	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
lived	NULL
it	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
blighted	NULL
affections	NULL
were	NULL
quite	NULL
dead	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
never	NULL
cease	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
faithful	NULL
mourner	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
occasion	NULL
to	NULL
wear	NULL
his	NULL
weeds	NULL
ostentatiously	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
love	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
respect	NULL
and	NULL
admire	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
doing	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
prove	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
'	NULL
No	NULL
'	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
spoiled	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Amy	NULL
's	NULL
advice	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
unnecessary	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
been	NULL
waiting	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
aforesaid	NULL
blighted	NULL
affections	NULL
were	NULL
decently	NULL
interred	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
being	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
'	NULL
hide	NULL
his	NULL
stricken	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
toil	NULL
on	NULL
'	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
Goethe	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
joy	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
grief	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
song	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
Laurie	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
embalm	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
sorrow	NULL
in	NULL
music	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
compose	NULL
a	NULL
Requiem	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
harrow	NULL
up	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
soul	NULL
and	NULL
melt	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
of	NULL
every	NULL
hearer	NULL
.	NULL

Therefore	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
getting	NULL
restless	NULL
and	NULL
moody	NULL
and	NULL
ordered	NULL
him	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Vienna	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
musical	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
firm	NULL
determination	NULL
to	NULL
distinguish	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
whether	NULL
the	NULL
sorrow	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
vast	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
embodied	NULL
in	NULL
music	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
music	NULL
too	NULL
ethereal	NULL
to	NULL
uplift	NULL
a	NULL
mortal	NULL
woe	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
soon	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Requiem	NULL
was	NULL
beyond	NULL
him	NULL
just	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
evident	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
working	NULL
order	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
ideas	NULL
needed	NULL
clarifying	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
often	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
plaintive	NULL
strain	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
find	NULL
himself	NULL
humming	NULL
a	NULL
dancing	NULL
tune	NULL
that	NULL
vividly	NULL
recalled	NULL
the	NULL
Christmas	NULL
ball	NULL
at	NULL
Nice	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
the	NULL
stout	NULL
Frenchman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
an	NULL
effectual	NULL
stop	NULL
to	NULL
tragic	NULL
composition	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
being	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
an	NULL
opera	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
nothing	NULL
seemed	NULL
impossible	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
here	NULL
again	NULL
unforeseen	NULL
difficulties	NULL
beset	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
Jo	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
heroine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
memory	NULL
to	NULL
supply	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
tender	NULL
recollections	NULL
and	NULL
romantic	NULL
visions	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
memory	NULL
turned	NULL
traitor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
possessed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
perverse	NULL
spirit	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
only	NULL
recall	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
oddities	NULL
,	NULL
faults	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
freaks	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
only	NULL
show	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
unsentimental	NULL
aspects	NULL
--	NULL
beating	NULL
mats	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
tied	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
bandanna	NULL
,	NULL
barricading	NULL
herself	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
pillow	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
throwing	NULL
cold	NULL
water	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
passion	NULL
a	NULL
la	NULL
Gummidge	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
irresistable	NULL
laugh	NULL
spoiled	NULL
the	NULL
pensive	NULL
picture	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
endeavoring	NULL
to	NULL
paint	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
put	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
opera	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
price	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
Bless	NULL
that	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
torment	NULL
she	NULL
is	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
clutch	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
distracted	NULL
composer	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
another	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
less	NULL
intractable	NULL
damsel	NULL
to	NULL
immortalize	NULL
in	NULL
melody	NULL
,	NULL
memory	NULL
produced	NULL
one	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
obliging	NULL
readiness	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
phantom	NULL
wore	NULL
many	NULL
faces	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
always	NULL
had	NULL
golden	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
enveloped	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
diaphanous	NULL
cloud	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
floated	NULL
airily	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
's	NULL
eye	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
pleasing	NULL
chaos	NULL
of	NULL
roses	NULL
,	NULL
peacocks	NULL
,	NULL
white	NULL
ponies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
blue	NULL
ribbons	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
complacent	NULL
wraith	NULL
any	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
heroine	NULL
and	NULL
grew	NULL
quite	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
gifted	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
every	NULL
gift	NULL
and	NULL
grace	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
escorted	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
unscathed	NULL
,	NULL
through	NULL
trials	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
annihilated	NULL
any	NULL
mortal	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

Thanks	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
inspiration	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
swimmingly	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
gradually	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
lost	NULL
its	NULL
charm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
forgot	NULL
to	NULL
compose	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
musing	NULL
,	NULL
pen	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
roamed	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
gay	NULL
city	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
some	NULL
new	NULL
ideas	NULL
and	NULL
refresh	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
somewhat	NULL
unsettled	NULL
state	NULL
that	NULL
winter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
sort	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
genius	NULL
simmering	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
let	NULL
it	NULL
simmer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
comes	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
secret	NULL
suspicion	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
genius	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
something	NULL
far	NULL
more	NULL
common	NULL
.	NULL

Whatever	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
simmered	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
purpose	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
discontented	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
desultory	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
long	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
real	NULL
and	NULL
earnest	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
at	NULL
,	NULL
soul	NULL
and	NULL
body	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finally	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
wise	NULL
conclusion	NULL
that	NULL
everyone	NULL
who	NULL
loved	NULL
music	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
composer	NULL
.	NULL

Returning	NULL
from	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Mozart	NULL
's	NULL
grand	NULL
operas	NULL
,	NULL
splendidly	NULL
performed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Royal	NULL
Theatre	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
played	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
parts	NULL
,	NULL
sat	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
busts	NULL
of	NULL
Mendelssohn	NULL
,	NULL
Beethoven	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Bach	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
stared	NULL
benignly	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
suddenly	NULL
he	NULL
tore	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
music	NULL
sheets	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
fluttered	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
soberly	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL

That	NULL

taken	NULL
the	NULL

out	NULL

"	NULL

That	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
question	NULL
to	NULL
answer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Laurie	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
wish	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
daily	NULL
bread	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
if	NULL
ever	NULL

occurred	NULL
an	NULL
eligible	NULL
opportunity	NULL
for	NULL
'	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
devil	NULL

,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
once	NULL
forcibly	NULL
expressed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
nothing	NULL

Satan	NULL
is	NULL
proverbially	NULL
fond	NULL

providing	NULL
employment	NULL

The	NULL
poor	NULL
fellow	NULL
had	NULL
temptations	NULL
enough	NULL
from	NULL
without	NULL

from	NULL
within	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
withstood	NULL
them	NULL
pretty	NULL
well	NULL

for	NULL
much	NULL

he	NULL
valued	NULL

his	NULL

a	NULL

Laurie	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
task	NULL
of	NULL
forgetting	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
Jo	NULL
would	NULL
absorb	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
powers	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
great	NULL
surprise	NULL
he	NULL
discovered	NULL
it	NULL
grew	NULL
easier	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
got	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
understand	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
these	NULL
hearts	NULL
of	NULL
ours	NULL
are	NULL
curious	NULL
and	NULL
contrary	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
nature	NULL
work	NULL
their	NULL
will	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
.	NULL

Laurie	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
ache	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wound	NULL
persisted	NULL
in	NULL
healing	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
rapidity	NULL
that	NULL
astonished	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
forget	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
foreseen	NULL
this	NULL
turn	NULL
of	NULL
affairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
disgusted	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
surprised	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
fickleness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
queer	NULL
mixture	NULL
of	NULL
disappointment	NULL
and	NULL
relief	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
recover	NULL
from	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
tremendous	NULL
blow	NULL
so	NULL
soon	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
carefully	NULL
stirred	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
embers	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
lost	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
blaze	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
comfortable	NULL
glow	NULL
that	NULL
warmed	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
him	NULL
good	NULL
without	NULL
putting	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
fever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
reluctantly	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
confess	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
boyish	NULL
passion	NULL
was	NULL
slowly	NULL
subsiding	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
tranquil	NULL
sentiment	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
tender	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
sad	NULL
and	NULL
resentful	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
away	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
a	NULL
brotherly	NULL
affection	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
last	NULL
unbroken	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
'	NULL
brotherly	NULL
'	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
reveries	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
smiled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
glanced	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
picture	NULL
of	NULL
Mozart	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
Well	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL

when	NULL
he	NULL

have	NULL
one	NULL
sister	NULL

took	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL

and	NULL
was	NULL
happy	NULL

Laurie	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
utter	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
instant	NULL
kissed	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
old	NULL
ring	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
No	NULL

then	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
Leaving	NULL
his	NULL
sentence	NULL
unfinished	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
seized	NULL
pen	NULL
and	NULL
paper	NULL
and	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
telling	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
settle	NULL
to	NULL
anything	NULL
while	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
changing	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL

Could	NULL
n't	NULL
she	NULL

would	NULL
n't	NULL
she	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
come	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
happy	NULL
?	NULL

While	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
answer	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
energetically	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fever	NULL
of	NULL
impatience	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
came	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
settled	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
effectually	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
point	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Jo	NULL
decidedly	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
wrapped	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
Beth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
love	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
begged	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
happy	NULL
with	NULL
somebody	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
always	NULL
keep	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
loving	NULL
sister	NULL
Jo	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
postscript	NULL
she	NULL
desired	NULL
him	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
Amy	NULL
that	NULL
Beth	NULL
was	NULL
worse	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
saddening	NULL
the	NULL
remainder	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
stay	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
time	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
please	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Laurie	NULL
must	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
often	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
feel	NULL
lonely	NULL
,	NULL
homesick	NULL
or	NULL
anxious	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
So	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

Poor	NULL
little	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
sad	NULL
going	NULL
home	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
afraid	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
Laurie	NULL
opened	NULL
his	NULL
desk	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
writing	NULL
to	NULL
Amy	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
proper	NULL
conclusion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sentence	NULL
left	NULL
unfinished	NULL
some	NULL
weeks	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
write	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
rummaged	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
best	NULL
paper	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
across	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
changed	NULL
his	NULL
purpose	NULL
.	NULL

Tumbling	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
desk	NULL
among	NULL
bills	NULL
,	NULL
passports	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
business	NULL
documents	NULL
of	NULL
various	NULL
kinds	NULL
were	NULL
several	NULL
of	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
letters	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
compartment	NULL
were	NULL
three	NULL
notes	NULL
from	NULL
Amy	NULL
,	NULL
carefully	NULL
tied	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
blue	NULL
ribbons	NULL
and	NULL
sweetly	NULL
suggestive	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
dead	NULL
roses	NULL
put	NULL
away	NULL
inside	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
half-repentant	NULL
,	NULL
half-amused	NULL
expression	NULL
,	NULL
Laurie	NULL
gathered	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
letters	NULL
,	NULL
smoothed	NULL
,	NULL
folded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
them	NULL
neatly	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
drawer	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
desk	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
turning	NULL
the	NULL
ring	NULL
thoughtfully	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
finger	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
slowly	NULL
drew	NULL
it	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
laid	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
letters	NULL
,	NULL
locked	NULL
the	NULL
drawer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
High	NULL
Mass	NULL
at	NULL
Saint	NULL
Stefan	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
funeral	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
not	NULL
overwhelmed	NULL
with	NULL
affliction	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
proper	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
than	NULL
in	NULL
writing	NULL
letters	NULL
to	NULL
charming	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
letter	NULL
went	NULL
very	NULL
soon	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
promptly	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Amy	NULL
was	NULL
homesick	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
confessed	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
delightfully	NULL
confiding	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
correspondence	NULL
flourished	NULL
famously	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
letters	NULL
flew	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
fro	NULL
with	NULL
unfailing	NULL
regularity	NULL
all	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
spring	NULL
.	NULL

Laurie	NULL
sold	NULL
his	NULL
busts	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
allumettes	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
opera	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
hoping	NULL
somebody	NULL
would	NULL
arrive	NULL
before	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
desperately	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Nice	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
asked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Amy	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
ask	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
having	NULL
little	NULL
experiences	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
rather	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
the	NULL
quizzical	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
'	NULL
our	NULL
boy	NULL
'	NULL
.	NULL

Fred	NULL
Vaughn	NULL
had	NULL
returned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
decided	NULL
to	NULL
answer	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
thank	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
thank	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
kindly	NULL
but	NULL
steadily	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
courage	NULL
failed	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
position	NULL
was	NULL
needed	NULL
to	NULL
satisfy	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
longing	NULL
that	NULL
filled	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
so	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
tender	NULL
hopes	NULL
and	NULL
fears	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Fred	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
I	NULL
fancied	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
ever	NULL
like	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
Laurie	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
uttered	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
kept	NULL
returning	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
pertinaciously	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
did	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
in	NULL
look	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
marry	NULL
for	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
troubled	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
wished	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
sounded	NULL
so	NULL
unwomanly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
Laurie	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
heartless	NULL
,	NULL
worldly	NULL
creature	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
care	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
queen	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
now	NULL
half	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
lovable	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
glad	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
hate	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
dreadful	NULL
things	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
took	NULL
them	NULL
so	NULL
beautifully	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
kinder	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
letters	NULL
were	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
comfort	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
home	NULL
letters	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
irregular	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
half	NULL
so	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
pleasure	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
answer	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
fellow	NULL
was	NULL
forlorn	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
needed	NULL
petting	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
Jo	NULL
persisted	NULL
in	NULL
being	NULL
stonyhearted	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
hard	NULL
,	NULL
many	NULL
people	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
proud	NULL
and	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
dear	NULL
boy	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Jo	NULL
never	NULL
would	NULL
act	NULL
like	NULL
other	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
but	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
kind	NULL
and	NULL
treat	NULL
him	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
brother	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
all	NULL
brothers	NULL
were	NULL
treated	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
Laurie	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
period	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
happier	NULL
race	NULL
of	NULL
beings	NULL
than	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
never	NULL
lectured	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
asked	NULL
his	NULL
opinion	NULL
on	NULL
all	NULL
subjects	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
everything	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
charming	NULL
little	NULL
presents	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sent	NULL
him	NULL
two	NULL
letters	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
lively	NULL
gossip	NULL
,	NULL
sisterly	NULL
confidences	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
captivating	NULL
sketches	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lovely	NULL
scenes	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
few	NULL
brothers	NULL
are	NULL
complimented	NULL
by	NULL
having	NULL
their	NULL
letters	NULL
carried	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
pockets	NULL
,	NULL
read	NULL
and	NULL
reread	NULL
diligently	NULL
,	NULL
cried	NULL
over	NULL
when	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
kissed	NULL
when	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
treasured	NULL
carefully	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
hint	NULL
that	NULL
Amy	NULL
did	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
fond	NULL
and	NULL
foolish	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
certainly	NULL
did	NULL
grow	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
pale	NULL
and	NULL
pensive	NULL
that	NULL
spring	NULL
,	NULL
lost	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
relish	NULL
for	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
sketching	NULL
alone	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
was	NULL
studying	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
dare	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
for	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
folded	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
terrace	NULL
at	NULL
Valrosa	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
absently	NULL
sketched	NULL
any	NULL
fancy	NULL
that	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
stalwart	NULL
knight	NULL
carved	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
tomb	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
asleep	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
curly	NULL
haired	NULL
girl	NULL
in	NULL
gorgeous	NULL
array	NULL
,	NULL
promenading	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
ballroom	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
arm	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
gentleman	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
faces	NULL
being	NULL
left	NULL
a	NULL
blur	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
fashion	NULL
in	NULL
art	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
safe	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
altogether	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
aunt	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
regretted	NULL
her	NULL
answer	NULL
to	NULL
Fred	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finding	NULL
denials	NULL
useless	NULL
and	NULL
explanations	NULL
impossible	NULL
,	NULL
Amy	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
taking	NULL
care	NULL
that	NULL
Laurie	NULL
should	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
Fred	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
Egypt	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
understood	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
relieved	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
venerable	NULL
air	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
think	NULL
better	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Poor	NULL
old	NULL
fellow	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
've	NULL
been	NULL
through	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
sympathize	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

With	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
heaved	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
sigh	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
discharged	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
up	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
and	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
Amy	NULL
's	NULL
letter	NULL
luxuriously	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
these	NULL
changes	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
abroad	NULL
,	NULL
trouble	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
telling	NULL
that	NULL
Beth	NULL
was	NULL
failing	NULL
never	NULL
reached	NULL
Amy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
Vevay	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
heat	NULL
had	NULL
driven	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
Nice	NULL
in	NULL
May	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
travelled	NULL
slowly	NULL
to	NULL
Switzerland	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
Genoa	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Italian	NULL
lakes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
bore	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
quietly	NULL
submitted	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
decree	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
shorten	NULL
her	NULL
visit	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
since	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
goodbye	NULL
to	NULL
Beth	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
stay	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
absence	NULL
soften	NULL
her	NULL
sorrow	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
heavy	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
longed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
looked	NULL
wistfully	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
lake	NULL
,	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
Laurie	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
comfort	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
come	NULL
very	NULL
soon	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
mail	NULL
brought	NULL
letters	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
both	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
Germany	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
some	NULL
days	NULL
to	NULL
reach	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
packed	NULL
his	NULL
knapsack	NULL
,	NULL
bade	NULL
adieu	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
fellow	NULL
pedestrians	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
his	NULL
promise	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
heart	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
joy	NULL
and	NULL
sorrow	NULL
,	NULL
hope	NULL
and	NULL
suspense	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
Vevay	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
boat	NULL
touched	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
quay	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
hurried	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
shore	NULL
to	NULL
La	NULL
Tour	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
Carrols	NULL
were	NULL
living	NULL
en	NULL
pension	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
garcon	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
despair	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
family	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
promenade	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
lake	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
blonde	NULL
mademoiselle	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
chateau	NULL
garden	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
monsieur	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
himself	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
of	NULL
sitting	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
flash	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
should	NULL
present	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
monsieur	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
wait	NULL
even	NULL
a	NULL
'	NULL
flash	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
speech	NULL
departed	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
mademoiselle	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
pleasant	NULL
old	NULL
garden	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
borders	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lovely	NULL
lake	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
chestnuts	NULL
rustling	NULL
overhead	NULL
,	NULL
ivy	NULL
climbing	NULL
everywhere	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tower	NULL
falling	NULL
far	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
sunny	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
one	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wide	NULL
,	NULL
low	NULL
wall	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
seat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
Amy	NULL
often	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
or	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
console	NULL
herself	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
here	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
leaning	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
homesick	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
heavy	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
Beth	NULL
and	NULL
wondering	NULL
why	NULL
Laurie	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
hear	NULL
him	NULL
cross	NULL
the	NULL
courtyard	NULL
beyond	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
pause	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
archway	NULL
that	NULL
led	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
subterranean	NULL
path	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
new	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
what	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
seen	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
tender	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
Amy	NULL
's	NULL
character	NULL
.	NULL

Everything	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
mutely	NULL
suggested	NULL
love	NULL
and	NULL
sorrow	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
blotted	NULL
letters	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
lap	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
ribbon	NULL
that	NULL
tied	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
womanly	NULL
pain	NULL
and	NULL
patience	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
ebony	NULL
cross	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
throat	NULL
seemed	NULL
pathetic	NULL
to	NULL
Laurie	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
wore	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
only	NULL
ornament	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
doubts	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
reception	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
set	NULL
at	NULL
rest	NULL
the	NULL
minute	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
dropping	NULL
everything	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
ran	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
exclaiming	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
tone	NULL
of	NULL
unmistakable	NULL
love	NULL
and	NULL
longing	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
Laurie	NULL
,	NULL
Laurie	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
you	NULL
'd	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
everything	NULL
was	NULL
said	NULL
and	NULL
settled	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
stood	NULL
together	NULL
quite	NULL
silent	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
head	NULL
bent	NULL
down	NULL
protectingly	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
Amy	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
comfort	NULL
and	NULL
sustain	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
Laurie	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Laurie	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
Amy	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
fill	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
place	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
disappointed	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
both	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
satisfied	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gladly	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
to	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
Amy	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
dried	NULL
her	NULL
tears	NULL
,	NULL
Laurie	NULL
gathered	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
scattered	NULL
papers	NULL
,	NULL
finding	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
sundry	NULL
well-worn	NULL
letters	NULL
and	NULL
suggestive	NULL
sketches	NULL
good	NULL
omens	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
Amy	NULL
felt	NULL
shy	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
rosy	NULL
red	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
recollection	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
impulsive	NULL
greeting	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
so	NULL
lonely	NULL
and	NULL
sad	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
surprise	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
find	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
fear	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
n't	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
trying	NULL
in	NULL
vain	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
quite	NULL
naturally	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
minute	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
wish	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
say	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
comfort	NULL
you	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
dear	NULL
little	NULL
Beth	NULL

but	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
only	NULL
feel	NULL

and	NULL
...	NULL
"	NULL
He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
any	NULL
further	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
too	NULL
turned	NULL
bashful	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
longed	NULL
to	NULL
lay	NULL
Amy	NULL
's	NULL
head	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
shoulder	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
cry	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
dare	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
instead	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
sympathetic	NULL
squeeze	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
need	NULL
n't	NULL
say	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
comforts	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
softly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Beth	NULL
is	NULL
well	NULL
and	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
n't	NULL
wish	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
dread	NULL
the	NULL
going	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
I	NULL
long	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL

We	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
makes	NULL
me	NULL
cry	NULL

I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
enjoy	NULL
you	NULL
while	NULL
you	NULL
stay	NULL

You	NULL
need	NULL
n't	NULL
go	NULL
right	NULL
back	NULL

need	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
want	NULL
me	NULL

dear	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

Aunt	NULL
and	NULL
Flo	NULL
are	NULL
very	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
you	NULL
seem	NULL
like	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL

it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
comfortable	NULL

have	NULL
you	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL

"	NULL

Amy	NULL
spoke	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
so	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
homesick	NULL
child	NULL
whose	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
that	NULL
Laurie	NULL
forgot	NULL
his	NULL
bashfulness	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
just	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
petting	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
cheerful	NULL
conversation	NULL
she	NULL
needed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Poor	NULL

you	NULL
look	NULL

walk	NULL
about	NULL
with	NULL

the	NULL
wind	NULL
is	NULL
too	NULL
chilly	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
still	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
half-caressing	NULL
,	NULL
half-commanding	NULL
way	NULL
that	NULL
Amy	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
tied	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
drew	NULL
her	NULL
arm	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
pace	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
sunny	NULL
walk	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
new-leaved	NULL
chestnuts	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
more	NULL
at	NULL
ease	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
legs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Amy	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
arm	NULL
to	NULL
lean	NULL
upon	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
familiar	NULL
face	NULL
to	NULL
smile	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
voice	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
delightfully	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
quaint	NULL
old	NULL
garden	NULL
had	NULL
sheltered	NULL
many	NULL
pairs	NULL
of	NULL
lovers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seemed	NULL
expressly	NULL
made	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
sunny	NULL
and	NULL
secluded	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
tower	NULL
to	NULL
overlook	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
wide	NULL
lake	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
echo	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
rippled	NULL
by	NULL
below	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
this	NULL
new	NULL
pair	NULL
walked	NULL
and	NULL
talked	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
rested	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
,	NULL
enjoying	NULL
the	NULL
sweet	NULL
influences	NULL
which	NULL
gave	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
charm	NULL
to	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
an	NULL
unromantic	NULL
dinner	NULL
bell	NULL
warned	NULL
them	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
Amy	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
burden	NULL
of	NULL
loneliness	NULL
and	NULL
sorrow	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
chateau	NULL
garden	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
moment	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Carrol	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
altered	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
illuminated	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
idea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Now	NULL
I	NULL
understand	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL

the	NULL
child	NULL

Bless	NULL
my	NULL
heart	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

With	NULL
praiseworthy	NULL
discretion	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
lady	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
betrayed	NULL
no	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
enlightenment	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
cordially	NULL
urged	NULL
Laurie	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
and	NULL
begged	NULL
Amy	NULL
to	NULL
enjoy	NULL
his	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
her	NULL
more	NULL
good	NULL
than	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
solitude	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
model	NULL
of	NULL
docility	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL
Flo	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
entertain	NULL
her	NULL
friend	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
her	NULL
usual	NULL
success	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
Nice	NULL
,	NULL
Laurie	NULL
had	NULL
lounged	NULL
and	NULL
Amy	NULL
had	NULL
scolded	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
Vevay	NULL
,	NULL
Laurie	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
idle	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
always	NULL
walking	NULL
,	NULL
riding	NULL
,	NULL
boating	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
studying	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
energetic	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Amy	NULL
admired	NULL
everything	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
and	NULL
followed	NULL
his	NULL
example	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
fast	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
was	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
climate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
contradict	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
glad	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
like	NULL
excuse	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
recovered	NULL
health	NULL
and	NULL
spirits	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
invigorating	NULL
air	NULL
did	NULL
them	NULL
both	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
much	NULL
exercise	NULL
worked	NULL
wholesome	NULL
changes	NULL
in	NULL
minds	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
bodies	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
clearer	NULL
views	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
duty	NULL
up	NULL
there	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
everlasting	NULL
hills	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fresh	NULL
winds	NULL
blew	NULL
away	NULL
desponding	NULL
doubts	NULL
,	NULL
delusive	NULL
fancies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
moody	NULL
mists	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
warm	NULL
spring	NULL
sunshine	NULL
brought	NULL
out	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
aspiring	NULL
ideas	NULL
,	NULL
tender	NULL
hopes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
happy	NULL
thoughts	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lake	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
wash	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
troubles	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
grand	NULL
old	NULL
mountains	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
benignly	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
saying	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Little	NULL
children	NULL

love	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL

"	NULL

In	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
sorrow	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
happy	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
happy	NULL
that	NULL
Laurie	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
disturb	NULL
it	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
to	NULL
recover	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
surprise	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
cure	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
firmly	NULL
believed	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
consoled	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
seeming	NULL
disloyalty	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
sister	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
as	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
self	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
woman	NULL
but	NULL
Amy	NULL
so	NULL
soon	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
first	NULL
wooing	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tempestuous	NULL
order	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
back	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
vista	NULL
of	NULL
years	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
compassion	NULL
blended	NULL
with	NULL
regret	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
away	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bitter-sweet	NULL
experiences	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
grateful	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
second	NULL
wooing	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
resolved	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
calm	NULL
and	NULL
simple	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
scene	NULL
,	NULL
hardly	NULL
any	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
telling	NULL
Amy	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
without	NULL
words	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
answer	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
all	NULL
came	NULL
about	NULL
so	NULL
naturally	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
complain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
everybody	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
pleased	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
Jo	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
our	NULL
first	NULL
little	NULL
passion	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
crushed	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
wary	NULL
and	NULL
slow	NULL
in	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
trial	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
Laurie	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
pass	NULL
,	NULL
enjoying	NULL
every	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
leaving	NULL
to	NULL
chance	NULL
the	NULL
utterance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
put	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
and	NULL
sweetest	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
new	NULL
romance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
rather	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
denoument	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
chateau	NULL
garden	NULL
by	NULL
moonlight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
graceful	NULL
and	NULL
decorous	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
exactly	NULL
the	NULL
reverse	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
was	NULL
settled	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
lake	NULL
at	NULL
noonday	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
blunt	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
floating	NULL
about	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL

from	NULL
gloomy	NULL

dabbling	NULL
her	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

during	NULL
the	NULL

that	NULL

leaning	NULL

with	NULL
an	NULL

returned	NULL
Laurie	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
rather	NULL
liked	NULL
the	NULL
arrangement	NULL

Feeling	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
mended	NULL
matters	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
Amy	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
offered	NULL
third	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
seat	NULL

shook	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL

accepted	NULL
an	NULL

She	NULL
rowed	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL

she	NULL
did	NULL
many	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL

though	NULL
she	NULL
used	NULL
both	NULL

Laurie	NULL

one	NULL

the	NULL

kept	NULL
time	NULL

the	NULL
boat	NULL
went	NULL
smoothly	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL

said	NULL
Amy	NULL

who	NULL
objected	NULL

silence	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL

"	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
both	NULL
stopped	NULL
rowing	NULL

unconsciously	NULL
added	NULL
a	NULL

CHAPTER	NULL
FORTY-TWO	NULL
ALL	NULL
ALONE	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
promise	NULL
self-abnegation	NULL
when	NULL
self	NULL
was	NULL
wrapped	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
soul	NULL
were	NULL
purified	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
sweet	NULL
example	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
helpful	NULL
voice	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
daily	NULL
lesson	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
beloved	NULL
presence	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
nothing	NULL
remained	NULL
but	NULL
loneliness	NULL
and	NULL
grief	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
Jo	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
promise	NULL
very	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
'	NULL
comfort	NULL
Father	NULL
and	NULL
Mother	NULL
'	NULL
when	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
heart	NULL
ached	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
ceaseless	NULL
longing	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
'	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
cheerful	NULL
'	NULL
when	NULL
all	NULL
its	NULL
light	NULL
and	NULL
warmth	NULL
and	NULL
beauty	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
deserted	NULL
it	NULL
when	NULL
Beth	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
home	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
where	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
'	NULL
find	NULL
some	NULL
useful	NULL
,	NULL
happy	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
loving	NULL
service	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
reward	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
tried	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
blind	NULL
,	NULL
hopeless	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
secretly	NULL
rebelling	NULL
against	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
unjust	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
few	NULL
joys	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
lessened	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
burdens	NULL
made	NULL
heavier	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
life	NULL
get	NULL
harder	NULL
and	NULL
harder	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
toiled	NULL
along	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
people	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
all	NULL
sunshine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
all	NULL
shadow	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
fair	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
tried	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
Amy	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
never	NULL
got	NULL
any	NULL
reward	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
disappointment	NULL
,	NULL
trouble	NULL
and	NULL
hard	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

Poor	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
these	NULL
were	NULL
dark	NULL
days	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
despair	NULL
came	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
spending	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
quiet	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
devoted	NULL
to	NULL
humdrum	NULL
cares	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
small	NULL
pleasures	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
duty	NULL
that	NULL
never	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
any	NULL
easier	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
meant	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
life	NULL
like	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
break	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
do	NULL
something	NULL
desperate	NULL
if	NULL
somebody	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
help	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
efforts	NULL
failed	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
moody	NULL
,	NULL
miserable	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
which	NULL
often	NULL
comes	NULL
when	NULL
strong	NULL
wills	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
yield	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
inevitable	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
someone	NULL
did	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
help	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
Jo	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
recognize	NULL
her	NULL
good	NULL
angels	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
wore	NULL
familiar	NULL
shapes	NULL
and	NULL
used	NULL
the	NULL
simple	NULL
spells	NULL
best	NULL
fitted	NULL
to	NULL
poor	NULL
humanity	NULL
.	NULL

Often	NULL
she	NULL
started	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
Beth	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
empty	NULL
bed	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
cry	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
bitter	NULL
cry	NULL
of	NULL
unsubmissive	NULL
sorrow	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
Beth	NULL
,	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
!	NULL

Come	NULL
back	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
stretch	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
yearning	NULL
arms	NULL
in	NULL
vain	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
quick	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
her	NULL
sobbing	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
faintest	NULL
whisper	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
comfort	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
with	NULL
words	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
patient	NULL
tenderness	NULL
that	NULL
soothes	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL
,	NULL
tears	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
mute	NULL
reminders	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
greater	NULL
grief	NULL
than	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
broken	NULL
whispers	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
eloquent	NULL
than	NULL
prayers	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
hopeful	NULL
resignation	NULL
went	NULL
hand-in-hand	NULL
with	NULL
natural	NULL
sorrow	NULL
.	NULL

Sacred	NULL
moments	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
heart	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
heart	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
affliction	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
blessing	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
chastened	NULL
grief	NULL
and	NULL
strengthened	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

Feeling	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
burden	NULL
seemed	NULL
easier	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
,	NULL
duty	NULL
grew	NULL
sweeter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
life	NULL
looked	NULL
more	NULL
endurable	NULL
,	NULL
seen	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
safe	NULL
shelter	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
aching	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
comforted	NULL
,	NULL
troubled	NULL
mind	NULL
likewise	NULL
found	NULL
help	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
study	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
leaning	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
gray	NULL
head	NULL
lifted	NULL
to	NULL
welcome	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
tranquil	NULL
smile	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
very	NULL
humbly	NULL

both	NULL

needed	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
Beth	NULL
's	NULL
little	NULL
chair	NULL
close	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL

Jo	NULL
told	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
entire	NULL
confidence	NULL

he	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
help	NULL
she	NULL
needed	NULL

both	NULL

For	NULL

FORTY-THREE	NULL

there	NULL

red	NULL
pillow	NULL

planning	NULL

never	NULL

Her	NULL
face	NULL
looked	NULL

grave	NULL

rather	NULL
sad	NULL

for	NULL
tomorrow	NULL
was	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL

seemed	NULL

accomplished	NULL

Almost	NULL
twenty-five	NULL

and	NULL
nothing	NULL

show	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL

Jo	NULL
was	NULL

...	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
Jo	NULL
sighed	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
inviting	NULL

It	NULL
seldom	NULL
is	NULL

at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thirty	NULL
seems	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL

five-and-twenty	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
bad	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
looks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
can	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
quite	NULL
happily	NULL

one	NULL
has	NULL
something	NULL

's	NULL
self	NULL

fall	NULL
back	NULL

At	NULL
twenty-five	NULL
,	NULL
girls	NULL
begin	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
being	NULL
old	NULL
maids	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
secretly	NULL
resolve	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
never	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
thirty	NULL
they	NULL
say	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
quietly	NULL
accept	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
sensible	NULL

console	NULL
themselves	NULL
by	NULL
remembering	NULL
that	NULL

twenty	NULL
more	NULL
useful	NULL

in	NULL

they	NULL
may	NULL

gracefully	NULL

Do	NULL
n't	NULL

spinsters	NULL

often	NULL

beat	NULL

quietly	NULL
under	NULL

Even	NULL
the	NULL

As	NULL
I	NULL
told	NULL
you	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
letter	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
wrote	NULL
that	NULL
Amy	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
shall	NULL
stop	NULL
loving	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
love	NULL
is	NULL
altered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
learned	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
better	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
.	NULL

Amy	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
changed	NULL
places	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
about	NULL
naturally	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
waited	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
patient	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
heartache	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
headstrong	NULL
and	NULL
violent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
lesson	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
me	NULL
my	NULL
mistake	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
of	NULL
myself	NULL
.	NULL

Upon	NULL
my	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
tumbled	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
loved	NULL
best	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
or	NULL
Amy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
you	NULL
both	NULL
alike	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
Switzerland	NULL
,	NULL
everything	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
clear	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
both	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
your	NULL
right	NULL
places	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
off	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
love	NULL
before	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
honestly	NULL
share	NULL
my	NULL
heart	NULL
between	NULL
sister	NULL
Jo	NULL

wife	NULL
Amy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
love	NULL
them	NULL
dearly	NULL

Will	NULL
you	NULL
believe	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
happy	NULL
old	NULL
times	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
first	NULL
knew	NULL
one	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL

Teddy	NULL

never	NULL

The	NULL

ca	NULL
n't	NULL

back	NULL

we	NULL
must	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL

I	NULL

you	NULL

you	NULL

I	NULL

I	NULL
shall	NULL
love	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL

admire	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
means	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
hoped	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL

any	NULL

we	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL

did	NULL

took	NULL
the	NULL

Amy	NULL

the	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
flourish	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
the	NULL
stranger	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
doubts	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
reception	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
set	NULL
at	NULL
rest	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
cordial	NULL
welcome	NULL
he	NULL
received	NULL
.	NULL

Everyone	NULL
greeted	NULL
him	NULL
kindly	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
very	NULL
soon	NULL
they	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
carried	NULL
the	NULL
talisman	NULL
that	NULL
opens	NULL
all	NULL
hearts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
these	NULL
simple	NULL
people	NULL
warmed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
friendly	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
poor	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
poverty	NULL
enriches	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
live	NULL
above	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
sure	NULL
passport	NULL
to	NULL
truly	NULL
hospitable	NULL
spirits	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
sat	NULL
looking	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
traveler	NULL
who	NULL
knocks	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
opens	NULL
,	NULL
finds	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
children	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
like	NULL
bees	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
honeypot	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
establishing	NULL
themselves	NULL
on	NULL
each	NULL
knee	NULL
,	NULL
proceeded	NULL
to	NULL
captivate	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
rifling	NULL
his	NULL
pockets	NULL
,	NULL
pulling	NULL
his	NULL
beard	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
investigating	NULL
his	NULL
watch	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
juvenile	NULL
audacity	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
women	NULL
telegraphed	NULL
their	NULL
approval	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
March	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
kindred	NULL
spirit	NULL
,	NULL
opened	NULL
his	NULL
choicest	NULL
stores	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
guest	NULL
's	NULL
benefit	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
silent	NULL
John	NULL
listened	NULL
and	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
the	NULL
talk	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
said	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Laurence	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Jo	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
otherwise	NULL
engaged	NULL
,	NULL
Laurie	NULL
's	NULL
behavior	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
amused	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL
twinge	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
jealousy	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
suspicion	NULL
,	NULL
caused	NULL
that	NULL
gentleman	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
aloof	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
observe	NULL
the	NULL
newcomer	NULL
with	NULL
brotherly	NULL
circumspection	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
last	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
got	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
drawn	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
circle	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
talked	NULL
well	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
genial	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
himself	NULL
justice	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seldom	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
Laurie	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
often	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
shadow	NULL
would	NULL
pass	NULL
across	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
regretting	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
lost	NULL
youth	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
watched	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
prime	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
would	NULL
turn	NULL
to	NULL
Jo	NULL
so	NULL
wistfully	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
surely	NULL
answered	NULL
the	NULL
mute	NULL
inquiry	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Jo	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
eyes	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
care	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
trusted	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
prudently	NULL
kept	NULL
them	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
sock	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
knitting	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
model	NULL
maiden	NULL
aunt	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
stealthy	NULL
glance	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
refreshed	NULL
her	NULL
like	NULL
sips	NULL
of	NULL
fresh	NULL
water	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
dusty	NULL
walk	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sidelong	NULL
peeps	NULL
showed	NULL
her	NULL
several	NULL
propitious	NULL
omens	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
the	NULL
absent-minded	NULL
expression	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
all	NULL
alive	NULL
with	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
actually	NULL
young	NULL
and	NULL
handsome	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
forgetting	NULL
to	NULL
compare	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
Laurie	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
usually	NULL
did	NULL
strange	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
great	NULL
detriment	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
quite	NULL
inspired	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
burial	NULL
customs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ancients	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
had	NULL
strayed	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
considered	NULL
an	NULL
exhilarating	NULL
topic	NULL
.	NULL

Jo	NULL
quite	NULL
glowed	NULL
with	NULL
triumph	NULL
when	NULL
Teddy	NULL
got	NULL
quenched	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
argument	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
watched	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
absorbed	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
How	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
enjoy	NULL
having	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
as	NULL
my	NULL
Professor	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
with	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

Lastly	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
was	NULL
dressed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
suit	NULL
of	NULL
black	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
look	NULL
more	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
bushy	NULL
hair	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
cut	NULL
and	NULL
smoothly	NULL
brushed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
stay	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
in	NULL
exciting	NULL
moments	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
rumpled	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
droll	NULL
way	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Jo	NULL
liked	NULL
it	NULL
rampantly	NULL
erect	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
flat	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
his	NULL
fine	NULL
forehead	NULL
a	NULL
Jove-like	NULL
aspect	NULL
.	NULL

Poor	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
glorify	NULL
that	NULL
plain	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
knitting	NULL
away	NULL
so	NULL
quietly	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
letting	NULL
nothing	NULL
escape	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
actually	NULL
had	NULL
gold	NULL
sleeve-buttons	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
immaculate	NULL
wristbands	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Dear	NULL
old	NULL
fellow	NULL
!	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
n't	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
himself	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
care	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
'd	NULL
been	NULL
going	NULL
a-wooing	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Jo	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
thought	NULL
born	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
blush	NULL
so	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
drop	NULL
her	NULL
ball	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
after	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
maneuver	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
succeed	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
though	NULL
just	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
act	NULL
of	NULL
setting	NULL
fire	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
funeral	NULL
pyre	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Professor	NULL
dropped	NULL
his	NULL
torch	NULL
,	NULL
metaphorically	NULL
speaking	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
dive	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
blue	NULL
ball	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
they	NULL
bumped	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
smartly	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
saw	NULL
stars	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
both	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
flushed	NULL
and	NULL
laughing	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
ball	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
resume	NULL
their	NULL
seats	NULL
,	NULL
wishing	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
left	NULL
them	NULL

Nobody	NULL
knew	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Hannah	NULL
skillfully	NULL
abstracted	NULL
the	NULL
babies	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
early	NULL
hour	NULL

nodding	NULL
like	NULL
two	NULL
rosy	NULL
poppies	NULL

and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Laurence	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL
to	NULL
rest	NULL

The	NULL

sat	NULL
round	NULL

talking	NULL

utterly	NULL
regardless	NULL
of	NULL

Meg	NULL

out	NULL

Demi	NULL
set	NULL

studying	NULL
the	NULL

said	NULL
Jo	NULL

feeling	NULL
that	NULL

were	NULL

But	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
thoughtless	NULL

for	NULL
Beth	NULL
still	NULL

Laurie	NULL

with	NULL
pardonable	NULL
pride	NULL

Amy	NULL
whispered	NULL

she	NULL
did	NULL
show	NULL
something	NULL
better	NULL

brilliancy	NULL

skill	NULL

for	NULL
she	NULL
sang	NULL

no	NULL

with	NULL

Jo	NULL

Mr.	NULL

could	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL

flattered	NULL
himself	NULL

knew	NULL

pretty	NULL
well	NULL

was	NULL

therefore	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
amazed	NULL

manner	NULL

which	NULL
she	NULL
showed	NULL
him	NULL

half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL

moods	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL

half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
met	NULL
him	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
surprised	NULL

though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
offered	NULL
her	NULL
his	NULL

she	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
that	NULL
filled	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
delight	NULL

but	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
missed	NULL
him	NULL

she	NULL
gave	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
chilly	NULL

formal	NULL
reply	NULL

despair	NULL

him	NULL

learning	NULL

almost	NULL
clapped	NULL

all	NULL
for	NULL

Then	NULL
on	NULL
hearing	NULL
his	NULL
destination	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
tone	NULL
of	NULL
despair	NULL
that	NULL
lifted	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL

a	NULL
pinnacle	NULL
of	NULL

but	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
minute	NULL
she	NULL
tumbled	NULL
him	NULL
down	NULL
again	NULL

Jo	NULL
rather	NULL
prided	NULL
herself	NULL

owing	NULL

was	NULL
in	NULL

everything	NULL

covered	NULL
herself	NULL
with	NULL
confusion	NULL

asking	NULL

lavender	NULL

the	NULL

Mr.	NULL

stood	NULL

blunder	NULL

Jo	NULL
frowned	NULL

asked	NULL
why	NULL

did	NULL

Mr.	NULL

the	NULL

himself	NULL

Jo	NULL
's	NULL

was	NULL
more	NULL
pathetic	NULL

she	NULL

For	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL

seemed	NULL
to	NULL

gone	NULL
in	NULL
as	NULL
suddenly	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL

the	NULL

grew	NULL
muddy	NULL

again	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL

her	NULL

that	NULL
her	NULL

colder	NULL

fuller	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
away	NULL

he	NULL
only	NULL

for	NULL
her	NULL

it	NULL

all	NULL
a	NULL

the	NULL

over	NULL
the	NULL

With	NULL
this	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL

she	NULL
hailed	NULL
an	NULL

gesture	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

flew	NULL
out	NULL

were	NULL
badly	NULL

Jo	NULL

winking	NULL
hard	NULL

because	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
died	NULL
rather	NULL

her	NULL

Mr.	NULL

the	NULL
drops	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL

though	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL

him	NULL
very	NULL

for	NULL
suddenly	NULL
stooping	NULL
down	NULL

said	NULL
Jo	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
satisfied	NULL

for	NULL
she	NULL
folded	NULL
both	NULL
hands	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL

looked	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL

showed	NULL
how	NULL
happy	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
through	NULL
life	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL

even	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
better	NULL
shelter	NULL

the	NULL
old	NULL
umbrella	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
carried	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
proposing	NULL
under	NULL
difficulties	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
desired	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mud	NULL

Neither	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
offer	NULL
Jo	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL

except	NULL
figuratively	NULL

for	NULL
both	NULL
were	NULL
full	NULL

Much	NULL
less	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
indulge	NULL
in	NULL
tender	NULL
remonstrations	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
street	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
near	NULL
it	NULL

So	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
express	NULL
his	NULL
rapture	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
expression	NULL
which	NULL
glorified	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
degree	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
actually	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
little	NULL
rainbows	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
drops	NULL
that	NULL
sparkled	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
beard	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
loved	NULL
Jo	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
lovely	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
skirts	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
deplorable	NULL
state	NULL

her	NULL
rubber	NULL
boots	NULL
splashed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ankle	NULL

and	NULL
her	NULL
bonnet	NULL
a	NULL
ruin	NULL

Fortunately	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bhaer	NULL
considered	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
beautiful	NULL
woman	NULL
living	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
"	NULL
Jove-like	NULL
"	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
his	NULL
hatbrim	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
limp	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
rills	NULL
trickling	NULL
thence	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
(	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
the	NULL
umbrella	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
Jo	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
finger	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
gloves	NULL
needed	NULL
mending	NULL

Passers-by	NULL
probably	NULL
thought	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
harmless	NULL
lunatics	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
entirely	NULL
forgot	NULL
to	NULL
hail	NULL
a	NULL
bus	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
strolled	NULL
leisurely	NULL
along	NULL
,	NULL
oblivious	NULL
of	NULL
deepening	NULL
dusk	NULL
and	NULL
fog	NULL
.	NULL

Little	NULL
they	NULL
cared	NULL
what	NULL
anybody	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
enjoying	NULL
the	NULL
happy	NULL
hour	NULL
that	NULL
seldom	NULL
comes	NULL

once	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
life	NULL

the	NULL
magical	NULL
moment	NULL
which	NULL
bestows	NULL
youth	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL

beauty	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
plain	NULL

wealth	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gives	NULL
human	NULL
hearts	NULL
a	NULL
foretaste	NULL
of	NULL
heaven	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Professor	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
conquered	NULL
a	NULL
kingdom	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
bliss	NULL

While	NULL
Jo	NULL
trudged	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL

had	NULL
always	NULL

wondering	NULL
how	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
astonishing	NULL
year	NULL
altogether	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
things	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
happen	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
unusually	NULL

manner	NULL

Almost	NULL
before	NULL

knew	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
married	NULL
and	NULL
settled	NULL
at	NULL
Plumfield	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
of	NULL
six	NULL
or	NULL
seven	NULL
boys	NULL
sprung	NULL
up	NULL
like	NULL
mushrooms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
flourished	NULL
surprisingly	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
boys	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
rich	NULL

for	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Laurence	NULL

continually	NULL
finding	NULL
some	NULL

begging	NULL
the	NULL
Bhaers	NULL

take	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
gladly	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sly	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
got	NULL
round	NULL
proud	NULL
Jo	NULL
,	NULL

furnished	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
style	NULL
of	NULL
boy	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
most	NULL
delighted	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
uphill	NULL
work	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL

and	NULL
Jo	NULL
made	NULL
queer	NULL
mistakes	NULL

but	NULL
the	NULL
wise	NULL
Professor	NULL
steered	NULL
her	NULL
safely	NULL
into	NULL
calmer	NULL
waters	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
rampant	NULL
ragamuffin	NULL
was	NULL
conquered	NULL
in	NULL

How	NULL
Jo	NULL
did	NULL
enjoy	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
how	NULL
poor	NULL

dear	NULL
Aunt	NULL
March	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
lamented	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
been	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
sacred	NULL

prim	NULL
,	NULL
well-ordered	NULL
Plumfield	NULL
overrun	NULL
with	NULL
Toms	NULL
,	NULL
Dicks	NULL
,	NULL

Harrys	NULL
!	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
poetic	NULL
justice	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
terror	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
for	NULL
miles	NULL
around	NULL

and	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL
exiles	NULL
feasted	NULL
freely	NULL
on	NULL
forbidden	NULL
plums	NULL
,	NULL
kicked	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
gravel	NULL
with	NULL
profane	NULL
boots	NULL
unreproved	NULL

and	NULL
played	NULL
cricket	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
field	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
irritable	NULL
'	NULL
cow	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
crumpled	NULL
horn	NULL
'	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
invite	NULL
rash	NULL
youths	NULL

come	NULL

be	NULL
tossed	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
boys	NULL
'	NULL
paradise	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Laurie	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
Bhaer-garten	NULL

,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
compliment	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
master	NULL

appropriate	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
inhabitants	NULL

It	NULL
never	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fashionable	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Professor	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
lay	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
fortune	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
what	NULL
Jo	NULL
intended	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL

'	NULL
a	NULL
happy	NULL

kindness	NULL

Every	NULL
room	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
house	NULL
was	NULL
soon	NULL
full	NULL

Every	NULL
little	NULL
plot	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
soon	NULL
had	NULL
its	NULL
owner	NULL

appeared	NULL
in	NULL

And	NULL
three	NULL
times	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
smiled	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
Fritz	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
table	NULL
lined	NULL
on	NULL
either	NULL

with	NULL
rows	NULL
of	NULL
happy	NULL

which	NULL
all	NULL
turned	NULL

had	NULL

enough	NULL
now	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL
tire	NULL

them	NULL

were	NULL
not	NULL
angels	NULL

by	NULL
any	NULL

caused	NULL
both	NULL

much	NULL
trouble	NULL

her	NULL
faith	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

heart	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
naughtiest	NULL

most	NULL
tantalizing	NULL

in	NULL
time	NULL
success	NULL

out	NULL
long	NULL
with	NULL

Very	NULL
precious	NULL
to	NULL
Jo	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
friendship	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lads	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
penitent	NULL
sniffs	NULL
and	NULL
whispers	NULL
after	NULL
wrongdoing	NULL

their	NULL
droll	NULL

even	NULL
their	NULL
misfortunes	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL

only	NULL
endeared	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
slow	NULL
boys	NULL
and	NULL
bashful	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
feeble	NULL
boys	NULL
and	NULL
riotous	NULL
boys	NULL
,	NULL
boys	NULL
that	NULL
lisped	NULL

boys	NULL
that	NULL
stuttered	NULL

one	NULL

a	NULL

who	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL

elsewhere	NULL

but	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
welcome	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
'	NULL
Bhaer-garten	NULL
'	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
some	NULL
people	NULL
predicted	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
admission	NULL
would	NULL
ruin	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
Jo	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
happy	NULL
woman	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
hard	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
anxiety	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
perpetual	NULL
racket	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
it	NULL
heartily	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
applause	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
boys	NULL
more	NULL
satisfying	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
praise	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL

for	NULL
now	NULL

told	NULL
no	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
years	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
little	NULL

came	NULL
to	NULL

happiness	NULL

Teddy	NULL

seemed	NULL

mother	NULL

How	NULL
they	NULL
ever	NULL
grew	NULL
up	NULL
alive	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
whirlpool	NULL
of	NULL
boys	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mystery	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
grandma	NULL
and	NULL
aunts	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
flourished	NULL
like	NULL
dandelions	NULL
in	NULL
spring	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
rough	NULL
nurses	NULL
loved	NULL
and	NULL
served	NULL
them	NULL
well	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
many	NULL
holidays	NULL
at	NULL
Plumfield	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
delightful	NULL
was	NULL

yearly	NULL
apple-picking	NULL

For	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
Marches	NULL
,	NULL
Laurences	NULL

Brookes	NULL

Bhaers	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
full	NULL
force	NULL

made	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL

Five	NULL
years	NULL
after	NULL
Jo	NULL
's	NULL
wedding	NULL

one	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL

festivals	NULL
occurred	NULL

a	NULL
mellow	NULL
October	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
exhilarating	NULL
freshness	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
spirits	NULL
rise	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
blood	NULL
dance	NULL
healthily	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
veins	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
orchard	NULL
wore	NULL
its	NULL
holiday	NULL
attire	NULL
.	NULL

Goldenrod	NULL
and	NULL
asters	NULL
fringed	NULL
the	NULL
mossy	NULL
walls	NULL
.	NULL

Grasshoppers	NULL
skipped	NULL
briskly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sere	NULL
grass	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
crickets	NULL
chirped	NULL
like	NULL
fairy	NULL
pipers	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
feast	NULL
.	NULL

Squirrels	NULL
were	NULL
busy	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
small	NULL
harvesting	NULL

Birds	NULL
twittered	NULL
their	NULL
adieux	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
alders	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
tree	NULL
stood	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
down	NULL
its	NULL
shower	NULL
of	NULL
red	NULL
or	NULL
yellow	NULL
apples	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL

Everybody	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

Everybody	NULL
laughed	NULL
and	NULL
sang	NULL
,	NULL
climbed	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
tumbled	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

Everybody	NULL
declared	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
jolly	NULL
set	NULL

enjoy	NULL
it	NULL

and	NULL
everyone	NULL
gave	NULL
themselves	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
simple	NULL
pleasures	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
as	NULL
freely	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
such	NULL
things	NULL
as	NULL

The	NULL

charged	NULL
up	NULL

down	NULL

performed	NULL
wonders	NULL
in	NULL

devoted	NULL

rode	NULL
his	NULL

daughter	NULL
in	NULL
