Dr	B-PER

His	B-PER

for	O
the	B-PER

with	O

was	O
brimful	O
of	O
the	O

up	O
her	O

the	O

Miss	B-PER

her	B-PER

it	O

that	O

make	O
a	B-FAC

Miss	B-PER

the	O

Miss	B-PER
Marjoribanks	I-PER
was	O
not	O
vain	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
word	O
had	O
taken	O
possession	O
of	O
her	O
imagination	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
natural	O
,	O
and	O
solaced	O
her	O
much	O
when	O
she	O
made	O
the	O
painful	O
discovery	O
that	O
her	O
gloves	O
were	O
half	O
a	O
number	O
larger	O

and	O
her	O

a	O

the	O
hands	O

were	O
both	O
perfectly	O

;	O
and	O
being	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
well	O
clothed	O
and	O
plump	O
,	O
were	O
much	O
more	O
presentable	O
and	O
pleasant	O
to	O
look	O
upon	O
than	O
the	O
lean	O
rudimentary	O
schoolgirl	B-PER
hands	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
surrounded	O

To	O
add	O
to	O
these	O
excellences	O

Lucilla	B-PER
had	O
a	O
mass	O
of	O
hair	O

been	O
cleared	O
a	O

it	O
was	O
nothing	O

tawny	O

curly	O
to	O
exasperation	O

She	O
wore	O
it	O
in	O
large	O

any	O
of	O
the	O

ought	O

for	O
it	O
had	O
this	O
aggravating	O
quality	O

that	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
grow	O
long	O

but	O
would	O
grow	O
ridiculously	O

unmanageably	O
thick	O

to	O
the	O
admiration	O
of	O
her	B-PER
companions	I-PER

to	O
her	O

no	O

what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
those	O
short	O

These	O
were	O
the	O
external	O
characteristics	O
of	O
the	B-PER
girl	I-PER
who	I-PER
was	I-PER
going	I-PER
home	I-PER
to	I-PER
be	I-PER
a	I-PER
comfort	I-PER
to	I-PER
her	I-PER

herself	I-PER
to	I-PER
his	I-PER
happiness	I-PER

In	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
her	O
rapid	O
journey	O
she	O
had	O
already	O

that	O
Dr	B-PER

was	O
very	O

given	O
to	O
embracing	O

that	O
a	O
hasty	O

on	O
her	O

was	O
the	O

weep	O
over	O

"	O

I	O
was	O
not	O
there	B-FAC
to	O
soothe	O
her	O
last	O
moments	O
!	O
"	O

Lucilla	B-PER
said	O
to	O
herself	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
sob	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
feelings	O
sufficiently	O
real	O
in	O
their	O
way	O

After	O
this	O
,	O
the	B-PER
devoted	I-PER
daughter	I-PER
made	O
up	O
her	O
mind	O
to	O
come	O
downstairs	B-FAC
again	O
,	O
pale	O
as	O
death	O
,	O

self-controlled	O

and	O
devote	O
herself	O
to	O
papa	B-PER

Perhaps	O

if	O
great	O
emotion	O
should	O
make	O
him	O
tearless	O
,	O
as	O
such	O
cases	O

Miss	B-PER

into	O
his	O
arms	O
unawares	O

so	O
surprise	O
him	O
into	O
weeping	O

All	O
this	O
went	O
briskly	O
through	O
her	O
mind	O
,	O
undeterred	O
by	O
the	O
reflection	O
that	O
tears	O
were	O
as	O
much	O
out	O
of	O
the	B-PER
Doctor	I-PER
's	O
way	O
as	O
embraces	O

and	O
in	O
this	O
mood	O
she	O
sped	O
swiftly	O
along	O
in	O
the	O
inspiration	O
of	O
her	O
first	O
sorrow	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
imagined	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
reality	O
to	O
suffer	O
her	O
first	O
disappointment	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
of	O
a	O
less	O

character	O
than	O
that	O
mild	O

When	O
Miss	B-PER

This	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
utterly	NULL

drove	NULL
Dr	NULL

the	NULL

hid	NULL
her	NULL

rested	NULL
her	NULL

mother	NULL

neither	NULL

himself	NULL

it	NULL

if	NULL
the	NULL

roused	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL

true	NULL

as	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL

summer	NULL
from	NULL

Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
means	NULL

knowing	NULL

doing	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL
by	NULL
him	NULL

widowhood	NULL

the	NULL

some	NULL

Accordingly	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
her	NULL
sobs	NULL
had	NULL
ceased	NULL

her	NULL
father	NULL
returned	NULL

raised	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL

placed	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
chair	NULL

In	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL

the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
finger	NULL

instinct	NULL
upon	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

sufficiently	NULL

then	NULL
a	NULL

When	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
comes	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
eighteen	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL

and	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
had	NULL
staved	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
danger	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
sending	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
off	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
schoolfellows	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
family	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
abroad	NULL

to	NULL
make	NULL
orthodox	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
Swiss	NULL
mountains	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL
Italian	NULL
capitals	NULL

still	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
plainly	NULL
an	NULL
expedient	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
mistress	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
along	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL

was	NULL
inevitable	NULL

So	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
denied	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
advent	NULL
was	NULL
regarded	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
with	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
interest	NULL
and	NULL
curiosity	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
wished	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
known	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
's	NULL
daughter	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
mild	NULL
young	NULL
lady	NULL
,	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
controlled	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
energy	NULL
and	NULL
determination	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
naturally	NULL
belonged	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
who	NULL
possessed	NULL
a	NULL
considerable	NULL
chin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
mouth	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
shut	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tightly	NULL
curling	NULL
tawny	NULL
tresses	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
determined	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
arranged	NULL
only	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
inclination	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
even	NULL
vaguely	NULL
reported	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
passages-of-arms	NULL

occurred	NULL
between	NULL

were	NULL
afforded	NULL
by	NULL
holidays	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
community	NULL
,	NULL
accordingly	NULL
,	NULL
regarded	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
affair	NULL
of	NULL
almost	NULL
municipal	NULL
importance	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
final	NULL
return	NULL
home	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
lady	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
career	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
importance	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
during	NULL
these	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
pupilage	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
political	NULL
economy	NULL
with	NULL
Miss	NULL
Martha	NULL
Blount	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
directing	NULL
spirit	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
establishment	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
exercised	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
influence	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
itself	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
her	NULL
course	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
deficient	NULL
in	NULL
grace	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
grace	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
secondary	NULL
quality	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
events	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
went	NULL
straight	NULL
forward	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
an	NULL
unquestionable	NULL
wake	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
running	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
indifference	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
skiffs	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
possessed	NULL
by	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
egotism	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
egoism	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
predestined	NULL
to	NULL
impress	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
its	NULL
perfect	NULL
reality	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
faith	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
surrounding	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
protest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
depreciation	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
actually	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
convince	NULL
themselves	NULL
that	NULL
anybody	NULL
cares	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
calmest	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
profound	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
discussed	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
doings	NULL
and	NULL
plans	NULL
and	NULL
clevernesses	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
bringing	NULL
forward	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
most	NULL
interesting	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
audience	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
a	NULL
conviction	NULL
is	NULL
never	NULL
without	NULL
its	NULL
fruits	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
always	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
independent	NULL
spirits	NULL
who	NULL
revolted	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
crowd	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
soon	NULL
became	NULL
impressed	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
profound	NULL
belief	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
creed	NULL
which	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
supported	NULL
so	NULL
firmly	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
conviction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
importance	NULL
and	NULL
value	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
proceedings	NULL
made	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
grew	NULL
older	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
copious	NULL
and	NULL
amusing	NULL
conversationalist	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
rank	NULL
which	NULL
few	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
are	NULL
indifferent	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
themselves	NULL
can	NULL
attain	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
thing	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
return	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
revolutionise	NULL
society	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
pleased	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
success	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
's	NULL
dinners	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
piqued	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
owed	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
instinct	NULL
of	NULL
government	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
true	NULL
despotic	NULL
order	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
objection	NULL
to	NULL
stoop	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
means	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
conquer	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
such	NULL
designs	NULL
against	NULL
Nancy	NULL
as	NULL
were	NULL
attributed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
expectant	NULL
audience	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
disposed	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
Nancy	NULL
for	NULL
prime-minister	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
divine	NULL
the	NULL
characteristic	NULL
points	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
sensible	NULL
and	NULL
thorough	NULL
belief	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
superficial	NULL
general	NULL
truths	NULL
which	NULL
most	NULL
minds	NULL
acquiesce	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
taking	NULL
the	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
example	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
brilliant	NULL
society	NULL
of	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
of	NULL
Paris	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
appears	NULL
in	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
women	NULL
have	NULL
generally	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
can	NULL
rule	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL

and	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
best	NULL
society	NULL
of	NULL

country	NULL

where	NULL
husbands	NULL
are	NULL
very	NULL
commonly	NULL
unmanageable	NULL

and	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL

deal	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
way	NULL

the	NULL
houses	NULL

will	NULL

go	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
is	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
inferior	NULL
branch	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
human	NULL
family	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
sense	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
and	NULL
appreciate	NULL
these	NULL
details	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
dinner	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
attraction	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
these	NULL
refractory	NULL
mortals	NULL
were	NULL
secured	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
wives	NULL
and	NULL
daughters	NULL
would	NULL
necessarily	NULL
follow	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
uncommon	NULL
with	NULL
women	NULL
who	NULL
are	NULL
clever	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
preferred	NULL
the	NULL
society	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rather	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
intentions	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
received	NULL
coolly	NULL
enough	NULL
the	NULL
invitation	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
friend	NULL

join	NULL

it	NULL

even	NULL
the	NULL

tour	NULL
was	NULL

none	NULL

her	NULL
out	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL

It	NULL

well	NULL
to	NULL
seize	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL

Thursday	NULL

St	NULL

(	NULL
who	NULL

tea	NULL

thus	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL

entrance	NULL

was	NULL
then	NULL
called	NULL
society	NULL

his	NULL
first	NULL

From	NULL
this	NULL
latter	NULL
circumstance	NULL
alone	NULL
the	NULL
entirely	NULL
disorganised	NULL
condition	NULL
of	NULL
affairs	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
visible	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Vincent	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
succeeded	NULL
Mr	NULL
Tufton	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
received	NULL
by	NULL
Lady	NULL
Western	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
days	NULL
when	NULL
public	NULL
opinion	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
great	NULL
advances	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
Lady	NULL
Western	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
good-natured	NULL
creature	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
an	NULL
invitation	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
regard	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
consequences	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Vincent	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
nice-looking	NULL
and	NULL
clever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
quite	NULL
presentable	NULL
.	NULL

Fortunately	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
period	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
allude	NULL
was	NULL
prior	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
entrance	NULL
of	NULL
Lady	NULL
Western	NULL
into	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
pretty	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
lady	NULL
of	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
always	NULL
of	NULL
importance	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
terribly	NULL
inconsequent	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
introductions	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
depended	NULL
upon	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
indeed	NULL
quite	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
inviting	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
of	NULL
retired	NULL
drapers	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
better	NULL
reason	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
gratify	NULL
her	NULL
protégés	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
proceeding	NULL
calculated	NULL
to	NULL
strike	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
roots	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
society	NULL
.	NULL

Fortunately	NULL
for	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
reorganisation	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
abler	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

Affairs	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
utterly	NULL
chaotic	NULL
state	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
period	NULL
when	NULL
this	NULL
record	NULL
commences	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
properly	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
centre	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
entire	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
was	NULL
inhabited	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
families	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
organisation	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
good	NULL
does	NULL
it	NULL
do	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
people	NULL
together	NULL
?	NULL

For	NULL
example	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Bury	NULL
was	NULL
utterly	NULL
unqualified	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
any	NULL
lead	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Bury	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
dead	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
daughters	NULL
were	NULL
married	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
's	NULL
maiden	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
entirely	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
tea-parties	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
like	NULL
Methodists	NULL
'	NULL
class-meetings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
where	NULL
Mr	NULL
Tufton	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
other	NULL
Dissenters	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
gave	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
hand	NULL
of	NULL
fellowship	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
gave	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
to	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
weak	NULL
tea	NULL
and	NULL
thin	NULL
bread-and-butter	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
fare	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
ladies	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
relish	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL
can	NULL
induce	NULL
Charles	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
young	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
piteously	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
dinner	NULL
he	NULL
thinks	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
an	NULL
easy-chair	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
papers	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
Miss	NULL
Bury	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
can	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
pity	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
your	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
carelessness	NULL
should	NULL
deprive	NULL
you	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
benefit	NULL
of	NULL
Christian	NULL
conversation	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
your	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
hope	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Miss	NULL
Bury	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
favourites	NULL
were	NULL
devoted	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
saw	NULL
enough	NULL
of	NULL
familiar	NULL
faces	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
tea-parties	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
defaulters	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
gave	NULL
only	NULL
dinners	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
naturally	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
lady	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
ladies	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
invited	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
drawback	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
benefit	NULL
to	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
quite	NULL
intolerable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
filled	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
expectations	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
cookery	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
never	NULL
were	NULL
properly	NULL
content	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
family	NULL
dinner	NULL
after	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
ladies	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
whom	NULL
something	NULL
might	NULL
justly	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
expected	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
society	NULL
pleasant	NULL
--	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Centum	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
example	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
everything	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
desire	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
liberal	NULL
housekeeping	NULL

or	NULL
by	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
liked	NULL
nothing	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL

,	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL

left	NULL

the	NULL
comfortable	NULL

that	NULL

would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
victim	NULL

a	NULL
circumstance	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
offender	NULL

for	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL

people	NULL

could	NULL
be	NULL
amusing	NULL

even	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
expense	NULL
of	NULL

made	NULL
it	NULL
quite	NULL
impossible	NULL
that	NULL

ever	NULL
do	NULL
anything	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL

making	NULL
a	NULL
harmonious	NULL
whole	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
scraps	NULL

fragments	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
energy	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
undertaking	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
children	NULL

and	NULL
disliked	NULL
bustle	NULL
and	NULL
trouble	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
opinion	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
never	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
his	NULL
dinner	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
four	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
over	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
,	NULL
house	NULL
by	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
finding	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
capital	NULL
material	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
without	NULL
encountering	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
individual	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
anything	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
this	NULL

briskly	NULL

and	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
conviction	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
reassured	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL

He	NULL
rubbed	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
bowled	NULL
along	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
appointment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
within	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL

turned	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL

spirit	NULL

as	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

Nancy	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL

If	NULL
Dr	NULL

had	NULL
entertained	NULL
any	NULL

that	NULL
his	NULL
dinners	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL

he	NULL
trusted	NULL
entirely	NULL
in	NULL
Nancy	NULL

a	NULL
little	NULL
in	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
suffered	NULL
his	NULL
long	NULL
upper-lip	NULL
to	NULL
relax	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
without	NULL

.	NULL

Her	NULL
father	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
returned	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
labours	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
long	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
arrived	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
visits	NULL
on	NULL
foot	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
the	NULL
brougham	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
thing	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
mutual	NULL
respect	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL

it	NULL

true	NULL

such	NULL

who	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL

except	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sole	NULL
occasion	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
misunderstood	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
sometimes	NULL
happens	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
time	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
pleased	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
other	NULL
times	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
visitor	NULL
;	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
kingdom	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
received	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
guest	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
coming	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
warmer	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
remembered	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
active	NULL
mind	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
stepped	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
brougham	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
bore	NULL
any	NULL
special	NULL
tender	NULL
meaning	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
desire	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
well	NULL
known	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
henceforward	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
comfort	NULL
to	NULL
dear	NULL
papa	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
now	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
kingdom	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
entering	NULL
the	NULL
domain	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
intended	NULL
her	NULL
will	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
law	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
living	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
with	NULL
friends	NULL
whose	NULL
arrangements	NULL
(	NULL
much	NULL
inferior	NULL
to	NULL
those	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
)	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
acquiesce	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whose	NULL
domestic	NULL
economy	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
be	NULL
criticised	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
point	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
naturally	NULL
a	NULL
pleasure	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
now	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
emancipated	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
liberty	NULL
to	NULL
exercise	NULL
her	NULL
faculty	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
times	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
year	NULL
when	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
with	NULL
difficulty	NULL
restrained	NULL
herself	NULL
from	NULL
snatching	NULL
the	NULL
reins	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
hosts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
showing	NULL
them	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
manage	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
impatient	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
restrain	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
bondage	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
king	NULL
entering	NULL
in	NULL
secret	NULL
a	NULL
capital	NULL
which	NULL
awaits	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
acclamations	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
she	NULL
presented	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rejoicing	NULL
public	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
arrangements	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
and	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
rapid	NULL
glance	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
shops	NULL
in	NULL
George	NULL
Street	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
drove	NULL
past	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
decided	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
honour	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
patronage	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
rapid	NULL
glance	NULL
of	NULL
reorganising	NULL
genius	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
cast	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
around	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
decided	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
regarded	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
guided	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
housemaid	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
Miss	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

Nancy	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
no	NULL
better	NULL
(	NULL
being	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
most	NULL
gifted	NULL
persons	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
idea	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
established	NULL
her	NULL
young	NULL
mistress	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
chamber	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
sentimental	NULL
notions	NULL
about	NULL
white	NULL
dimity	NULL
,	NULL
shook	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
frigid	NULL
little	NULL
apartment	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
sorry	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
placed	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
if	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
prevenant	NULL
_	NULL
class	NULL
,	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
preparations	NULL
possible	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
daughter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
arrange	NULL
elegant	NULL
surprises	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
disgusted	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
bent	NULL
on	NULL
making	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
necessary	NULL
improvements	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
person	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
to	NULL
await	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
disapprobation	NULL
was	NULL
mingled	NULL
with	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
and	NULL
content	NULL
in	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
behold	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
shook	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
shrugged	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
paused	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
faded	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
light	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
burned	NULL
brightly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
kept	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
lively	NULL
play	NULL
of	NULL
glimmer	NULL
and	NULL
shadow	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tall	NULL
glass	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
fireplace	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
twinkled	NULL
dimly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
long	NULL
windows	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
curtains	NULL
hung	NULL
stiff	NULL
and	NULL
solemn	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
daylight	NULL
form	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
an	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
big	NULL
,	NULL
dull	NULL
,	NULL
faded	NULL
,	NULL
respectable	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
recollections	NULL
attached	NULL
to	NULL
every	NULL
old	NULL
ottoman	NULL
and	NULL
easy-chair	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
charming	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
waste	NULL
and	NULL
howling	NULL
wilderness	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
walked	NULL
from	NULL
one	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
verified	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
plans	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
conceived	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
embellishment	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
inner	NULL
court	NULL
and	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
kingdom	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
walked	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
unhesitating	NULL
step	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
match	NULL
and	NULL
lighted	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
candles	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
candlesticks	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
flickering	NULL
in	NULL
grotesque	NULL
shadows	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
roof	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
proceeding	NULL
threw	NULL
a	NULL
flood	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
considerations	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
passing	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
mode	NULL
of	NULL
lighting	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
afterwards	NULL
acted	NULL
upon	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
success	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
flood	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
regarding	NULL
everything	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
enlightened	NULL
critic	NULL
and	NULL
reformer	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
there	NULL
arose	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
a	NULL
momentary	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
startling	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
_	NULL
éclairage	NULL
_	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
witnessed	NULL
was	NULL
scarcely	NULL
necessary	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
momentary	NULL
glance	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
candles	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
greet	NULL
his	NULL
daughter	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
far	NULL
too	NULL
well-bred	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
suggest	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sentiment	NULL
of	NULL
real	NULL
pleasure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
owned	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
keep	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
department	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
rather	NULL
agreeable	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sentiment	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
enthusiastic	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
neither	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
salutation	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
you	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
moderate	NULL
and	NULL
unexcited	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
papa	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
home	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
discussed	NULL
the	NULL
journey	NULL
--	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
state	NULL
the	NULL
railway	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
--	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
bethought	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
prepare	NULL
for	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Nancy	NULL
is	NULL
always	NULL
very	NULL
punctual	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
sure	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
hungry	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
so	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
go	NULL
upstairs	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
your	NULL
permission	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
change	NULL
my	NULL
coat	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
the	NULL
actual	NULL
arrival	NULL
terminated	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
reign	NULL
began	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
sovereign	NULL
gave	NULL
any	NULL
intimation	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
future	NULL
policy	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
naturally	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
that	NULL
first	NULL
night	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
exclusively	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
adventures	NULL
and	NULL
achievements	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
related	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
return	NULL
made	NULL
that	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
natural	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
altogether	NULL
superior	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
natural	NULL
prejudice	NULL
which	NULL
makes	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
interested	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
themselves	NULL
particularly	NULL
interesting	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
doings	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
doing	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
certainly	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
duties	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
amused	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
followed	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
marvel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
principles	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
of	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
conquest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
grand	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
essential	NULL
preliminary	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
interval	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
spent	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
claret	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
effecting	NULL
another	NULL
fundamental	NULL
duty	NULL
of	NULL
woman	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
expressed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
harmonised	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL

by	NULL
the	NULL
simple	NULL
method	NULL
of	NULL
rearranging	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
chairs	NULL
and	NULL
covering	NULL
the	NULL
tables	NULL
with	NULL
trifles	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL

a	NULL
proceeding	NULL

converted	NULL

The	NULL
Doctor	NULL
himself	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
moved	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
vaguely	NULL
round	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
doubtful	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
only	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sparkling	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
candles	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
mantelpiece	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
well-bred	NULL
to	NULL
remark	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
unfolded	NULL
her	NULL
standard	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
breakfast	NULL
,	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
pour	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
coffee	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
intense	NULL
amazement	NULL
,	NULL
seated	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
usually	NULL
occupied	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
urn	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
coffee-pot	NULL
.	NULL

Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
hesitated	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
momentous	NULL
instant	NULL
,	NULL
stricken	NULL
dumb	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
unparalleled	NULL
audacity	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
so	NULL
great	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
daughter	NULL
's	NULL
courage	NULL
and	NULL
steadiness	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
fate	NULL
he	NULL
accepted	NULL
the	NULL
seat	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
where	NULL
everything	NULL
was	NULL
arranged	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
invited	NULL
him	NULL
sweetly	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
mental	NULL
perturbation	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seated	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
opened	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
importance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
step	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
afraid	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
your	NULL
seat	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
ingenuous	NULL
sweetness	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
then	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
the	NULL
urn	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
mind	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
Doctor	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
"	NULL
Humph	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
undertone	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
aware	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
abdicated	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
knowing	NULL
it	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
reins	NULL
of	NULL
state	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
smilingly	NULL
withdrawn	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
unconscious	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Nancy	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
appearance	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
became	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
apparent	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
still	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sweetest	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
dreadful	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
papa	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
bothered	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL

"	NULL
After	NULL
this	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
sure	NULL
you	NULL

I	NULL

it	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
smiled	NULL
so	NULL
sweetly	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
two	NULL
amazed	NULL
subjects	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
humour	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL
Doctor	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL

laughed	NULL
out	NULL

much	NULL

Nancy	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

those	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
nearly	NULL
reached	NULL
Salem	NULL
Chapel	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
pushed	NULL
itself	NULL
forward	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
cosy	NULL
little	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL

pondering	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL

the	NULL

in	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
shape	NULL

Tom	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
that	NULL
singular	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
fortune	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
effect	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
career	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
happy	NULL
accidents	NULL
rarely	NULL
happen	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
to	NULL
great	NULL
generals	NULL
or	NULL
heroes	NULL
of	NULL
romance	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
presumption	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
to	NULL
place	NULL
herself	NULL
conspicuously	NULL
in	NULL
either	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
categories	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fact	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
eventful	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
walking	NULL
along	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
shade	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
pretty	NULL
parasol	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
expecting	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
absorbed	NULL
in	NULL
many	NULL
thoughts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
cast	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
expectations	NULL
of	NULL
success	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
consciousness	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
unlucky	NULL
cousin	NULL
would	NULL
insist	NULL
upon	NULL
making	NULL
love	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
even	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
expressed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
_	NULL
saying	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
_	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
skill	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
saying	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
love-making	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
abstract	NULL
was	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
nineteen	NULL
,	NULL
well	NULL
off	NULL
and	NULL
good-looking	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
other	NULL
matters	NULL
of	NULL
more	NULL
importance	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
while	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL
these	NULL
reflections	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
within	NULL
three	NULL
doors	NULL
of	NULL
Salem	NULL
Chapel	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
garden	NULL
where	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
mignonette	NULL
had	NULL
run	NULL
to	NULL
seed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
Michaelmas	NULL
daisies	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
full	NULL
possession	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
roused	NULL
suddenly	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
musings	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
surprise	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
great	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
stopped	NULL
short	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
extremity	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
astonishment	NULL
and	NULL
delight	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
could	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
that	NULL
possessed	NULL
that	NULL
voice	NULL
which	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
felt	NULL
by	NULL
instinct	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
wanting	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
full	NULL

delicious	NULL
contralto	NULL

precisely	NULL
adapted	NULL
to	NULL
supplement	NULL
without	NULL
supplanting	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
high-pitched	NULL
and	NULL
much-cultivated	NULL
organ	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
stopped	NULL
short	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
rapid	NULL
observation	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
surprise	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
house	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
exactly	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
humble	NULL
houses	NULL
in	NULL
Grove	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
little	NULL
blank	NULL
squares	NULL
hung	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
windows	NULL
,	NULL
revealed	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
educated	NULL
eye	NULL
the	NULL
existence	NULL
of	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
"	NULL
feeling	NULL
"	NULL
for	NULL
art	NULL
as	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
satisfied	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
transparent	NULL
porcelain	NULL
version	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
famous	NULL
Madonna	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
even	NULL
catch	NULL
a	NULL
glimpse	NULL

through	NULL
the	NULL
curtains	NULL

the	NULL

were	NULL
well	NULL
drawn	NULL
back	NULL

light	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
fully	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
glimmer	NULL
of	NULL
gilt	NULL
picture-frames	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
garden	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
buried	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
mignonette	NULL

were	NULL
some	NULL
remains	NULL
of	NULL
plaster-casts	NULL

originally	NULL
placed	NULL
there	NULL
for	NULL
ornament	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
long	NULL
since	NULL
cast	NULL
down	NULL
by	NULL
rain	NULL
and	NULL
neglect	NULL
.	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
observations	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
promptitude	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
accomplished	NULL
warrior	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
bar	NULL
of	NULL

it	NULL

that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
bold	NULL

out	NULL

Miss	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL
stood	NULL
aghast	NULL

lost	NULL

perplexity	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
amiable	NULL
or	NULL
yielding	NULL
by	NULL
nature	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL

Miss	NULL

Barbara	NULL

she	NULL

for	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
sang	NULL
her	NULL

when	NULL

came	NULL
to	NULL
Barbara	NULL

turn	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
essayed	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL

drove	NULL
the	NULL

off	NULL

then	NULL
the	NULL

grand	NULL
enough	NULL

filled	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

sustained	NULL
by	NULL

herself	NULL

the	NULL
first	NULL
necessity	NULL

a	NULL
woman	NULL

She	NULL
paused	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

clap	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
strophe	NULL

resumed	NULL
with	NULL
energy	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL

she	NULL
knew	NULL
by	NULL
instinct	NULL
what	NULL

the	NULL

that	NULL

which	NULL

the	NULL
glory	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL

elated	NULL

performed	NULL
this	NULL

She	NULL

up	NULL

then	NULL
she	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL
bland	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
held	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
captive	NULL
graciously	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gathered	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
parasol	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
chair	NULL
.	NULL

Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
visitor	NULL
go	NULL
after	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
asleep	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
dreamt	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
visit	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
drawing-master	NULL
was	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
quantity	NULL
of	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Barbara	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
forgiven	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
for	NULL
dying	NULL
just	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
portfolio	NULL
of	NULL
drawings	NULL
were	NULL
asked	NULL
out	NULL
frequently	NULL
to	NULL
tea	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
pupils	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
kind	NULL
people	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
daughters	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
ambitious	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
beheld	NULL
herself	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
almost	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
threshold	NULL
of	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
as	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
finished	NULL
her	NULL
pale	NULL
career	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
poor	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Lake	NULL
thought	NULL
fit	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
injury	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
daughter	NULL
's	NULL
prospects	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
destruction	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
hopes	NULL
.	NULL

Naturally	NULL
Barbara	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
quite	NULL
forgiven	NULL
that	NULL
injury	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
ill-used	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
resolute	NULL
about	NULL
sending	NULL
Rose	NULL
to	NULL
Mount	NULL
Pleasant	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
little	NULL
girl	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
happy	NULL
helping	NULL
her	NULL
papa	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
School	NULL
of	NULL
Design	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Barbara	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
Rose	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
resign	NULL
her	NULL
inclinations	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
set	NULL
of	NULL
odious	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
hard	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
proper	NULL
ambition	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
handsome	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
fall	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
housekeeping	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
consent	NULL
to	NULL
remain	NULL
unseen	NULL
and	NULL
unheard	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
Barbara	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
remarkable	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
these	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
imagined	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
movement	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
passionate	NULL
temper	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
breath	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
consider	NULL
this	NULL
sudden	NULL
and	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
visit	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
glimmer	NULL
of	NULL
hope	NULL
and	NULL
interest	NULL
penetrated	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bosom	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
gloomy	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
two	NULL
years	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
different	NULL
in	NULL
"	NULL
style	NULL
"	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
stout	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
contralto	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
stout	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
due	NULL
opportunity	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
development	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
come	NULL
later	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Barbara	NULL
possessed	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
beauty	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
passionate	NULL
and	NULL
somewhat	NULL
sullen	NULL
brunette	NULL
,	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
glowing	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
straight	NULL
black	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
straight	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
gave	NULL
,	NULL
oddly	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
suggestion	NULL
of	NULL
oblique	NULL
vision	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
oblique	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
you	NULL
straight	NULL
from	NULL
under	NULL
that	NULL
black	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
shadow	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
doubtful	NULL
expression	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
shy	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
any	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
injured	NULL
and	NULL
unappreciated	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
no	NULL
two	NULL
things	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
different	NULL
than	NULL
this	NULL
shyness	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
Barbara	NULL
look	NULL
you	NULL
straight	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
scared	NULL
defiance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sweet	NULL
shyness	NULL
that	NULL
pleaded	NULL
for	NULL
kind	NULL
treatment	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
soft	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
little	NULL
Rose	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
plain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
oddest	NULL
longing	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
people	NULL
comfortable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
please	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
successful	NULL
.	NULL

Barbara	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stool	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
obliging	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
close	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
with	NULL
growing	NULL
excitement	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
doubt	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
puzzling	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
discovery	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
contralto	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
getting	NULL
up	NULL
unlimited	NULL
duets	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
further	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
aim	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
comfort	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
dear	NULL
papa	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Barbara	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
soldier	NULL
of	NULL
fortune	NULL
,	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
for	NULL
granted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
swallow	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
mysterious	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
programme	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
adventurous	NULL
general	NULL
who	NULL
might	NULL
lead	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
glory	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
her	NULL
dreams	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
herself	NULL
receiving	NULL
in	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
the	NULL
homage	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
of	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
even	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL
families	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
attracted	NULL
by	NULL
rumours	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
wonderful	NULL
performance	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Barbara	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
consciousness	NULL
,	NULL
walking	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
aisle	NULL
of	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
Church	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
veil	NULL
of	NULL
real	NULL
Brussels	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
little	NULL
Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
hungry	NULL
and	NULL
good-tempered	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
concluded	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
bridegroom	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
matters	NULL
of	NULL
detail	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
precisely	NULL
concluded	NULL
on	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
immediate	NULL
result	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
secondary	NULL
personage	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
masterly	NULL
impromptu	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
needless	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
accomplished	NULL
warrior	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
wits	NULL
always	NULL
about	NULL

for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

who	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
prudence	NULL
which	NULL
Dr	NULL

himself	NULL

acknowledged	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

would	NULL
be	NULL
at	NULL

The	NULL

got	NULL
over	NULL

for	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
soul	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
ordinary	NULL

the	NULL
second	NULL
unanswerable	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
discovery	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
satisfied	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
necessities	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
.	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
liberal	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
genius	NULL
ought	NULL
always	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
willing	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL

in	NULL

should	NULL
sing	NULL
their	NULL
little	NULL
songs	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL

entertaining	NULL
her	NULL

then	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
moment	NULL

when	NULL
her	NULL
ruling	NULL

saw	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL

would	NULL
occur	NULL
the	NULL
duet	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
duet	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
feature	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL

Thus	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL

used	NULL

tasted	NULL
the	NULL
sweetness	NULL

This	NULL

however	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
willing	NULL

the	NULL

felt	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
produced	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
combination	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

was	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
weaker	NULL
woman	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
incapable	NULL

making	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
sentiment	NULL

Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
never	NULL
came	NULL
home	NULL

indeed	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
contempt	NULL

Tom	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
arrived	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
's	NULL
expectation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
arrived	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
curious	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
adaptation	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
which	NULL
characterised	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
which	NULL
put	NULL
Nancy	NULL
entirely	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
upset	NULL
the	NULL
equanimity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
for	NULL
twenty-four	NULL
hours	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
can	NULL
conceive	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
instance	NULL
of	NULL
carelessness	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
nine	NULL
o'clock	NULL
train	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
putting	NULL

downstairs	NULL

After	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
conclusion	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Carlingford	NULL

occurring	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
after	NULL

arrival	NULL

when	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
fully	NULL
prepared	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
_	NULL
so	NULL
_	NULL
like	NULL
Tom	NULL
,	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
partially	NULL
understood	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
furiously	NULL
hungry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
managed	NULL
perfectly	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
dinner	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
missed	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
at	NULL
Didcot	NULL
Junction	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
wonderful	NULL
blunder	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
railway	NULL
people	NULL

which	NULL
never	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
occurred	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
unlucky	NULL
presence	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
passengers	NULL
.	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
took	NULL
Thomas	NULL
apart	NULL
,	NULL

sent	NULL
him	NULL
downstairs	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
conciliatory	NULL
message	NULL

said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Nancy	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
sweetness	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
subdue	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

much	NULL
against	NULL

the	NULL
two	NULL

spinning	NULL
about	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

books	NULL

knick-knacks	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
tables	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
covering	NULL
his	NULL
impatience	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
off	NULL
Tom	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
favourite	NULL

to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
den	NULL
downstairs	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
supper	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL

served	NULL

but	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
deny	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
greetings	NULL

homage	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
cousin	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL

what	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
sensible	NULL
arrangement	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL

instead	NULL

sister	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
widow	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL

no	NULL

had	NULL
spoiled	NULL
her	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

who	NULL
no	NULL

would	NULL

how	NULL

Thus	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
mused	NULL

with	NULL
that	NULL
sense	NULL

mild	NULL
amazement	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

without	NULL

a	NULL

beyond	NULL
her	NULL

in	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Tom	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
horribly	NULL

no	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
exhilarated	NULL
by	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

delighted	NULL

And	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
led	NULL
the	NULL

downstairs	NULL

leaving	NULL
Tom	NULL

followed	NULL

which	NULL

Naturally	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
reverted	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL

rival	NULL

some	NULL
one	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
sensible	NULL
Doctor	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
nothing	NULL

his	NULL
very	NULL
ears	NULL
grew	NULL
red	NULL
with	NULL
excitement	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
idea	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL

he	NULL
ate	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
meal	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL

had	NULL

the	NULL
Doctor	NULL

according	NULL

sat	NULL

his	NULL

between	NULL

fire	NULL

sipped	NULL

watched	NULL

what	NULL

was	NULL
doing	NULL

which	NULL
Tom	NULL
replied	NULL
to	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
frankest	NULL
confidence	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL

were	NULL
his	NULL
abilities	NULL
anything	NULL
out	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
moment	NULL
Tom	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
gain	NULL
the	NULL
Woolsack	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
gave	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
listened	NULL

wondered	NULL
much	NULL

Providence	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL

give	NULL

him	NULL

the	NULL
boy	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
meantime	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
occupied	NULL
upstairs	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
housemaid	NULL
up	NULL
nominally	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
instructions	NULL
about	NULL
Mr	NULL
Tom	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL

really	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
covers	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
chairs	NULL

and	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
they	NULL
looked	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
lighted	NULL
up	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
progress	NULL
of	NULL
decay	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
too	NULL
far	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
that	NULL
trial	NULL

After	NULL
all	NULL

the	NULL
chintz	NULL

though	NULL
none	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
came	NULL
upstairs	NULL

Tom	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
's	NULL
disgust	NULL

insisted	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
found	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
act	NULL
of	NULL
pacing	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL

pacing	NULL

not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sentimental	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
promenade	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
homely	NULL
practical	NULL
signification	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
view	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
form	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
carpet	NULL
was	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
tall	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
through	NULL
this	NULL
process	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
great	NULL
drawback	NULL
in	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
grace	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
step	NULL
giving	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
tragedy-queen	NULL
effect	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
handsome	NULL

substantial	NULL
person	NULL
and	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
sweeping	NULL
dress	NULL

She	NULL
stopped	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
withdrew	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
established	NULL
her	NULL
throne	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
conscious	NULL
pathos	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
impressed	NULL
her	NULL
companions	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Tom	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
instinctively	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
mystery	NULL
under	NULL
which	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
supported	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
irrelevant	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
conceived	NULL
immediately	NULL
a	NULL
violent	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
knock	NULL
the	NULL
fellow	NULL
down	NULL
;	NULL
whereas	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL

The	NULL

at	NULL

nothing	NULL

against	NULL

very	NULL
superior	NULL

knew	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL

dinner	NULL
was	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
revolution	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
vaguely	NULL
oppressed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL

all	NULL
that	NULL

the	NULL
entrance	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Holden	NULL
the	NULL
upholsterer	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

He	NULL
acquiesced	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL

for	NULL
it	NULL

it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
confessed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
spectre	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL

sitting	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
right	NULL
hand	NULL
clouded	NULL
over	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
the	NULL
pleasant	NULL
anticipation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL

a	NULL

then	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
absolutely	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
gave	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sigh	NULL

Thus	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
realise	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
serious	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
semi-abdication	NULL

been	NULL
beguiled	NULL

come	NULL
in	NULL
again	NULL

triumph	NULL

possession	NULL

the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
knew	NULL
too	NULL

a	NULL
long	NULL
life	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
precisely	NULL
amusing	NULL

he	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL

was	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
make	NULL

Tom	NULL
,	NULL

put	NULL
her	NULL
bridle	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL

Nancy	NULL

when	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
changing	NULL
the	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
's	NULL
dinners	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
intellect	NULL
naturally	NULL
got	NULL
more	NULL
obtuse	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
joke	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Tom	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
disposed	NULL

summarily	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Miss	NULL

Tom	NULL

utterly	NULL

inspired	NULL

believed	NULL
it	NULL

a	NULL

it	NULL
never	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
filial	NULL
devotion	NULL

contemplate	NULL

would	NULL
preserve	NULL

from	NULL
the	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

quite	NULL
ready	NULL

And	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
ten	NULL

Mrs	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL

before	NULL
anybody	NULL

commenced	NULL

sing	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

or	NULL
even	NULL
with	NULL
German	NULL

as	NULL
some	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
do	NULL

She	NULL
sang	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
ballad	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
treasures	NULL
of	NULL
resuscitated	NULL

dig	NULL
out	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL

the	NULL

a	NULL

genius	NULL

out	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
result	NULL
to	NULL

.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
dread	NULL
that	NULL
overshadowed	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
composed	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL

When	NULL

it	NULL

pursued	NULL

that	NULL
Mr	NULL

insisted	NULL

marrying	NULL
her	NULL

Tom	NULL

instead	NULL

then	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
changed	NULL

instead	NULL
of	NULL
receiving	NULL
the	NULL
salutations	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL

as	NULL
M.P.	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
borough	NULL

it	NULL

the	NULL
amusing	NULL
man	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
defeated	NULL
candidate	NULL

who	NULL
grinned	NULL
and	NULL
nodded	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
said	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
hustings	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
forget	NULL
the	NULL
luncheon	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
introduction	NULL

Such	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
nightmare	NULL
that	NULL
pursued	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
even	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
sphere	NULL
of	NULL
dreams	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
presentiment	NULL
takes	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
well-balanced	NULL
mind	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL

,	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
accepted	NULL
as	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL

likely	NULL

follow	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
did	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
disarm	NULL
fate	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sweetest	NULL
submission	NULL
and	NULL
dutifulness	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wishes	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
severe	NULL
disregard	NULL
of	NULL
Tom	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
drove	NULL
that	NULL
unhappy	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
nearly	NULL
desperate	NULL
.	NULL

Far	NULL
from	NULL
saying	NULL
anything	NULL
about	NULL
luncheon	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
even	NULL
ignored	NULL
his	NULL
presence	NULL
at	NULL
breakfast	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
remained	NULL
calmly	NULL
unconscious	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
empty	NULL
cup	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
coffee	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
injured	NULL

pathetic	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
amused	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
beyond	NULL

But	NULL
even	NULL
this	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
prove	NULL
sufficient	NULL

propitiate	NULL
the	NULL

When	NULL

were	NULL
gone	NULL

it	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
well	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
arrangements	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
decided	NULL
upon	NULL
going	NULL

Grove	NULL

pay	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
a	NULL
visit	NULL

and	NULL
practise	NULL
some	NULL
duets	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
as	NULL
innocent	NULL
an	NULL
occupation	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
leisure	NULL
as	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
desired	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
putting	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
hat	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
object	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
rang	NULL
solemnly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
curiosity	NULL
conquered	NULL
her	NULL
good	NULL
manners	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
hastening	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL

saw	NULL
Mr	NULL
Bury	NULL
himself	NULL
enter	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
accompanied	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
figure	NULL
in	NULL
deep	NULL
and	NULL
shabby	NULL
mourning	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
tremors	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
rushed	NULL
back	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL

arrived	NULL

a	NULL
trial	NULL

her	NULL
courage	NULL
very	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

her	NULL

Nothing	NULL

the	NULL
most	NULL
solemn	NULL
intentions	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
supported	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL

a	NULL
veil	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL

a	NULL
woman	NULL
to	NULL

she	NULL
felt	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
collected	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
powers	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
this	NULL
mysterious	NULL
assault	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
hat	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
instinctive	NULL
certainty	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL

the	NULL
duet	NULL

notwithstanding	NULL

it	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
perfectly	NULL

him	NULL

Marjoribanks	NULL
that	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL
dependant	NULL

The	NULL
Rector	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL

was	NULL
Evangelical	NULL

had	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
female	NULL
circle	NULL
who	NULL
admired	NULL
and	NULL
swore	NULL
by	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
,	NULL
consequently	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
manner	NULL
natural	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL

After	NULL
this	NULL
introduction	NULL

the	NULL
figure	NULL
in	NULL
black	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
its	NULL

It	NULL

sad	NULL

Indeed	NULL

at	NULL
all	NULL

we	NULL
have	NULL
great	NULL

into	NULL
temptation	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL

terribly	NULL
deceitful	NULL

After	NULL
hearing	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL

I	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL

up	NULL

talk	NULL

Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
sure	NULL
his	NULL
natural	NULL
good	NULL
sense	NULL
will	NULL
teach	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
ought	NULL
not	NULL

I	NULL

since	NULL

been	NULL

me	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
continued	NULL

with	NULL

looking	NULL

"	NULL
Everybody	NULL

it	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
uttered	NULL
a	NULL

then	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL

up	NULL

It	NULL

hinder	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
extricated	NULL

triumphantly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
consequences	NULL

that	NULL

defeated	NULL

she	NULL

taken	NULL
up	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL

who	NULL

always	NULL
prompt	NULL
in	NULL

found	NULL
her	NULL

the	NULL
failure	NULL

After	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
away	NULL

Miss	NULL

herself	NULL
conducted	NULL
the	NULL
widow	NULL

by	NULL
this	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
's	NULL

brighten	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
active	NULL

new	NULL
friend	NULL

This	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
good	NULL
humour	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
restored	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
forgiven	NULL
Tom	NULL

maladroitness	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
privately	NULL
to	NULL
old	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL

"	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
indeed	NULL
as	NULL

intended	NULL

did	NULL
for	NULL
driving	NULL

Marjoribanks	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
extremity	NULL

The	NULL

exactly	NULL

;	NULL
and	NULL
Mr	NULL
Holden	NULL
himself	NULL
waited	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
complaisance	NULL
for	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
opinion	NULL

the	NULL
effect	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

himself	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
naturally	NULL
impressed	NULL

as	NULL
most	NULL

with	NULL
that	NULL
confidence	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

so	NULL
much	NULL
facilitates	NULL
the	NULL
operations	NULL

are	NULL
born	NULL

greatness	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
precisely	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL

persuaded	NULL
Tom	NULL

and	NULL
to	NULL
shut	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
door	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
external	NULL
world	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
refuge	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
renovation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
Tom	NULL
's	NULL
last	NULL
day	NULL
at	NULL
Carlingford	NULL

had	NULL
no	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
unkind	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

To	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
regard	NULL
and	NULL
impulse	NULL
of	NULL
protection	NULL

patronage	NULL
towards	NULL
Tom	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
something	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

time	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
things	NULL

approaching	NULL

crisis	NULL
upstairs	NULL

was	NULL
listening	NULL
intently	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
movements	NULL
overhead	NULL

and	NULL
wondering	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sent	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL

at	NULL
which	NULL
Tom	NULL
thought	NULL
fit	NULL
to	NULL
claim	NULL
a	NULL
hearing	NULL

the	NULL
state	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL

with	NULL
his	NULL

alternately	NULL
red	NULL

and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
signs	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL

life	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL

took	NULL
possession	NULL

suddenly	NULL
ceased	NULL

perhaps	NULL

equally	NULL
to	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL

She	NULL

Under	NULL
these	NULL

it	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
readily	NULL
believed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
commencement	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
operations	NULL
was	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
opportune	NULL
that	NULL
society	NULL
forgot	NULL
its	NULL
usual	NULL
instincts	NULL
of	NULL
criticism	NULL

forgave	NULL
Miss	NULL

more	NULL
enlightened	NULL

her	NULL
neighbours	NULL

then	NULL
most	NULL

were	NULL
very	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL

now	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
restored	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
privilege	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
accorded	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
crowd	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
it	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
vow	NULL
of	NULL
secrecy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
owned	NULL
to	NULL
having	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
run	NULL
upstairs	NULL
one	NULL
evening	NULL
after	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
little	NULL
dinners	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
_	NULL
convives	NULL

were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
erected	NULL
her	NULL
temporary	NULL
throne	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
clandestine	NULL
inspection	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
failure	NULL
it	NULL
deserved	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
light	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
moonlight	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
three	NULL
white	NULL
blotches	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
carpet	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
burying	NULL
everything	NULL
else	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
profoundest	NULL
darkness	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
spy	NULL
knocked	NULL
his	NULL
foot	NULL
against	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
reduced	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
sudden	NULL
and	NULL
well-merited	NULL
agony	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
discretion	NULL
itself	NULL

and	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
nothing	NULL

to	NULL
her	NULL
niece	NULL

I	NULL

From	NULL
this	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
curiosity	NULL
of	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
was	NULL
excited	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
lively	NULL
extent	NULL
.	NULL

Many	NULL
people	NULL
even	NULL
went	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL
Browns	NULL
a	NULL

Mr	NULL

had	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
handsome	NULL
house	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
out	NULL

All	NULL
these	NULL

passed	NULL

,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
precious	NULL

the	NULL

not	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
least	NULL
inclination	NULL
to	NULL

as	NULL
she	NULL

it	NULL

indeed	NULL

that	NULL

for	NULL

best	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
would	NULL
reply	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL

I	NULL
need	NULL

when	NULL
papa	NULL

good	NULL
about	NULL
everything	NULL

"	NULL

Yet	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
ungracious	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
first	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
marry	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
be	NULL
deranging	NULL
her	NULL
plans	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
serious	NULL
extent	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
hopes	NULL
were	NULL
realised	NULL
,	NULL
constitute	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
queen	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
but	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
these	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
reconsider	NULL
her	NULL
resolution	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
thus	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
passed	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
was	NULL
undergoing	NULL
renovation	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
much	NULL
tantalised	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
absence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
prevented	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
having	NULL
any	NULL
music	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
even	NULL
been	NULL
tempted	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
snatches	NULL
of	NULL
song	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL

some	NULL

the	NULL
gentlemen	NULL

the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
himself	NULL

Colonel	NULL
Chiley	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL

preferred	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL

And	NULL
thus	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
brilliant	NULL
auspices	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL
confidence	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
future	NULL

that	NULL
Miss	NULL

superintended	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
momentous	NULL
Thursday	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL

the	NULL

her	NULL

work	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL

"	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

said	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
painful	NULL
pride	NULL
of	NULL
poverty	NULL

aggravated	NULL
much	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
comforts	NULL

other	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
an	NULL
injury	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

she	NULL

been	NULL
thinking	NULL

little	NULL
else	NULL
for	NULL
at	NULL

a	NULL
week	NULL
past	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
choice	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
wardrobe	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
disposition	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
rejected	NULL
sympathy	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
look	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
pretend	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
indifferent	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
this	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
dull	NULL
colour	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL

the	NULL
colour	NULL
of	NULL
irritation	NULL

she	NULL
could	NULL

asking	NULL
herself	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
handsome	NULL

the	NULL

while	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
Barbara	NULL

had	NULL
nothing	NULL

a	NULL
white	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
differences	NULL

frocks	NULL

the	NULL
masculine	NULL

Barbara	NULL

six	NULL

a	NULL
very	NULL

When	NULL

these	NULL

Marjoribanks	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL

Barbara	NULL
proceeded	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL

examine	NULL
it	NULL

It	NULL

with	NULL

Miss	NULL

justly	NULL
observed	NULL

the	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

with	NULL
that	NULL

impartiality	NULL

When	NULL
Mr	NULL

came	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
ingratiating	NULL
way	NULL

asked	NULL
her	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL

proved	NULL

proof	NULL

the	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL

go	NULL
away	NULL

said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sentiment	NULL
perhaps	NULL
too	NULL
large	NULL

enlightened	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
truest	NULL
sense	NULL

it	NULL
ought	NULL

have	NULL
done	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
applause	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
audience	NULL

Most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
persons	NULL
immediately	NULL
surrounding	NULL
her	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
_	NULL
bon-mot	NULL
_	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
utterance	NULL

laughed	NULL
accordingly	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
needless	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
that	NULL
these	NULL
were	NULL
persons	NULL
quite	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
her	NULL
genius	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
keeping	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
figure	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sofa	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL

glued	NULL
there	NULL

kept	NULL
staring	NULL
defiance	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
in	NULL

from	NULL
under	NULL
black	NULL

level	NULL
brows	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
introduced	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
flattering	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
present	NULL

but	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
stranger	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
intruder	NULL
into	NULL
those	NULL
regions	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
blest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
feeling	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
her	NULL
present	NULL
companions	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
whispered	NULL
among	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Miss	NULL
Lake	NULL

she	NULL
herself	NULL

still	NULL

reminded	NULL

Barbara	NULL
sat	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
move	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
corner	NULL

looking	NULL
out	NULL
upon	NULL
everybody	NULL
with	NULL
scared	NULL
eyes	NULL

which	NULL
expressed	NULL
nothing	NULL

defiance	NULL
,	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
mind	NULL
making	NULL
the	NULL
reflections	NULL

bitter	NULL
poverty	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
airy	NULL

figures	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL

in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
variations	NULL

that	NULL
costume	NULL
which	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
announced	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
standard	NULL
of	NULL
dress	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

Barbara	NULL
's	NULL
muslin	NULL
,	NULL
six	NULL
times	NULL
washed	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
spotless	NULL
lightness	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
draperies	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
fright	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
defiance	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
gay	NULL
babble	NULL
and	NULL
pleasant	NULL
looks	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
group	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
combination	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
form	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
never	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
anything	NULL
in	NULL
common	NULL
between	NULL
those	NULL
frivolous	NULL
creatures	NULL
and	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
daughter	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
exasperated	NULL
with	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
beguiled	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
this	NULL
scene	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
game	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
poor	NULL
Barbara	NULL
said	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
making	NULL
game	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
nobody	NULL
took	NULL
much	NULL
notice	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
unsuccessful	NULL
attempt	NULL
at	NULL
conversation	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
unfortunate	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
unhappy	NULL
humour	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
eye	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
act	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
the	NULL
appeal	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
already	NULL
recorded	NULL
.	NULL

Barbara	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
lover	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
read	NULL
an	NULL
unlimited	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
novels	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
nearly	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
somebody	NULL
who	NULL
resembled	NULL
the	NULL
indispensable	NULL
hero	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
fierce	NULL
interest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
remembered	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
instant	NULL
how	NULL
often	NULL
in	NULL
books	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
humble	NULL
heroine	NULL
,	NULL
behind	NULL
backs	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
snub	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
wins	NULL
the	NULL
hero	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
sent	NULL
him	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
smiled	NULL
benignantly	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
colour	NULL
flushed	NULL
to	NULL
Barbara	NULL
's	NULL
cheeks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
dull	NULL
and	NULL
fixed	NULL
between	NULL
fright	NULL
and	NULL
spite	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
sudden	NULL
expression	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
straight	NULL
brows	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
intention	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
an	NULL
intention	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
instinct	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
sprang	NULL
into	NULL
life	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
knowing	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
drew	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
breath	NULL
of	NULL
eagerness	NULL
and	NULL
impotence	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
quite	NULL
near	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
doing	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
orders	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
flirting	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
might	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Barbara	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
hungry	NULL
schoolboy	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
tempting	NULL
apple	NULL
just	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
reach	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
suitor	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
pure	NULL
a	NULL
delight	NULL
to	NULL
tear	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
golden	NULL
apple	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tread	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
trample	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
nothing	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
good	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
six	NULL
places	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
touched	NULL
Barbara	NULL
's	NULL
shoulder	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL
with	NULL
me	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
you	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
loud	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
crimson	NULL
countenance	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
secret	NULL
thoughts	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
written	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
guilty	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
these	NULL
were	NULL
eyes	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
utterly	NULL
destitute	NULL
of	NULL
expression	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
pleased	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
their	NULL
owner	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
just	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
experience	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stumbled	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
awkward	NULL
motion	NULL
natural	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
shyness	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
temper	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
temperament	NULL
united	NULL
to	NULL
produce	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
all	NULL
but	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
foot	NULL
through	NULL
Miss	NULL
Brown	NULL
's	NULL
delicate	NULL
skirt	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
neither	NULL
the	NULL
natural	NULL
disposition	NULL
nor	NULL
the	NULL
acquired	NULL
grace	NULL
which	NULL
can	NULL
carry	NULL
off	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
trifling	NULL
offences	NULL
against	NULL
society	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
beside	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
owned	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
thrill	NULL
of	NULL
curiosity	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
?	NULL

A	NULL
girl	NULL
with	NULL
splendid	NULL
black	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
brows	NULL
as	NULL
level	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
line	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
intense	NULL
eyes	NULL
which	NULL
looked	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
oblique	NULL
under	NULL
that	NULL
straight	NULL
bar	NULL
of	NULL
shadow	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
dress	NULL
was	NULL
limp	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
figure	NULL
as	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
passed	NULL
over	NULL
even	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
evening	NULL
party	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
flushed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
lit	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
excitement	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
survey	NULL
everybody	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
defiant	NULL
look	NULL
which	NULL

awkwardness	NULL

standing	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
conspicuous	NULL
position	NULL

where	NULL
everybody	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL

Most	NULL
people	NULL
concluded	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
Italian	NULL
whom	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
picked	NULL
up	NULL
somewhere	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
travels	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Mr	NULL

he	NULL
stopped	NULL
short	NULL
altogether	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
occupation	NULL
which	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
allotted	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
drew	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL

seen	NULL
the	NULL

somewhere	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
shabby	NULL
bonnet	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
even	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
learned	NULL
in	NULL
female	NULL
apparel	NULL
to	NULL
observe	NULL
the	NULL
limpness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
dress	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
preface	NULL
of	NULL
curiosity	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
been	NULL
foreseen	NULL
by	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
paused	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
pretence	NULL
of	NULL
selecting	NULL
her	NULL
music	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
:	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
most	NULL
persons	NULL
of	NULL
elevated	NULL
aims	NULL

was	NULL
content	NULL
to	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
success	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
people	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
doing	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
voices	NULL
rose	NULL
,	NULL
bursting	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
astonished	NULL
community	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
revelation	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
nobody	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
members	NULL
of	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
dinner-party	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
heard	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
sing	NULL

much	NULL
less	NULL
her	NULL
companion	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
account	NULL
which	NULL
these	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
had	NULL
carried	NULL
home	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
wives	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
generally	NULL
pooh-poohed	NULL

put	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

this	NULL

Mrs	NULL

as	NULL

Mr	NULL

broke	NULL
a	NULL

clean	NULL
off	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
most	NULL
interesting	NULL
moment	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
impossible	NULL

record	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
sang	NULL

for	NULL
those	NULL
events	NULL

as	NULL
everybody	NULL

happened	NULL
a	NULL

the	NULL
chances	NULL

that	NULL
the	NULL

forgotten	NULL
the	NULL

which	NULL
made	NULL
so	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
an	NULL
impression	NULL
on	NULL

inhabitants	NULL
of	NULL
Grange	NULL

The	NULL
applause	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
performance	NULL
was	NULL
received	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
length	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL

Barbara	NULL

for	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL

ever	NULL

flushed	NULL

shone	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
more	NULL
calmly	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
knowing	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL

and	NULL
accordingly	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
surprised	NULL
when	NULL
people	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
remarkable	NULL

She	NULL
consented	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
urgent	NULL
persuasion	NULL

to	NULL
repeat	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
verse	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
duet	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL

was	NULL
smilingly	NULL
obdurate	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Almost	NULL

said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
magnificent	NULL
depreciation	NULL
of	NULL

"	NULL
Perhaps	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
attend	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
guests	NULL

but	NULL
she	NULL
left	NULL
Barbara	NULL
still	NULL

over	NULL
her	NULL
limp	NULL

all	NULL

Fortunately	NULL

for	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
Barbara	NULL
's	NULL
pride	NULL

her	NULL
shyness	NULL
prevented	NULL
her	NULL

feast	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
Barbara	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
gifted	NULL
in	NULL
talk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
defiant	NULL

then	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
blazing	NULL
with	NULL

she	NULL

as	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Mr	NULL

had	NULL
a	NULL
weakness	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
contralto	NULL

While	NULL
this	NULL

Miss	NULL

this	NULL
idea	NULL
struck	NULL
her	NULL

made	NULL

calculation	NULL

who	NULL
Dr	NULL

what	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

not	NULL
deceive	NULL

that	NULL
Mr	NULL

over	NULL

they	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
gone	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
that	NULL

unduly	NULL
flattered	NULL

Mr	NULL

happened	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

her	NULL

reached	NULL
the	NULL

receiving	NULL
the	NULL
natural	NULL
homage	NULL
of	NULL
mankind	NULL
on	NULL
several	NULL
clearly-defined	NULL
occasions	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
case	NULL
had	NULL
various	NULL
features	NULL
peculiar	NULL
to	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
prevented	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
from	NULL
crushing	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bud	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
cousin	NULL

ill-fated	NULL

had	NULL

consider	NULL

the	NULL
first	NULL
place	NULL

her	NULL
mission	NULL

Carlingford	NULL

was	NULL
more	NULL
important	NULL

anything	NULL

though	NULL
Miss	NULL

had	NULL
vowed	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
reorganisation	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
delicious	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL

make	NULL
game	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL

kindness	NULL

is	NULL
again	NULL

felt	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL

would	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

"	NULL

And	NULL
Barbara	NULL
crimsoned	NULL
higher	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
held	NULL
Rose	NULL
fast	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
arm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
attention	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
visible	NULL
and	NULL
indeed	NULL
tangible	NULL
signs	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
elegant	NULL
apparition	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
underbred	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Rose	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
gentlewoman	NULL
born	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
horror	NULL
unspeakable	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
bad	NULL
manners	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
movement	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
to	NULL
address	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
pretty	NULL
gray	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
Rose	NULL
lifted	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
straightforward	NULL
surprise	NULL
and	NULL
inquiry	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
retire	NULL
so	NULL
hastily	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
again	NULL
more	NULL
respectfully	NULL
than	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pursued	NULL
his	NULL
walk	NULL
along	NULL
Grove	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
ulterior	NULL
intention	NULL
in	NULL
visiting	NULL
that	NULL
humble	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
held	NULL
Rose	NULL
faster	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
almost	NULL
pinched	NULL
her	NULL
arm	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
listen	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
exultant	NULL
whisper	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
thinks	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
paying	NULL
her	NULL
attention	NULL

"	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
took	NULL
to	NULL
being	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
conferred	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
contralto	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
moment	NULL
a	NULL
palpable	NULL
injury	NULL

grievance	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-master	NULL
's	NULL
daughter	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
looking	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
several	NULL
years	NULL

her	NULL
life	NULL

And	NULL
naturally	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
thinking	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL

green	NULL
shadows	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL

deprived	NULL

on	NULL
her	NULL
reflections	NULL

had	NULL
she	NULL
seen	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL

The	NULL

that	NULL

genius	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
altogether	NULL
overstep	NULL
them	NULL

And	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
still	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
was	NULL
paying	NULL
her	NULL
attention	NULL

The	NULL
second	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
Thursday	NULL
evenings	NULL
found	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
secure	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
more	NULL
anxious	NULL
than	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
former	NULL
occasion	NULL

The	NULL
charm	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
novelty	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL

and	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
quite	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
subjects	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
sense	NULL
to	NULL
recognise	NULL
all	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL

them	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
counts	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
in	NULL
confidence	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL

Last	NULL
Thursday	NULL
they	NULL
wanted	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

giving	NULL
a	NULL

pressure	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL

at	NULL

nevertheless	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
watched	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
grandmotherly	NULL
interest	NULL

was	NULL
comforted	NULL

perceive	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

felt	NULL
instinctively	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL

was	NULL
doing	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
favourite	NULL
's	NULL
arm	NULL
in	NULL
hers	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
upstairs	NULL

gave	NULL
Mr	NULL

a	NULL

opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL

in	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

what	NULL
is	NULL

The	NULL
cause	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
exclamation	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
universal	NULL
hum	NULL
and	NULL
rustle	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL

voices	NULL

and	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL

when	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
companion	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
themselves	NULL
lost	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
laughing	NULL
crowd	NULL

which	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
refuge	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
landing	NULL

There	NULL
is	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

everybody	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
is	NULL
here	NULL

Do	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
room	NULL
for	NULL
us	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL

"	NULL
cried	NULL
this	NULL
overplus	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
enviable	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
certainly	NULL
was	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
standing	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
stairs	NULL
,	NULL
scarcely	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
penetrate	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
throng	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
guests	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
self-possession	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
forsake	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
supreme	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
grasped	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
once	NULL
again	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
significant	NULL
gesture	NULL
which	NULL
pleased	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
but	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
only	NULL
_	NULL
confidante	NULL
_	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
brilliant	NULL

perilous	NULL
undertaking	NULL

_	NULL
They	NULL
_	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
in	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
come	NULL
upstairs	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
whether	NULL
the	NULL
faint	NULL
inflection	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
meant	NULL
exultation	NULL
or	NULL
disappointment	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
friend	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
changed	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
rightful	NULL
sovereign	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
gay	NULL
but	NULL
disorganised	NULL
dominion	NULL
where	NULL
her	NULL
subjects	NULL
attended	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
re-established	NULL
order	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
important	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
girls	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
that	NULL
can	NULL
talk	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
my	NULL
principles	NULL
always	NULL
to	NULL
flirt	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
happened	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
,	NULL
ignorant	NULL
people	NULL
laughed	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
_	NULL
bon	NULL
mot	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
needless	NULL
to	NULL
inform	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
intelligent	NULL
persons	NULL
who	NULL
understand	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL
means	NULL
a	NULL
_	NULL
bon	NULL
mot	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
expressed	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
convictions	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
sincerity	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
Thursday	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
brilliant	NULL
and	NULL
infinitely	NULL
more	NULL
gratifying	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
furniture	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
to	NULL
criticise	NULL
this	NULL
new	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
entertainment	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sincerest	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
enjoying	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
moments	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
egotism	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
conveys	NULL
the	NULL
highest	NULL
compliment	NULL
that	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
paid	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
minds	NULL
which	NULL
take	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
rule	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
amuse	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
drawback	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
show	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
modesty	NULL
and	NULL
reticence	NULL
as	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
former	NULL
occasion	NULL
.	NULL

Far	NULL
from	NULL
being	NULL
sensibly	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
prudent	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
on	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
first	NULL
Thursday	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
forgot	NULL
herself	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
occupy	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
's	NULL
valuable	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
employed	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
usefully	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
sang	NULL
by	NULL
herself	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
brought	NULL
some	NULL
music	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
unseen	NULL
by	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
kept	NULL
her	NULL
seat	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
stool	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
ever	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
detaining	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
an	NULL
exhibition	NULL
of	NULL
herself	NULL
:	NULL
for	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
received	NULL
one	NULL
good	NULL
gift	NULL
from	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
refused	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
talk	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
arrested	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
many	NULL
occupations	NULL
,	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
protégée	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
rising	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
stopped	NULL
quite	NULL
short	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
anxiety	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
touching	NULL
to	NULL
behold	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
jealousy	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
rival	NULL
cantatrice	NULL
which	NULL
inspired	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
countenance	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
far	NULL
broader	NULL
and	NULL
grander	NULL
anxiety	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
accomplished	NULL
statesman	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
sees	NULL
a	NULL
rash	NULL
and	NULL
untrained	NULL
hand	NULL
meddling	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
most	NULL
delicate	NULL
machinery	NULL
.	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
ignored	NULL
everything	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
--	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
's	NULL
attentions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
merely	NULL
secondary	NULL
and	NULL
personal	NULL
emotion	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
these	NULL
details	NULL
were	NULL
swallowed	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fear	NULL
that	NULL
Barbara	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
acquit	NULL
herself	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
credit	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
acquit	NULL
herself	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
sing	NULL
well	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
sing	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
more	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
finger	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
pulse	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
community	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
listened	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

Fortunately	NULL
,	NULL
things	NULL
went	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
well	NULL
that	NULL
Barbara	NULL
sang	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
best	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
kept	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
prestige	NULL
:	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
different	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
particular	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
unluckily	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
contralto	NULL
knew	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
many	NULL
songs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
showed	NULL
no	NULL
inclination	NULL
to	NULL
stop	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
remained	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
bold	NULL
_	NULL
coup	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
executed	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
natural	NULL
coolness	NULL
and	NULL
success	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
dear	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
putting	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
singer	NULL
's	NULL
shoulders	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
finished	NULL
her	NULL
strain	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
to-night	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
will	NULL
take	NULL
you	NULL
downstairs	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
you	NULL
a	NULL
cup	NULL

Thus	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
proved	NULL
herself	NULL
capable	NULL

preferring	NULL
her	NULL
great	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
personal	NULL
sentiments	NULL

which	NULL
is	NULL
generally	NULL
considered	NULL
next	NULL

impossible	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
what	NULL
perhaps	NULL
nobody	NULL
else	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL

she	NULL
sent	NULL

at	NULL
that	NULL

Barbara	NULL

blazing	NULL
out	NULL

This	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
ignorance	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
preventing	NULL
her	NULL
Evening	NULL

losing	NULL
its	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL

she	NULL
proved	NULL
herself	NULL
capable	NULL

the	NULL
exertion	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
hopeless	NULL
to	NULL
attempt	NULL

describe	NULL
the	NULL
indignation	NULL

she	NULL

encouragingly	NULL

it	NULL

Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL

took	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
tea	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
returned	NULL
upstairs	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
another	NULL
pause	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
landing	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
kept	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
lively	NULL
stream	NULL
of	NULL
young	NULL
people	NULL
coming	NULL
and	NULL
going	NULL
.	NULL

Barbara	NULL
had	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
experience	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
weak	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL

lingered	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL

himself	NULL

to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL

his	NULL

were	NULL

a	NULL
very	NULL
different	NULL
description	NULL

For	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
owned	NULL
that	NULL
Barbara	NULL
's	NULL
admirer	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
but	NULL
be	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
magnanimity	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
return	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
present	NULL
companion	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
watched	NULL
and	NULL
noted	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
of	NULL
comment	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
more	NULL
amusing	NULL
than	NULL
agreeable	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
take	NULL
Barbara	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
discomfited	NULL
air	NULL
which	NULL
tickled	NULL
the	NULL
spectators	NULL
beyond	NULL
measure	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
evil	NULL
luck	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
pause	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
landing	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
watch	NULL
his	NULL
opportunity	NULL
of	NULL
entering	NULL
unobserved	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
to	NULL
encounter	NULL
the	NULL
returning	NULL
couple	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
met	NULL
full	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
paces	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
--	NULL
exactly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
Mr	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
wedding	NULL
visit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
unfortunate	NULL
gentleman	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
looked	NULL
more	NULL
utterly	NULL
disconcerted	NULL
and	NULL
guilty	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
convicted	NULL
of	NULL
putting	NULL
the	NULL
spoons	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
designs	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
silver	NULL
tea-service	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
seat	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
companion	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
haste	NULL
possible	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
lingering	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
anticipated	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
off	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
instant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hid	NULL
himself	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
criminal	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
talking	NULL
together	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
were	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
hopeless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whom	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
tolerated	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
partly	NULL
because	NULL
their	NULL
wives	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
excusable	NULL
weakness	NULL
,	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
bringing	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
partly	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
foil	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
brighter	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
served	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
butt	NULL
when	NULL
anybody	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
witty	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
effort	NULL
to	NULL
recall	NULL
the	NULL
truant	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
ranks	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Incurables	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
vengeance	NULL

took	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
desertion	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
leave	NULL

her	NULL

was	NULL
also	NULL
going	NULL

the	NULL
benevolent	NULL
grace	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
acknowledged	NULL
sovereign	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
reflections	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
alone	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
domains	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
nature	NULL
very	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
reflections	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
giver	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
feast	NULL
is	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
when	NULL
all	NULL
is	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
everybody	NULL
is	NULL
aware	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
selfish	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
personal	NULL
pleasure	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
any	NULL
scheme	NULL
of	NULL
worldly	NULL
ambition	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
moved	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
such	NULL
motives	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
natural	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
All	NULL
is	NULL
vanity	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
should	NULL
occur	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
weary	NULL
entertainer	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
withered	NULL
flowers	NULL
and	NULL
extinguished	NULL
lights	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
ideas	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
common	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
enlightened	NULL
conceptions	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
false	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
second	NULL
Thursday	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
superior	NULL
intelligence	NULL
like	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
could	NULL
permit	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
any	NULL
jealousy	NULL
of	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
vain	NULL
to	NULL
deny	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
_	NULL
surprised	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
knows	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
will	NULL
acknowledge	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
was	NULL
implied	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
confession	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
triumphed	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
weakness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
triumphantly	NULL
proved	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
estimate	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
importance	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
went	NULL
far	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
influence	NULL
of	NULL
mere	NULL
personal	NULL
feeling	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
these	NULL
circumstances	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
could	NULL
contemplate	NULL
her	NULL
withered	NULL
flowers	NULL
with	NULL
perfect	NULL
calmness	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
vanity	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
accomplishing	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
public	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
unspeakable	NULL
consolation	NULL
of	NULL
knowing	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
proved	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL
comfort	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
dear	NULL
papa	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Doctor	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
looking	NULL
on	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
half-amused	NULL
consciousness	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
assistance	NULL
was	NULL
totally	NULL
unnecessary	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
gradually	NULL
veered	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
thence	NULL
had	NULL
finally	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
escape	NULL
downstairs	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
beloved	NULL
library	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
security	NULL
and	NULL
tranquillity	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
established	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
undisturbed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
gay	NULL
storm	NULL
that	NULL
raged	NULL
outside	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
charm	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
retirement	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
rubbed	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
listens	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
howling	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
doors	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
shelter	NULL
and	NULL
comfort	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
sensation	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
accomplished	NULL
her	NULL
filial	NULL
duties	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
effective	NULL
manner	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
extent	NULL
justified	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
quite	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
nobody	NULL
missed	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
pleasant	NULL
assembly	NULL
upstairs	NULL
.	NULL

Chapter	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
reign	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
became	NULL
gradually	NULL
established	NULL
and	NULL
confirmed	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
unnecessary	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
into	NULL
detail	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
redouble	NULL
instances	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
singular	NULL
genius	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
itself	NULL
so	NULL
fully	NULL
felt	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
furthest	NULL
limits	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
even	NULL
indeed	NULL
extended	NULL
those	NULL
limits	NULL
miraculously	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
magic	NULL
circle	NULL
of	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
powers	NULL
beguiled	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
Powells	NULL
and	NULL
Sir	NULL
John	NULL
Richmond	NULL
's	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
everybody	NULL

fully	NULL
entitled	NULL

be	NULL
called	NULL
county	NULL

came	NULL
only	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Thursdays	NULL
when	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
moonlight	NULL
to	NULL
light	NULL
them	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
wondered	NULL
at	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
county	NULL
society	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
parts	NULL
was	NULL
unusually	NULL
heavy	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
period	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
even	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
lodgment	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
enemy	NULL
's	NULL
country	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
capture	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
John	NULL
Brown	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
big	NULL
old	NULL
house	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
town	NULL
_	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
George	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
laughed	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
cynical	NULL
way	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
pretensions	NULL
of	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
ladies	NULL
admitted	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
influence	NULL
over	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
slightly	NULL
contemptuous	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
perhaps	NULL
envious	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
extent	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
gift	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
everybody	NULL
knows	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
requires	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
to	NULL
satisfy	NULL
the	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
will	NULL
only	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
confessed	NULL
frankly	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL

"	NULL
For	NULL
you	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL

apology	NULL

"	NULL
So	NULL
many	NULL

"	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
added	NULL
,	NULL
fluttering	NULL
her	NULL
maiden	NULL
plumes	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
disdainful	NULL
pity	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Centum	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL

who	NULL
were	NULL
well	NULL
aware	NULL

both	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
hearts	NULL

that	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
dinners	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
selfish	NULL
mates	NULL
would	NULL
find	NULL
infinite	NULL
objections	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Thursday	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
an	NULL
institution	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
condescension	NULL
and	NULL
superiority	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
frankness	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
never	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL

them	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
said	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
matrons	NULL
found	NULL
themselves	NULL
worsted	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
_	NULL
Them	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
community	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
exerted	NULL
herself	NULL
so	NULL
successfully	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
proved	NULL
more	NULL
completely	NULL
the	NULL
disinterested	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
proceedings	NULL
than	NULL
her	NULL
behaviour	NULL
in	NULL
respect	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
the	NULL
bold	NULL
and	NULL
decisive	NULL
action	NULL
taken	NULL
by	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
occasion	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
flirtation	NULL
between	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
became	NULL
apparent	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
misguided	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
frame	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
;	NULL
perhaps	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
admiration	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
magnanimity	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
attracted	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
indifference	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
known	NULL
and	NULL
ascertained	NULL
weakness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
perhaps	NULL
also	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
was	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
's	NULL
opinion	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
reason	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
whatever	NULL
the	NULL
cause	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
behaved	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
profoundest	NULL
decorum	NULL
for	NULL
several	NULL
weeks	NULL
in	NULL
succession	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
treated	NULL
the	NULL
contralto	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
overwhelming	NULL
politeness	NULL
as	NULL
reduced	NULL
poor	NULL
Barbara	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
momentary	NULL
exultation	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
humiliation	NULL
and	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
was	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
right	NULL
hand	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
short	NULL
but	NULL
virtuous	NULL
period	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fully	NULL
justified	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
opinion	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
founded	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
upon	NULL
reflection	NULL
and	NULL
experience	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
can	NULL
flirt	NULL
is	NULL
next	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
indispensable	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
leader	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
under	NULL
efficient	NULL
discipline	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
carrying	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
grand	NULL
conception	NULL
.	NULL

Everything	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
delightfully	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
interval	NULL
lasted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
herself	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
disdain	NULL
to	NULL
recompense	NULL
her	NULL
faithful	NULL
assistant	NULL
by	NULL
bestowing	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
various	NULL
little	NULL
privileges	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
naturally	NULL
appertain	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
subject	NULL
whose	NULL
place	NULL
is	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
steps	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
throne	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
confidence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
extent	NULL
a	NULL
party	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
large	NULL
and	NULL
philanthropic	NULL
projects	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
accepted	NULL
a	NULL
suggestion	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
true	NULL
candour	NULL
and	NULL
modesty	NULL
which	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
accompany	NULL
administrative	NULL
genius	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
this	NULL
continued	NULL
,	NULL
kind	NULL
old	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
kept	NULL
caressing	NULL
them	NULL
both	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
old-womanly	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
even	NULL
went	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
"	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
grandson	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
afternoon	NULL
drive	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
brougham	NULL
past	NULL
his	NULL
house	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
genial	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
prospective	NULL
property	NULL
through	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
wonderfully	NULL
pleasant	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
known	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
connections	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
everybody	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Cavendishes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
content	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
hard	NULL
indeed	NULL
to	NULL
please	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
"	NULL
take	NULL
off	NULL
"	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
justly	NULL
remarked	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
Archbishop	NULL
of	NULL
Canterbury	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
Virgin	NULL
Mary	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
fear	NULL
but	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
once	NULL
married	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
soon	NULL
bring	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
senses	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
Mr	NULL
Chiltern	NULL
grew	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
feeble	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
scarcely	NULL
once	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fortnight	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
Parliament	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
interests	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
borough	NULL
dreadful	NULL
to	NULL
contemplate	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
thus	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
interests	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
that	NULL
ladies	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
eligible	NULL
for	NULL
election	NULL
under	NULL
such	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
carried	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
little	NULL
canvass	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
M.P.	NULL
All	NULL
this	NULL
lasted	NULL
,	NULL
alas	NULL
!	NULL

only	NULL
too	NULL
short	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
level	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
and	NULL
flashing	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
magnificent	NULL
voice	NULL
of	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
reassert	NULL
their	NULL
ancient	NULL
power	NULL

Whatever	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
Cavendishes	NULL
in	NULL

this	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
had	NULL
paid	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
naturally	NULL
entertained	NULL
dreams	NULL

the	NULL
wildest	NULL

most	NULL
magnificent	NULL
character	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
riding	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
carriage	NULL

as	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
herself	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL

and	NULL
dressing	NULL
as	NULL
nobody	NULL
else	NULL
dressed	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
becoming	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
lady	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
eclipsing	NULL
utterly	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
impertinent	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
patronise	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
Barbara	NULL
's	NULL
delicious	NULL
dreams	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
whole	NULL
fortnight	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
down	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
delivered	NULL
himself	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
service	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

Barbara	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
intellect	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
heart	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
vital	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
inclinations	NULL
and	NULL
passions	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
set	NULL
in	NULL
motion	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
intense	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
self-regard	NULL
which	NULL
belongs	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
organisations	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
she	NULL
arrayed	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
simple	NULL
muslin	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
fascination	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
will	NULL
and	NULL
fixed	NULL
purpose	NULL
can	NULL
add	NULL
to	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
excitement	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
opportunity	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
advancement	NULL
and	NULL
grandeur	NULL
depended	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
night	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
level	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
flushing	NULL
cheeks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
black	NULL
intense	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
rose	NULL
almost	NULL
into	NULL
positive	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nobody	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
to	NULL
compare	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
sing	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
memorable	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Miss	NULL
Browns	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
example	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
pretty	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
Lydia	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
afterwards	NULL
married	NULL
to	NULL
young	NULL
Richmond	NULL
,	NULL
Sir	NULL
John	NULL
's	NULL
eldest	NULL
son	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
much	NULL
_	NULL
nicer	NULL
_	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
far	NULL
more	NULL
engaging	NULL
than	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
a	NULL
lady	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
her	NULL
determination	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
enough	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
glow	NULL
and	NULL
passion	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
coarser	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
sing	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
struck	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
appearance	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
new	NULL
dress	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
white	NULL
muslin	NULL
like	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
priestess	NULL
inspired	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
approaching	NULL
crisis	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sweeping	NULL
forward	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
victim	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sacrificed	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
the	NULL
victim	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
was	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
being	NULL
ready	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
thinking	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
concluded	NULL
that	NULL
prudence	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
other	NULL
reasonable	NULL
sentiment	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
many	NULL
ways	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
thing	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
persuade	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
to	NULL
preside	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
share	NULL
his	NULL
fortunes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
certainty	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
habitually	NULL
prone	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
off	NULL
after	NULL
everything	NULL
that	NULL
attracted	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
direct	NULL
opposition	NULL
to	NULL
prudence	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
inclination	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
shared	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
everybody	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
ruined	NULL
poor	NULL
Mr	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
's	NULL
fortunes	NULL
by	NULL
"	NULL
taking	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
very	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
rich	NULL
uncle	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
family	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
wise	NULL
resolution	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
path	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
contralto	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
followed	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
confident	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
determination	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
allowed	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
her	NULL
eye	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
rash	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Barbara	NULL
flashed	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
passed	NULL
a	NULL
blaze	NULL
of	NULL
intense	NULL
oblique	NULL
lightning	NULL
from	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
level	NULL
brows	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
straight	NULL
black	NULL
line	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
look	NULL
oblique	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
result	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
anticipated	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

Barbara	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
richer	NULL
voice	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
but	NULL
obliterated	NULL
even	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
too	NULL
was	NULL
singing	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
poor	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
again	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
snare	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
very	NULL
night	NULL
the	NULL
flirtation	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
created	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
talk	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
resumed	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
energy	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Barbara	NULL
took	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
place	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sang	NULL
song	NULL
after	NULL
song	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
intoxication	NULL
of	NULL
triumph	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
visible	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
portion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
guests	NULL
who	NULL
crowded	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
was	NULL
soon	NULL
so	NULL
visible	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
became	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hero	NULL
wavered	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
excitement	NULL
was	NULL
kept	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
weeks	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
nobody	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
any	NULL
reasonable	NULL
doubt	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
while	NULL
this	NULL
process	NULL
of	NULL
seduction	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
revealed	NULL
itself	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
its	NULL

grandeur	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

to	NULL
him	NULL

Whether	NULL
this	NULL
singular	NULL
self-denial	NULL
cost	NULL
Miss	NULL

any	NULL

sufferings	NULL
,	NULL
nobody	NULL

Mrs	NULL

was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL

dinner	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL

her	NULL

and	NULL
after	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
eaten	NULL
her	NULL
dinner	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
upstairs	NULL
and	NULL
show	NULL
herself	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
perfect	NULL
voice	NULL

and	NULL
neither	NULL
lost	NULL
her	NULL
colour	NULL

nor	NULL

any	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
sole	NULL
and	NULL
sympathising	NULL
counsellor	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
experience	NULL
in	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
became	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
opinion	NULL
that	NULL
such	NULL
sense	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
but	NULL
superhuman	NULL
.	NULL

Meantime	NULL
the	NULL
tide	NULL
of	NULL
public	NULL
opinion	NULL
ran	NULL
very	NULL
high	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
against	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
popular	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Miss	NULL
Browns	NULL

or	NULL
a	NULL
niece	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
's	NULL

or	NULL
indeed	NULL
anybody	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL

might	NULL

it	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-master	NULL
's	NULL
daughters	NULL
!	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
person	NULL
indifferent	NULL
was	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
better	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
thoughtless	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL

and	NULL
liked	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
transfer	NULL
those	NULL
attentions	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
paying	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
quarter	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
harmless	NULL
amusement	NULL
with	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
handsome	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
by	NULL
times	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
obdurate	NULL
stupidity	NULL
which	NULL
captivated	NULL
the	NULL
mimic	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
anything	NULL
coming	NULL
of	NULL
_	NULL
that	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
rejected	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
simplicity	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
consistent	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
insight	NULL
into	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
's	NULL
weaknesses	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
Barbara	NULL
's	NULL
stolid	NULL
defiant	NULL
look	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
square	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
give	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
oblique	NULL
gleam	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
perfect	NULL
skill	NULL
and	NULL
mastery	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
be	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
stolid	NULL
as	NULL
Barbara	NULL
in	NULL
respect	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
consequences	NULL
which	NULL
must	NULL
follow	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
against	NULL
so	NULL
unexceptionable	NULL
a	NULL
match	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
accordingly	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
turned	NULL
aside	NULL
in	NULL
so	NULL
perfectly	NULL
legitimate	NULL
a	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
repertory	NULL
a	NULL
sketch	NULL
of	NULL
Barbara	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
yielding	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
's	NULL
entreaties	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
seated	NULL
herself	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
"	NULL
for	NULL
just	NULL
one	NULL
song	NULL
"	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
being	NULL
perfectly	NULL
successful	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
representation	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
care	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
hero	NULL
was	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
experienced	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
matters	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
proper	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
the	NULL
affair	NULL
progressed	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
far	NULL
more	NULL
serious	NULL
consequences	NULL
than	NULL
these	NULL
thoughtless	NULL
persons	NULL
dreamed	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

Barbara	NULL
ascended	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
heights	NULL
of	NULL
exultation	NULL
and	NULL
enchantment	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
even	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
grateful	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
thus	NULL
distinguished	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
feared	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
in	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
unlimited	NULL
millinery	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
than	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
these	NULL
details	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
perhaps	NULL
contemplated	NULL
by	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
devoted	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
handsome	NULL
contralto	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
dream	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Barbara	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wedding	NULL
breakfast	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
orange	NULL
blossoms	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
of	NULL
furnishing	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
handsomer	NULL
than	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
giving	NULL
parties	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
real	NULL
parties	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
mere	NULL
Thursdays	NULL
.	NULL

None	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
imaginations	NULL
occupied	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
followed	NULL
Barbara	NULL
's	NULL
glowing	NULL
cheeks	NULL
and	NULL
flashing	NULL
eyes	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
undoing	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
it	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
occasions	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
determination	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
important	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
taking	NULL
everything	NULL
into	NULL
consideration	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
fortunate	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
affections	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
engaged	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
behaved	NULL
as	NULL
nobody	NULL
else	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
was	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
behaving	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
few	NULL
people	NULL
anywhere	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
's	NULL
admiring	NULL
belief	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
vulgar	NULL
antagonist	NULL
like	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
to	NULL
touch	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
lunch	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
practising	NULL
duets	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
was	NULL
angelical	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
brought	NULL
the	NULL
tears	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
domestic	NULL
traitor	NULL
whom	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
thus	NULL
contrived	NULL
to	NULL
warm	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
magnanimous	NULL
bosom	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sometimes	NULL
so	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
spite	NULL
and	NULL
disappointment	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
neither	NULL
eat	NULL
her	NULL
lunch	NULL
nor	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
singing	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
dearest	NULL
climax	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
triumph	NULL
was	NULL
wanting	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
notice	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
taking	NULL
any	NULL
notice	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
sweeter	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
friendly	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
serene	NULL
unconsciousness	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
so	NULL
afraid	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
caught	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
feel	NULL
clear	NULL
in	NULL
your	NULL
lower	NULL
notes	NULL

we	NULL
can	NULL
pass	NULL
over	NULL
this	NULL
passage	NULL

you	NULL
know	NULL

for	NULL
to-day	NULL

You	NULL
must	NULL
see	NULL
papa	NULL
before	NULL
you	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
order	NULL
you	NULL
something	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
take	NULL
care	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Barbara	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
eaten	NULL
her	NULL
fingers	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
gloves	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
kept	NULL
biting	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
vexation	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
jealous	NULL

the	NULL
victory	NULL
was	NULL

half	NULL
a	NULL
victory	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL

Chapter	NULL
XIV	NULL
_	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
went	NULL
through	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
preliminary	NULL
stages	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
succeeded	NULL
finally	NULL
in	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
triumph	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
certainly	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
defeat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
humbling	NULL
defeat	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
anybody	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
too	NULL
sensible	NULL
to	NULL
deceive	NULL
herself	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
paying	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
withdrawn	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
open	NULL
manner	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
trying	NULL
an	NULL
accident	NULL
as	NULL
can	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

Fortunately	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
affections	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
engaged	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
apart	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
affections	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
other	NULL
sentiments	NULL
which	NULL
demand	NULL
consideration	NULL
.	NULL

Everybody	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
paying	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
attention	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
required	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
delicate	NULL
skill	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
through	NULL
it	NULL
successfully	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
circumstances	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
difficult	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL

had	NULL
been	NULL
perfectly	NULL
sincere	NULL

natural	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL

proceedings	NULL

constantly	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
organisation	NULL

welfare	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
kingdom	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
what	NULL
people	NULL
took	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
cleverest	NULL
calculation	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
reality	NULL
a	NULL
succession	NULL
of	NULL
happy	NULL

by	NULL

of	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sovereignty	NULL
of	NULL
true	NULL
genius	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
please	NULL
everybody	NULL
by	NULL
having	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
little	NULL
victory	NULL
is	NULL
almost	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
nature	NULL
that	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
expand	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
stimulus	NULL
of	NULL
victory	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
reformer	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
stage	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL

that	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
last	NULL

this	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
natural	NULL
prevision	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
ruling	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
foreseen	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
shape	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
feared	NULL
defeat	NULL

if	NULL
a	NULL
nature	NULL
so	NULL
full	NULL

resources	NULL
could	NULL
ever	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL

fear	NULL

that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
breakdown	NULL

when	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

the	NULL
sudden	NULL

a	NULL
rival	NULL

in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
with	NULL
superior	NULL
powers	NULL

though	NULL
the	NULL

was	NULL

a	NULL
dim	NULL

improbable	NULL
danger	NULL

the	NULL
first	NULL
was	NULL

and	NULL
might	NULL

Miss	NULL

was	NULL
much	NULL

happened	NULL

To	NULL

out	NULL
of	NULL

Grange	NULL

these	NULL

averted	NULL
on	NULL

Not	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
vulgar	NULL
and	NULL
likely	NULL
manner	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
trial	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
strength	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

her	NULL

full	NULL
in	NULL

an	NULL
evening	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
imitated	NULL
on	NULL
every	NULL

at	NULL
that	NULL

when	NULL
an	NULL
ordinary	NULL

would	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
turned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gone	NULL
wild	NULL
with	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
success	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
suddenly	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
dragon	NULL
approaching	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL

do	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL

without	NULL

Carlingford	NULL
knowing	NULL

it	NULL

at	NULL
that	NULL
epoch	NULL
of	NULL
intoxication	NULL

triumph	NULL
the	NULL
danger	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
sudden	NULL
,	NULL
appalling	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
unlooked	NULL
for	NULL

If	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
staggered	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
encounter	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
showed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
met	NULL
the	NULL
difficulty	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
mettle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
scorned	NULL
to	NULL
flinch	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
summer	NULL
weather	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
final	NULL
day	NULL
arrived	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
forgot	NULL
himself	NULL
altogether	NULL

and	NULL
went	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
insidious	NULL
enemy	NULL
whom	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
nourishing	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
bosom	NULL
.	NULL

Fifty	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
upon	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
watching	NULL
her	NULL
conduct	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
critical	NULL
moment	NULL
--	NULL
fifty	NULL
ears	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
strain	NULL
to	NULL
divine	NULL
her	NULL
sentiments	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL

and	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
some	NULL
intonation	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
betray	NULL
her	NULL
consciousness	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL

But	NULL
if	NULL
Miss	NULL

fitly	NULL
discharged	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL

have	NULL
no	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
divining	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
curiosity	NULL

got	NULL
no	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
from	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

Many	NULL
people	NULL
even	NULL
supposed	NULL
she	NULL

not	NULL

anything	NULL

her	NULL

just	NULL

that	NULL
Barbara	NULL

all	NULL
flushed	NULL

crimson	NULL

with	NULL
her	NULL

blazing	NULL
under	NULL

stood	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
glow	NULL
of	NULL
triumph	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

with	NULL
Mr	NULL

in	NULL
devoted	NULL
attendance	NULL

yet	NULL
the	NULL

had	NULL
never	NULL
before	NULL

lost	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
sense	NULL

Instead	NULL

fainting	NULL

getting	NULL
pale	NULL

or	NULL
showing	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
symptoms	NULL
of	NULL
violent	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
went	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
airy	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
indirectly	NULL
approaching	NULL
this	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
interest	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
chatted	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ordered	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
chair	NULL
for	NULL
Barbara	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
can	NULL
you	NULL

If	NULL

lose	NULL
her	NULL

what	NULL
should	NULL
we	NULL
all	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
established	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
commodious	NULL
corner	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
left	NULL
them	NULL

"	NULL
Take	NULL

were	NULL
her	NULL
parting	NULL
words	NULL

even	NULL
the	NULL
culprits	NULL
themselves	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
nothing	NULL

stare	NULL
at	NULL
each	NULL

consternation	NULL

shame	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
notice	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
took	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
affronted	NULL

nobody	NULL

when	NULL
Mrs	NULL

offered	NULL
the	NULL
tribute	NULL

her	NULL

it	NULL
has	NULL
already	NULL

"	NULL
Fortunately	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL

no	NULL

that	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
advantage	NULL

then	NULL

as	NULL

there	NULL

before	NULL

before	NULL

The	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
masterly	NULL

on	NULL
this	NULL
occasion	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL

None	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
drew	NULL
a	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
trial	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL

the	NULL
modest	NULL

intense	NULL
gratification	NULL

stood	NULL
the	NULL
test	NULL

diffused	NULL
itself	NULL

there	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL
sacred	NULL
sense	NULL

duty	NULL

the	NULL
high	NULL
aims	NULL
of	NULL
genius	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
attractive	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
well-regulated	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
herself	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
candles	NULL

and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
room	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
acquitted	NULL

satisfactorily	NULL
which	NULL

was	NULL
more	NULL
unlikely	NULL

or	NULL
supposing	NULL
him	NULL

be	NULL
comfortably	NULL
disposed	NULL

nobody	NULL
could	NULL
say	NULL
with	NULL
any	NULL
certainty	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
man	NULL
unknown	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
start	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
and	NULL
gain	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
sweet	NULL
voices	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shopkeepers	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
majority	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
community	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
quite	NULL
outnumbered	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
consoled	NULL
herself	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
meditative	NULL
but	NULL
undaunted	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
maiden	NULL
rest	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
remained	NULL
an	NULL
amused	NULL
spectator	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
chuckled	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
quietly	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
saying	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
anybody	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
turn	NULL
affairs	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Doctor	NULL
knew	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
everybody	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
an	NULL
enthusiast	NULL
in	NULL
favour	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
's	NULL
brother	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
received	NULL
so	NULL
warmly	NULL
into	NULL
society	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Cavendishes	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
being	NULL
Scotch	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
turn	NULL
for	NULL
genealogy	NULL
,	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
description	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
vague	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
events	NULL
there	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
laughed	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
retired	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
daughter	NULL
's	NULL
trial	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Doctor	NULL
possibly	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
professional	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
discipline	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
description	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
useful	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
--	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
slip	NULL
the	NULL
reins	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
control	NULL
of	NULL
affairs	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
skill	NULL
which	NULL
amused	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
abilities	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
himself	NULL
the	NULL
victim	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
always	NULL
unchecked	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
triumphant	NULL
career	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
must	NULL
endure	NULL
like	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
an	NULL
occasional	NULL
defeat	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
been	NULL
really	NULL
worsted	NULL
,	NULL
paternal	NULL
feeling	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
interposed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
would	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
extent	NULL
have	NULL
suffered	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
suffering	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
was	NULL
different	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
nobody	NULL
required	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
suffer	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Doctor	NULL
was	NULL
pleased	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
shown	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
spirit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pleased	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
entirely	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
discomfited	NULL
her	NULL
antagonists	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
the	NULL
tables	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
young	NULL
puppy	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
in	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
confidence	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
withal	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
chuckled	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
secret	NULL
heart	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
event	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
concluded	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
vanquished	NULL
Nancy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
skilful	NULL
jerk	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
reins	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
experienced	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
very	NULL
wisely	NULL
governed	NULL
since	NULL
his	NULL
abdication	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sorry	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
conqueror	NULL
should	NULL
feel	NULL
herself	NULL
human	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
nobody	NULL
except	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
mingled	NULL
rage	NULL
and	NULL
disappointment	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
had	NULL
hoped	NULL
to	NULL
inspire	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
bosom	NULL

and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL

had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Barbara	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
returned	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mingled	NULL
spite	NULL

exultation	NULL
and	NULL
disgust	NULL

which	NULL
filled	NULL
her	NULL

amazement	NULL

This	NULL

place	NULL
in	NULL
Mr	NULL

with	NULL
her	NULL

This	NULL

too	NULL
much	NULL
importance	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

we	NULL

It	NULL

Dr	NULL

permitted	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL

the	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL

nobody	NULL

out	NULL

The	NULL

thought	NULL
it	NULL

serve	NULL
him	NULL
right	NULL

yet	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sufficiently	NULL

Miss	NULL

she	NULL
too	NULL
recognised	NULL
the	NULL
importance	NULL

resolved	NULL

evening	NULL
a	NULL

had	NULL
occupied	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL

the	NULL
possibilities	NULL

put	NULL
on	NULL

for	NULL
Miss	NULL

herself	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

details	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
approaching	NULL
evening	NULL

of	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
more	NULL
distant	NULL

consequently	NULL
less	NULL

,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL

such	NULL
a	NULL

always	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
outlook	NULL

there	NULL
are	NULL
circumstances	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL

is	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
useful	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL

the	NULL
house	NULL

man	NULL

can	NULL
flirt	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL

then	NULL
there	NULL
occurs	NULL
a	NULL

example	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
both	NULL

united	NULL

even	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
modest	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
stupid	NULL
or	NULL
obstinately	NULL
Low-Church	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
despise	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
apparition	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
thus	NULL
suddenly	NULL
blown	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
door	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
seats	NULL
placed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
(	NULL
not	NULL
too	NULL
visibly	NULL

shrouded	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
shrubs	NULL

round	NULL
the	NULL
trunks	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
chose	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
illumination	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
universal	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
tea-garden	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
concentrated	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
spot	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
lime-tree	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
permitted	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
speculate	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
about	NULL
this	NULL
unknown	NULL
hero	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
ask	NULL
herself	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
dark	NULL
or	NULL
fair	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
usage	NULL
of	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
High	NULL
or	NULL
Broad	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
question	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
various	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
hidden	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
surrounding	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
did	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
cheer	NULL
up	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
discouragement	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
supposed	NULL
her	NULL
young	NULL
friend	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
suffering	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
loftier	NULL
expedient	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
way	NULL
than	NULL
Nancy	NULL

something	NULL

then	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
any	NULL
doubt	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL
kindness	NULL
which	NULL
prompted	NULL
both	NULL
suggestions	NULL

,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
what	NULL
people	NULL
do	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
spirit	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
into	NULL
consideration	NULL

most	NULL
justly	NULL
observed	NULL

the	NULL

Mr	NULL

who	NULL
felt	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

difficulty	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL

to	NULL
tell	NULL

a	NULL
little	NULL
ashamed	NULL

came	NULL
late	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL

to	NULL
abridge	NULL
his	NULL
trial	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
habitual	NULL
good-fortune	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
confined	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
necessities	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
involve	NULL
everybody	NULL
opposed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
ceaseless	NULL
ill-luck	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
edifying	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
spectators	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
late	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
guests	NULL
had	NULL
formed	NULL
into	NULL
groups	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
open	NULL
space	NULL
and	NULL
avenue	NULL
of	NULL
approach	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
audience	NULL
,	NULL
thus	NULL
arranged	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
impatient	NULL
and	NULL
unfavourable	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
lingerer	NULL
who	NULL
kept	NULL
them	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
everybody	NULL
ceased	NULL
talking	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
stern	NULL
silence	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
wretched	NULL
culprit	NULL
walked	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
length	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
unoccupied	NULL
space	NULL
which	NULL
exposed	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
unmercifully	NULL
on	NULL
every	NULL
side	NULL

They	NULL
all	NULL
stopped	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
saying	NULL

and	NULL
fixed	NULL
stony	NULL
eyes	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
Ancient	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL

Mr	NULL

narrative	NULL

Everybody	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
entirely	NULL
aware	NULL

the	NULL
supposed	NULL

the	NULL
low	NULL

indeed	NULL

that	NULL
the	NULL

was	NULL

conveyed	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL

time	NULL
a	NULL
confession	NULL

guilt	NULL

a	NULL
storm	NULL
of	NULL
applause	NULL

admiration	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
alarming	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
terrible	NULL

confusion	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
soothing	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL

administered	NULL
punishment	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
annihilating	NULL
kind	NULL

without	NULL

diverging	NULL

the	NULL
perfect	NULL
sweetness	NULL

amiability	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
treat	NULL
all	NULL

father	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
complete	NULL

perfect	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
another	NULL
word	NULL

said	NULL
either	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
committed	NULL
herself	NULL

condescended	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
maiden	NULL
dignity	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
chuckled	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
anticipation	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
supposed	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
enjoyed	NULL

vindication	NULL

his	NULL

The	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
victory	NULL

even	NULL
heard	NULL
upstairs	NULL

where	NULL
the	NULL

what	NULL

as	NULL
we	NULL

a	NULL

night	NULL

it	NULL

all	NULL

there	NULL

then	NULL
public	NULL
curiosity	NULL

profoundly	NULL
concerned	NULL

how	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
conduct	NULL

so	NULL
trying	NULL
an	NULL

The	NULL
laughter	NULL
even	NULL
jarred	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sensitive	NULL
feelings	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
thought	NULL

where	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL

concerned	NULL

that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
serious	NULL

then	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
when	NULL

at	NULL
this	NULL

all	NULL

directed	NULL

diffused	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL

made	NULL
that	NULL
proposal	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
instinct	NULL

that	NULL
something	NULL
out	NULL

neither	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
searching	NULL
expression	NULL
in	NULL
Lady	NULL
Richmond	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
elicited	NULL
from	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

The	NULL
sentiment	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL

conveyed	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

Here	NULL

a	NULL

Lydia	NULL
Brown	NULL
was	NULL
heard	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL

natural	NULL
anxiety	NULL

the	NULL

contralto	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
singers	NULL
were	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL

alone	NULL

Half	NULL
the	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dinner-party	NULL

who	NULL
were	NULL
past	NULL
the	NULL
sentimental	NULL
age	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL

moonlight	NULL

had	NULL
gone	NULL
upstairs	NULL
according	NULL

use	NULL

remained	NULL
there	NULL

finding	NULL

to	NULL
their	NULL
great	NULL
satisfaction	NULL

room	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
about	NULL

and	NULL
comfortable	NULL
chairs	NULL

sit	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL

chatted	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corners	NULL
in	NULL
great	NULL
content	NULL

good-humour	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

Barbara	NULL
executed	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
charming	NULL
duets	NULL

Now	NULL

then	NULL
old	NULL
Colonel	NULL

paused	NULL

put	NULL
his	NULL
two	NULL
hands	NULL
softly	NULL
together	NULL

cry	NULL

Brava	NULL

but	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
the	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
disturbed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
music	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL

bad	NULL

the	NULL

upstairs	NULL

So	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
pinch	NULL

maltreat	NULL
her	NULL
rival	NULL

circumstances	NULL

it	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
did	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
Barbara	NULL

except	NULL
incite	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
sing	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
best	NULL

but	NULL
no	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
means	NULL

inflicting	NULL
considerable	NULL
pain	NULL
on	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL

who	NULL
stood	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
distance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL

listened	NULL
to	NULL
both	NULL

and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
had	NULL
inward	NULL
doubts	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
wisdom	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
choice	NULL

Such	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
arrangement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
social	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
that	NULL
everybody	NULL
was	NULL
occupied	NULL

when	NULL
an	NULL
event	NULL
occurred	NULL
which	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
later	NULL
period	NULL
awoke	NULL
much	NULL
excitement	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
small	NULL
influence	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
fate	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
individuals	NULL
whose	NULL
history	NULL

here	NULL
recorded	NULL

Everything	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
calm	NULL

cheerful	NULL

agreeable	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL

had	NULL
been	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
the	NULL
seventh	NULL
heaven	NULL
of	NULL
terrestrial	NULL
harmony	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sky	NULL
itself	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
peaceful	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
gave	NULL
less	NULL
indication	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
tempest	NULL
than	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
tranquil	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
below	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
knew	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
everybody	NULL
was	NULL
friendly	NULL
.	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
risen	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
pause	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
cheers	NULL
were	NULL
audible	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Chiley	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
conversation	NULL
,	NULL
patted	NULL
his	NULL
two	NULL
hands	NULL
together	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
door	NULL
opened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Thomas	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
followed	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
gentleman	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
stranger	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
forward	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL
as	NULL
mistress	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
step	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
suddenly	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
arrested	NULL
by	NULL
something	NULL
more	NULL
urgent	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
arrival	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
stranger	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
standing	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
arrival	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
directly	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
near	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
move	NULL
without	NULL
attracting	NULL
her	NULL
attention	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
took	NULL
that	NULL
step	NULL
in	NULL
advance	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
impulse	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
saying	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
turned	NULL
right	NULL
round	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
something	NULL
terrible	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
look	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
absorbed	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
feelings	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
betraying	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
near	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
pale	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
green	NULL
ghastly	NULL
look	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
face	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
blood	NULL
had	NULL
suddenly	NULL
been	NULL
withdrawn	NULL
to	NULL
reinforce	NULL
the	NULL
vital	NULL
centre	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
failing	NULL
of	NULL
nature	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
under-lip	NULL
hung	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
hollows	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
seen	NULL
there	NULL
before	NULL
appeared	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
taken	NULL
by	NULL
surprise	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
duties	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
regarding	NULL
in	NULL
utter	NULL
dismay	NULL
and	NULL
amazement	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
dead	NULL
stupefied	NULL
terror	NULL
which	NULL
thus	NULL
appeared	NULL
so	NULL
unexpectedly	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
right	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
lady	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
talking	NULL
the	NULL
minute	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
unconscious	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
presented	NULL
the	NULL
spectacle	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
miserable	NULL
surprise	NULL
and	NULL
alarm	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
striking	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
woman	NULL
present	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
entertain	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
grudge	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
unusual	NULL
inaction	NULL
on	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
stranger	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
led	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Chiley	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
shaken	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
entering	NULL
into	NULL
some	NULL
explanations	NULL
which	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
divined	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
usual	NULL
quick	NULL
intelligence	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
Colonel	NULL
roused	NULL
himself	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
easy-chair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
leaned	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
showed	NULL
symptoms	NULL
of	NULL
approaching	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
these	NULL
movements	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
followed	NULL
breathlessly	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
consciousness	NULL
that	NULL
only	NULL
her	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
stood	NULL
between	NULL
her	NULL
faithless	NULL
suitor	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
danger	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
to	NULL
prove	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
,	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
chose	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
others	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
her	NULL
power	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
appeal	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
taste	NULL
in	NULL
music	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
unhappy	NULL
man	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
response	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
saw	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
lose	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
fearless	NULL
hand	NULL
she	NULL
threw	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
portfolio	NULL
of	NULL
music	NULL
which	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
merciful	NULL
disturbance	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
curtsey	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
received	NULL
the	NULL
homage	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
Beverley	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
arrived	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
host	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
his	NULL
host	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
broken	NULL
your	NULL
music-stand	NULL
or	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
portfolio	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
what	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
me	NULL
so	NULL
awkward	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
seeing	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
gentleman	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
paid	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
a	NULL
compliment	NULL
on	NULL
having	NULL
made	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
commotion	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
our	NULL
day	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
soldier	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
you	NULL
churchmen	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
open	NULL
again	NULL
before	NULL
this	NULL
little	NULL
speech	NULL
was	NULL
finished	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
step	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
with	NULL
difficulty	NULL
kept	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL
running	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
good-night	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
made	NULL
any	NULL
further	NULL
appearance	NULL
either	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
doors	NULL
or	NULL
indoors	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
made	NULL
himself	NULL
very	NULL
agreeable	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
one	NULL
man	NULL
never	NULL
quite	NULL
makes	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
scared	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
full	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
identity	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
itself	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
proved	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
vain	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
excited	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
sudden	NULL
gleam	NULL
of	NULL
mystery	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
an	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
and	NULL
altogether	NULL
unexpected	NULL
attraction	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
utterly	NULL
inconceivable	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
everybody	NULL
knew	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
give	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
panic	NULL

The	NULL
question	NULL
was	NULL

What	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
mean	NULL
?	NULL

_	NULL
Chapter	NULL
XVII	NULL
_	NULL
The	NULL
arrival	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
Beverley	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
many	NULL
reasons	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
event	NULL
of	NULL
importance	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
especially	NULL
to	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
in	NULL
anything	NULL
that	NULL
drew	NULL
new	NULL
and	NULL
pleasant	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
that	NULL
first	NULL
proposal	NULL
of	NULL
elevating	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
bishopric	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
relieve	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
bishop	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
district	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
immense	NULL
diocese	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
been	NULL
mooted	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
supposing	NULL
this	NULL
conception	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
ever	NULL
carried	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
nobody	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
eligible	NULL
as	NULL
first	NULL
bishop	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
prime	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
successful	NULL
clergyman	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
so	NULL
important	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
presence	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
attraction	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
clergy	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
a	NULL
visitation	NULL
.	NULL

Notwithstanding	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
deny	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
hostess	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
regarded	NULL
the	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
appearance	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
displeasure	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
sense	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
seek	NULL
his	NULL
entertainers	NULL
!	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
awkward	NULL
to	NULL
arrive	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
find	NULL
that	NULL
everybody	NULL
is	NULL
out	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
justly	NULL
observed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
baby	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
better	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Coming	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
first	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
almost	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
travelling	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
cream	NULL
off	NULL
everything	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
tears	NULL
of	NULL
vexation	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL

what	NULL
have	NULL
we	NULL

show	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
annoyed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
wealth	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
resources	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
despair	NULL

like	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
friend	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
never	NULL
know	NULL
any	NULL
better	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
sympathetically	NULL

Mrs	NULL

said	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
naturally	NULL
a	NULL
confidence	NULL
in	NULL
herself	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
even	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
's	NULL
admiring	NULL
faith	NULL
fell	NULL
short	NULL

The	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
himself	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
quite	NULL
cheerfully	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
natural	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL

a	NULL
very	NULL
pleasant	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

in	NULL
his	NULL
Broad-Church	NULL
way	NULL

as	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL

subject	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
Thursday	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
merest	NULL

For	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
Broad-Church	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
though	NULL
his	NULL
antecedents	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
proclaimed	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
talking	NULL
on	NULL
many	NULL
subjects	NULL
which	NULL
alarmed	NULL
his	NULL
hostess	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
anything	NULL
objectionable	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL

for	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL

a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
archdeacon	NULL
may	NULL
say	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL

things	NULL

ordinary	NULL
people	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL

venture	NULL
on	NULL

--	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
lead	NULL

;	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
everybody	NULL

as	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
custom	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
society	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
respectful	NULL
assent	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
example	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Bury	NULL
's	NULL
extreme	NULL
Low-Churchism	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL

it	NULL

Mr	NULL

had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
regard	NULL
for	NULL
respectability	NULL

that	NULL

spoke	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Bury	NULL
's	NULL
views	NULL
wounded	NULL
some	NULL
people	NULL
's	NULL
feelings	NULL
.	NULL

Altogether	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
anxious	NULL
person	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
often	NULL
agreed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
loose	NULL
ways	NULL
of	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
correct	NULL
opinions	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
wives	NULL
and	NULL
mothers	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
charge	NULL
of	NULL
Their	NULL
morality	NULL
strove	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
way	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
reverse	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
one	NULL
naturally	NULL
expected	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
nice	NULL
position	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
duty	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
results	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
agreeable	NULL
character	NULL
might	NULL
spring	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
otherwise	NULL
than	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
personal	NULL
predilection	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
devoted	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
guest	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
admitted	NULL
frankly	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
what	NULL
clergymen	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
every	NULL
silly	NULL
boy	NULL
and	NULL
girl	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
opinion	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
consulted	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
them	NULL
utterly	NULL
insupportable	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
charitable	NULL
to	NULL
Mary	NULL
Chiley	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
understood	NULL
better	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
brought	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
sound	NULL
Church	NULL
principles	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
on	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
desired	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
delightful	NULL
person	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
information	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
everybody	NULL
admitted	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
erected	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
bishopric	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
only	NULL
right	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
should	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
appointed	NULL
bishop	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
highly	NULL
probable	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
pleasure	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
owned	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
showed	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
tact	NULL
in	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
Thursday	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
arrival	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
brushing	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
cream	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
introduction	NULL
to	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
still	NULL
sighed	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
over	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
within	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
his	NULL
fault	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
designing	NULL
,	NULL
artful	NULL
creature	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
lead	NULL
any	NULL
man	NULL
wrong	NULL

For	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
clear	NULL

he	NULL

But	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
answer	NULL
Barbara	NULL
gave	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
jerk	NULL
of	NULL
annoyance	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
easy-chair	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL

lying	NULL
buried	NULL

with	NULL
her	NULL

upon	NULL

Rose	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL

prompt	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL

she	NULL
wasted	NULL
no	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL

Grange	NULL

her	NULL
little	NULL
head	NULL
erect	NULL

her	NULL

regarding	NULL

recognition	NULL

which	NULL
Rose	NULL
felt	NULL
she	NULL
owed	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
artist	NULL

her	NULL
fellow-creatures	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL

,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
consciousness	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
draw	NULL
them	NULL

immortalise	NULL
them	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL

her	NULL
own	NULL

a	NULL

Rose	NULL

too	NULL

open-eyed	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

_	NULL
her	NULL

rank	NULL

which	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
everybody	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
frame	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL

house	NULL

found	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
glad	NULL

see	NULL
her	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
pondering	NULL
deeply	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL

and	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
visitor	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
sent	NULL
by	NULL
heaven	NULL

help	NULL
her	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL

though	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
understood	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
Mr	NULL

powers	NULL

intelligence	NULL

the	NULL
lack	NULL

experience	NULL

such	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL

that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL

who	NULL
required	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
treatment	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
intently	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
Rose	NULL
's	NULL
arrival	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
advantages	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
novel	NULL
position	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
understand	NULL
it	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
within	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL

be	NULL
produced	NULL

she	NULL
could	NULL
but	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Thursday	NULL
morning	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
lose	NULL

Rose	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
quick-witted	NULL

understood	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
salute	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dismissal	NULL

went	NULL
away	NULL
accordingly	NULL

with	NULL
pride	NULL

pleasure	NULL

a	NULL

pain	NULL

The	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
practically	NULL
exemplifying	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL

person	NULL

the	NULL

destiny	NULL

it	NULL

,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
to	NULL
withdraw	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
responsibilities	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
shabby	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
who	NULL

out	NULL

stimulated	NULL
her	NULL
courage	NULL

who	NULL

themselves	NULL

Notwithstanding	NULL
this	NULL

the	NULL

it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
admitted	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
wear	NULL
had	NULL
flushed	NULL
to	NULL
Rose	NULL
's	NULL
very	NULL
finger-tips	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
heat	NULL
and	NULL
tingle	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
heroine	NULL
was	NULL
ashamed	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Thursday	NULL
morning	NULL

and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL

after	NULL
the	NULL

given	NULL
her	NULL

once	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL

stilled	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

her	NULL

of	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL

she	NULL

often	NULL
proclaimed	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
at	NULL

broke	NULL
off	NULL

falling	NULL
into	NULL
reverie	NULL
that	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
anticipations	NULL

were	NULL
trifling	NULL
matters	NULL
in	NULL

the	NULL

excitement	NULL

the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL

first	NULL
appearance	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL

What	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
called	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
public	NULL
appearance	NULL
took	NULL
place	NULL
at	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL

although	NULL
he	NULL

previously	NULL

at	NULL
Sir	NULL

somebody	NULL

Colonel	NULL

almost	NULL
every	NULL

county	NULL

at	NULL
Sir	NULL
John	NULL
's	NULL

Mr	NULL
Bury	NULL
's	NULL

naturally	NULL
counted	NULL

very	NULL
little	NULL

Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
;	NULL
--	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
confidently	NULL
reported	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
had	NULL
invited	NULL
Mr	NULL
Tufton	NULL
of	NULL
Salem	NULL
Chapel	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL

that	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL
Dissenting	NULL
minister	NULL
having	NULL
more	NULL
sense	NULL

knowing	NULL
his	NULL
place	NULL

that	NULL
unseemly	NULL
conjunction	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
place	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL
horror	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
right-thinking	NULL
people	NULL

So	NULL
that	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
reality	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
house	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
society	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
perhaps	NULL
be	NULL
using	NULL
too	NULL
strong	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
anxious	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
success	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
arrangements	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL

evening	NULL

but	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
admitted	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
were	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
justify	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
anxiety	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
him	NULL
justice	NULL

was	NULL
always	NULL
agreeable	NULL

and	NULL
his	NULL
departure	NULL
disturbed	NULL
the	NULL
habitual	NULL
party	NULL

and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
powers	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL

and	NULL
sat	NULL
at	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
left	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
just	NULL
like	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL

and	NULL
evidently	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
depended	NULL
on	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
Barbara	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
coming	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
nothing	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
programme	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
music	NULL
,	NULL
nobody	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
the	NULL
flirting	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
to	NULL
supply	NULL
the	NULL
dramatic	NULL
by-play	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
accustomed	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
honour	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
introduced	NULL
in	NULL
society	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
powers	NULL
inferior	NULL
to	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
sunk	NULL
under	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
weight	NULL
of	NULL
responsibility	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
excited	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
everything	NULL
depended	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
courage	NULL
and	NULL
self-possession	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
but	NULL
lost	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
and	NULL
lost	NULL
command	NULL
of	NULL
affairs	NULL
,	NULL
everything	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
lost	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
fortunately	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
herself	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
modest	NULL
confidence	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
lose	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
still	NULL
eat	NULL
her	NULL
dinner	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
composure	NULL
of	NULL
genius	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
wrong	NULL
to	NULL
deny	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
pale	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
discourage	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
another	NULL
discordant	NULL
element	NULL
was	NULL
added	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Bury	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Rector	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
Low-Church	NULL
,	NULL
has	NULL
no	NULL
particular	NULL
objections	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
dinner	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
principle	NULL
of	NULL
talking	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
important	NULL
daily	NULL
necessity	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
disparaging	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
best	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
patronising	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
roused	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
temper	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
would	NULL
launch	NULL
a	NULL
shaft	NULL
of	NULL
medical	NULL
wit	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
spiritual	NULL
guide	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Mr	NULL
Bury	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
parrying	NULL
.	NULL

Nor	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
danger	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
peace	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
party	NULL
was	NULL
exposed	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
regarded	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
critical	NULL
suspiciousness	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
is	NULL
seldom	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
encountered	NULL
except	NULL
among	NULL
clergymen	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
much	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
clerical	NULL
superior	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
recently	NULL
been	NULL
appointed	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
archdeaconry	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
looks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
demeanour	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
indicated	NULL
what	NULL
Mr	NULL
Bury	NULL
considered	NULL
a	NULL
loose	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
thinking	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
made	NULL
any	NULL
remark	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
would	NULL
pause	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
plate	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
fork	NULL
suspended	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
exchange	NULL
glances	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
supposed	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
discomposing	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
responsibility	NULL
of	NULL
everything	NULL

who	NULL
could	NULL

laughed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
laughing	NULL
in	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
this	NULL
fright	NULL
and	NULL
panic	NULL
were	NULL
poor	NULL
preparatives	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
got	NULL
through	NULL
creditably	NULL
with	NULL
so	NULL
few	NULL
resources	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
total	NULL
reversal	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ordinary	NULL
programme	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
tingling	NULL
with	NULL
curiosity	NULL
and	NULL
alarm	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
rose	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
really	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
that	NULL
an	NULL
adventurer	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
received	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
society	NULL
of	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
judges	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
discriminate	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
false	NULL
and	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
could	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
expect	NULL
that	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
would	NULL
continue	NULL
to	NULL
confide	NULL
its	NULL
most	NULL
important	NULL
arrangements	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
incompetent	NULL
hands	NULL
?	NULL

Such	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
dreadful	NULL
question	NULL
that	NULL
occupied	NULL
all	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
thoughts	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
adventurer	NULL
himself	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
he	NULL
deserved	NULL
anything	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
come	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
judgment	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
overtake	NULL
the	NULL
careless	NULL
shepherds	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
admitted	NULL
the	NULL
wolf	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
fold	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
in	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
abstract	NULL
justice	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
entirely	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
philanthropical	NULL
intention	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
stopped	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
dangerous	NULL
details	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
_	NULL
nobody	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
_	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
mark	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
best	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
inquire	NULL
too	NULL
closely	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
preoccupied	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
less	NULL
in	NULL
spirits	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
than	NULL
on	NULL
any	NULL
previous	NULL
occasion	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
unlucky	NULL
nights	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
every	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
large	NULL
and	NULL
public-spirited	NULL
views	NULL
must	NULL
calculate	NULL
upon	NULL
as	NULL
inevitable	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
moon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Richmonds	NULL
naturally	NULL
were	NULL
absent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
Miss	NULL
Browns	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
staying	NULL
there	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
visit	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
engagement	NULL
between	NULL
Lydia	NULL
[	NULL

John	NULL

Mr	NULL

(	NULL
though	NULL
perhaps	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL

Mrs	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
spirit	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
went	NULL
upstairs	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sentiment	NULL
which	NULL
pervaded	NULL
her	NULL
whole	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
occasion	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
displeased	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL

that	NULL
her	NULL

met	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
adequate	NULL
response	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
unfailing	NULL
inspiration	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
rush	NULL
into	NULL
opposition	NULL
because	NULL
any	NULL
misguided	NULL
man	NULL
or	NULL
woman	NULL
failed	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL

appreciate	NULL
her	NULL
efforts	NULL

her	NULL

On	NULL

nothing	NULL

more	NULL
long-suffering	NULL

tolerant	NULL

the	NULL

regarded	NULL
the	NULL
unfortunate	NULL
persons	NULL
who	NULL
mistook	NULL
or	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
appreciate	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
herself	NULL

which	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
superior	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL

was	NULL
something	NULL
they	NULL

sorry	NULL
(	NULL

for	NULL
their	NULL

If	NULL
there	NULL
should	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
somebody	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
gained	NULL
admittance	NULL
into	NULL
society	NULL
under	NULL
false	NULL
pretences	NULL

not	NULL
even	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
offence	NULL
,	NULL
grievous	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
induce	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
to	NULL
condemn	NULL
the	NULL
culprit	NULL
unheard	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
her	NULL
settled	NULL
resolution	NULL

a	NULL
peculiarity	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
character	NULL

whatever	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
thoughts	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
immediate	NULL
decision	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
shut	NULL
her	NULL
ears	NULL
to	NULL
every	NULL
indication	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
culprit	NULL
's	NULL
personality	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
blind	NULL
to	NULL
every	NULL
suggestion	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
identify	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

People	NULL
who	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
discover	NULL
the	NULL
alloy	NULL
which	NULL
blends	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
human	NULL
motives	NULL
,	NULL
may	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
felt	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
credit	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
leader	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
at	NULL
stake	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
admit	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
duped	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
reality	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
small	NULL
share	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
instinct	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
reason	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
doubtful	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL

was	NULL
always	NULL
to	NULL
side	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
friends	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
persons	NULL
included	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
sacred	NULL
number	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
scarcely	NULL
worthy	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
every	NULL
lofty	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
act	NULL
but	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
forsake	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
thus	NULL
mysteriously	NULL
and	NULL
darkly	NULL
assailed	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
reward	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
virtues	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
which	NULL
go	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
recompense	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
other	NULL
virtues	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
prompt	NULL
guerdon	NULL
is	NULL
bestowed	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
possessed	NULL
this	NULL
happier	NULL
development	NULL
.	NULL

Whether	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
little	NULL
speech	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
which	NULL
touched	NULL
the	NULL
mimic	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
whether	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
was	NULL
produced	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
secret	NULL
influence	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
's	NULL
talent	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
apotheosis	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
shook	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
languor	NULL
as	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
inspiration	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
sketch	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
as	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
day	NULL
is	NULL
remembered	NULL
more	NULL
clearly	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
off	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
very	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
everybody	NULL
else	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
shook	NULL
with	NULL
restrained	NULL
laughter	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
Rose	NULL
Lake	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
portfolio	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
sketches	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL
's	NULL
(	NULL
who	NULL
afterwards	NULL
became	NULL
so	NULL
celebrated	NULL

in	NULL
it	NULL

which	NULL
electrified	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
fond	NULL

art	NULL

by	NULL
the	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

and	NULL
who	NULL
remained	NULL
unwittingly	NULL
to	NULL
grace	NULL

She	NULL
stood	NULL
by	NULL
herself	NULL

all	NULL
wan	NULL
and	NULL
crumpled	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL

showing	NULL

rage	NULL

jilted	NULL

all	NULL

a	NULL
most	NULL
startling	NULL
example	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
danger	NULL
of	NULL
showing	NULL
your	NULL
feelings	NULL

with	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
point	NULL
a	NULL
moral	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
young	NULL
people	NULL
about	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
because	NULL
Rose	NULL

coming	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
eclipsed	NULL
by	NULL

But	NULL
nobody	NULL
took	NULL
any	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
Barbara	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
miserable	NULL
evening	NULL
;	NULL
nobody	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL

sing	NULL

offered	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
seat	NULL

even	NULL
spoke	NULL

her	NULL

except	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

who	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
magnanimity	NULL
found	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL

her	NULL
hair	NULL

hastily	NULL

the	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL

a	NULL

She	NULL
drove	NULL
her	NULL

drew	NULL
an	NULL

the	NULL

thing	NULL
that	NULL
dissatisfied	NULL
Mrs	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL

nothing	NULL

is	NULL
generally	NULL
attributed	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
gave	NULL
little	NULL
Rose	NULL
the	NULL
fullest	NULL
opportunity	NULL
of	NULL
showing	NULL
her	NULL
drawings	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL

awakening	NULL
his	NULL
curiosity	NULL

even	NULL
securing	NULL

everybody	NULL

Mr	NULL

though	NULL

was	NULL
most	NULL
probably	NULL

in	NULL
this	NULL

no	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
painful	NULL
aspect	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
which	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
discussed	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
got	NULL
home	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL

not	NULL

day	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL

"	NULL

still	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
has	NULL
a	NULL
nice	NULL
position	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
just	NULL
suit	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
going	NULL

leaving	NULL
him	NULL

the	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL

the	NULL
little	NULL
one	NULL

just	NULL
as	NULL
designing	NULL

If	NULL

Mrs	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL

he	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
more	NULL
calmly	NULL

a	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
unchristian	NULL
persuasion	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
regarded	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
extent	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
personal	NULL
bias	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
person	NULL
who	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
abstractly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
contemplated	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
accidents	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
progressing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
kinds	NULL
of	NULL
social	NULL
difficulties	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
master-mind	NULL
which	NULL
first	NULL
conceived	NULL
the	NULL
grand	NULL
design	NULL
of	NULL
turning	NULL
the	NULL
chaotic	NULL
elements	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
into	NULL
one	NULL
grand	NULL
unity	NULL
.	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
blind	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dangers	NULL
that	NULL
surrounded	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
indifferent	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
partial	NULL
disappointment	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
undergone	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
great	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
progress	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
when	NULL
we	NULL
announce	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
herself	NULL
was	NULL
satisfied	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
remains	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
,	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
natural	NULL
obtuseness	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
general	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
pleasant	NULL
party	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
has	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
clear	NULL
candid	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
certainly	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
pronouncing	NULL
solemnly	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
and	NULL
Lady	NULL
Richmond	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lump	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
considering	NULL
how	NULL
unlike	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
knew	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
though	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
satisfied	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
events	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
vain	NULL
to	NULL
deny	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
perturbations	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
laid	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
maiden	NULL
pillow	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
again	NULL
with	NULL
profounder	NULL
fervour	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
fortunately	NULL
her	NULL
affections	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
engaged	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
more	NULL
things	NULL
than	NULL
affections	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
into	NULL
consideration	NULL
.	NULL

Could	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
mystery	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
imposture	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
kind	NULL
or	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
crossed	NULL
the	NULL
sacred	NULL
threshold	NULL
of	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
people	NULL
might	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
cast	NULL
in	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
the	NULL
dreadful	NULL
discovery	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
received	NULL
in	NULL
_	NULL
her	NULL
_	NULL
house	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
?	NULL

When	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
crossed	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
shivered	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
satin	NULL
quilt	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
change	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
one	NULL
way	NULL
or	NULL
another	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
act	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
circumspection	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
possible	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
appreciated	NULL
fully	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
that	NULL
exists	NULL
between	NULL
wrong	NULL
and	NULL
discovery	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
any	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
imposing	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
neighbours	NULL
and	NULL
telling	NULL
lies	NULL
about	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
fault	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
leader	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
betray	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
received	NULL
and	NULL
petted	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
responsibility	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
_	NULL
her	NULL
_	NULL
shoulders	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
softer	NULL
thoughts	NULL
mingled	NULL
with	NULL
these	NULL
prudential	NULL
considerations	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
sweet	NULL
yet	NULL
stern	NULL
resolution	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
which	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
this	NULL
evening	NULL
expressed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
pity	NULL
for	NULL
everybody	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
unfortunate	NULL
which	NULL
asserts	NULL
itself	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
strongest	NULL
of	NULL
female	NULL
intelligences	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
that	NULL
prudence	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
thing	NULL
required	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
determination	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
too	NULL
hasty	NULL
heed	NULL
to	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
alarmist	NULL
policy	NULL
.	NULL

Fortunately	NULL
the	NULL
respectability	NULL
of	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
cover	NULL
its	NULL
guests	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
shining	NULL
buckler	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
calmed	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
apprehensions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
convincing	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
impostor	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
really	NULL
received	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
worse	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
impostor	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
meantime	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lack	NULL
of	NULL
evidence	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
no	NULL
notice	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
who	NULL
regarded	NULL
that	NULL
past	NULL
danger	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
livelier	NULL
horror	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
distinct	NULL
fear	NULL
,	NULL
certainly	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
knowing	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
nobody	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
remarked	NULL
as	NULL
being	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
despondent	NULL
condition	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
anything	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
highest	NULL
spirits	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
Thursday	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
ungrateful	NULL
creature	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
mischief	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
tolerant	NULL
as	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
going	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
limits	NULL
of	NULL
nature	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
expected	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
profoundly	NULL
sorry	NULL
for	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
an	NULL
elevated	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
sad	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
courage	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
briefest	NULL
and	NULL
rudest	NULL
response	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
question	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
"	NULL
taken	NULL
off	NULL
"	NULL
her	NULL
woe-begone	NULL
looks	NULL
almost	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
shown	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
sympathy	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
forsaken	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
been	NULL
called	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
solitude	NULL
to	NULL
sing	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Rose	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
attracted	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
attention	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL

like	NULL

people	NULL
,	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
keenly	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
wrongs	NULL

had	NULL
no	NULL
eyes	NULL

perceive	NULL
that	NULL
Rose	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
proud	NULL
little	NULL
spirit	NULL

anything	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
's	NULL
entertainment	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
herself	NULL
so	NULL
largely	NULL
contributed	NULL

"	NULL

should	NULL
never	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL

Barbara	NULL
said	NULL

quite	NULL
subdued	NULL
and	NULL
broken	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
burst	NULL
of	NULL
tears	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL

and	NULL
poor	NULL
little	NULL
Rose	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL

Rose	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
passing	NULL

pulled	NULL

stared	NULL

it	NULL
all	NULL

there	NULL

looked	NULL

this	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
managed	NULL
miraculously	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
month	NULL
's	NULL
absence	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
charming	NULL
little	NULL
moustache	NULL

were	NULL

to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL

slightly	NULL
red	NULL

It	NULL
gleamed	NULL
into	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL

did	NULL
such	NULL
things	NULL

themselves	NULL

Mr	NULL

's	NULL

it	NULL

utterly	NULL

himself	NULL

before	NULL

in	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
opinion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
certainly	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
attract	NULL
attention	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
beards	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
usual	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
days	NULL

They	NULL
met	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
spot	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

him	NULL
last	NULL

with	NULL
that	NULL
look	NULL

failing	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
fortunately	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
getting	NULL
late	NULL

too	NULL
late	NULL

even	NULL
had	NULL

longing	NULL

Barbara	NULL
once	NULL

Not	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
far	NULL
more	NULL
suitable	NULL
match	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
than	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
and	NULL
fortune	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-master	NULL
's	NULL
daughter	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
of	NULL
fixed	NULL
and	NULL
settled	NULL
sentiments	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
triumph	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
desired	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
difficulties	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
herself	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
been	NULL
she	NULL
from	NULL
whom	NULL
action	NULL
was	NULL
demanded	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
spirited	NULL
and	NULL
determined	NULL
conduct	NULL
in	NULL
theory	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
women	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
lounged	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pockets	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
strayed	NULL
out	NULL
quite	NULL
accidentally	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
unpremeditating	NULL
mood	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
Grove	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
meant	NULL
nothing	NULL
by	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
inquire	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
strolled	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
higher	NULL
parts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
linger	NULL
here	NULL
about	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
might	NULL
pass	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stop	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
and	NULL
ask	NULL
him	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
worry	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
surely	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
enough	NULL
of	NULL
bother	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
pleasant	NULL
in	NULL
Grove	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
people	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
watered	NULL
their	NULL
little	NULL
gardens	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
brought	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
sweetness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mignonette	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sentimental	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
its	NULL
influence	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
lights	NULL
that	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
appear	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
parlour	NULL
windows	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
breathed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
odours	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
gardens	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
denied	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
through	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
bother	NULL
and	NULL
vexation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whether	NULL
love	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cottage	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
garden	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
mignonette	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
tolerable	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
comfort	NULL
within	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
more	NULL
reasonable	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
sight	NULL
?	NULL

This	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
allowed	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
conclusion	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
on	NULL
sufficient	NULL
premises	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
calmness	NULL
that	NULL
befitted	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
important	NULL
argument	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
mere	NULL
suggestion	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
impatient	NULL
,	NULL
undecided	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
did	NULL
always	NULL
what	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
it	NULL
found	NULL
most	NULL
agreeable	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
reflected	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
repentance	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
reflection	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
arrived	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
paused	NULL
by	NULL
instinct	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
lamp	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
lighted	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
opposite	NULL
Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
his	NULL
fault	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
upper	NULL
window	NULL
a	NULL
figure	NULL
looking	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
Mariana	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sighing	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
He	NULL
cometh	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Naturally	NULL
the	NULL
figure	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
who	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
_	NULL
he	NULL
_	NULL
was	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
figure	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
innocent	NULL
manner	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
entirely	NULL
natural	NULL
curiosity	NULL
was	NULL
satisfied	NULL
.	NULL

First	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
was	NULL
opened	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
down	NULL
below	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
of	NULL
Barbara	NULL
singing	NULL
softly	NULL
up	NULL
above	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
settled	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
identity	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
to	NULL
_	NULL
his	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
Barbara	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
perceived	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
any	NULL
doubt	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
heart	NULL
leaped	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
right	NULL
place	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
first	NULL
caught	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
blessed	NULL
apparition	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
orange-flowers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
wedding	NULL
breakfast	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
veil	NULL
of	NULL
real	NULL
Brussels	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
Barbara	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
wept	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
sing	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
convey	NULL
hope	NULL
and	NULL
assurance	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
timid	NULL
lover	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
romantic	NULL
precedent	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
prompt	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
natural	NULL
way	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
felt	NULL
quite	NULL
sure	NULL
who	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
civil	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
forward	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
Barbara	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
extreme	NULL
step	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
doubt	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
extreme	NULL
step	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
public	NULL
aim	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
justified	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
measure	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
public	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
a	NULL
decided	NULL
personal	NULL
,	NULL
purpose	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
obeyed	NULL
the	NULL
impulse	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
mingled	NULL
inclination	NULL
towards	NULL
another	NULL
and	NULL
determination	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
mind	NULL
calls	NULL
itself	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
sometimes	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
sheer	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
succeeds	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
either	NULL
genius	NULL
or	NULL
calculation	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
palpitating	NULL
with	NULL
renewed	NULL
hope	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
dread	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
escape	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
appeared	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
glowing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
blazing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
thumping	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
breast	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
quiet	NULL
twilight	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
hopes	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
even	NULL
advanced	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
instinctive	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
approach	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
they	NULL
met	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
being	NULL
comparatively	NULL
quiet	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
mignonette	NULL
perfuming	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
poetry	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
homely	NULL
order	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
lamp-post	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
tree	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
lover	NULL
had	NULL
placed	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
dew	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
watering	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
odour	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mignonette	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
neither	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
poetical	NULL
personages	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
accessories	NULL
did	NULL
perfectly	NULL
well	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
it	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
?	NULL

Goodness	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
who	NULL
it	NULL

cried	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
breath	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

it	NULL

I.	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL

an	NULL

I	NULL

before	NULL
I	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
again	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
imprudent	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
commit	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
benefit	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
hero	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
eve	NULL
of	NULL
departure	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

no	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
ill	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Barbara	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
added	NULL

taking	NULL
breath	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
quite	NULL
well	NULL

Wo	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
come	NULL

"	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
perfectly	NULL
simple	NULL
and	NULL
natural	NULL
manner	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nobody	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Barbara	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
her	NULL
lover	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
advantages	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
well	NULL
matched	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
special	NULL
protection	NULL
on	NULL
either	NULL
side	NULL

Though	NULL
naturally	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
felt	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
almost	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
pattern	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
Brussels	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
serious	NULL
object	NULL
in	NULL
view	NULL
than	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
only	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
offered	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
refuge	NULL
from	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
deliberations	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
decision	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL

Rose	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
walk	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
taking	NULL
together	NULL

they	NULL
found	NULL

to	NULL
their	NULL
great	NULL
amazement	NULL
,	NULL
Barbara	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
parlour	NULL
,	NULL
singing	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
dangers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
hopes	NULL
of	NULL
better	NULL
fortune	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
contented	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
mellow	NULL
contralto	NULL
that	NULL
delighted	NULL
his	NULL
ears	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
blazing	NULL
scarlet	NULL
bloom	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
black	NULL
level	NULL
brows	NULL
that	NULL
pleased	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
anybody	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
desired	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
yet	NULL
given	NULL
a	NULL
thought	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
wedding	NULL
breakfast	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
arranged	NULL
already	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
enchantress	NULL
who	NULL
thus	NULL
held	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
thrall	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
perhaps	NULL
that	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
best	NULL
accounted	NULL
for	NULL
by	NULL
referring	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
indefinable	NULL
peculiarities	NULL
of	NULL
difference	NULL
that	NULL
exist	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
of	NULL
woman	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
daughter	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
walk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
Willie	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
about	NULL
art	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
effects	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
"	NULL
bits	NULL
"	NULL
which	NULL
Rose	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
mutually	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
this	NULL
unexpected	NULL
conjunction	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
parlour	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
surprise	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
indeed	NULL
consternation	NULL
,	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
imagined	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
of	NULL
Rose	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL
sentiment	NULL
existed	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
how	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
superior	NULL
position	NULL
"	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
received	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
appearance	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
artist	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
forgot	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
visitor	NULL
was	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
daughter	NULL
very	NULL
handsome	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
visit	NULL
Barbara	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
little	NULL
drawing-master	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
suffer	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
seduced	NULL
by	NULL
thoughts	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
apart	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
from	NULL
carrying	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
principles	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
rose	NULL
up	NULL
confused	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
caught	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL

Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL
held	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
perfect	NULL
suavity	NULL

I	NULL

who	NULL
knows	NULL

not	NULL
just	NULL

one	NULL

naturally	NULL
the	NULL

they	NULL
only	NULL

it	NULL

would	NULL
be	NULL
glad	NULL

admittance	NULL

consequence	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL

felt	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL

more	NULL
confused	NULL

happened	NULL

explained	NULL
faintly	NULL

the	NULL
pleasure	NULL
of	NULL
meeting	NULL

"	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
assure	NULL
you	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-master	NULL

"	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
hail	NULL
with	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
the	NULL
appearance	NULL
of	NULL

have	NULL
heard	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL

We	NULL

our	NULL

our	NULL
thoughts	NULL

But	NULL
still	NULL
we	NULL
are	NULL
sympathetic	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL

We	NULL
can	NULL
understand	NULL
other	NULL

we	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
share	NULL
them	NULL

Yes	NULL

Barbara	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
poorly	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
look	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
to-night	NULL

Ask	NULL
for	NULL

lamp	NULL

Rose	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
grandeur	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
light	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
candles	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL

which	NULL
lighted	NULL
that	NULL

the	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
apartment	NULL

small	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL

in	NULL
comparative	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
magnificent	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
adding	NULL
the	NULL
lamp	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
illumination	NULL

but	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL

as	NULL
Mr	NULL

himself	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
every	NULL
artist	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
prodigal	NULL

Rose	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
standing	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
hat	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
Gorgon	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
want	NULL
here	NULL
?	NULL

How	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
been	NULL
admitted	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
scorned	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
interrogate	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
involved	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
infidelity	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL

but	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL
looked	NULL
hard	NULL
at	NULL
Mr	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
severity	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL

a	NULL
reassuring	NULL
effect	NULL

him	NULL

tell	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
benign	NULL
reception	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
receiving	NULL
from	NULL
Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
setting	NULL
the	NULL
visitor	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
ease	NULL

made	NULL
him	NULL
nervous	NULL

for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
heroic	NULL
soul	NULL
which	NULL
existed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-master	NULL
's	NULL
limited	NULL
person	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
thought	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
"	NULL
caught	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
vulgar	NULL
theory	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
Barbara	NULL

father	NULL

cringing	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

playing	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL

secure	NULL
a	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
Rose	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
evidently	NULL
,	NULL
either	NULL
from	NULL
jealousy	NULL

some	NULL
other	NULL
reason	NULL

was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
plot	NULL

She	NULL
stood	NULL
apart	NULL
and	NULL
scowled	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
intruder	NULL

"	NULL

Rose	NULL

Mr	NULL

wished	NULL

At	NULL
this	NULL
trenchant	NULL
speech	NULL
Mr	NULL

rose	NULL

was	NULL
quite	NULL
grateful	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL

It	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
less	NULL

had	NULL
committed	NULL

more	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
an	NULL
intruder	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
agreeable	NULL
suggestion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL

the	NULL

for	NULL
Mr	NULL

he	NULL
too	NULL

it	NULL

curiosity	NULL

He	NULL

him	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL

made	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL

_	NULL
Chapter	NULL
XXI	NULL
_	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
particularly	NULL
meaning	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
impressed	NULL
upon	NULL
two	NULL
interesting	NULL
and	NULL
amiable	NULL
young	NULL
women	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
day	NULL
the	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
propose	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
in	NULL
either	NULL
case	NULL
realising	NULL
that	NULL
expectation	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
this	NULL
last	NULL
exploit	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
more	NULL
confused	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
will	NULL
more	NULL
undecided	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
perverse	NULL
minds	NULL
which	NULL
cling	NULL
to	NULL
everything	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
forbidden	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
near	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
seek	NULL
her	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
follow	NULL
her	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
permissible	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
might	NULL
marry	NULL
one	NULL
wife	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
liking	NULL
and	NULL
another	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
interests	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
compromised	NULL
by	NULL
proposing	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
both	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
very	NULL
soon	NULL
have	NULL
triumphed	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
handsome	NULL
,	NULL
sullen	NULL
,	NULL
passionate	NULL
rival	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
conciliating	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
does	NULL
not	NULL
exist	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
British	NULL
Islands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
consequently	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
every	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
saw	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
clearly	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
so	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
same	NULL
thing	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
with	NULL
any	NULL
confidence	NULL
be	NULL
predicated	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
consent	NULL
,	NULL
nothing	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
interests	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
an	NULL
unconquerable	NULL
reluctance	NULL
kept	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
history	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
spotless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
chapters	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
kill	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
brought	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
of	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL
fellow	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
everybody	NULL
's	NULL
sight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
unacknowledged	NULL
even	NULL
by	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
little	NULL
private	NULL
nook	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
gratitude	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
he	NULL
scarcely	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
passing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
saved	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
effects	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
panic	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
unexpected	NULL
appearance	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
partly	NULL
this	NULL
consciousness	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
presence	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
gratitude	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
deceive	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
he	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ask	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
acute	NULL
observer	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
care	NULL
of	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
emergency	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
a	NULL
match	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
seductive	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
appear	NULL
to	NULL
others	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
few	NULL
people	NULL
are	NULL
acute	NULL
observers	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
so	NULL
entirely	NULL
personal	NULL
to	NULL
themselves	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
furious	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
how	NULL
foolish	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
ever	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
near	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
in	NULL

present	NULL

and	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL

that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
delightful	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
colour	NULL
blaze	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL

from	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
flush	NULL
of	NULL
excitement	NULL

triumph	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL

the	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
intoxicated	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
presence	NULL

Thus	NULL
the	NULL
unfortunate	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
torn	NULL
asunder	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
by	NULL
love	NULL

duty	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
by	NULL
inclination	NULL
and	NULL
interest	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
inclination	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
strong	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
allowed	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
great	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
the	NULL
interest	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
certain	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
repaid	NULL
the	NULL
exertion	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
only	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
decide	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
panic	NULL
that	NULL
pursued	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
adopt	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
wise	NULL
policy	NULL
that	NULL
remained	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wait	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
making	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
horribly	NULL
vexed	NULL
and	NULL
annoyed	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
avoiding	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
plague	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL

over	NULL

Certainly	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
expected	NULL
him	NULL

evening	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
ten	NULL
o'clock	NULL

and	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL

a	NULL
little	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
exactly	NULL
disappointed	NULL

but	NULL
annoyed	NULL
at	NULL
herself	NULL
for	NULL
having	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
expectation	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
could	NULL
turn	NULL
from	NULL
Mr	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
thus	NULL
failed	NULL
to	NULL
fulfil	NULL
the	NULL
demands	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
serene	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL

with	NULL
that	NULL
delightful	NULL
consciousness	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
reproach	NULL
herself	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
balm	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
well-regulated	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
whatever	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
injudiciously	NULL
discouraged	NULL
nor	NULL
encouraged	NULL
the	NULL
possible	NULL
Member	NULL
for	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
free	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
her	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
possible	NULL
Bishop	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
neither	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL

nor	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
could	NULL
anybody	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
too	NULL

committed	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL

While	NULL

were	NULL
passing	NULL
through	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
came	NULL
upstairs	NULL

had	NULL
grown	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
custom	NULL
lately	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
tea	NULL

though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
principles	NULL

sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
sat	NULL
by	NULL
while	NULL
his	NULL
daughter	NULL

hers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
amused	NULL
himself	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
chat	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
later	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
to-night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
naturally	NULL
the	NULL
tea-tray	NULL
had	NULL
disappeared	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
permit	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
preoccupation	NULL
to	NULL
interfere	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
discharge	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
immediate	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
unquestionably	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
amusing	NULL

a	NULL
sentiment	NULL
of	NULL
general	NULL
content	NULL
and	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
filled	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
experienced	NULL
a	NULL
natural	NULL
womanly	NULL
vexation	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
proposal	NULL
nipped	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bud	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
annoyed	NULL
her	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
on	NULL
personal	NULL
as	NULL
on	NULL
general	NULL
principles	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
pernicious	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
than	NULL
when	NULL
thus	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
point	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
thrown	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
permitted	NULL
to	NULL
produce	NULL
that	NULL
delicate	NULL
bloom	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
affections	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
preventing	NULL
a	NULL
rose	NULL
from	NULL
putting	NULL
forth	NULL
its	NULL
flowers	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
cruelty	NULL
equally	NULL
prejudicial	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
plant	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
this	NULL
pang	NULL
of	NULL
wounded	NULL
philanthropy	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
felt	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Providence	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
special	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
telling	NULL
what	NULL
embarrassments	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
complications	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
unbosoming	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
doubt	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
confidence	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
whatever	NULL
difficulties	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
extricated	NULL
herself	NULL
from	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
_	NULL
éclat	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
the	NULL
necessity	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
serene	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
"	NULL
whatever	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
best	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
betook	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
peaceful	NULL
slumbers	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
who	NULL
hold	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
are	NULL
tempted	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
entirely	NULL
different	NULL
opinion	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
linger	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
spectacle	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mind	NULL
so	NULL
perfectly	NULL
well	NULL
regulated	NULL
.	NULL

Very	NULL
different	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
sentiments	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
sleep	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
ghosts	NULL
that	NULL
kept	NULL
tugging	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
every	NULL
side	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
too	NULL
the	NULL
flower	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
hero	NULL
's	NULL
love	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
nipped	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bud	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
natural	NULL
that	NULL
goodness	NULL
and	NULL
self-control	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
sometimes	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
uncertain	NULL
world	NULL

Chapter	NULL
XXII	NULL
_	NULL
The	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
before	NULL
Thursday	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
anticipated	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
interval	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
recovered	NULL
his	NULL
courage	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
renew	NULL
his	NULL
visit	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
alarmed	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

Everybody	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
remarked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
how	NULL
worried	NULL
poor	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
looked	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
eyes	NULL
lost	NULL
their	NULL
brightness	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
some	NULL
people	NULL
thought	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
beauty	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
nerves	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
temper	NULL
both	NULL
failed	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
tell	NULL
why	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
personal	NULL
sketches	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
were	NULL
truculent	NULL
and	NULL
bitter	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
unheard-of	NULL
degree	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
savage	NULL
force	NULL
which	NULL
electrified	NULL
her	NULL
audience	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
words	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
which	NULL
everybody	NULL
admitted	NULL
were	NULL
exactly	NULL
like	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
ever	NULL
be	NULL
imagined	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
fallen	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
circumstances	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
mimic	NULL
placed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
short	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
drama	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
showed	NULL
some	NULL
surprise	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
restrained	NULL
laughter	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corners	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
anybody	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
showed	NULL
an	NULL
instinctive	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
confidence	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
not	NULL
studied	NULL
her	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
an	NULL
opinion	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
reverse	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
deliverance	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
rather	NULL
studied	NULL
him	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
too	NULL
keen	NULL
an	NULL
edge	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
characteristic	NULL
qualities	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
is	NULL
natural	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
literary	NULL
portraiture	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
went	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
people	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
personal	NULL
spite	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Mr	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
some	NULL
faint	NULL
echo	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
suggestion	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
's	NULL
clever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
carries	NULL
her	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
enters	NULL
into	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
far	NULL
she	NULL
is	NULL
going	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
answer	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
before	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Hal	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
here	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
key-note	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
says	NULL
.	NULL

_	NULL
He	NULL
_	NULL
has	NULL
met	NULL
everybody	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
place	NULL
or	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
simple	NULL
man	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
natural	NULL
pride	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
vain	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fashionable	NULL
brother-in-law	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
understood	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
sick	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Continent	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
news	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
wonderful	NULL
tendency	NULL
to	NULL
increase	NULL
and	NULL
grow	NULL
bigger	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
spread	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
friend	NULL
was	NULL
dying	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
probable	NULL
large	NULL
increase	NULL
of	NULL
fortune	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
popular	NULL
favourite	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
did	NULL
credit	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
imagination	NULL
of	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
disappeared	NULL
completely	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
eventful	NULL
day	NULL
which	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
described	NULL
,	NULL
carrying	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fullest	NULL
way	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
prediction	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
striking	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
with	NULL
bitter	NULL
disappointment	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
occupy	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Barbara	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
humble	NULL
duty	NULL
of	NULL
looking	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
brothers	NULL
and	NULL
sisters	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
attending	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
comfort	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
occupations	NULL
particularly	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Barbara	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
neglected	NULL
her	NULL
duties	NULL
,	NULL
Rose	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
return	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
School	NULL
of	NULL
Design	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
fierce	NULL
little	NULL
outbreak	NULL
of	NULL
indignation	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
elder	NULL
sister	NULL
felt	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
bear	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
accordingly	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
little	NULL
else	NULL
but	NULL
brood	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
sudden	NULL
disappearance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
spend	NULL
her	NULL
time	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
looking	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
return	NULL
.	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
conducted	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
rational	NULL
and	NULL
dignified	NULL
manner	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
herself	NULL
very	NULL
agreeable	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
unbended	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
grew	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
herself	NULL
allowed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
uneasy	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
opinions	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
certainly	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
free	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
talking	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
discuss	NULL
_	NULL
anything	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
approved	NULL
of	NULL
by	NULL
Mr	NULL
Bury	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
still	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
connections	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
nice	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
Bishop	NULL
of	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
marriage	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
well	NULL
known	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
never	NULL
can	NULL
have	NULL
everything	NULL
one	NULL
wants	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
difference	NULL
his	NULL
opinions	NULL
made	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Chiley	NULL
's	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
tea	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
daughter	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
enemy	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
Colonel	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
doubt	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
enough	NULL
of	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Chiley	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
received	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
idea	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
battle	NULL
of	NULL
Waterloo	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
people	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
nonsense	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
would	NULL
very	NULL
often	NULL
walk	NULL
home	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
visitor	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
heard	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
's	NULL
name	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
regretted	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
so	NULL
eminent	NULL
a	NULL
member	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
commonwealth	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
absent	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
visit	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
took	NULL
great	NULL
care	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
all	NULL
personalities	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
kept	NULL
a	NULL
discreet	NULL
silence	NULL
even	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
gifts	NULL
and	NULL
accomplishments	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
almost-lover	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
sighed	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
how	NULL
her	NULL
young	NULL
friend	NULL
avoided	NULL
this	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
sometimes	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
forgotten	NULL
,	NULL
sometimes	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
was	NULL
breaking	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
needless	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
neither	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
suppositions	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
true	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
considered	NULL
rather	NULL
odd	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
should	NULL
pay	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
visit	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
kind	NULL
and	NULL
hospitable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
distinguished	NULL
clergyman	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
six	NULL
weeks	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shows	NULL
no	NULL
inclination	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
natural	NULL
that	NULL
people	NULL
should	NULL
feel	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
surprised	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
visitation	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
dined	NULL
with	NULL
everybody	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
studied	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
characteristics	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
entered	NULL
into	NULL
everything	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
chances	NULL
are	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
himself	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
departure	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
domestic	NULL
calamity	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
forget	NULL
either	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
or	NULL
his	NULL
ways	NULL
of	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
absence	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
real	NULL
connection	NULL
between	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
hosts	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
combat	NULL
or	NULL
contradict	NULL
anybody	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL
smile	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
uttered	NULL
his	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
sentiments	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL

Broad-Church	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Dear	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
puzzled	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
pure	NULL
,	NULL
gentle	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
tone	NULL
which	NULL
settled	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
appeal	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
distinct	NULL
characterisation	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
together	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bright	NULL
little	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
particular	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
loitering	NULL
as	NULL
people	NULL
do	NULL
who	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
coming	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
in	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
's	NULL
tone	NULL
and	NULL
manner	NULL
which	NULL
struck	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
as	NULL
something	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
to	NULL
attach	NULL
undue	NULL
importance	NULL
to	NULL
looks	NULL
and	NULL
tones	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
's	NULL
manner	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
softened	NULL
and	NULL
mellowed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
expression	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
marked	NULL
regard	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
recognise	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
crisis	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
approaching	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
means	NULL
so	NULL
near	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
crisis	NULL
_	NULL
manqué	NULL
_	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
lately	NULL
passed	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
in	NULL
respect	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
still	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
but	NULL
remark	NULL
the	NULL
signs	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
slowly	NULL
approaching	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
likely	NULL
more	NULL
important	NULL
climax	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
remarked	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
naturally	NULL
by	NULL
anticipation	NULL
prepared	NULL
herself	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
coming	NULL
event	NULL
that	NULL
thus	NULL
threw	NULL
a	NULL
shadow	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
only	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
society	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
his	NULL
claims	NULL
into	NULL
full	NULL
consideration	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
these	NULL
claims	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
strong	NULL
to	NULL
merit	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
reward	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
admirable	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
,	NULL
absolutely	NULL
what	NULL
foolish	NULL
people	NULL
call	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
herself	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
agreeable	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dawn	NULL
of	NULL
tenderness	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
regarded	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
broad	NULL
central	NULL
path	NULL
which	NULL
traversed	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
neither	NULL
looking	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
nor	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
presenting	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
appearance	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
female	NULL
observer	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
easy	NULL
of	NULL
interpretation	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
remotest	NULL
idea	NULL
into	NULL
whose	NULL
house	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
who	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
protégée	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
better	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
finished	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
lessons	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sent	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
pupils	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
preparing	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
little	NULL
class	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
raising	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
accidentally	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
coming	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
person	NULL
whom	NULL
Mr	NULL
Bury	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
recommending	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
companion	NULL
and	NULL
chaperone	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
daughter	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
since	NULL
then	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
's	NULL
appearance	NULL
had	NULL
considerably	NULL
changed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
younger	NULL
by	NULL
ten	NULL
years	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
period	NULL
of	NULL
comparative	NULL
comfort	NULL
and	NULL
tranquillity	NULL
which	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
active	NULL
help	NULL
and	NULL
championship	NULL
had	NULL
procured	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
scholars	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
bloom	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
filling-up	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
worn	NULL
frame	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
doing	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
intervals	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
legislative	NULL
cares	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
run	NULL
about	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
searching	NULL
for	NULL
pupils	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
moment	NULL
had	NULL
cut	NULL
and	NULL
stitched	NULL
and	NULL
arranged	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
papered	NULL
walls	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
planted	NULL
flower-beds	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
feeble	NULL
creature	NULL
thus	NULL
thrown	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
character	NULL
which	NULL
certainly	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
made	NULL
any	NULL
fuss	NULL
about	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
endless	NULL
pleasure	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
protégée	NULL
so	NULL
perfectly	NULL
content	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
"	NULL
done	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
do	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
told	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
faded	NULL
widow	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
sensitive	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
feelings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
forgot	NULL
herself	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
faint	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
nearly	NULL
to	NULL
faint	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
unlucky	NULL
moment	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
's	NULL
character	NULL
and	NULL
dignity	NULL
demanded	NULL
superior	NULL
self-control	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
youth	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
good	NULL
looks	NULL
under	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
shadow	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
approaching	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
's	NULL
first	NULL
impulse	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
smile	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
conjunction	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
dropped	NULL
the	NULL
books	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
gazing	NULL
out	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
colour	NULL
all	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
surprise	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
surprise	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
dismay	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
terror	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
had	NULL
exhibited	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
apparition	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
dropped	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
chair	NULL
without	NULL
knowing	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
probably	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
fainted	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
something	NULL
more	NULL
urgent	NULL
than	NULL
mere	NULL
"	NULL
feelings	NULL
"	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
roused	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
very	NULL
happily	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
thus	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
preparation	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
patroness	NULL
was	NULL
leading	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
more	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
inevitably	NULL
be	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
roused	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
strength	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
gathered	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
books	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
without	NULL
knowing	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
taking	NULL
virtue	NULL
from	NULL
necessity	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
desperately	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
who	NULL
first	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
white	NULL
and	NULL
tottering	NULL
,	NULL
leaning	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
trellis	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
porch	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
but	NULL
give	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
cry	NULL
of	NULL
alarm	NULL
and	NULL
wonder	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
man	NULL
could	NULL
this	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
thus	NULL
struck	NULL
down	NULL
another	NULL
victim	NULL
without	NULL
even	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
raised	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
standing	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
faded	NULL
roses	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
approaching	NULL
so	NULL
indifferently	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
faded	NULL
existence	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
better	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
stock-still	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
basilisk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
pleased	NULL
interest	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
as	NULL
unconscious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
softened	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
ear	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
talked	NULL
nonsense	NULL
to	NULL
please	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
eyes	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
big	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
figure	NULL
which	NULL
stood	NULL
shrinking	NULL
and	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
porch	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
one	NULL
long	NULL
step	NULL
forward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
sleeve	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
to	NULL
convince	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
real	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
showed	NULL
no	NULL
joy	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
anything	NULL
but	NULL
sheer	NULL
amaze	NULL
and	NULL
wonder	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
unexpected	NULL
appearance	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
had	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
prepare	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Am	NULL
I	NULL
dreaming	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
voice	NULL
that	NULL
sounded	NULL
as	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
speaking	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
years	NULL
had	NULL
elapsed	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
vain	NULL
to	NULL
describe	NULL
the	NULL
amazement	NULL
and	NULL
singular	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
had	NULL
suddenly	NULL
given	NULL
way	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
stood	NULL
by	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Chapter	NULL

_	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
naturally	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
to	NULL
recover	NULL
her	NULL
senses	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
emergency	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
self-possessed	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
natural	NULL
giddiness	NULL
inseparable	NULL
from	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
reversal	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
lose	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
widow	NULL
standing	NULL
white	NULL
and	NULL
tremulous	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
porch	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
manly	NULL
countenance	NULL
had	NULL
paled	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
corresponding	NULL
colour	NULL

ask	NULL

"	NULL

without	NULL
some	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL

destitute	NULL

Miss	NULL

nodding	NULL
pleasantly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

went	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL

calling	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
self-possession	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
gift	NULL
only	NULL
of	NULL
great	NULL
minds	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
safe	NULL
distance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
stoop	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
in	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
porch	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
denied	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
moved	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
putting-up	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
trellis	NULL
round	NULL
that	NULL
porch	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
arrangement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sprawling	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
uncared	NULL
for	NULL

If	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
any	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
shock	NULL

it	NULL
certainly	NULL

she	NULL

the	NULL

these	NULL

a	NULL
revolution	NULL

unlooked-for	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

When	NULL
we	NULL

such	NULL

the	NULL

all	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

her	NULL

sufficiently	NULL

Miss	NULL

had	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL

set	NULL

up	NULL

she	NULL

many	NULL

at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL

Mr	NULL

explaining	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL

too	NULL
much	NULL
good	NULL
sense	NULL
to	NULL
upbraid	NULL
anybody	NULL
with	NULL
ingratitude	NULL

or	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
any	NULL
claim	NULL
upon	NULL
that	NULL
slippery	NULL
quality	NULL

but	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
widow	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
last	NULL
person	NULL
from	NULL
whom	NULL
a	NULL

should	NULL
come	NULL

the	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
difficult	NULL

She	NULL
walked	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
path	NULL
very	NULL
briskly	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
influence	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

nature	NULL

snub	NULL
the	NULL

when	NULL
she	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

Miss	NULL

who	NULL

When	NULL
this	NULL

ebullition	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
place	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
began	NULL
gradually	NULL
to	NULL
right	NULL
herself	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
grand	NULL

the	NULL
spectacle	NULL

one	NULL
which	NULL

this	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
be	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
frightened	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
popular	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whose	NULL
unlooked-for	NULL
appearance	NULL
had	NULL
driven	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
back	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
recovered	NULL
good	NULL
looks	NULL
and	NULL
cheerfulness	NULL
into	NULL
pallor	NULL
and	NULL
trembling	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
knew	NULL
quite	NULL
well	NULL
who	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
son	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
of	NULL
Trent	NULL
Valley	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
known	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
family	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
.	NULL

Everybody	NULL
knew	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
:	NULL
his	NULL
career	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
youth	NULL
up	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
clearly	NULL
traceable	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
killed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
railway	NULL
accident	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
memoir	NULL
published	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
Times	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
smallest	NULL
degree	NULL
secret	NULL
or	NULL
mysterious	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
how	NULL
could	NULL
it	NULL
come	NULL
about	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
should	NULL
frighten	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
senses	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
utterly	NULL
unconnected	NULL
with	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
but	NULL
faint	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
former	NULL
occasion	NULL
?	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
his	NULL
mission	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
driving	NULL
people	NULL
into	NULL
fits	NULL
of	NULL
terror	NULL
or	NULL
agitation	NULL
?	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Broad-Churchman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
type	NULL
of	NULL
clergyman	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
inclined	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
Broad	NULL
Church	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
speak	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
freely	NULL
on	NULL
religious	NULL
matters	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
basilisk	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
these	NULL
thoughts	NULL
went	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
observing	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
branches	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pear-tree	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
contained	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shape	NULL
of	NULL
fruit	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
loose	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
swaying	NULL
about	NULL
greatly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
damage	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
half-grown	NULL
pears	NULL
,	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
untidy	NULL
look	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
corner	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
send	NULL
Crawford	NULL
down	NULL
this	NULL
evening	NULL
to	NULL
fasten	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
other	NULL
remarks	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
description	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
parenthesis	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
tour	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
astonishing	NULL
how	NULL
many	NULL
little	NULL
things	NULL
go	NULL
wrong	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
or	NULL
woman	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
eyes	NULL
is	NULL
absent	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
helm	NULL
of	NULL
affairs	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
since	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
round	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
's	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
espalier	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
detached	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
verbenas	NULL
were	NULL
dead	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
borders	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sticks	NULL
that	NULL
propped	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
dahlias	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
plants	NULL
in	NULL
miserable	NULL
confusion	NULL
.	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
shook	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
over	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
herself	NULL
what	NULL
mysterious	NULL
influence	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
degree	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
confess	NULL
to	NULL
having	NULL
felt	NULL
agitated	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
this	NULL
fated	NULL
garden	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
seriousness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
produced	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
appearance	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
others	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
have	NULL
broken	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
props	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
nuisances	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
pursued	NULL
her	NULL
musings	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
her	NULL
large	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
incapable	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
its	NULL
perfect	NULL
serenity	NULL
was	NULL
happily	NULL
regained	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
confining	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
unless	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
reason	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
sole	NULL
subject	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
her	NULL
inspection	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
nobody	NULL
had	NULL
yet	NULL
appeared	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
collected	NULL
the	NULL
books	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
lying	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
summer-house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
them	NULL
under	NULL
cover	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
looked	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
like	NULL
rain	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
done	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
all	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
if	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
required	NULL
her	NULL
immediate	NULL
care	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
carried	NULL
philosophy	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
highest	NULL
practical	NULL
point	NULL
by	NULL
going	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
height	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
sense	NULL
which	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
thought	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
humanity	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
legislative	NULL
soul	NULL
and	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
nature	NULL
;	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
thus	NULL
denying	NULL
herself	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
advantages	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
inevitable	NULL
result	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
received	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
would	NULL
write	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
three-cornered	NULL
note	NULL
,	NULL
marked	NULL
_	NULL
Private	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
highly	NULL
probable	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
himself	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
some	NULL
explanation	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
this	NULL
tranquil	NULL
assurance	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
turned	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
towards	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
conviction	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
this	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
either	NULL
that	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
raised	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
bishopric	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
bishop	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
any	NULL
ground	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
quiet	NULL
certainty	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
conviction	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
recognised	NULL
that	NULL
beautiful	NULL
self-adjusting	NULL
balance	NULL
of	NULL
compensations	NULL
which	NULL
keeps	NULL
everything	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
recovered	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
shock	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
walk	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
shut	NULL
up	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
's	NULL
parlour	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
partaking	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
virtuous	NULL
peace	NULL
and	NULL
serenity	NULL
which	NULL
filled	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
bosom	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
collected	NULL
her	NULL
faculties	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
arrived	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
foreseen	NULL
by	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
terror	NULL
seized	NULL
the	NULL
widow	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
pupils	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
deep	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
gratitude	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
ascertained	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
protecting	NULL
genius	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
them	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
gratitude	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
recollection	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
manner	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
coming	NULL
together	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
path	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
mistress	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
showed	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
wrung	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
recollected	NULL
the	NULL
looks	NULL
and	NULL
attitude	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rumour	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
reached	NULL
her	NULL
ears	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
was	NULL
paying	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
miserable	NULL
presence	NULL
here	NULL
to	NULL
dispel	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
youthful	NULL
hopes	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
benefactress	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
revolution	NULL
in	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
prospects	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
poor	NULL
woman	NULL
felt	NULL
herself	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
sink	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
out	NULL
disconsolately	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
rain	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
rain	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
supposed	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
creature	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cage	NULL
,	NULL
helpless	NULL
,	NULL
imprisoned	NULL
,	NULL
miserable	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
knowing	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
cause	NULL
of	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
friends	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
little	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
garden	NULL
may	NULL
look	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
paradise	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sunshine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
feel	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
dungeon	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
woman	NULL
all	NULL
alone	NULL
looks	NULL
out	NULL
across	NULL
her	NULL
flowers	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sees	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
that	NULL
shuts	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thinks	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
has	NULL
no	NULL
refuge	NULL
nor	NULL
escape	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
nobody	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
feeble	NULL
powers	NULL
to	NULL
support	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
dreadful	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
has	NULL
done	NULL
harm	NULL
and	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
only	NULL
protector	NULL
.	NULL

Any	NULL
reasonable	NULL
creature	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
enough	NULL
certainly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
secure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
driven	NULL
lonely	NULL
and	NULL
distressed	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL
that	NULL
shut	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
blast	NULL
of	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
sweeping	NULL
,	NULL
downright	NULL
rain	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
her	NULL
off	NULL
from	NULL
any	NULL
succour	NULL
outside	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
burden	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
which	NULL
by	NULL
herself	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
combination	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
wringing	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
feeling	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
way	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
and	NULL
unexpected	NULL
burden	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
advance	NULL
matters	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
degree	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
strong-minded	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
already	NULL
proved	NULL
;	NULL
nor	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
the	NULL
ordinary	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
indifference	NULL
to	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
confidence	NULL
in	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
stands	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
self-control	NULL
with	NULL
many	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
wrung	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
out	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
vague	NULL
instinct	NULL
of	NULL
perhaps	NULL
finding	NULL
some	NULL
suggestion	NULL
of	NULL
comfort	NULL
outside	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
relapsed	NULL
by	NULL
necessity	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
support	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
months	NULL
past	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
consult	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
wound	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
anything	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
tell	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
creature	NULL
is	NULL
helpless	NULL
and	NULL
weak	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
has	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
friend	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
who	NULL
is	NULL
strong	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
can	NULL
she	NULL
do	NULL
but	NULL
apply	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
sustainer	NULL
and	NULL
guardian	NULL
?	NULL

When	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
beating	NULL
about	NULL
wildly	NULL
from	NULL
one	NULL
point	NULL
to	NULL
another	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
arrived	NULL
ultimately	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
predicted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
conclusion	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
remained	NULL
a	NULL
further	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
respect	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
communication	NULL
.	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
settled	NULL
quite	NULL
calmly	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
unlucky	NULL
moment	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
July	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
near	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
St	NULL
Swithin	NULL
's	NULL
Day	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
delightful	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
nobody	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
reason	NULL
to	NULL
complain	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
glad	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
was	NULL
wet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
was	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
interrupted	NULL
by	NULL
visitors	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
plans	NULL
to	NULL
settle	NULL
and	NULL
mature	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
enterprise	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
feeling	NULL
any	NULL
personal	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
considering	NULL
herself	NULL
injured	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
sudden	NULL
desertion	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
little	NULL
episode	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
as	NULL
completely	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
one	NULL
point	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
conviction	NULL
remained	NULL
firm	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impressed	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
bishopric	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
made	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
bishopric	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
chosen	NULL
to	NULL
occupy	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
see	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
instinctive	NULL
certainties	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
explanation	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
borne	NULL
in	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
spirit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
more	NULL
sure	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
seen	NULL
it	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
Queen	NULL
's	NULL
own	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
seal	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
usual	NULL
morning	NULL
occupations	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
great	NULL
and	NULL
novel	NULL
undertaking	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
revolutionised	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
many	NULL
people	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
shrunk	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
or	NULL
weeks	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
better	NULL
arms	NULL
than	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
influence	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
in	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
nature	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
daunted	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
difficulty	NULL
so	NULL
unimportant	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
thank	NULL
Heaven	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL
herself	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
widow	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
strait	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
soul	NULL
!	NULL

than	NULL
to	NULL
faint	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
never	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
beaten	NULL
,	NULL
whereas	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
had	NULL
undergone	NULL
numberless	NULL
defeats	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hardest	NULL
matter	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
identification	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Mr	NULL
Kavan	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
afraid	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
of	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
clever	NULL
rascal	NULL
and	NULL
adventurer	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
the	NULL
fellow	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
not	NULL
many	NULL
days	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
unfeignedly	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
matters	NULL
had	NULL
changed	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
reflections	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
now	NULL
be	NULL
best	NULL
that	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
meet	NULL
and	NULL
recognise	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
business	NULL
should	NULL
once	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
be	NULL
definitively	NULL
settled	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
offence	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
committed	NULL
against	NULL
society	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
sum	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
childless	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
this	NULL
mysterious	NULL
culprit	NULL
should	NULL
conceal	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
liberty	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
crime	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
surely	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
anything	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
took	NULL
pains	NULL
to	NULL
impress	NULL
upon	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
hoped	NULL
a	NULL
friendly	NULL
audience	NULL
will	NULL
also	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
goodness	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
_	NULL
real	NULL
foundation	NULL
_	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
suspicions	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
identity	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
personage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
might	NULL
turn	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
completely	NULL
mistaken	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
change	NULL
whatever	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
flourishing	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
antecedents	NULL
perfectly	NULL
well	NULL
known	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
unconscious	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
ashamed	NULL
about	NULL
;	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
confessed	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
likely	NULL
hypothesis	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
supposition	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
such	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
just	NULL
faith	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
instincts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
brief	NULL
but	NULL
telling	NULL
pieces	NULL
of	NULL
evidence	NULL
which	NULL
supported	NULL
her	NULL
conclusion	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
over	NULL
this	NULL
important	NULL
branch	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
care	NULL
and	NULL
devotion	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
out	NULL
by	NULL
chance	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
rain	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
crossing	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
thus	NULL
had	NULL
warning	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
to	NULL
prepare	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
visit	NULL
;	NULL
not	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
at	NULL
disadvantage	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
so	NULL
practical	NULL
and	NULL
pressing	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
prepared	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
air	NULL
and	NULL
expression	NULL
so	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
borne	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
intercourse	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
gone	NULL
than	NULL
yesterday	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
the	NULL
corresponding	NULL
revolution	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
but	NULL
regard	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
mingled	NULL
admiration	NULL
and	NULL
surprise	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
judged	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
world	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
judged	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
credit	NULL
for	NULL
skill	NULL
and	NULL
courage	NULL
in	NULL
assuming	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
attitude	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
preoccupied	NULL
and	NULL
natural	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
attitude	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
occur	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sinned	NULL
towards	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
his	NULL
extreme	NULL
surprise	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
possibly	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
aware	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
grievances	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
perhaps	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
innocent	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
intentions	NULL
which	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
had	NULL
attributed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
even	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
clear-sighted	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
dawning	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
last	NULL
interview	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
questions	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
female	NULL
intellect	NULL
is	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
judge	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
light	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
regarded	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
,	NULL
accordingly	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
preoccupied	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
cloud	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
brow	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
smallest	NULL
appearance	NULL
of	NULL
penitence	NULL
or	NULL
deprecation	NULL
;	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
demeanour	NULL
he	NULL
gained	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
deserving	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
respect	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
extent	NULL
the	NULL
admiration	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
expression	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
repentant	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
aggrieved	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
cloud	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
countenance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
offence	NULL
and	NULL
temper	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
breathed	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
impatient	NULL
sigh	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

----	NULL
"	NULL
At	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
rang	NULL
the	NULL
door-bell	NULL
.	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
knew	NULL
perfectly	NULL
well	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
baker	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
similarly	NULL
initiated	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
secrets	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
she	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
almost	NULL
wrung	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
let	NULL
it	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
will	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
again	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
tone	NULL
of	NULL
entreaty	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Before	NULL
you	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
Heaven	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
refuse	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
cried	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
anybody	NULL
had	NULL
but	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
!	NULL

as	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
the	NULL
minute	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Thomas	NULL
did	NULL
hear	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
his	NULL
young	NULL
mistress	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
luncheon	NULL
was	NULL
waiting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
did	NULL
all	NULL
but	NULL
knock	NULL
downstairs	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
sudden	NULL
and	NULL
unlooked-for	NULL
exit	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
impression	NULL
naturally	NULL
conveyed	NULL
to	NULL
Thomas	NULL
by	NULL
these	NULL
words	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
clearest	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
distinct	NULL
description	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
even	NULL
known	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
That	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
knew	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
as	NULL
spoke	NULL
more	NULL
plain	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
rushed	NULL
downstairs	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
Thomas	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
unenviable	NULL
frame	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
rain	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
meeting	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
friends	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
size	NULL
and	NULL
principles	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
meeting	NULL
anybody	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
vast	NULL
distinction	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
everybody	NULL
is	NULL
aware	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
,	NULL
between	NULL
physical	NULL
and	NULL
moral	NULL
strength	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
tears	NULL
and	NULL
anxieties	NULL
passed	NULL
off	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
miraculous	NULL
manner	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
visitor	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
downstairs	NULL
and	NULL
ate	NULL
her	NULL
luncheon	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
serenest	NULL
brow	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
agreeable	NULL
ladylike	NULL
appetite	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
fib	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
may	NULL
perhaps	NULL
be	NULL
supposed	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
expecting	NULL
people	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
hour	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
always	NULL
did	NULL
expect	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
kept	NULL
back	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
rain	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
justified	NULL
in	NULL
looking	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
her	NULL
warm	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
duties	NULL
of	NULL
hospitality	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
rained	NULL
so	NULL
heavily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
nobody	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
maidenly	NULL
and	NULL
delicate	NULL
repast	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
step	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
taken	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
taken	NULL
triumphantly	NULL
.	NULL

Henceforward	NULL
,	NULL
whatever	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
's	NULL
illusions	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
stand	NULL
calm	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
eminence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
conclude	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
raise	NULL
the	NULL
widow	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
lowly	NULL
estate	NULL
.	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
such	NULL
idea	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
marrying	NULL
her	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
heir	NULL
would	NULL
ever	NULL
present	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
information	NULL
went	NULL
--	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
thought	NULL
was	NULL
equally	NULL
removed	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
personage	NULL
unknown	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
denounced	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
impostor	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
affect	NULL
the	NULL
value	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
suggestion	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
instrument	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
used	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
big	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
defend	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
whose	NULL
account	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
philanthropist	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
compunctions	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
step	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
taken	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
taken	NULL
successfully	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
after	NULL
this	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
difficulties	NULL
began	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
knew	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
and	NULL
identify	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
assail	NULL
and	NULL
vanquish	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
mysterious	NULL
Mr	NULL
Kavan	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
abused	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
widow	NULL
defended	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
military	NULL
genius	NULL
knows	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
commencement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
campaign	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
conduct	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
considered	NULL
so	NULL
closely	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
alone	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dull	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
that	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
half-holiday	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
because	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
judged	NULL
it	NULL
best	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
subject	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
undeveloped	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
much	NULL
questioning	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
sent	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
note	NULL
to	NULL
satisfy	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
telling	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
herself	NULL
easy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
bully	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
confide	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
devotion	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
affectionate	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
thus	NULL
satisfied	NULL
the	NULL
immediate	NULL
demands	NULL
of	NULL
friendship	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
reflect	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
exciting	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
difficulties	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
stimulated	NULL
her	NULL
genius	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
any	NULL
selfish	NULL
advantage	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
neighbour	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
most	NULL
sublime	NULL
manifestation	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
neighbour	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
injured	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
been	NULL
insensible	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
attractions	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL

the	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
unpardonable	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
sought	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
scriptural	NULL
coals	NULL
of	NULL
fire	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL

she	NULL
pondered	NULL
her	NULL
great	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL

The	NULL
enterprise	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
vanity	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
vanity	NULL

a	NULL

The	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL

that	NULL

Mrs	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL

as	NULL
people	NULL

It	NULL

accordingly	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
sense	NULL

on	NULL
both	NULL

would	NULL
not	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
wise	NULL
to	NULL
pretend	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
visit	NULL
of	NULL
regard	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
wise	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
interlocutor	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
clever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
prone	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
every	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
expression	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
flattered	NULL
herself	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
sufficient	NULL
experience	NULL
to	NULL
enable	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
dismiss	NULL

when	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
occasion	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL

all	NULL
expression	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL

But	NULL
such	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
her	NULL
policy	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
faces	NULL
had	NULL
touched	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
loving	NULL
and	NULL
sisterly	NULL
salutation	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
owners	NULL
immediately	NULL
separated	NULL

regarded	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
from	NULL
two	NULL
opposite	NULL
chairs	NULL

without	NULL
decided	NULL
hostility	NULL

it	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL

whom	NULL
it	NULL

And	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
expedient	NULL

under	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

from	NULL
me	NULL

impossible	NULL

"	NULL
continued	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Mr	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
,	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
absurdity	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL

explained	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
struck	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
boisterous	NULL
_	NULL
badinage	NULL

.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mingled	NULL
terror	NULL
and	NULL
relief	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
excited	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
serenely	NULL
smiling	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
mimic	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
nerves	NULL
strung	NULL
to	NULL
desperation	NULL
,	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
wildest	NULL
comic	NULL
travesty	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
looks	NULL
and	NULL
manners	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
inquiries	NULL
about	NULL
Harry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sent	NULL
her	NULL
unsuspicious	NULL
husband	NULL
into	NULL
convulsions	NULL
of	NULL
laughter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
laughed	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
tears	NULL
ran	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
cheeks	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
unconscious	NULL
simpleton	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
him	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
trample	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL

or	NULL
put	NULL
pins	NULL
into	NULL
him	NULL

or	NULL
scratch	NULL
his	NULL
beaming	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
into	NULL
hysterics	NULL
instead	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
possessed	NULL
that	NULL
other	NULL
safety-valve	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
that	NULL
supreme	NULL
composure	NULL
and	NULL
self-command	NULL
which	NULL
belonged	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
higher	NULL
organisation	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wrote	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
letter	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
dreadful	NULL
headache	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
after	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
considering	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
weak-minded	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
last	NULL
resource	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
headache	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
disturbed	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
beneficent	NULL
progress	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
acquired	NULL
any	NULL
distinct	NULL
information	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
gained	NULL
a	NULL
moral	NULL
certainty	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
measured	NULL
the	NULL
forces	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
's	NULL
bodyguard	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
them	NULL
utterly	NULL
unequal	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
prolonged	NULL
resistance	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
wanted	NULL
was	NULL
prudence	NULL
and	NULL
care	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
good	NULL
luck	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
an	NULL
endowment	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
way	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
qualities	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
secured	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL
meditating	NULL
her	NULL
next	NULL
step	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
difficulty	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
consciousness	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
skill	NULL
and	NULL
power	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
required	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
on	NULL
three	NULL
different	NULL
threads	NULL
of	NULL
innocent	NULL
intrigue	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
different	NULL
persons	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
drama	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
ever	NULL
letting	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
web	NULL
get	NULL
confused	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
confounding	NULL
one	NULL
strand	NULL
with	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
frighten	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
might	NULL
marry	NULL
the	NULL
impostor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
the	NULL
widow	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
profoundest	NULL
ignorance	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
suggestion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
manage	NULL
and	NULL
guide	NULL
the	NULL
impostor	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
deliver	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
enemies	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
his	NULL
would-be	NULL
persecutor	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
harmless	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
by	NULL
chance	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
forget	NULL
herself	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
for	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
betray	NULL
her	NULL
mode	NULL
of	NULL
dealing	NULL
with	NULL
either	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
person	NULL
interested	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
farewell	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
hopes	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
required	NULL
was	NULL
skill	NULL
and	NULL
self-possession	NULL
and	NULL
courage	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
knew	NULL
herself	NULL
too	NULL
well	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
afraid	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
done	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
sweet	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
well-regulated	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
internal	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
alone	NULL
that	NULL
Providence	NULL
limited	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
reward	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
exceptional	NULL
cases	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
virtue	NULL
finds	NULL
its	NULL
just	NULL
acknowledgment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
disinterested	NULL
well-doing	NULL
is	NULL
recompensed	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
deserves	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
arrangement	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
plans	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
interrupted	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
visitor	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
entered	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
brow	NULL
clouded	NULL
by	NULL
care	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
exalted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
charge	NULL
and	NULL
dignity	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
afforded	NULL
to	NULL
every	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Centum	NULL
who	NULL
thus	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
unfold	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
event	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
happen	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

Rose	NULL
was	NULL

soul	NULL

not	NULL
only	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL

her	NULL

also	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

about	NULL
Barbara	NULL
's	NULL
shortcomings	NULL

jealously	NULL
concealing	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL

and	NULL
attacking	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
violence	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL
twice	NULL

six	NULL

she	NULL

tremble	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
alone	NULL

But	NULL
little	NULL
Rose	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
found	NULL
things	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
point	NULL
beyond	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
experience	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

Barbara	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
secret	NULL
meetings	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
whose	NULL
presence	NULL
nobody	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL

and	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
openly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
to	NULL
seek	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
persevered	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
remonstrances	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
clandestine	NULL
career	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
prejudices	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
instincts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
artist	NULL
rose	NULL
up	NULL
against	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
vague	NULL
presentiment	NULL
of	NULL
greater	NULL
evil	NULL
behind	NULL
impelled	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
action	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shame	NULL
and	NULL
pride	NULL
combined	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
her	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
man	NULL
lost	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
straightway	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
piteous	NULL
appeals	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
fuss	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
threw	NULL
the	NULL
burden	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
double	NULL
weight	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Rose	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
pride	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
addition	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
other	NULL
pride	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
these	NULL
painful	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
consult	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
recounted	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
early	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
history	NULL

a	NULL
great	NULL
authority	NULL
at	NULL
Mount	NULL
Pleasant	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
her	NULL
heroic	NULL
belief	NULL
in	NULL
herself	NULL
led	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
,	NULL
others	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
can	NULL
keep	NULL
counsel	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Rose	NULL
felt	NULL
,	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
injured	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
revenged	NULL
herself	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL

confidence	NULL

be	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
extent	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
offence	NULL

All	NULL
these	NULL
motives	NULL

combined	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
intolerable	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
a	NULL
burden	NULL
greater	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
bear	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

Miss	NULL

she	NULL
led	NULL
her	NULL
guests	NULL
downstairs	NULL

luncheon	NULL

was	NULL
every	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
General	NULL

it	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
doubted	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
little	NULL

Mrs	NULL

the	NULL

idea	NULL
what	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
meant	NULL

it	NULL

she	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
generally	NULL
so	NULL
civil	NULL
to	NULL
everybody	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
knew	NULL
perfectly	NULL
well	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL

and	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
imperatively	NULL

down	NULL

Carlingford	NULL
could	NULL

perfectly	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
did	NULL

then	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
human	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL

supposed	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
simply	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL

actuated	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL

on	NULL
strictly	NULL

perceived	NULL

that	NULL
it	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
left	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Centum	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
afraid	NULL

put	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL

trembled	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
uttered	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL

faltering	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
doubtful	NULL
expression	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

humour	NULL
was	NULL
keener	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
this	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
flagged	NULL
slightly	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
undeniably	NULL
received	NULL
a	NULL
shock	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
benevolent	NULL
preoccupation	NULL
and	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
suddenly	NULL
dawned	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
stronghold	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
attacked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tables	NULL
turned	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
twinkling	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
eye	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
discouragement	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
triumphant	NULL
career	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
moments	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
faith	NULL
in	NULL
herself	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
fail	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
faith	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
natural	NULL
born	NULL
subjects	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
creatures	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
bounty	NULL
--	NULL
had	NULL
visibly	NULL
failed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
Rose	NULL
Lake	NULL
nor	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
had	NULL
shown	NULL
that	NULL
confidence	NULL
in	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
genius	NULL
which	NULL
experience	NULL
and	NULL
loyalty	NULL
both	NULL
called	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
downstairs	NULL
to	NULL
resume	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
writing	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
Lancet	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
moments	NULL
of	NULL
sublime	NULL
despondency	NULL
which	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
try	NULL
the	NULL
spirits	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
benefactors	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
race	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
tears	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
reflected	NULL
upon	NULL
this	NULL
great	NULL
problem	NULL
.	NULL

Without	NULL
such	NULL
trials	NULL
genius	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
fully	NULL
know	NULL
itself	NULL
nor	NULL
be	NULL
justly	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
strength	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
no	NULL
temptation	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
disinterested	NULL
exertions	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
effect	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
her	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
pain	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
unbelief	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
followers	NULL
was	NULL
mingled	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
pity	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
weakness	NULL
which	NULL
involves	NULL
pardon	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
wounded	NULL
her	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sorry	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
nature	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
fault	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
fallible	NULL
human	NULL
creatures	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
simple	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
genius	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
shed	NULL
these	NULL
few	NULL
tears	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
subjects	NULL
'	NULL
weakness	NULL
and	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
faith	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
rose	NULL
up	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
new	NULL
strength	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
momentary	NULL
downfall	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sublime	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
giving	NULL
them	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
leaving	NULL
their	NULL
affairs	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
guidance	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
penetrated	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
heroic	NULL
mind	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
human	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
naturally	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
prick	NULL
of	NULL
ingratitude	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
crisis	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
she	NULL
rose	NULL
up	NULL
calmly	NULL
and	NULL
lighted	NULL
her	NULL
candle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
magnanimous	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
performed	NULL
that	NULL
simple	NULL
action	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
lifted	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
feeble	NULL
widow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
of	NULL
Lakes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
burly	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
ungrateful	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
unaware	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
supreme	NULL
claim	NULL
of	NULL
Need	NULL
upon	NULL
Strength	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
the	NULL
wound	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
loyal	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
appeal	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
consciousness	NULL
of	NULL
superior	NULL
Power	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
just	NULL
to	NULL
omit	NULL
all	NULL
mention	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
consolatory	NULL
recollection	NULL
which	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
weakness	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
crisis	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
of	NULL
genius	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
supported	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
very	NULL
trifling	NULL
in	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
instant	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
moisture	NULL
sprang	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Poor	NULL
Tom	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
bitterness	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
extent	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
evaporated	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
way	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
madness	NULL
indeed	NULL
to	NULL
connect	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
way	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
fortunes	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
unlucky	NULL
cousin	NULL
;	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
support	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
amid	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
faith	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
encountering	NULL
,	NULL
Tom	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
insignificant	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
practical	NULL
result	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
anything	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
called	NULL
insignificant	NULL
which	NULL
gives	NULL
strength	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
mind	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
discouragement	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
"	NULL
Poor	NULL
Tom	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
lean	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
comforted	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
mention	NULL
this	NULL
fact	NULL
rather	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
contribution	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
history	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
phenomena	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
human	NULL

which	NULL

as	NULL

than	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
actual	NULL
circumstance	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
simple	NULL

unlucky	NULL
fellow	NULL

and	NULL
yet	NULL
a	NULL
sensation	NULL
of	NULL
comfort	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

she	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
prepared	NULL
her	NULL
toilette	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
evening	NULL

to	NULL
take	NULL
tea	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Lakes	NULL

with	NULL
greater	NULL

than	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL

upon	NULL
a	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL

to	NULL

dressed	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL

high	NULL

which	NULL
she	NULL

brought	NULL
into	NULL
fashion	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
simple	NULL
evening	NULL
toilette	NULL
required	NULL
many	NULL
adjuncts	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
necessary	NULL
on	NULL
other	NULL
occasions	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
destination	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
the	NULL
four	NULL
distinct	NULL
aims	NULL
of	NULL
pleasing	NULL
Rose	NULL

of	NULL

of	NULL
being	NULL

as	NULL

in	NULL
harmony	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
punctual	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL

her	NULL

as	NULL

indeed	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL

she	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
house	NULL

where	NULL

naturally	NULL

there	NULL
had	NULL

for	NULL

Mr	NULL

his	NULL

was	NULL
taking	NULL

tea	NULL
an	NULL

received	NULL
his	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL

to	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
honours	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
suppressed	NULL
exultation	NULL
and	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
triumph	NULL

which	NULL
proved	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
plan	NULL
was	NULL
indeed	NULL
an	NULL
inspiration	NULL
of	NULL
genius	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Rose	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
describe	NULL
what	NULL
were	NULL
her	NULL
sensations	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
faith	NULL
still	NULL
failed	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
momentous	NULL
hour	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
sceptical	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
naturally	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
regarded	NULL
everybody	NULL
with	NULL
jealous	NULL
scrutiny	NULL

expectation	NULL
and	NULL
distrust	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
conspirator	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
profoundly	NULL
excited	NULL
and	NULL
curious	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
betray	NULL
and	NULL
interfere	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
such	NULL
treachery	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Rose	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
specially	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
visit	NULL

yet	NULL
Rose	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
cool	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
fully	NULL

appreciate	NULL
her	NULL
condescension	NULL

but	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
happily	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
magnanimous	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
purpose	NULL
to	NULL
support	NULL
her	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
comprehensive	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
larger	NULL
application	NULL

anything	NULL
that	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL

with	NULL

looked	NULL
round	NULL

In	NULL
all	NULL
Carlingford	NULL

was	NULL
no	NULL

enjoyed	NULL
a	NULL

consequently	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
delicious	NULL
sense	NULL

chivalrous	NULL
deference	NULL

equality	NULL

in	NULL
his	NULL
tea	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
Barbara	NULL
's	NULL
thoughts	NULL
were	NULL
occupied	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
different	NULL
subject	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
Rose	NULL
had	NULL
but	NULL
little	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
spare	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
papa	NULL
's	NULL
comforts	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
special	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
larger	NULL
mind	NULL
embraced	NULL
everything	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
fingers	NULL
itching	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
the	NULL
bread-and-butter	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
tea	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
indignation	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
great	NULL
creature	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
level	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
crimson	NULL
bloom	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
that	NULL
three	NULL
lumps	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL
liked	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
taken	NULL
tea	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
before	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
second	NULL
cup	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
dispensed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
exactly	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
taste	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
Barbara	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
learned	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
wonder	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
contemptuous	NULL
indignation	NULL
arose	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
calm	NULL
and	NULL
impartial	NULL
bosom	NULL
of	NULL
genius	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
Rose	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
Rose	NULL
was	NULL
good	NULL
for	NULL
something	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
a	NULL
set-off	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
respect	NULL
for	NULL
use	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
person	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
appreciate	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
truly	NULL
enlightened	NULL
mind	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
creature	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
earthly	NULL
good	NULL
irritated	NULL
her	NULL
well-regulated	NULL
spirit	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
contralto	NULL
(	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
fine	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
professionally	NULL
)	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
sufficient	NULL
moment	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
to	NULL
excuse	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
for	NULL
not	NULL
knowing	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
a	NULL
comfortable	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
tea	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
nine	NULL
o'clock	NULL
before	NULL
Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
walk	NULL

by	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
dark	NULL

the	NULL
lamp	NULL
outside	NULL

lighted	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

the	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
seat	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
witnessing	NULL
everything	NULL

it	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
denied	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
excited	NULL
when	NULL
Barbara	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL

leaving	NULL
Rose	NULL
alone	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
guest	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
beat	NULL

two	NULL

the	NULL
first	NULL

though	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
parlour	NULL

Grove	NULL

the	NULL

There	NULL

nobody	NULL

an	NULL

grinding	NULL
a	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
childish	NULL
fury	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
just	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sitting	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL

within	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
lamp	NULL

the	NULL
organ-grinder	NULL

and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Jane	NULL
Hemmings	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
staircase	NULL

--	NULL
just	NULL
where	NULL
Barbara	NULL

placed	NULL
her	NULL

where	NULL
that	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
calculated	NULL
on	NULL

her	NULL

when	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
promenade	NULL
of	NULL
triumph	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
partially	NULL
lighted	NULL
street	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
clandestine	NULL
suitor	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
Barbara	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
Miss	NULL
Jane	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL

and	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
public	NULL
opinion	NULL

thus	NULL
watching	NULL

her	NULL

at	NULL
all	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
herself	NULL

or	NULL
indignant	NULL
at	NULL
being	NULL
spied	NULL
upon	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
apotheosis	NULL

Barbara	NULL

only	NULL
second	NULL

the	NULL

accomplished	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
Church	NULL

Brussels	NULL

grew	NULL
more	NULL

more	NULL
real	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL

Thus	NULL
neither	NULL
the	NULL
actors	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
drama	NULL

the	NULL
principal	NULL
spectator	NULL

were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

disturbed	NULL
by	NULL
horror	NULL

shame	NULL

sense	NULL

the	NULL

Rose	NULL

Naturally	NULL
nobody	NULL

Rose	NULL

Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL

took	NULL
her	NULL
admirer	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL
little	NULL
artist	NULL

and	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
put	NULL
back	NULL
her	NULL
small	NULL
assailant	NULL
softly	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL

and	NULL
smoothed	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL

"	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

then	NULL
there	NULL
followed	NULL
a	NULL
pause	NULL

a	NULL

The	NULL

stopped	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
scarcely	NULL
any	NULL

the	NULL
street	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

seized	NULL
them	NULL

their	NULL

grew	NULL
in	NULL
interest	NULL

even	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL

the	NULL

Barbara	NULL
's	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL

the	NULL

deeper	NULL

with	NULL
which	NULL
Rose	NULL
had	NULL
but	NULL
little	NULL
acquaintance	NULL

which	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL

while	NULL
her	NULL

sat	NULL
panting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
corner	NULL

Miss	NULL

looking	NULL

joints	NULL

feeling	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL

her	NULL

For	NULL

after	NULL
all	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
small	NULL
enterprise	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
forth	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
denounce	NULL
the	NULL

his	NULL

and	NULL
take	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
enchantress	NULL

but	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
show	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
true	NULL

A	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

not	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
rule	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
all	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
purely	NULL
egotistical	NULL
sway	NULL
of	NULL
Barbara	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
magnanimous	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
that	NULL
pity	NULL
itself	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
mingled	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
disdain	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
quite	NULL
still	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
that	NULL
Barbara	NULL
grew	NULL
intoxicated	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
triumph	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
movement	NULL
of	NULL
compassion	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
breadth	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
human	NULL
sympathy	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
waited	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
latest	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
deluded	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
imaginary	NULL
victory	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
rose	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
solemnity	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
an	NULL
unappreciated	NULL
kiss	NULL
to	NULL
Rose	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
kept	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
corner	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Good-night	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
going	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
words	NULL
were	NULL
simple	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
yet	NULL
they	NULL
rang	NULL
in	NULL
Rose	NULL
's	NULL
ears	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
signal	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
conspiracy	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
calm	NULL
leader	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
expedition	NULL
went	NULL
forth	NULL
,	NULL
sensible	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
importance	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mission	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
tranquil	NULL
as	NULL
great	NULL
minds	NULL
always	NULL
are	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
danger	NULL
,	NULL
Rose	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
too	NULL
and	NULL
followed	NULL
,	NULL
trembling	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
limb	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
thrown	NULL
herself	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
spears	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
person	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
_	NULL
élan	NULL
_	NULL
of	NULL
indignation	NULL
and	NULL
passion	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
waiting	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
meeting	NULL
her	NULL
antagonists	NULL
in	NULL
reasonable	NULL
combat	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
deliberately	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
unnecessary	NULL
haste	NULL
,	NULL
sweeping	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
dusky	NULL
twilight	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
virginal	NULL
white	NULL
draperies	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
ordinary	NULL
scene	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
excitement	NULL
,	NULL
Rose	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
observing	NULL
involuntarily	NULL
its	NULL
pictorial	NULL
qualities	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
only	NULL
any	NULL
painter	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
transferred	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
canvas	NULL
the	NULL
subdued	NULL
musical	NULL
hum	NULL
of	NULL
surrounding	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
fragrance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mignonette	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
peaceful	NULL
stillness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sky	NULL
shone	NULL
out	NULL
green-blue	NULL
,	NULL
lambent	NULL
and	NULL
wistful	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
vacant	NULL
space	NULL
between	NULL
Miss	NULL
Hemmings	NULL
's	NULL
and	NULL
Mr	NULL
Wrangle	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
dusky	NULL
twilight	NULL
shadows	NULL
below	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
yellow	NULL
gleam	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lamp	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Barbara	NULL
's	NULL
exulting	NULL
,	NULL
triumphant	NULL
figure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
robes	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
avenging	NULL
angel	NULL
.	NULL

Rose	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
observed	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
stilled	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
breathless	NULL
awe	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
solemn	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
struck	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
being	NULL
somehow	NULL
like	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Millais	NULL
's	NULL
pictures	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
lovers	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
turned	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
consequently	NULL
met	NULL
her	NULL
straight	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
suave	NULL
and	NULL
smiling	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
garden	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
_	NULL
is	NULL
_	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
so	NULL
glad	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
hoping	NULL
and	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
I	NULL
heard	NULL
you	NULL
talking	NULL
I	NULL
felt	NULL
sure	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
your	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
greeting	NULL
she	NULL
addressed	NULL
to	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
's	NULL
lover	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
his	NULL
part	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
growing	NULL
red	NULL
and	NULL
growing	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
struck	NULL
dumb	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
unlooked-for	NULL
meeting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
never	NULL
before	NULL
had	NULL
entered	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
worse	NULL
actions	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
Barbara	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
calculated	NULL
upon	NULL
this	NULL
open	NULL
encounter	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
giving	NULL
him	NULL
any	NULL
assistance	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
duty	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
only	NULL
tossed	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
giggled	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
embarrassment	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
pride	NULL
than	NULL
shame	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
disappear	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
pavement	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
once	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
Rose	NULL
were	NULL
agreed	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
a	NULL
gulf	NULL
had	NULL
opened	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
jumped	NULL
into	NULL
it	NULL
without	NULL
ever	NULL
pausing	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
himself	NULL
why	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
as	NULL
placid	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
expecting	NULL
his	NULL
reply	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
friendly	NULL
observations	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
realised	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
need	NULL
to	NULL
wipe	NULL
his	NULL
forehead	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
hot	NULL
and	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
tongue	NULL
frozen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
horror	NULL
he	NULL
woke	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Comus	NULL
's	NULL
revellers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
changed	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
likeness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
creature	NULL
he	NULL
consorted	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
an	NULL
ass	NULL
's	NULL
head	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
more	NULL
startled	NULL
and	NULL
horrified	NULL
than	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
imbecility	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
giggle	NULL
like	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
answer	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
remark	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
!	NULL

yes	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
my	NULL
voice	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
very	NULL
sorry	NULL
to	NULL
separate	NULL
you	NULL
from	NULL
Barbara	NULL

said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
is	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL

you	NULL
know	NULL

much	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL

good-night	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL

catch	NULL
cold	NULL

thank	NULL
you	NULL

for	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
pleasant	NULL
evening	NULL

said	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
pressing	NULL
another	NULL
kiss	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
friend	NULL
's	NULL
unwilling	NULL
cheek	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
sweeping	NULL
her	NULL
white	NULL
garments	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
narrow	NULL
gateway	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
's	NULL
arm	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
brother	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
fetch	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
us	NULL
go	NULL
round	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
chapel	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL

Be	NULL
sure	NULL

practise	NULL
for	NULL
Thursday	NULL

Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
bid	NULL
your	NULL
papa	NULL
good-night	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL

"	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
carried	NULL
off	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
finally	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
Barbara	NULL
's	NULL
very	NULL
fingers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
sisters	NULL
were	NULL
left	NULL
standing	NULL
together	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
stare	NULL
at	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
extremity	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
amazement	NULL
.	NULL

Rose	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
remained	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
by	NULL
far	NULL
the	NULL
guiltiest	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
miserable	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
party	NULL
,	NULL
ran	NULL
upstairs	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
cried	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
would	NULL
break	NULL
.	NULL

Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
past	NULL
crying	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
watched	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
white	NULL
dress	NULL
disappearing	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
with	NULL
indescribable	NULL
emotions	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
call	NULL
the	NULL
police	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
appeal	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
crier	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
her	NULL
lover	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
has	NULL
lost	NULL
:	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
carried	NULL
off	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
strong	NULL
hand	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
watch	NULL
him	NULL
gradually	NULL
going	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
disappearing	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
his	NULL
steps	NULL
withdrawing	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
--	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
trial	NULL
as	NULL
few	NULL
are	NULL
called	NULL
upon	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stood	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
after	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
so	NULL
sudden	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
affair	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

Barbara	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
realise	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
revolution	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
effected	NULL
;	NULL
--	NULL
one	NULL
minute	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
leaning	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
triumphant	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
show	NULL
and	NULL
exhibition	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pride	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
she	NULL
standing	NULL
here	NULL
watching	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
blank	NULL
countenance	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
despairing	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
pounced	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
carried	NULL
him	NULL
off	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
cruel	NULL
grasp	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
blow	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
sudden	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Barbara	NULL
stood	NULL
speechless	NULL
and	NULL
motionless	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
departing	NULL
figures	NULL
had	NULL
vanished	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

Would	NULL
he	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
gone	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
and	NULL
ever	NULL
?	NULL

Such	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
thoughts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
forsaken	NULL
maiden	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
paralysed	NULL
under	NULL
this	NULL
sudden	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
fortune	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
some	NULL
cruel	NULL
spectator	NULL
had	NULL
thrown	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
that	NULL
Brussels	NULL
veil	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
imagination	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
played	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Barbara	NULL
had	NULL
stood	NULL
heart-struck	NULL
,	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
filmy	NULL
tissue	NULL
dissolve	NULL
into	NULL
ashes	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
sudden	NULL
anguish	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
acute	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
Barbara	NULL
's	NULL
pangs	NULL
were	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
light	NULL
touch	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
doomed	NULL
feet	NULL
turn	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
dangerous	NULL
direction	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
became	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
led	NULL
beyond	NULL
all	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
resistance	NULL
,	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
fate	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
consolation	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
dark	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
conceal	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
white	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
the	NULL
well-known	NULL
form	NULL
and	NULL
lineaments	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
monarch	NULL
of	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
whose	NULL
company	NULL
nobody	NULL
could	NULL
pass	NULL
unobserved	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
faced	NULL
danger	NULL
by	NULL
sea	NULL
and	NULL
land	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
average	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
courage	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
danger	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
walk	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
street	NULL

which	NULL
afterwards	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
St	NULL

it	NULL

Mr	NULL

that	NULL
evening	NULL
by	NULL
General	NULL
Travers	NULL

whose	NULL
claim	NULL

was	NULL
too	NULL
decided	NULL

never	NULL

very	NULL
well	NULL
what	NULL
passed	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
when	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
expound	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
urgent	NULL
necessity	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
confide	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL

the	NULL

which	NULL
he	NULL

himself	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL

taken	NULL
leave	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
watched	NULL
her	NULL
white	NULL

sweep	NULL
away	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
garden	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
only	NULL
remaining	NULL
protector	NULL
who	NULL
thus	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL

smoked	NULL
a	NULL

cigar	NULL

Mr	NULL

been	NULL
accompanied	NULL
home	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL

had	NULL
turned	NULL
up	NULL

unlucky	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL

was	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
supposed	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
behaved	NULL
himself	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
like	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL

since	NULL
General	NULL

had	NULL
no	NULL

undesirable	NULL

anything	NULL

The	NULL
General	NULL

indeed	NULL

it	NULL

quite	NULL
natural	NULL

Mr	NULL

had	NULL
only	NULL
himself	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
habitation	NULL
perfect	NULL

he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
pass	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL

home	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL

though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
particularly	NULL
given	NULL

he	NULL

an	NULL

not	NULL
give	NULL

Mr	NULL

General	NULL

could	NULL
not	NULL

feel	NULL
the	NULL
force	NULL

the	NULL
contrast	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
deep	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL

by	NULL

he	NULL
felt	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
describe	NULL
his	NULL
feelings	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
knocking	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
poor	NULL
places	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
clandestine	NULL
visits	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL

and	NULL
hovering	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
suburban	NULL
simplicity	NULL
of	NULL
Grove	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
enveloped	NULL
and	NULL
surrounded	NULL
by	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
pleasant	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
and	NULL
comfortable	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
outer	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
wonderfully	NULL
consolatory	NULL
and	NULL
agreeable	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dreadfully	NULL
harassed	NULL
condition	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
preoccupied	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
degree	NULL
,	NULL
wondering	NULL
what	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
really	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
far	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
betrayed	NULL
himself	NULL

and	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
extent	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
safe	NULL

as	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
said	NULL

to	NULL
confide	NULL
in	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL

time	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL

show	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
General	NULL
's	NULL

and	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
a	NULL
painful	NULL
effort	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
recall	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mutual	NULL

referred	NULL
to	NULL

whose	NULL
names	NULL

persons	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL

felt	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL

refreshing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

fell	NULL

upon	NULL
Mr	NULL

whose	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL

,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL

it	NULL
slightly	NULL
resembled	NULL

The	NULL
gallant	NULL
General	NULL
made	NULL
himself	NULL
so	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL
nearly	NULL
drove	NULL
the	NULL
unfortunate	NULL

out	NULL

,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
exhausted	NULL
all	NULL

returned	NULL

said	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
frightful	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
self-control	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
at	NULL
full	NULL
strain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
occur	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
nobody	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
senses	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
applied	NULL
the	NULL
term	NULL
"	NULL
little	NULL
thing	NULL

to	NULL
Barbara	NULL

and	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
slow	NULL
aggravation	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
submitting	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
insolent	NULL
soldier	NULL
interfering	NULL
in	NULL
Grove	NULL
Street	NULL
was	NULL
beyond	NULL
his	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
endurance	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
General	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
tone	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
exclamation	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
too	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Yes	NULL

"	NULL
with	NULL
equally	NULL
unmistakable	NULL
meaning	NULL

startled	NULL
,	NULL

ready	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
emergency	NULL

Thus	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL

a	NULL
second	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
ordinary	NULL
acceptation	NULL

and	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
eve	NULL

Mr	NULL

had	NULL
,	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
pretty	NULL
nearly	NULL
forgotten	NULL
Barbara	NULL

.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
piquant	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
occupation	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
else	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
morbid	NULL
fancy	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
eve	NULL
of	NULL
turning	NULL
its	NULL
back	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
between	NULL
his	NULL
teeth	NULL
"	NULL
Confound	NULL
these	NULL
women	NULL

and	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
excitement	NULL

the	NULL
approaching	NULL
crisis	NULL

Barbara	NULL

her	NULL
crimson	NULL
cheeks	NULL

and	NULL
her	NULL
level	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
contralto	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
altogether	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
quite	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
may	NULL
feel	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
liberty	NULL
to	NULL
forget	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
when	NULL
other	NULL
matters	NULL
of	NULL
more	NULL
immediate	NULL
interest	NULL
are	NULL
absorbing	NULL
his	NULL
attention	NULL

and	NULL
yet	NULL
be	NULL
driven	NULL
furious	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
suddenly	NULL
presented	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
somebody	NULL
else	NULL

who	NULL
has	NULL
nothing	NULL
earthly	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL

about	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL

recovered	NULL
himself	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
General	NULL
sat	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL

began	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL

defiance	NULL
was	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL

lighted	NULL

he	NULL

the	NULL

soldier	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
naturally	NULL
his	NULL
recollection	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
perfect	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
something	NULL
very	NULL
funny	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
Jove	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
forget	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

General	NULL
Travers	NULL
said	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
his	NULL
host	NULL
at	NULL
breakfast	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
one	NULL
bad	NULL
joke	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
was	NULL
spared	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
shut	NULL
his	NULL
door	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
departing	NULL
guest	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
sense	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
done	NULL
or	NULL
said	NULL
anything	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
funny	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Thank	NULL
Heaven	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
groan	NULL
of	NULL
relief	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
troublesome	NULL
visitor	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
library	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sitting	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
fully	NULL
appreciated	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
comfort	NULL
of	NULL
everything	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
handsome	NULL
house	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
without	NULL
thinking	NULL
anything	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
pleasant	NULL
luxurious	NULL
accessories	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
doing	NULL
without	NULL
them	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
liked	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
rather	NULL
be	NULL
content	NULL
to	NULL
lose	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
stroke	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
known	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ruined	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
his	NULL
fortune	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
should	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Cavendishes	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
the	NULL
person	NULL
it	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
alas	NULL
!	NULL

all	NULL
his	NULL
fortune	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bring	NULL
reality	NULL
to	NULL
these	NULL
pretensions	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
hinder	NULL
the	NULL
exposure	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
horror	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
adventurer	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
base	NULL
one	NULL
;	NULL
nor	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
done	NULL
anything	NULL
dishonourable	NULL
either	NULL
to	NULL
gain	NULL
his	NULL
fortune	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
captivate	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
opinion	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
so	NULL
important	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
actual	NULL
crimes	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
sooner	NULL
forgiven	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
folly	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
permitted	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
considered	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Cavendishes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
set	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
on	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
figure	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
mild	NULL
provincial	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
knew	NULL
enough	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
nature	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
duchess	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
lord-chamberlain	NULL
would	NULL
forgive	NULL
more	NULL
readily	NULL
than	NULL
Mr	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Centum	NULL
any	NULL
such	NULL
imposition	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
intrusion	NULL
into	NULL
their	NULL
exclusive	NULL
circle	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
run	NULL
away	NULL
!	NULL

For	NULL
her	NULL
sake	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
rush	NULL
off	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sell	NULL
his	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
furniture	NULL
and	NULL
horses	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
advantages	NULL
of	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
came	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
stronger	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
has	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
recognised	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
members	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
local	NULL
aristocracy	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
anything	NULL
half	NULL
so	NULL
precious	NULL
as	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
everywhere	NULL
known	NULL
and	NULL
acknowledged	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
constituent	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
;	NULL
--	NULL
recognised	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
passed	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
and	NULL
another	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
stranger	NULL
who	NULL
might	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
ignorant	NULL
as	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
charm	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
universal	NULL
acknowledgment	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
more	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
than	NULL
most	NULL
men	NULL
have	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
signed	NULL
his	NULL
patent	NULL
of	NULL
gentility	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
acknowledged	NULL
and	NULL
prized	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
an	NULL
infinite	NULL
deal	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
keep	NULL
its	NULL
regard	NULL
and	NULL
recognition	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
half	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
parts	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
emergency	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
undue	NULL
confidence	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
magnanimity	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
behave	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
grandeur	NULL
worthy	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
forgive	NULL
the	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fortune	NULL
sooner	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
real	NULL
offence	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Thursday	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
either	NULL
fight	NULL
or	NULL
flee	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
too	NULL
had	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
evenings	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Thursday	NULL
lightly	NULL
as	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
amusing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
assembly	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
has	NULL
thoughts	NULL
like	NULL
these	NULL
to	NULL
entertain	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
nothing	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
useless	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
in	NULL
ordinary	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
three	NULL
o'clock	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
thing	NULL
one	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

Poor	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
free	NULL
to	NULL
act	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
proper	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
position	NULL
to	NULL
shock	NULL
his	NULL
servants	NULL
'	NULL
feelings	NULL
with	NULL
impunity	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
accordingly	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
martyr	NULL
,	NULL
carrying	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
difficulties	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
these	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
companions	NULL
naturally	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
night	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
to	NULL
themselves	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
sheer	NULL
fatigue	NULL
and	NULL
exhaustion	NULL
procured	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
's	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
getting	NULL
deeper	NULL
and	NULL
deeper	NULL
into	NULL
trouble	NULL
:	NULL
for	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
planted	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
foot	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
General	NULL
Travers	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
fatal	NULL
force	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
Grove	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
awoke	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Confound	NULL
these	NULL
women	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
fervour	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
swore	NULL
a	NULL
mighty	NULL
oath	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
horsewhip	NULL
the	NULL
fellow	NULL
who	NULL
ventured	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
great	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
belonged	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
complication	NULL
that	NULL
afforded	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
outlet	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
temper	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dreadful	NULL
difficulties	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
constantly	NULL
renewing	NULL
itself	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
or	NULL
stay	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
presenting	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
in	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
being	NULL
met	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
held	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
public	NULL
contempt	NULL
there	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
looking	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
Travers	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
carry	NULL
the	NULL
narrative	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
too	NULL
horrible	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
contemplated	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
how	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
to	NULL
escape	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
driven	NULL
backwards	NULL
and	NULL
forwards	NULL
by	NULL
every	NULL
new	NULL
wind	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
note	NULL
was	NULL
put	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
long	NULL
consideration	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
determined	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
permitted	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
too	NULL
energetic	NULL
a	NULL
temperament	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
things	NULL
linger	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
uncertain	NULL
way	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
conclusion	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
nobody	NULL
can	NULL
predict	NULL
what	NULL
sudden	NULL
and	NULL
unexpected	NULL
turn	NULL
human	NULL
affairs	NULL
may	NULL
take	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
business	NULL
dramatically	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
of	NULL
everybody	NULL
concerned	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
some	NULL
fine	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
resolved	NULL
itself	NULL
by	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
illegitimate	NULL
and	NULL
incomplete	NULL
expedients	NULL
which	NULL
abound	NULL
in	NULL
ordinary	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
view	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
step	NULL
of	NULL
writing	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sacred	NULL
retirement	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
maiden	NULL
chamber	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
;	NULL
perhaps	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
when	NULL
General	NULL
Travers	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
himself	NULL
have	NULL
vulgarly	NULL
called	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
chaffing	NULL
"	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
and	NULL
disinterested	NULL
friendship	NULL
which	NULL
united	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
sovereign	NULL
of	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
naturally	NULL
such	NULL
poor	NULL
raillery	NULL
was	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
virginal	NULL
thoughts	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
retired	NULL
and	NULL
sacred	NULL
hour	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
may	NULL
venture	NULL
to	NULL
add	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
elevating	NULL
influence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
maiden	NULL
's	NULL
bower	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
composed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
tranquil	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
meditation	NULL
and	NULL
solitude	NULL
,	NULL
breathed	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
line	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
force	NULL
to	NULL
every	NULL
sentiment	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
which	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
tore	NULL
open	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
excited	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
anxious	NULL
and	NULL
curious	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
solemn	NULL
perusal	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
received	NULL
.	NULL

MY	NULL
DEAR	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
unlucky	NULL
that	NULL

interrupted	NULL
this	NULL

such	NULL
an	NULL

I	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL

you	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
thing	NULL
I	NULL

him	NULL
at	NULL

"	NULL
Perhaps	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
foolish	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
suspect	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
such	NULL
treachery	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
beating	NULL
louder	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
position	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
chose	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
supposed	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
aggravating	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
always	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
may	NULL
do	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
looked	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
composure	NULL
of	NULL
desperation	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
soonest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
continue	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
face	NULL
which	NULL
extremity	NULL
rendered	NULL
stolid	NULL
and	NULL
impassible	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
poor	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
colour	NULL
changed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
very	NULL
least	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
expect	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
pardon	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
mingled	NULL
spite	NULL
and	NULL
humiliation	NULL
and	NULL
mortification	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
response	NULL
were	NULL
beyond	NULL
telling	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
blazed	NULL
with	NULL
sudden	NULL
rage	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
passion	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
furious	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
actually	NULL
did	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
an	NULL
imperious	NULL
sign	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL
leave	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
even	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
expect	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
heartless	NULL
way	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
Barbara	NULL
stood	NULL
aghast	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
her	NULL
senses	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
he	NULL
really	NULL
passed	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

Had	NULL
he	NULL
actually	NULL
gone	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
adversary	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
eyes	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
stood	NULL
stock-still	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
gazing	NULL
after	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
blazing	NULL
with	NULL
rage	NULL
and	NULL
despite	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
scarcely	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
herself	NULL
from	NULL
shrieking	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
torrent	NULL
of	NULL
reproaches	NULL
and	NULL
vituperations	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
attempt	NULL
whatever	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
her	NULL
wrath	NULL
or	NULL
jealous	NULL
curiosity	NULL
from	NULL
any	NULL
eyes	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
proper	NULL
pride	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
had	NULL
carried	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
intentions	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
chances	NULL
are	NULL
that	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
driven	NULL
desperate	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
rushed	NULL
after	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
some	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
breaking	NULL
in	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
interview	NULL
with	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
badgering	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
courage	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
intentions	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
sunshiny	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sickening	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
doors	NULL
might	NULL
open	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
fate	NULL
rush	NULL
out	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
soul	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
only	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
poor	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
's	NULL
distempered	NULL
fancy	NULL
that	NULL
somebody	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
thought	NULL
at	NULL
leisure	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
to	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
whether	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
watching	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
his	NULL
senses	NULL
and	NULL
faculties	NULL
were	NULL
engaged	NULL
forecasting	NULL
what	NULL
might	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
reach	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
approaching	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
consequently	NULL
had	NULL
everything	NULL
to	NULL
risk	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Mr	NULL
Centum	NULL
's	NULL
door	NULL
opened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
nurses	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
unfortunate	NULL
man	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
jump	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
drop	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
lower	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
that	NULL
drove	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
refuge	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
open	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
rushed	NULL
in	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
breath	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
safe	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
instant	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
watching	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
divined	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
's	NULL
reasons	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
heart	NULL
too	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
jump	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
wrath	NULL
cooled	NULL
down	NULL
miraculously	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
doubt	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
impatience	NULL
at	NULL
being	NULL
questioned	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
answer	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
deserted	NULL
her	NULL
standard	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
met	NULL
him	NULL
half-way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Barbara	NULL
calmed	NULL
down	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
enter	NULL
at	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
's	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
having	NULL
thus	NULL
witnessed	NULL
his	NULL
safe	NULL
exit	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
at	NULL
liberty	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
affairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
prepare	NULL
her	NULL
toilette	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
moved	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Thursday	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
telling	NULL
what	NULL
might	NULL
happen	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
hero	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
commotion	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
and	NULL
buried	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
's	NULL
back	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
threw	NULL
himself	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wiped	NULL
his	NULL
forehead	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
his	NULL
fault	NULL
if	NULL
events	NULL
had	NULL
overwhelmed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
met	NULL
in	NULL
succession	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
and	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
without	NULL
stopping	NULL
to	NULL
question	NULL
himself	NULL
further	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
accumulation	NULL
.	NULL

Panic	NULL
had	NULL
seized	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
panic	NULL
wrought	NULL
more	NULL
effectually	NULL
than	NULL
all	NULL
argument	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
terrible	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
under	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
shadow	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
put	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
only	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
left	NULL
at	NULL
rest	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
perilous	NULL
leap	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dare	NULL
everything	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
be	NULL
worse	NULL
than	NULL
ruin	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
something	NULL
even	NULL
worse	NULL
than	NULL
ruin	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
thing	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
rest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
meantime	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hide	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
forget	NULL
the	NULL
nightmare	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
seated	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
haste	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
his	NULL
careful	NULL
dress	NULL
and	NULL
pale	NULL
looks	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
frightened	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
second	NULL
that	NULL
despair	NULL
had	NULL
driven	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wits	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
anything	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
tell	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
bottle	NULL
of	NULL
prussic	NULL
acid	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
waistcoat	NULL
pocket	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
idea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
second	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
his	NULL
most	NULL
wise	NULL
and	NULL
laudable	NULL
resolution	NULL
of	NULL
proposing	NULL

that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL

naturally	NULL
a	NULL
serious	NULL

hazardous	NULL

which	NULL

Mr	NULL

added	NULL

watched	NULL

read	NULL

that	NULL

the	NULL

did	NULL

she	NULL
sat	NULL
at	NULL

looked	NULL
out	NULL

fifty	NULL

none	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
just	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
it	NULL
positively	NULL

all	NULL

he	NULL

Now	NULL

all	NULL

tided	NULL
over	NULL

the	NULL
worst	NULL
avoided	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
became	NULL
regretfully	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
now	NULL
no	NULL

higher	NULL

was	NULL
possible	NULL
for	NULL

unfortunate	NULL

might	NULL
once	NULL

and	NULL
with	NULL
hope	NULL

have	NULL
aspired	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
sad	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
help	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
certain	NULL
tenderness	NULL
of	NULL
compassion	NULL
entered	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
bosom	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
realised	NULL
this	NULL
change	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
hard	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
pity	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
thus	NULL
shut	NULL
out	NULL
by	NULL
hard	NULL
fate	NULL
from	NULL
any	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
ever	NULL
becoming	NULL
the	NULL
companion	NULL
of	NULL

existence	NULL

man	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL

had	NULL

whose	NULL

This	NULL
thought	NULL
filled	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
with	NULL
gentle	NULL
regret	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
sad	NULL

but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
inevitable	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
's	NULL
note	NULL
was	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
simply	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
briefly	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
though	NULL
not	NULL
sure	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
understood	NULL
the	NULL
meaning	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
certainly	NULL
do	NULL
himself	NULL
the	NULL
pleasure	NULL
of	NULL
accepting	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
her	NULL
kind	NULL
invitation	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
regret	NULL
grew	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
profound	NULL

Such	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
appreciating	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
known	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
decline	NULL
upon	NULL
Barbara	NULL
!	NULL

The	NULL
pity	NULL
was	NULL
entirely	NULL
disinterested	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
nobody	NULL
knew	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
arrangement	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
might	NULL
marry	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-master	NULL
's	NULL
daughter	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
well	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
position	NULL
in	NULL
society	NULL

have	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
consent	NULL

marriage	NULL

anybody	NULL

daughter	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL

But	NULL
still	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pity	NULL
--	NULL
nobody	NULL
could	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
pity	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
so	NULL
visibly	NULL
capable	NULL

better	NULL
things	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

however	NULL

could	NULL
not	NULL
afford	NULL

her	NULL

An	NULL
evening	NULL

many	NULL

change	NULL

to	NULL
bring	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
to	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
interesting	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL

to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL

she	NULL
could	NULL
look	NULL
by	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
exhibition	NULL
of	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
feelings	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
naturally	NULL
a	NULL
trial	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
had	NULL
drawn	NULL
back	NULL
once	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
was	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
more	NULL
attractive	NULL
than	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
widow	NULL
,	NULL
forlorn	NULL
and	NULL
faded	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
wonder	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
acknowledged	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
ancient	NULL
object	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
affections	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
among	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
fresh	NULL
young	NULL
faces	NULL
of	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
:	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
should	NULL
draw	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
step	NULL
in	NULL
--	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
rose	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
shook	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
draperies	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
shaking	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
idea	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
At	NULL
all	NULL
events	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
my	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
thus	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
last	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
exquisite	NULL
refinement	NULL
of	NULL
well-doing	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
possibly	NULL
be	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
harm	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
benefiting	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
heroically	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
hat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
issued	NULL
forth	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dinner-hour	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
pupils	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
invite	NULL
her	NULL
last	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
important	NULL
guest	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
period	NULL
of	NULL
suspense	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
means	NULL
a	NULL
happy	NULL
or	NULL
comfortable	NULL
period	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
poor	NULL
widow	NULL
was	NULL
living	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
constant	NULL
expectation	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
happening	NULL
,	NULL
whereas	NULL
her	NULL
only	NULL
true	NULL
policy	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
would	NULL
ever	NULL
happen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shaped	NULL
herself	NULL
accordingly	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Instead	NULL
of	NULL
eating	NULL
her	NULL
dinner	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
hour	NULL
of	NULL
leisure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fortifying	NULL
herself	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
weary	NULL
afternoon	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
when	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
tedious	NULL
business	NULL
looking	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
rain	NULL
was	NULL
drenching	NULL
the	NULL
four	NULL
walls	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
and	NULL
breaking	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
flowers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
reducing	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
little	NULL
shrubs	NULL
to	NULL
abject	NULL
misery	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
cheerful	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sunshine	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
pleasant	NULL
sounds	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
over	NULL
that	NULL
enclosure	NULL
--	NULL
voices	NULL
and	NULL
footsteps	NULL
of	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
called	NULL
alive	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
this	NULL
solitary	NULL
woman	NULL
was	NULL
buried	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
a	NULL
fate	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
accepted	NULL
when	NULL
people	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
their	NULL
minds	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
making	NULL
up	NULL
one	NULL

one	NULL
fixes	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
thoughts	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
outside	NULL

and	NULL
fancies	NULL
that	NULL
every	NULL
moment	NULL

call	NULL
may	NULL
come	NULL

and	NULL
one	NULL
may	NULL
find	NULL
one	NULL

the	NULL
active	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
tedium	NULL
grows	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
insupportable	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
naturally	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
any	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
should	NULL
sit	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
--	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
content	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
eat	NULL
her	NULL
dinner	NULL
instead	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
are	NULL

the	NULL

notice	NULL

he	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

her	NULL
constitution	NULL

,	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
medical	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
perhaps	NULL
so	NULL
liable	NULL
to	NULL
parental	NULL
anxieties	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
unprofessional	NULL
father	NULL
might	NULL

even	NULL
he	NULL

little	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
appearance	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL

yet	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
observe	NULL
that	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

said	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fact	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
doubted	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL

said	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
more	NULL
colour	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
pulse	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
steady	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
ordinary	NULL
rate	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
admirable	NULL
circulation	NULL
was	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
affected	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
ordinary	NULL
rose-tints	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
complexion	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
deepened	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

distinctly	NULL
an	NULL
improvement	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
been	NULL
habitually	NULL
pale	NULL

but	NULL
still	NULL
the	NULL
flush	NULL
was	NULL
moderate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
no	NULL
harm	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
larger	NULL
party	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
received	NULL

the	NULL

all	NULL
her	NULL
ordinary	NULL
ease	NULL

self-possession	NULL

but	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
excitement	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
eve	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
crisis	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
failure	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
success	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
public	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
naturally	NULL
she	NULL
anticipated	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
emotion	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
sufficient	NULL
sense	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
very	NULL
early	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
corner	NULL

keep	NULL
himself	NULL
out	NULL

the	NULL

for	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
screwed	NULL
up	NULL

the	NULL
emergency	NULL

his	NULL
self-possession	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
who	NULL
suffered	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
heightened	NULL
colour	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
conspicuous	NULL

that	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL

because	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
pale	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
pale	NULL

almost	NULL
white	NULL

had	NULL
dark	NULL
eyes	NULL

dark	NULL
hair	NULL

possessed	NULL
precisely	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
accessories	NULL
which	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
complexion	NULL
remarkable	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
this	NULL
evening	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
evident	NULL
that	NULL
even	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
admired	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL

moment	NULL

then	NULL
stopped	NULL
short	NULL

inquire	NULL

"	NULL

to	NULL
which	NULL
question	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
naturally	NULL
replied	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
indignant	NULL
shrug	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
white	NULL
shoulders	NULL
and	NULL
aversion	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
sorry	NULL

perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
night	NULL
only	NULL

Even	NULL
Mr	NULL

would	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
receive	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL

could	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL

bury	NULL
himself	NULL

nobody	NULL

she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL

be	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
the	NULL

her	NULL

did	NULL

nor	NULL
keep	NULL

the	NULL

had	NULL
by	NULL

put	NULL
his	NULL
finger	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL

when	NULL
he	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL

that	NULL
instead	NULL

handing	NULL
her	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
General	NULL
Travers	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
down	NULL

dinner	NULL

would	NULL

Fortunately	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL

the	NULL

declining	NULL

as	NULL
Mrs	NULL

A	NULL
close	NULL
observer	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
remarked	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
and	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
took	NULL
their	NULL
places	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
both	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
flush	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
noticeable	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
time	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
quite	NULL
pale	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
trial	NULL
.	NULL

Poor	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
excitement	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
,	NULL
immediately	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
lamp	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
unsuspecting	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
said	NULL
grace	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
decorously	NULL
cast	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
owned	NULL
the	NULL
ordinary	NULL
weakness	NULL
of	NULL
humanity	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
drop	NULL
her	NULL
fan	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
napkin	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
arranged	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
symmetrical	NULL
pyramid	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
plate	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
a	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
feebleness	NULL
could	NULL
but	NULL
endear	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
everybody	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
momentous	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
crisis	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
these	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
happily	NULL
recovered	NULL
and	NULL
everybody	NULL
seated	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
kept	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
fixed	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
terrible	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
raised	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
naturally	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
went	NULL
direct	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
mark	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
arrow	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
surrounded	NULL
by	NULL
every	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
regard	NULL
and	NULL
consideration	NULL
,	NULL
full	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lamp	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
favourite	NULL
adventurer	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
impostor	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
denounced	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
place	NULL
by	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
rose	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
excitement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
discovery	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
to	NULL
clear	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Good	NULL
God	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
loud	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
accent	NULL
of	NULL
horror	NULL
which	NULL
paralysed	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
people	NULL
lower	NULL
down	NULL
than	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
paralysed	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
lost	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
glance	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
or	NULL
movement	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
large	NULL
person	NULL
.	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
rose	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
height	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
sharply	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
energy	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mr	NULL

said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
somebody	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
indifferent	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
companion	NULL

to	NULL
civility	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
Thomas	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
soup	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
hoarsely	NULL
,	NULL
interrupting	NULL
his	NULL
scrutiny	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
eye	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
liberate	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
gaze	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
fixed	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
people	NULL
only	NULL
look	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
mean	NULL
something	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
you	NULL

said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL

She	NULL
spoke	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
nobody	NULL

hear	NULL

himself	NULL

and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

General	NULL

himself	NULL

no	NULL

all	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
never	NULL
turned	NULL
her	NULL

a	NULL

from	NULL
the	NULL

Marjoribanks	NULL
added	NULL

She	NULL
laughed	NULL

spoke	NULL

a	NULL
kind	NULL

laugh	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL

obliging	NULL

her	NULL
ingenuous	NULL
countenance	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
pretty	NULL
pause	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
raised	NULL
her	NULL
confiding	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
cast	NULL
down	NULL

once	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL

face	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

n't	NULL
think	NULL
how	NULL
nice	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL

Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
clasped	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
eloquent	NULL
meaning	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
mistake	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
gazed	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL
.	NULL

Whether	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL

or	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL

more	NULL
completely	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
man	NULL
before	NULL

victim	NULL

some	NULL

kind	NULL
of	NULL
delusion	NULL
,	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
man	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
utterly	NULL
stricken	NULL
dumb	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
accepted	NULL
the	NULL
soup	NULL
humbly	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Thomas	NULL
set	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
soup	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
effeminate	NULL
dish	NULL

which	NULL
went	NULL
utterly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
principles	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
innocent	NULL
young	NULL
creature	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
side	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
flutter	NULL
of	NULL
happy	NULL
confusion	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
terrible	NULL
position	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Broad-Churchman	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
tacit	NULL
confession	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
spring	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
seat	NULL
and	NULL
hurl	NULL
the	NULL
impostor	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

had	NULL
a	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

emotion	NULL
that	NULL

caught	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL
casting	NULL
a	NULL

glance	NULL

she	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL

reassuring	NULL
nod	NULL

which	NULL
the	NULL

watched	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
inward	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL

publicly	NULL

man	NULL

had	NULL
just	NULL
received	NULL
this	NULL
mark	NULL
of	NULL
confidence	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
young	NULL
hostess	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
everything	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
trials	NULL
of	NULL
Christian	NULL
patience	NULL
and	NULL
fortitude	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

as	NULL

himself	NULL

all	NULL

ate	NULL
his	NULL
soup	NULL

never	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
what	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL

That	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
consumed	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
large	NULL
spoonfuls	NULL
without	NULL
being	NULL
aware	NULL

by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
,	NULL
words	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
give	NULL
any	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
ate	NULL
his	NULL
dinner	NULL
sternly	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
anything	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
plate	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
consumed	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
exquisite	NULL
_	NULL
plats	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
tenderest	NULL
wings	NULL
of	NULL
chicken	NULL
and	NULL
morsels	NULL
of	NULL
_	NULL
paté	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
personal	NULL
enemies	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
tables	NULL
altogether	NULL
turned	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
confounded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
mean	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
General	NULL
who	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
's	NULL
abandoned	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
gallant	NULL
soldier	NULL
talked	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
will	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
pleasant	NULL
hours	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
fellow	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
club	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
amused	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
domesticity	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
talk	NULL
very	NULL
natural	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
placed	NULL
at	NULL
table	NULL
between	NULL
his	NULL
friend	NULL
's	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
supposed	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
friend	NULL
's	NULL
future	NULL
bride	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
naturally	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
got	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
benefit	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
received	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
perfect	NULL
grace	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
delicate	NULL
points	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
General	NULL
's	NULL
wit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
appreciated	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
half	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
envy	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
By	NULL
Jove	NULL
!	NULL

he	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
luckiest	NULL
fellow	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
General	NULL
Travers	NULL
said	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
probably	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
charms	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
intelligent	NULL
and	NULL
animated	NULL
conversation	NULL
that	NULL
kept	NULL
the	NULL
ladies	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
at	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
afterwards	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
kept	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
until	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
quite	NULL
ashamed	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
enjoy	NULL
her	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
move	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
was	NULL
fuller	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
.	NULL

Everybody	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
--	NULL
Sir	NULL
John	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
others	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
only	NULL
came	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
exception	NULL
_	NULL
everybody	NULL
_	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
certainly	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
herself	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
half-hour	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
kept	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
regarded	NULL
the	NULL
staircase	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
anxious	NULL
countenance	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
herself	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
helm	NULL
of	NULL
affairs	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
security	NULL
that	NULL
everything	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
tolerably	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
nobody	NULL
could	NULL
tell	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
set	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
themselves	NULL
might	NULL
or	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
dreadful	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
hidden	NULL
away	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
curtains	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
nobody	NULL
,	NULL
speaking	NULL
to	NULL
nobody	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
commit	NULL
suicide	NULL
with	NULL
pleasure	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
cajoled	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
that	NULL
martyrdom	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
civil	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
other	NULL
guests	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
horribly	NULL
preoccupied	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
quite	NULL
unusual	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
sure	NULL
she	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
watching	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
afar	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
eat	NULL
any	NULL
dinner	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
slowly	NULL
and	NULL
extricated	NULL
herself	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
crowd	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
motion	NULL
as	NULL
best	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
young	NULL
friend	NULL
's	NULL
aid	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
radiant	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
observant	NULL
assembly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
change	NULL
occurred	NULL
in	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
suddenly	NULL
that	NULL
nobody	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
actual	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
revolution	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
's	NULL
arm	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
come	NULL
upstairs	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
old	NULL
friend	NULL
of	NULL
yours	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
who	NULL
wants	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
led	NULL
him	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
conqueror	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
led	NULL
a	NULL
captive	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
crowd	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
dispensed	NULL
on	NULL
every	NULL
side	NULL
her	NULL
most	NULL
gracious	NULL
glances	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
coming	NULL
directly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
said	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
naturally	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
on	NULL
all	NULL
sides	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
most	NULL
people	NULL
remarked	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
also	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
very	NULL
sullen	NULL
and	NULL
lowering	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
watching	NULL
that	NULL
triumphal	NULL
progress	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
certainly	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
fault	NULL
if	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
and	NULL
Lady	NULL
Richmond	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
other	NULL
ladies	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
thus	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
form	NULL
a	NULL
false	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
affairs	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Lady	NULL
Richmond	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
by	NULL
and	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

According	NULL
to	NULL
appearances	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
perfectly	NULL
right	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
triumphant	NULL
,	NULL
led	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
length	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
widow	NULL
sat	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
curtains	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
looked	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
visible	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
jealous	NULL
rage	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
highly	NULL
improper	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
clergyman	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
yet	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
exciting	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
drama	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
conclude	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
Lady	NULL
Richmond	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
satisfied	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
naturally	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
consulted	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
held	NULL
in	NULL
leash	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
subdued	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
curiosity	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
daughter	NULL
's	NULL
movements	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
them	NULL
out	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
blaze	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
tempest	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
crimson	NULL
cheeks	NULL
and	NULL
black	NULL
bold	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
herself	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
reins	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
deposited	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
in	NULL
safety	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
faced	NULL
round	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
malcontents	NULL
and	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
observers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
rest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
everything	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
inspection	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
herself	NULL
ready	NULL
and	NULL
able	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Chapter	NULL
XXXIII	NULL
_	NULL
The	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
stood	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
fireplace	NULL
with	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
host	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Beverley	NULL
's	NULL
countenance	NULL
was	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
clouds	NULL
and	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
careless	NULL
ease	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
amusing	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
drawn	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
full	NULL
height	NULL
and	NULL
breadth	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
formidably	NULL
muscular	NULL
Christian	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
repression	NULL
and	NULL
restraint	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
painful	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
pleasing	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Berserker	NULL
madness	NULL
was	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
such	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
restraints	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
eye	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
him	NULL
down	NULL
--	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
eye	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
frivolous	NULL
creatures	NULL
in	NULL
white	NULL
muslin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
old	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
irreverently	NULL
called	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
less	NULL
pleasant	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
imposing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
leading	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
party	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
name	NULL
alone	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
conferred	NULL
importance	NULL
upon	NULL
any	NULL
"	NULL
movement	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
whom	NULL
his	NULL
bishop	NULL
himself	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
clergy	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
charged	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
visitation	NULL
addresses	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
regiment	NULL
of	NULL
cavalry	NULL
--	NULL
stood	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
in	NULL
awe	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
such	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
beneficial	NULL
restraints	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
follow	NULL
his	NULL
natural	NULL
impulses	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
even	NULL
do	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
highest	NULL
testimony	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
value	NULL
of	NULL
social	NULL
influence	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
given	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
natural	NULL
that	NULL
under	NULL
such	NULL
circumstances	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
should	NULL
feel	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
savage	NULL
wrath	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bond	NULL
that	NULL
confined	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
indignant	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
false	NULL

tyrannical	NULL
conventionalism	NULL

society	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL

of	NULL
all	NULL
times	NULL

she	NULL
never	NULL

turned	NULL

the	NULL

were	NULL
seated	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
recess	NULL

the	NULL
window	NULL

he	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
assault	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL

as	NULL
his	NULL
manner	NULL

suggested	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL

them	NULL

with	NULL
his	NULL

the	NULL

creating	NULL
thus	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL

the	NULL

his	NULL

The	NULL

shut	NULL

her	NULL

sat	NULL
still	NULL

expecting	NULL

earth	NULL

had	NULL
once	NULL

ridicule	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL

the	NULL

him	NULL

hysterical	NULL

the	NULL
chances	NULL
are	NULL

out	NULL

down	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL

steal	NULL
downstairs	NULL

apply	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL

he	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
silently	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
abandoned	NULL
chair	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
take	NULL
pride	NULL
in	NULL
seeing	NULL
both	NULL
sides	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
very	NULL
candid	NULL
about	NULL
disputed	NULL
points	NULL
in	NULL
theology	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
entertain	NULL
everybody	NULL
's	NULL
objection	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
thing	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
heard	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
true	NULL
state	NULL

the	NULL
case	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
widow	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
seated	NULL
half	NULL
fainting	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
side	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
account	NULL
often	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
somehow	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
effective	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
lips	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL

confronted	NULL
him	NULL
than	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
mild	NULL

weeping	NULL
woman	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
loved	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
whose	NULL
opinion	NULL
on	NULL
any	NULL
earthly	NULL
(	NULL
or	NULL
heavenly	NULL
)	NULL
subject	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
weight	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
straw	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
that	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
ludicrous	NULL
and	NULL
miserable	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
goes	NULL
to	NULL
law	NULL
without	NULL
adequate	NULL
reason	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
without	NULL
proof	NULL
to	NULL
maintain	NULL
his	NULL
cause	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
a	NULL
horrible	NULL
divergence	NULL
from	NULL
everything	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
and	NULL
right	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL

as	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
well-known	NULL

highly-esteemed	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
Beverley	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
held	NULL
up	NULL

the	NULL
amusement	NULL

edification	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL

a	NULL
_	NULL
Times	NULL
_	NULL
leader	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
martyrdom	NULL

Archdeacon	NULL

"	NULL
Here	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
woman	NULL
stopped	NULL
short	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL

What	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
wife	NULL

which	NULL
nature	NULL

truth	NULL

the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
all	NULL
prompted	NULL
her	NULL

as	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
possible	NULL
solution	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
puzzle	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
widow	NULL
stopped	NULL
,	NULL
blushing	NULL
and	NULL
tingling	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
shame	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
overwhelming	NULL
than	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
a	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL

pure	NULL
honesty	NULL

affection	NULL
that	NULL
prompted	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL

yet	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
vilest	NULL
sentiment	NULL
in	NULL
human	NULL
nature	NULL

she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
utterly	NULL
ashamed	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL

she	NULL
cried	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
sharp	NULL
and	NULL
sudden	NULL
wretchedness	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
telling	NULL
a	NULL
downright	NULL
lie	NULL
instead	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
was	NULL
paying	NULL
no	NULL
particular	NULL
attention	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
loved	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
woman	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
indifferent	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
innocent	NULL
nonsense	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL

that	NULL
her	NULL
confusion	NULL

even	NULL
the	NULL
half	NULL
offer	NULL
of	NULL
herself	NULL

occasioned	NULL
these	NULL

him	NULL

He	NULL
kept	NULL

often	NULL
himself	NULL

perhaps	NULL
the	NULL

it	NULL

Afterwards	NULL

Mrs	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL

in	NULL
its	NULL
merest	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
sadly	NULL
hurt	NULL

wounded	NULL

much	NULL

she	NULL

She	NULL
drew	NULL

a	NULL
quick	NULL
movement	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
rush	NULL

her	NULL

Why	NULL
they	NULL

how	NULL
she	NULL

easily	NULL

she	NULL
never	NULL

on	NULL
reviewing	NULL

Miss	NULL

whatever	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
faint	NULL

perhaps	NULL
there	NULL
never	NULL

anything	NULL

Never	NULL

the	NULL

he	NULL
put	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL

Mr	NULL

stopped	NULL
short	NULL

resisted	NULL

made	NULL

Oddly	NULL
enough	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL

his	NULL

suddenly	NULL

him	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
curious	NULL
what	NULL

could	NULL
be	NULL
between	NULL
that	NULL

the	NULL
garden	NULL

its	NULL

cottage	NULL
covered	NULL

Such	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL

it	NULL
moved	NULL
the	NULL

to	NULL
a	NULL
singular	NULL

and	NULL
,	NULL
considering	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL

rather	NULL
indecorous	NULL

Instead	NULL

himself	NULL

,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
slightly	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
moralising	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
usual	NULL
wisdom	NULL
she	NULL
kept	NULL
her	NULL
meditations	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
momentary	NULL
vexation	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
plants	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
put	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
beds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
trouble	NULL
lost	NULL
--	NULL
when	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
common	NULL
between	NULL
this	NULL
walk	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
walk	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
together	NULL
from	NULL
Grove	NULL
Street	NULL
to	NULL
Grange	NULL

on	NULL
an	NULL
earlier	NULL
occasion	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
being	NULL
reluctant	NULL
to	NULL
accompany	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
eagerly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
maid	NULL
retired	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
behind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
found	NULL
themselves	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
most	NULL
perfect	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
positions	NULL
for	NULL
mutual	NULL
confidence	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
street	NULL
not	NULL
too	NULL
crowded	NULL
and	NULL
noisy	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
shrouded	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
twinkling	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
friendly	NULL
lights	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
autumn	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
perfect	NULL
than	NULL
their	NULL
isolation	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
surrounding	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
thought	NULL
proper	NULL
to	NULL
isolate	NULL
themselves	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
refuge	NULL
in	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
confidence	NULL
should	NULL
receive	NULL
a	NULL
check	NULL

or	NULL

mind	NULL

the	NULL
chance	NULL

Mr	NULL

Mr	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
here	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
pause	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
fluttered	NULL
and	NULL
frightened	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL

not	NULL
he	NULL

ought	NULL

And	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
wish	NULL

which	NULL
gave	NULL

simply	NULL
a	NULL

whether	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
fluttered	NULL
too	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL

Her	NULL

it	NULL

true	NULL

was	NULL
not	NULL
_	NULL
very	NULL
_	NULL
particularly	NULL
engaged	NULL

still	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sensible	NULL

all	NULL
Mr	NULL

was	NULL
"	NULL
very	NULL

him	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

and	NULL
her	NULL
exertions	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL

had	NULL
produced	NULL
their	NULL
natural	NULL
effect	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
moved	NULL
her	NULL
affections	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
involuntary	NULL
pause	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
hundredth	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
reckoned	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
up	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
herself	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
place	NULL

becoming	NULL
and	NULL
suitable	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL

who	NULL

the	NULL
only	NULL
person	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
his	NULL
secret	NULL

should	NULL
take	NULL
him	NULL

it	NULL
together	NULL

make	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL

And	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
consciousness	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
indeed	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL

Mr	NULL

Nobody	NULL

ever	NULL
crossed	NULL
her	NULL
path	NULL

whom	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL

as	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
further	NULL
danger	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL

origin	NULL

found	NULL
out	NULL

exposed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
smiling	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
defence	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL

She	NULL

accept	NULL
him	NULL

him	NULL
elected	NULL

Carlingford	NULL

him	NULL
triumphantly	NULL
through	NULL
all	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
part	NULL
--	NULL

even	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
--	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
paused	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
rapid	NULL
review	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL

and	NULL
reconsidered	NULL
her	NULL
decision	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
if	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
really	NULL
in	NULL
earnest	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
vague	NULL
possibility	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
become	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
fact	NULL
and	NULL
real	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
actually	NULL
fluttered	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
reasonable	NULL
bosom	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
experienced	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
_	NULL
malaise	NULL
_	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
new	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
with	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
?	NULL

or	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
merely	NULL
the	NULL
excitement	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
final	NULL
decision	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
that	NULL
unusual	NULL
commotion	NULL
far	NULL
away	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
?	NULL

However	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
triumphed	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
momentary	NULL
weakness	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL

Mr	NULL

hesitated	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL

notwithstanding	NULL
her	NULL
courage	NULL

she	NULL
too	NULL
faltered	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL

the	NULL

for	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL

she	NULL
pressed	NULL
quite	NULL
kindly	NULL
the	NULL

still	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL

He	NULL
rushed	NULL

she	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
worsted-work	NULL
with	NULL

itself	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
gentler	NULL

the	NULL

always	NULL
found	NULL

she	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
sad	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

her	NULL
genius	NULL

For	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL

wiser	NULL

more	NULL

one	NULL

is	NULL
in	NULL
most	NULL
cases	NULL
a	NULL
weariness	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
flesh	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
sacrifice	NULL

and	NULL
nobody	NULL
appreciated	NULL
it	NULL

Instead	NULL

choosing	NULL
a	NULL
position	NULL
which	NULL
pleased	NULL
her	NULL
imagination	NULL

suited	NULL
her	NULL
energies	NULL

did	NULL

go	NULL
against	NULL

heart	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

moved	NULL
by	NULL

had	NULL
decided	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
regret	NULL

give	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
sacrificed	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
inclination	NULL

a	NULL
sphere	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL

instead	NULL

the	NULL
heroism	NULL
acknowledged	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
misunderstood	NULL

rewarded	NULL
with	NULL
ingratitude	NULL

When	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
alone	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
solitude	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
drawing-room	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

we	NULL

of	NULL
her	NULL
genius	NULL

she	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
sad	NULL

as	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
moment	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

mind	NULL
a	NULL
name	NULL

which	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
often	NULL
pronounced	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pages	NULL

this	NULL
history	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
consolation	NULL

A	NULL
sympathetic	NULL
presence	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
diffuse	NULL
itself	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
loneliness	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
moments	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
faith	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
humble	NULL
individual	NULL
may	NULL
save	NULL
a	NULL

from	NULL
discouragement	NULL

the	NULL
consciousness	NULL

Mr	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL

spend	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
said	NULL
much	NULL
less	NULL
about	NULL

on	NULL
this	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

there	NULL
could	NULL

no	NULL

it	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL

that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL

gone	NULL

the	NULL
good	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
human	NULL
species	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
everything	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
most	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
appeal	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
assistance	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
need	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
proved	NULL
the	NULL
readiest	NULL
to	NULL
accuse	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
something	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
your	NULL
fault	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
stage	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
progress	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
responsibility	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
nearly	NULL
the	NULL
entire	NULL
social	NULL
organisation	NULL
of	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
depending	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
providing	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
wants	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
subjects	NULL
sensibly	NULL
diminished	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
confidence	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
resources	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
impaired	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
equal	NULL
degree	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
whatever	NULL
the	NULL
difficulties	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
bate	NULL
a	NULL
jot	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
courage	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
buoyancy	NULL
of	NULL
hope	NULL
had	NULL
departed	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
joyful	NULL
and	NULL
triumphant	NULL
a	NULL
figure	NULL
as	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
conquered	NULL
Nancy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
won	NULL
over	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
electrified	NULL
Mr	NULL
Holden	NULL
by	NULL
choosing	NULL
curtains	NULL
which	NULL
suited	NULL
her	NULL
complexion	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
diminished	NULL
hopes	NULL
and	NULL
increased	NULL
experience	NULL
and	NULL
unabated	NULL
courage	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
presented	NULL
a	NULL
still	NULL
nobler	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
imposing	NULL
aspect	NULL
to	NULL
everybody	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
eye	NULL
for	NULL
moral	NULL
grandeur	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
how	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
worthy	NULL
spectators	NULL
existed	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
our	NULL
readers	NULL
are	NULL
aware	NULL
,	NULL
another	NULL
subject	NULL
also	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
position	NULL
altered	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
been	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
_	NULL
that	NULL
_	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
need	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
home	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
accepting	NULL
new	NULL
furniture	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
extent	NULL
pledged	NULL
herself	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
immediately	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
comfort	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
dear	NULL
papa	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
delicate	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
treat	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
freedom	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
full	NULL
development	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
not	NULL
unusual	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

Most	NULL
people	NULL
are	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
falling	NULL
in	NULL
love	NULL
only	NULL
once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
few	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
life	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
disappointed	NULL
and	NULL
heartbroken	NULL
suitors	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
commonly	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
as	NULL
perhaps	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
wished	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
little	NULL
doubt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
chief	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
society	NULL
is	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
signify	NULL
its	NULL
approval	NULL
and	NULL
admiration	NULL
and	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
lady	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
by	NULL
making	NULL
dozens	NULL
of	NULL
proposals	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
ascertained	NULL
from	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
best-informed	NULL
sources	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
beauty	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
is	NULL
very	NULL
brilliant	NULL
and	NULL
graceful	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
even	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
agreeable	NULL
and	NULL
amusing	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
ordinary	NULL
idea	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
floating	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
number	NULL
less	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
's	NULL
merits	NULL
,	NULL
propose	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
may	NULL
not	NULL
perhaps	NULL
accept	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
proportion	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
qualities	NULL
rise	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
sublime	NULL
,	NULL
these	NULL
victims	NULL
are	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
increase	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
woman	NULL
feels	NULL
herself	NULL
set	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
true	NULL
value	NULL
until	NULL
some	NULL
poor	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
set	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
put	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
people	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
happiness	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
delicate	NULL
subject	NULL
to	NULL
discuss	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
well-known	NULL
and	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
established	NULL
reward	NULL
of	NULL
female	NULL
excellence	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
fallen	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
lot	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
Tom	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Tom	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
count	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
presented	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
as	NULL
eligible	NULL
candidates	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
regard	NULL
,	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
this	NULL
proof	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
admiration	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
year	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
society	NULL
had	NULL
laid	NULL
no	NULL
tribute	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
description	NULL
upon	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
shrine	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Mortimer	NULL
instead	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
led	NULL
away	NULL
by	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
!	NULL

After	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
experience	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
inherent	NULL
sweetness	NULL
and	NULL
wholesome	NULL
tone	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
character	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
kept	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
cynicism	NULL
and	NULL
disbelief	NULL
in	NULL
humanity	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
smiled	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
cynically	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sweetly	NULL
melancholy	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
Poor	NULL
men	NULL
!	NULL

they	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
ways	NULL
set	NULL
before	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
chosen	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
sad	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
this	NULL
proof	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
imperfection	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
nature	NULL
thrust	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
turn	NULL
her	NULL
sweet	NULL
into	NULL
bitter	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
ordinary	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

Notwithstanding	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
universal	NULL
reward	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
other	NULL
cases	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
everybody	NULL
knows	NULL
,	NULL
given	NULL
so	NULL
indiscriminately	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
liberality	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
altogether	NULL
failed	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
still	NULL
resumed	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
beautiful	NULL
constancy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
forward	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
fate	NULL
undaunted	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
period	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
career	NULL
.	NULL

Up	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
said	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
paying	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
was	NULL
paying	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
other	NULL
marriages	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
preliminaries	NULL
of	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
nobody	NULL
had	NULL
proposed	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

Affairs	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
state	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
burden	NULL
again	NULL
boldly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
set	NULL
out	NULL
anew	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
proof	NULL
of	NULL
magnanimity	NULL
and	NULL
philanthropy	NULL
which	NULL
nobody	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
asked	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
actuated	NULL
by	NULL
higher	NULL
motives	NULL
than	NULL
those	NULL
that	NULL
sway	NULL
the	NULL
common	NULL
crowd	NULL
.	NULL

Without	NULL
any	NULL
assistance	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
genius	NULL
--	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
stimulating	NULL
applause	NULL
of	NULL
admirers	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
circumstances	NULL
has	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
calculate	NULL
upon	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
sympathising	NULL
soul	NULL
to	NULL
fall	NULL
back	NULL
upon	NULL

and	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
dull	NULL
level	NULL

people	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL

--	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
undaunted	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
harness	NULL
and	NULL
resumed	NULL
her	NULL
course	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
difficulties	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
only	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
more	NULL
friendly	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
tender	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
weaker	NULL
than	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whom	NULL
evil	NULL
fortune	NULL
had	NULL
disabled	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL

When	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
got	NULL
her	NULL
situation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
governess	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Rose	NULL
's	NULL
fears	NULL
were	NULL
realised	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
with	NULL
bitter	NULL
tears	NULL
to	NULL
relinquish	NULL
her	NULL
Career	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
went	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
whole	NULL
afternoons	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
artist	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
handiest	NULL
assistance	NULL

and	NULL
taught	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
learned	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
School	NULL
of	NULL
Design	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
self-abnegation	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
bore	NULL
General	NULL
Travers	NULL
's	NULL
decision	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
officers	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
stout-heartedness	NULL
which	NULL
nobody	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
looked	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
hesitate	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
her	NULL
position	NULL
boldly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
erect	NULL
her	NULL
standard	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
her	NULL
new	NULL
campaign	NULL
,	NULL
unaided	NULL
and	NULL
unappreciated	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL

People	NULL
who	NULL
know	NULL
no	NULL
better	NULL
may	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
upon	NULL
marriage	NULL

or	NULL
they	NULL
may	NULL
fly	NULL
off	NULL

foreign	NULL
travel	NULL

or	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
as	NULL
governesses	NULL

when	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
bravely	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
post	NULL

and	NULL
scorned	NULL
to	NULL
flinch	NULL
or	NULL
run	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
commenced	NULL

amid	NULL
mists	NULL
of	NULL
discouragement	NULL

in	NULL
an	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
vain	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
in	NULL
detail	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
consistent	NULL

career	NULL

nor	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
steadily	NULL

all	NULL

with	NULL

The	NULL

about	NULL
it	NULL

that	NULL
the	NULL

other	NULL
nibbles	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
kind	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
period	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
perhaps	NULL
have	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
off	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
looks	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
immediate	NULL
appearance	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
name	NULL
or	NULL
condition	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
part	NULL
.	NULL

Many	NULL
people	NULL
quite	NULL
congratulated	NULL
themselves	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
imagine	NULL
what	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
social	NULL
condition	NULL
of	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
without	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
doubtful	NULL
whether	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
congratulated	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
comfortable	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
little	NULL
opposition	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
things	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
more	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
hands	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
there	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
husband	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
to	NULL
satisfy	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
age	NULL
when	NULL
most	NULL
people	NULL
have	NULL
husbands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
an	NULL
independent	NULL
position	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
becomes	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
self-respect	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
_	NULL
was	NULL
_	NULL
independent	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
--	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
difference	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
everybody	NULL
knows	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
but	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
shown	NULL
that	NULL
appreciation	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
earlier	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
with	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
fear	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
ten	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
really	NULL
gone	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
ten	NULL
years	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
triumph	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
youth	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
named	NULL
that	NULL
period	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
probably	NULL
begin	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
carpets	NULL
and	NULL
curtains	NULL
had	NULL
faded	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
delicate	NULL
pale	NULL
green	NULL
which	NULL
suited	NULL
her	NULL
complexion	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
a	NULL
profitable	NULL
colour	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
nobody	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL
or	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
period	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
degree	NULL
to	NULL
swindle	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
had	NULL
arrived	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
forward	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
arrived	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Ten	NULL
years	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
comfort	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
dear	NULL
papa	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
remained	NULL
another	NULL
development	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
begin	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
main	NULL
element	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
new	NULL
development	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

Unless	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
person	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
form	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
related	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Richmonds	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
much	NULL
respected	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bar	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
distinguish	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
old	NULL
Miss	NULL
Penrhyn	NULL
died	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
Firs	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
distinguish	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
gone	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
coming	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
new	NULL
property	NULL
and	NULL
settling	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
taking	NULL
his	NULL
place	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
local	NULL
notability	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
evening	NULL
parties	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
provincial	NULL
town	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
dine	NULL
with	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
generally	NULL
popular	NULL
upstairs	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
paid	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
nothing	NULL
very	NULL
marked	NULL
and	NULL
noticeable	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
instance	NULL
(	NULL
if	NULL
anybody	NULL
remembered	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
whose	NULL
money	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Funds	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
who	NULL
more	NULL
probably	NULL
speculated	NULL
.	NULL

Everybody	NULL
knew	NULL
everything	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
ease	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
public	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Firs	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
known	NULL
as	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
steeple	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
everything	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
proprietor	NULL
's	NULL
pedigree	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
traced	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
semi-mythical	NULL
personage	NULL
known	NULL
as	NULL
old	NULL
Penrhyn	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
daughter	NULL
was	NULL
Sir	NULL
John	NULL
Richmond	NULL
's	NULL
grandmother	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Firs	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
descended	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
female	NULL
line	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
where	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
comes	NULL
from	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
made	NULL
himself	NULL
very	NULL
agreeable	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
never	NULL
above	NULL
enlightening	NULL
anybody	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
law	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
opinion	NULL
endorsed	NULL
practically	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
many	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
neighbours	NULL
wondered	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
patience	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
to	NULL
rusticate	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Firs	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
abilities	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
either	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
heard	NULL
these	NULL
wonderings	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
took	NULL
any	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
lived	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
liked	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presented	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
men	NULL
an	NULL
aspect	NULL
of	NULL
serene	NULL
contentment	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
sphere	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
what	NULL
suggestion	NULL
or	NULL
association	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
which	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
into	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
commotion	NULL
in	NULL
Masters	NULL
's	NULL
shop	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
cause	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
commotion	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
event	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
long	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
ten	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
looked	NULL
on	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
possible	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
happen	NULL
any	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wonder	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
that	NULL
old	NULL
Mr	NULL
Chiltern	NULL
should	NULL
die	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
lived	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
ladies	NULL
in	NULL
Masters	NULL
's	NULL
cried	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Poor	NULL
dear	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
that	NULL
however	NULL
long	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
death	NULL
always	NULL
seemed	NULL
sudden	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
stir	NULL
made	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
death	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
pleasant	NULL
than	NULL
sad	NULL
.	NULL

People	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
career	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
ended	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
must	NULL
now	NULL
begin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
excitement	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
election	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
agreeable	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
too	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
vain	NULL
to	NULL
assert	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
regretful	NULL
recollection	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
was	NULL
thought	NULL
a	NULL
likely	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
succeed	NULL
Mr	NULL
Chiltern	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
occur	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
dismissed	NULL
that	NULL
transitory	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
suddenly	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
intuitions	NULL
which	NULL
have	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
effect	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
receives	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
very	NULL
marked	NULL
political	NULL
opinions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
aware	NULL
what	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
's	NULL
views	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Irish	NULL
Church	NULL
question	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
upon	NULL
parliamentary	NULL
reform	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
after	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
flash	NULL
of	NULL
lightning	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
idea	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
new	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
striking	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
excitement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
suggest	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
friend	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
practicable	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
lose	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
prompt	NULL
nature	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
such	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
absorbed	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
until	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
almost	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
walking	NULL
straight	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
hero	NULL
's	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL

said	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
scream	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
put	NULL

Miss	NULL

with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL

When	NULL

the	NULL

such	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
force	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

that	NULL
Mr	NULL

a	NULL

look	NULL
with	NULL
fond	NULL

compunctious	NULL
regret	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
address	NULL

yet	NULL
began	NULL
more	NULL

more	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
justice	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL

over	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

rather	NULL
stiffly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
address	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL

when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
her	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL

it	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL

by	NULL
her	NULL
refusal	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bold	NULL
experiment	NULL

here	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
temptation	NULL

the	NULL
moment	NULL

took	NULL
some	NULL

the	NULL

everything	NULL

it	NULL

Mrs	NULL

it	NULL

lifted	NULL
her	NULL

all	NULL

amusement	NULL

triumph	NULL

struck	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

did	NULL
he	NULL
care	NULL

laughing	NULL
within	NULL
himself	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
cruel	NULL

it	NULL

restored	NULL
her	NULL
self-command	NULL

a	NULL
moment	NULL

this	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL

for	NULL
her	NULL

her	NULL

nobody	NULL

enough	NULL

minds	NULL
that	NULL

round	NULL

the	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Dr	NULL

,	NULL
his	NULL
triumph	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL

He	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
after	NULL

could	NULL

the	NULL
worst	NULL

it	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
actually	NULL
Mr	NULL

wonderful	NULL

unlooked-for	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
event	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

though	NULL

the	NULL
effect	NULL

her	NULL

such	NULL

The	NULL
Doctor	NULL

a	NULL

the	NULL
moment	NULL

went	NULL
back	NULL

Mr	NULL

ended	NULL
again	NULL

it	NULL

agreement	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

was	NULL
right	NULL
in	NULL
politics	NULL

after	NULL
all	NULL

Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
sort	NULL

person	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL

When	NULL
a	NULL

less	NULL
exacting	NULL

went	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL

the	NULL

at	NULL
last	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL

Dr	NULL

was	NULL
that	NULL

gone	NULL
off	NULL

not	NULL
gone	NULL
off	NULL
nearly	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
might	NULL

been	NULL
expected	NULL

at	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
laughed	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
odd	NULL
sound	NULL

which	NULL
roused	NULL
him	NULL

might	NULL

induced	NULL
some	NULL

this	NULL

naturally	NULL

more	NULL
serious	NULL

when	NULL

upstairs	NULL

coarse	NULL

as	NULL
men	NULL

at	NULL
that	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

naturally	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL

come	NULL
a	NULL

earlier	NULL

all	NULL
these	NULL
thoughts	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL

they	NULL

while	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
by	NULL
snatches	NULL
discussed	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL

embarrassment	NULL

perplexity	NULL
are	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
natural	NULL
accompaniment	NULL
to	NULL
life	NULL

movement	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
better	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
driven	NULL
out	NULL

your	NULL
senses	NULL

that	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
without	NULL

a	NULL
manner	NULL

the	NULL

asking	NULL

beyond	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
_	NULL
right	NULL

go	NULL
back	NULL

the	NULL
eagerness	NULL

had	NULL
rushed	NULL
home	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
earliest	NULL
possible	NULL
moment	NULL
to	NULL
present	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
poor	NULL
old	NULL
Mr	NULL
Chiltern	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
King	NULL
Bomba	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
gloomy	NULL
Oriental	NULL
tyrant	NULL
,	NULL
keeping	NULL
all	NULL
possible	NULL
reformers	NULL
and	NULL
successors	NULL
banished	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
dominions	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
candidate	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
spoken	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
pathos	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
thing	NULL
which	NULL
tells	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
imaginative	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
community	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
most	NULL
people	NULL
think	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
moved	NULL
by	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
moment	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
her	NULL
enlightened	NULL
mind	NULL
asserted	NULL
its	NULL
rights	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
home	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
steamboat	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
Calais	NULL
and	NULL
Boulogne	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
Dieppe	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
open	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
an	NULL
actual	NULL
refugee	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
consequently	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
particular	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
pathetic	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
claims	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
affections	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
stayed	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
away	NULL
?	NULL

These	NULL
two	NULL
rationalistic	NULL
questions	NULL
dispersed	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
_	NULL
attendrissement	NULL
_	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
steal	NULL
over	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
conclusion	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
difficulties	NULL
cleared	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
engagements	NULL
and	NULL
reject	NULL
that	NULL
intimation	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
impressed	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
which	NULL
ancient	NULL
truth	NULL
and	NULL
friendship	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
demand	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
verity	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
document	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
been	NULL
reading	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
appeal	NULL
to	NULL
sentiment	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
generally	NULL
called	NULL
humbug	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
living	NULL
here	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
much	NULL
stronger	NULL
claims	NULL
upon	NULL
our	NULL
affections	NULL

if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
wanted	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
ages	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
people	NULL
struggle	NULL
on	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

When	NULL
this	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
felt	NULL
more	NULL
indignation	NULL
than	NULL
sympathy	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
calm	NULL
utterance	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
candidate	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
man	NULL
for	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
sweet	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
given	NULL
sound	NULL
counsel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
carrying	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
makes	NULL
up	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
failures	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
like	NULL
balm	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
bosom	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
necessary	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
commotion	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
calmed	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tranquillity	NULL
of	NULL
undisturbed	NULL
conviction	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
certainty	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
bonnet	NULL
and	NULL
issued	NULL
forth	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
snowed	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
wintry	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
's	NULL
behalf	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
her	NULL
fortune	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
very	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
!	NULL

and	NULL
feeble	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
her	NULL
sofa	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
but	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
comfortable	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sofa	NULL
was	NULL
wheeled	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
reclined	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
knitted	NULL
rugs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
brightest	NULL
colours	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
young	NULL
friends	NULL
all	NULL
worked	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
last	NULL
one	NULL
arrived	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
called	NULL
an	NULL
Afghanistan	NULL
blanket	NULL
,	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
stripes	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
pretty	NULL
tints	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
present	NULL
from	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Beverley	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Her	NULL

she	NULL
says	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
we	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
soft	NULL
dawdling	NULL

it	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL

"	NULL

But	NULL
still	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
honour	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
,	NULL
covering	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
's	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
affording	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
when	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
side	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
stood	NULL
one	NULL
China	NULL
rose	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL

a	NULL
pale	NULL
rose	NULL

almost	NULL
as	NULL
pale	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
soft	NULL
old	NULL
cheeks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
chilled	NULL
like	NULL
them	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
approaching	NULL
frost	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
burned	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
officious	NULL
cheerfulness	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
elbow	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
thought	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
accidental	NULL
circumstances	NULL
as	NULL
winter	NULL
and	NULL
old	NULL
age	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
reflection	NULL
which	NULL
never	NULL

Mrs	NULL

said	NULL

the	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
say	NULL

now	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL

the	NULL

agreed	NULL
with	NULL

naturally	NULL

with	NULL

it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
close	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

wholesome	NULL

for	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Chiley	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL

feel	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
sentiment	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
quoted	NULL
from	NULL
himself	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
just	NULL
sentiment	NULL

"	NULL
By	NULL
George	NULL
!	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
went	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
process	NULL
very	NULL
similar	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
modified	NULL
the	NULL
sentiments	NULL
of	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
previous	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
fellow	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
rushed	NULL
off	NULL
among	NULL
a	NULL
set	NULL
of	NULL
Frenchmen	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
marry	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
in	NULL
addition	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
somehow	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
failed	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
commotion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
sentimental	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
what	NULL
if	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
Firs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lived	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
spent	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
Christian	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
for	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
Colonel	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
still	NULL
wavered	NULL
and	NULL
veered	NULL
about	NULL
;	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
received	NULL
an	NULL
impulse	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL
means	NULL
unworthy	NULL
of	NULL
consideration	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
laid	NULL
back	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
pillows	NULL
and	NULL
painfully	NULL
questioned	NULL
with	NULL
herself	NULL
whether	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
any	NULL
_	NULL
particular	NULL
_	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
taking	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
's	NULL
part	NULL
so	NULL
warmly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
with	NULL
justice	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
brighter	NULL
and	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
animation	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
shown	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
arose	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
simple	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
touching	NULL
and	NULL
delicate	NULL
motive	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
_	NULL
that	NULL
_	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
difference	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
dependent	NULL
on	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
's	NULL
observation	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
happened	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
wounded	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
young	NULL
friend	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
appreciated	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
worth	NULL
deserved	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
advantage	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
frightful	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
friends	NULL
should	NULL
fly	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
trial	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
if	NULL
anything	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
----	NULL
Thus	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
evident	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
visit	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
an	NULL
argumentative	NULL
visit	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
without	NULL
its	NULL
fruit	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
again	NULL
cheerful	NULL
and	NULL
warm	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
sealskin	NULL
coat	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
suited	NULL
her	NULL
remarkably	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
corresponded	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
everybody	NULL
knows	NULL
how	NULL
comfortable	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
snowflakes	NULL
fell	NULL
softly	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
melted	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
nothing	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
sleeves	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
without	NULL
leaving	NULL
any	NULL
trace	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
chill	NULL
air	NULL
blowing	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
those	NULL
feathery	NULL
messengers	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
but	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
walk	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
readiness	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
all	NULL
kinds	NULL
of	NULL
objections	NULL
and	NULL
difficulties	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
feelings	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
magnanimous	NULL
and	NULL
heroic	NULL
element	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
_	NULL
particular	NULL
_	NULL
reason	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dry	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
use	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
social	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
paid	NULL
her	NULL
any	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
put	NULL
himself	NULL
forth	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
candidate	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
favour	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
thrill	NULL
of	NULL
utter	NULL
disinterestedness	NULL
which	NULL
kept	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
warm	NULL
within	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
sealskin	NULL
did	NULL
without	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
soul	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
came	NULL
on	NULL
faster	NULL
and	NULL
faster	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Wentworth	NULL
's	NULL
(	NULL
who	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
was	NULL
new	NULL
in	NULL
St	NULL
Roque	NULL
's	NULL
)	NULL
gray	NULL
sisters	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
another	NULL
lady	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
quickly	NULL
as	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
garden	NULL
walls	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
were	NULL
either	NULL
at	NULL
business	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
club	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
keeping	NULL
themselves	NULL
snug	NULL
indoors	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
these	NULL
devoted	NULL
women	NULL
who	NULL
braved	NULL
the	NULL
elements	NULL
outside	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
figure	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
cloak	NULL
was	NULL
occupied	NULL
simply	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
our	NULL
present	NULL
business	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
two	NULL
were	NULL
otherwise	NULL
inspired	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
lately	NULL
arrived	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
thinking	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
capacity	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
lost	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
advancing	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
momentary	NULL
chill	NULL
came	NULL
over	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
errand	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
but	NULL
jump	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
less	NULL
important	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
induced	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
doors	NULL
on	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
loud	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
drew	NULL
near	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
an	NULL
unexpected	NULL
and	NULL
generous	NULL
auxiliary	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
foe	NULL
accomplished	NULL
and	NULL
formidable	NULL
?	NULL

For	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
coming	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Centum	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
herself	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
relief	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
nearer	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
ladies	NULL
instinctively	NULL
looked	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
weapons	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
already	NULL
in	NULL
many	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
passage	NULL
of	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
nothing	NULL
like	NULL
this	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
in	NULL
union	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
carry	NULL
all	NULL
before	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
struggle	NULL
unto	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
it	NULL
really	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

down	NULL

as	NULL
Mr	NULL

the	NULL

pithily	NULL
remarked	NULL

that	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
nobody	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
about	NULL
Reform	NULL

the	NULL
Income-tax	NULL

everybody	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
lived	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

and	NULL
was	NULL
supplied	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
creditable	NULL
way	NULL
by	NULL
George	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
mystery	NULL
whatever	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

People	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL

and	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
he	NULL
paid	NULL
for	NULL
everything	NULL

the	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
accounts	NULL
were	NULL
kept	NULL

and	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL

Even	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
wine	NULL
direct	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
growers	NULL
(	NULL
for	NULL
naturally	NULL
his	NULL

put	NULL

Carlingford	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL

his	NULL

made	NULL
Sir	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
rule	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
in	NULL

about	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
people	NULL

had	NULL
once	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
remarked	NULL
in	NULL
Grove	NULL

that	NULL
Mr	NULL

had	NULL
once	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dreadful	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
tranquil	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
community	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL

And	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
wanted	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

a	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
vain	NULL
to	NULL
deny	NULL

Miss	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL

that	NULL

bringing	NULL

it	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL

Aunt	NULL

talking	NULL

her	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL

Nothing	NULL

Mr	NULL

still	NULL
there	NULL

When	NULL
a	NULL

is	NULL
brilliant	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
always	NULL
a	NULL

an	NULL

Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
sorry	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs	NULL

had	NULL
bad	NULL
nights	NULL

suggested	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL

hoped	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

Carlingford	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
her	NULL
good	NULL

was	NULL
very	NULL
glad	NULL

hear	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL

getting	NULL
on	NULL

well	NULL

India	NULL

Aunt	NULL

could	NULL
not	NULL

him	NULL

feeling	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL

substance	NULL

not	NULL
one	NULL

those	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL

was	NULL
quite	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL

still	NULL
with	NULL

She	NULL

which	NULL

it	NULL

a	NULL
little	NULL

a	NULL
confidence	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL

stand	NULL
the	NULL

about	NULL

to	NULL
it	NULL

which	NULL
did	NULL
honour	NULL

With	NULL
this	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL

what	NULL
Mr	NULL

The	NULL

exchanged	NULL
a	NULL

when	NULL
they	NULL

And	NULL
Mr	NULL

sat	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
arm	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL

and	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL

deep	NULL

dropped	NULL

knit	NULL

listened	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

was	NULL
terribly	NULL

it	NULL

When	NULL

down	NULL

Mr	NULL

added	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
laugh	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL

,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL

the	NULL

he	NULL
left	NULL

that	NULL

stricken	NULL

notwithstanding	NULL
this	NULL

she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL

acknowledge	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
mentioned	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
handsome	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
inconceivably	NULL
gone	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pockets	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
care	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
bitter	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
failure	NULL
of	NULL
friends	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
vanity	NULL
of	NULL
expectations	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
last	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
walked	NULL
past	NULL
those	NULL
garden	NULL
walls	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
himself	NULL
sure	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
support	NULL
of	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
personal	NULL
esteem	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
houses	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
passing	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
Archdeacon	NULL
had	NULL
broken	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
case	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
an	NULL
adventurer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
felt	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
sweetness	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
member	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
oligarchy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
entitled	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sympathy	NULL
and	NULL
support	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
order	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
path	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
ears	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pockets	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rage	NULL
and	NULL
pain	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

Whose	NULL
fault	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
had	NULL
deserted	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
knew	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
might	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
have	NULL
asked	NULL
whose	NULL
fault	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
stout	NULL
and	NULL
red	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
grace	NULL
of	NULL
figure	NULL
nor	NULL
ease	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
very	NULL
near	NULL
to	NULL
settling	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
becoming	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
domestic	NULL
respectability	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
quiet	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
escaped	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
laughed	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
since	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
imagined	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
much	NULL
glee	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
fogy	NULL
looking	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
men	NULL
do	NULL
become	NULL
old	NULL
fogies	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
children	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lose	NULL
their	NULL
figure	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
elasticity	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
sooner	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
called	NULL
life	NULL
than	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
milder	NULL
scene	NULL
of	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
handy	NULL
just	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
sure	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
election	NULL
without	NULL
paying	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
living	NULL
fast	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
spending	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
real	NULL
ambition	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
had	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
within	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
won	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
change	NULL
his	NULL
mode	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turn	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
leaf	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
become	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
has	NULL
made	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
resolution	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
feels	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
success	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
moral	NULL
reformation	NULL
depends	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
victory	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
permitted	NULL
to	NULL
consider	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
win	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
divined	NULL
what	NULL
his	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
discovery	NULL
that	NULL
even	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
friends	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
election	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
such	NULL
importance	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL

and	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
miserable	NULL

had	NULL
just	NULL

far	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
Mr	NULL
Centum	NULL

a	NULL
moment	NULL

then	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
one	NULL

his	NULL
great	NULL

he	NULL
greeted	NULL
him	NULL

effect	NULL
upon	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
_	NULL
had	NULL
_	NULL
gone	NULL
too	NULL
far	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
as	NULL
careful	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
stayed	NULL
at	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
paying	NULL
the	NULL
penalty	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
edifying	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
Grove	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
a	NULL
waft	NULL
of	NULL
soft	NULL
recollections	NULL
came	NULL
across	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
absence	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
sympathy	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
turning	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
enchantress	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
who	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
sing	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
listen	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
storm	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Probably	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
ended	NULL
by	NULL
strolling	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
familiar	NULL
street	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
canvassing	NULL
for	NULL
Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL
's	NULL
vote	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
stopped	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
brougham	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Doctor	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
very	NULL
strange	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
nobody	NULL
had	NULL
particularly	NULL
remarked	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
perhaps	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
smoothed	NULL
his	NULL
countenance	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
brougham	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
refuge	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
stopped	NULL
suddenly	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
perform	NULL
that	NULL
ceremony	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
cloudy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
constrained	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
forced	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
;	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
strange	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

very	NULL
glad	NULL

you	NULL

the	NULL
Doctor	NULL

you	NULL

Mr	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
shrug	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
imprudent	NULL

the	NULL

Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
grimly	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
added	NULL

looking	NULL
at	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
critical	NULL
medical	NULL
glance	NULL
which	NULL
shows	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
verbal	NULL
response	NULL
is	NULL
quite	NULL
unnecessary	NULL

This	NULL
time	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
look	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
insinuation	NULL
of	NULL
doubt	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

I	NULL
'm	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL

he	NULL
answered	NULL
curtly	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL

"	NULL

the	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
little	NULL

the	NULL
term	NULL
at	NULL

was	NULL
consolatory	NULL

after	NULL
that	NULL
Doctor	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
quite	NULL
changed	NULL

tone	NULL

"	NULL

promptly	NULL

somehow	NULL

felt	NULL
a	NULL
pleasure	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
brougham	NULL
drove	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
was	NULL
involved	NULL

and	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

felt	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
judicial	NULL
recompense	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
desertion	NULL
of	NULL

he	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL

who	NULL
shared	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
sentiments	NULL

then	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

going	NULL
out	NULL
any	NULL

day	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL

who	NULL

all	NULL
about	NULL

the	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
meantime	NULL
he	NULL
threw	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
an	NULL
easy	NULL
chair	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
so	NULL
stout	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
visiting	NULL
his	NULL
patients	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
brougham	NULL
between	NULL

went	NULL
bowling	NULL
along	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL

along	NULL
the	NULL
familiar	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
glumness	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
demonstrative	NULL
man	NULL

but	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
alone	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
tell	NULL
by	NULL
certain	NULL
lines	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
well-worn	NULL

his	NULL
countenance	NULL
whether	NULL
all	NULL

just	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL

he	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
conscious	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
up	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
rather	NULL
late	NULL
one	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
pondering	NULL
upon	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL

thinking	NULL
within	NULL
herself	NULL
compassionately	NULL
of	NULL
poor	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

way	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL

but	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
opposite	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL

For	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
but	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
antithesis	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
foolish	NULL
apprentice	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
chosen	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
way	NULL

was	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
bad	NULL

while	NULL
she	NULL

the	NULL

one	NULL
about	NULL

her	NULL
Lord	NULL
Mayor	NULL

And	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

time	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
candidate	NULL

whose	NULL
canvass	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
so	NULL
successfully	NULL

that	NULL

after	NULL
the	NULL
election	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL
excitement	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL

she	NULL
would	NULL
feel	NULL
a	NULL
blank	NULL
--	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
blank	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
filled	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL

for	NULL

as	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL

not	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL

for	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
feels	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
Power	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
so	NULL
few	NULL
other	NULL
outlets	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
disheartened	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

Gleams	NULL
of	NULL
possibility	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
crossed	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
marrying	NULL
the	NULL
member	NULL
for	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
instance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
beginning	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
important	NULL
career	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
experienced	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
aware	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
possibilities	NULL
which	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
depend	NULL
upon	NULL
herself	NULL
alone	NULL
had	NULL
better	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
calculated	NULL
upon	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
did	NULL
occur	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
among	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
Experiment	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
carried	NULL
out	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
genius	NULL

of	NULL
marrying	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL

affording	NULL
to	NULL
Carlingford	NULL

England	NULL
an	NULL
example	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
influence	NULL

Such	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
thoughts	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
passing	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
great	NULL

she	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL

And	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
rest	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
one	NULL
subject	NULL
of	NULL
thought	NULL
which	NULL
kept	NULL
her	NULL
awake	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
was	NULL
popular	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
forces	NULL

rally	NULL
round	NULL
a	NULL
penitent	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL

then	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL

going	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
illogical	NULL
manner	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL

and	NULL
wondering	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
meaning	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Meantime	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
fell	NULL
heavily	NULL
outside	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wrapped	NULL
everything	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
soft	NULL

And	NULL
amid	NULL

the	NULL

those	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
suffering	NULL

And	NULL
though	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL

man	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
practice	NULL

had	NULL
perfect	NULL
command	NULL

night	NULL
that	NULL
ever	NULL
blew	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL

there	NULL

The	NULL
bell	NULL
that	NULL

roused	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
young	NULL

still	NULL
hung	NULL
near	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL

his	NULL
closed-up	NULL

when	NULL
he	NULL

when	NULL
the	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
evening	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
considered	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
importance	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
unlooked-for	NULL
event	NULL
which	NULL
startled	NULL
all	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

Nobody	NULL
could	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
.	NULL

Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
patients	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
declared	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
nurses	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
a	NULL
made-up	NULL
story	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
prove	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
be	NULL
dead	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
ever	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
last	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
down	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
sobbing	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saying	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
a	NULL
mistake	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
who	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
died	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
protestations	NULL
were	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
avail	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
stony	NULL
fact	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
frightened	NULL
Thomas	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
senses	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
without	NULL
calling	NULL
or	NULL
disturbing	NULL
anybody	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
faint	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
brandy	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
remains	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
still	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
bedside	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
anybody	NULL
could	NULL
tell	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
brought	NULL
Dr	NULL
Rider	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
examine	NULL
the	NULL
strong	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
frame	NULL
--	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
not	NULL
old	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
weakly	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
such	NULL
sudden	NULL
extinction	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
ceased	NULL
its	NULL
human	NULL
functions	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
swept	NULL
over	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
breath	NULL
of	NULL
wind	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
wind	NULL
even	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
silent	NULL
snowy	NULL
day	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
election	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
people	NULL
's	NULL
heads	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
affairs	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
being	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
known	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
--	NULL
seen	NULL
them	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
and	NULL
kept	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
himself	NULL
always	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
breach	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
pale	NULL
Death	NULL
approached	NULL
that	NULL
way	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
made	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
boast	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
friendliness	NULL
or	NULL
been	NULL
large	NULL
in	NULL
sympathetic	NULL
expressions	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
flinched	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
deserted	NULL
his	NULL
patients	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
consideration	NULL
.	NULL

Carlingford	NULL
was	NULL
sorry	NULL
,	NULL
profoundly	NULL
sorry	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
true	NULL
sorrow	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
person	NULL
mourned	NULL
as	NULL

the	NULL
mourner	NULL

who	NULL
feels	NULL

if	NULL

another	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL

Dr	NULL

was	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL

who	NULL
felt	NULL

for	NULL

everything	NULL
was	NULL
paralysed	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL

canvassing	NULL

Dr	NULL

the	NULL
question	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

she	NULL

her	NULL

her	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL

woman	NULL

sink	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
private	NULL
life	NULL

some	NULL

inclined	NULL

believe	NULL

Inside	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

naturally	NULL

the	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
affairs	NULL
was	NULL
sad	NULL
enough	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

notwithstanding	NULL
the	NULL
many	NULL

things	NULL

how	NULL
he	NULL

talking	NULL

I	NULL
should	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
indeed	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
natural	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
an	NULL
utterly	NULL
impossible	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
first	NULL
long	NULL
snowy	NULL
,	NULL
troubled	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
went	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bedroom	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
wringing	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
creature	NULL
distracted	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
sat	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
recall	NULL
the	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
shoulder	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
still	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
feeling	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cry	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
true	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
last	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
events	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
something	NULL
higher	NULL
than	NULL
accident	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
held	NULL
accountable	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
one	NULL
ever	NULL
so	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
burden	NULL
of	NULL
affairs	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
own	NULL
shoulders	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
watched	NULL
ever	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
closely	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
effect	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
bewildering	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
changed	NULL
position	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
roused	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
into	NULL
that	NULL
feverish	NULL
and	NULL
unnatural	NULL
activity	NULL
of	NULL
thought	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
minds	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
inevitable	NULL
reaction	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
unaccustomed	NULL
curb	NULL
and	NULL
shock	NULL
of	NULL
grief	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
dreadful	NULL
certainty	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
suddenly	NULL
come	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
leap	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
knowledge	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
blame	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
though	NULL
_	NULL
he	NULL
_	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
_	NULL
she	NULL
_	NULL
remained	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
censure	NULL
upon	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
became	NULL
immediately	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
horror	NULL
and	NULL
confusion	NULL
of	NULL
thoughts	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
involuntary	NULL
stir	NULL
and	NULL
bustle	NULL
of	NULL
plans	NULL
and	NULL
projects	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
return	NULL
and	NULL
overwhelm	NULL
her	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
chose	NULL
it	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
asking	NULL
herself	NULL
what	NULL
her	NULL
new	NULL
position	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
strangely	NULL
free	NULL
and	NULL
new	NULL
and	NULL
unlimited	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
recollected	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
very	NULL
active	NULL
mind	NULL
and	NULL
great	NULL
energies	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
old	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
fancy	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
encountered	NULL
a	NULL
natural	NULL
grief	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
passage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
too	NULL
young	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
future	NULL
still	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
kept	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
nobody	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
moved	NULL
the	NULL
household	NULL
and	NULL
superintended	NULL
the	NULL
arrangements	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
muffled	NULL
way	NULL
through	NULL
Thomas	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
servant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
knew	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
ways	NULL
"	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
her	NULL
seclusion	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
honest	NULL
sorrow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
perfect	NULL
observance	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
ordinary	NULL
restraints	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
wrong	NULL
to	NULL
omit	NULL
all	NULL
mention	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
feverish	NULL
bustle	NULL
of	NULL
thinking	NULL
which	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
solitude	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
vexed	NULL
and	NULL
irritated	NULL
and	NULL
distressed	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
indignantly	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
!	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
chances	NULL
are	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
sheer	NULL
duty	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
anybody	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
;	NULL
without	NULL
being	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
mere	NULL
shock	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
horror	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
profound	NULL
commotion	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
than	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
in	NULL
producing	NULL
that	NULL
fluttering	NULL
crowd	NULL
of	NULL
busy	NULL
,	NULL
vexatious	NULL
speculations	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
will	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
,	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
looked	NULL
a	NULL
dreadful	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
way	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
wishing	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
solitude	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
blinds	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
sometimes	NULL
came	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
thump	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
dark	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
comfort	NULL
when	NULL
night	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
lamp	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
lighted	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
bad	NULL
for	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
widow	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
daughter	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
keep	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
position	NULL
of	NULL
social	NULL
importance	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
unless	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
herself	NULL
lightly	NULL
said	NULL
so	NULL
short	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
since	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
awfully	NULL
rich	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
next	NULL
to	NULL
impossible	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
that	NULL
gave	NULL
importance	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
society	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
hospitable	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
house	NULL
--	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
.	NULL

Things	NULL
could	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
respect	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
might	NULL
stay	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
keep	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
furthest	NULL
extent	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
its	NULL
old	NULL
traditions	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
limit	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
consciousness	NULL
kept	NULL
gleaming	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dull	NULL
daylight	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
closed	NULL
blinds	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
articles	NULL
of	NULL
mourning	NULL
piled	NULL
about	NULL
everywhere	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
dimness	NULL
getting	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
distressed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
consciousness	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sadness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
altogether	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
stir	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
reaction	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
go	NULL
wherever	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
limit	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
and	NULL
proper	NULL
and	NULL
becoming	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
please	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
might	NULL
go	NULL
abroad	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
perhaps	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
modern	NULL
English	NULL
mind	NULL
when	NULL
anything	NULL
happens	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
settle	NULL
wherever	NULL
she	NULL
pleased	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
arrange	NULL
her	NULL
mode	NULL
of	NULL
existence	NULL
as	NULL
seemed	NULL
good	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
an	NULL
heiress	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moderate	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Jemima	NULL
was	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
absolutely	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
disposal	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
taken	NULL
anywhere	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
age	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
predict	NULL
what	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
position	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
these	NULL
fairer	NULL
possibilities	NULL
gleamed	NULL
into	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
describe	NULL
the	NULL
anger	NULL
and	NULL
self-disgust	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
reproached	NULL
herself	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
consciously	NULL
failed	NULL
in	NULL
maintaining	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
becoming	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
nobody	NULL
but	NULL
herself	NULL
knew	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
accusation	NULL
was	NULL
acute	NULL
and	NULL
bitter	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
how	NULL
could	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
travels	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
quicker	NULL
than	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
goes	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
makes	NULL
its	NULL
expeditions	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
subtle	NULL
,	NULL
stealthy	NULL
ways	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
might	NULL
begin	NULL
by	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
dear	NULL
papa	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
dry	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
off	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
bewildering	NULL
speculations	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
everything	NULL
was	NULL
certain	NULL
now	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
everything	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
uncertain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
unknown	NULL
issues	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
days	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
funeral	NULL
passed	NULL
by	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
everybody	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
kind	NULL
.	NULL

Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
props	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
bestirred	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
final	NULL
honours	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
conspired	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
from	NULL
all	NULL
possible	NULL
trouble	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
help	NULL
her	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
trial	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
respected	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
possible	NULL
comforts	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
changes	NULL
that	NULL
everybody	NULL
looked	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
occurred	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
this	NULL
change	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
entirely	NULL
unexpected	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
everything	NULL
else	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
external	NULL
appearance	NULL
,	NULL
need	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
died	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
set	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
loss	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
failure	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
misunderstanding	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
anybody	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
existence	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
every	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
wine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
nothing	NULL
particular	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
him	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
ideal	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
life	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
demand	NULL
anything	NULL
better	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
confusing	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
its	NULL
fundamentals	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
different	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
just	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
kind	NULL
to	NULL
many	NULL
people	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
lifetime	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
that	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
another	NULL
rectifying	NULL
,	NULL
completer	NULL
existence	NULL
which	NULL
most	NULL
men	NULL
have	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
seemed	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
die	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
contented	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
lower	NULL

fare	NULL
badly	NULL

and	NULL
where	NULL
so	NULL
few	NULL
of	NULL
us	NULL
are	NULL
contented	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fact	NULL
which	NULL
exercised	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
confusing	NULL
influence	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
themselves	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
many	NULL
people	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
under	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
identify	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
angels	NULL
and	NULL
spirits	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
feeling	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
regret	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
poignant	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
regret	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
they	NULL
buried	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
signs	NULL
of	NULL
respect	NULL
.	NULL

People	NULL
from	NULL
twenty	NULL
miles	NULL
off	NULL
sent	NULL
their	NULL
carriages	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
George	NULL
Street	NULL
people	NULL
shut	NULL
their	NULL
shops	NULL

and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
business	NULL
done	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
and	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
walked	NULL
side	NULL
by	NULL
side	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
funeral	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
affecting	NULL
sight	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL

and	NULL
if	NULL
anything	NULL
more	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
done	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
their	NULL
respect	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
corporation	NULL
of	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
sorry	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
still	NULL
lay	NULL
deep	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
corners	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
trampled	NULL
down	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
lamp	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
lighted	NULL
now	NULL
of	NULL
nights	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
lighting	NULL
the	NULL
lamp	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
lighthouse	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
point	NULL
out	NULL
succour	NULL
and	NULL
safety	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
neighbours	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
physician	NULL
himself	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
beyond	NULL
all	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
succour	NULL
or	NULL
aid	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
people	NULL
retired	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sympathetic	NULL
,	NULL
awe-stricken	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
decided	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
the	NULL
ladies	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
whether	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
scarcely	NULL
could	NULL
forgive	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
really	NULL
been	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
taken	NULL
in	NULL
mistake	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
as	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
cried	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
hand	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
shoulder	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
last	NULL
unusual	NULL
caress	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
touching	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
world	NULL
of	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
proud	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
showed	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
by	NULL
times	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
again	NULL
that	NULL
lingering	NULL
touch	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cried	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
would	NULL
break	NULL
:	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
keep	NULL
her	NULL
thoughts	NULL
steady	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
prevent	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
wandering	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
kinds	NULL
of	NULL
profane	NULL
out-of-door	NULL
matters	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
considerations	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
estimates	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
position	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
wounded	NULL
her	NULL
sadly	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
inappropriate	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
natural	NULL
light	NULL
and	NULL
air	NULL
oppressed	NULL
her	NULL
sorely	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
longed	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
natural	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
talk	NULL
with	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Jemima	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
refuge	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
present	NULL
loneliness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
escape	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
from	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
bustle	NULL
and	NULL
commotion	NULL
of	NULL
unbecoming	NULL
thoughts	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL
surely	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
encounter	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
time	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL
night	NULL
another	NULL
rumour	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
murmur	NULL
through	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
rumour	NULL
more	NULL
bewildering	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
incredible	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
confirm	NULL
and	NULL
acknowledge	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
its	NULL
seal	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
first	NULL
mentioned	NULL
,	NULL
everybody	NULL
(	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
heart	NULL
to	NULL
laugh	NULL
)	NULL
laughed	NULL
loud	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
narrator	NULL
with	NULL
mingled	NULL
scepticism	NULL
and	NULL
indignation	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
by	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ridiculed	NULL
and	NULL
scoffed	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
richest	NULL

"	NULL
people	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
everybody	NULL

"	NULL

But	NULL
after	NULL
this	NULL
statement	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
other	NULL
witnesses	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
confirm	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL

It	NULL
never	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
lived	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
practice	NULL

and	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL

money	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
nothing	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
hid	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
elaborate	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
as	NULL
just	NULL
and	NULL
righteous	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
will	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
will	NULL
was	NULL
read	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
everything	NULL
named	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
disappeared	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
bubble	NULL
.	NULL

Instead	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
richest	NULL
,	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
poorest	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
shut	NULL
his	NULL
door	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
snowy	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
revelation	NULL
which	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
perfectly	NULL
by	NULL
storm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
startled	NULL
everybody	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
senses	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
plans	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
so	NULL
wicked	NULL

went	NULL
out	NULL
all	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL

amaze	NULL
and	NULL
dismay	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
no	NULL
words	NULL
could	NULL
give	NULL
any	NULL
expression	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
fortune	NULL
which	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL

more	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

all	NULL

seize	NULL
her	NULL

went	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

a	NULL

a	NULL

utter	NULL
gloom	NULL

bewildering	NULL
uncertainty	NULL
came	NULL
over	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
lifted	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

into	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL

it	NULL
almost	NULL
surprised	NULL
her	NULL

this	NULL

every	NULL

her	NULL

everything	NULL

after	NULL

away	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
wonder	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
drew	NULL
close	NULL

took	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
between	NULL

what	NULL

Instead	NULL

the	NULL

nothing	NULL

Such	NULL
an	NULL

all	NULL
his	NULL

"	NULL
Poor	NULL
papa	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
given	NULL

employing	NULL
her	NULL

this	NULL
way	NULL

realising	NULL
the	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL

now	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL

told	NULL
her	NULL

put	NULL
off	NULL
a	NULL

his	NULL

but	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL

justice	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
qualities	NULL

This	NULL
,	NULL
amid	NULL
her	NULL
general	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
confusion	NULL
and	NULL
dizziness	NULL
and	NULL
insecurity	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
clear	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
struck	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
freezing	NULL
outside	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
people	NULL
manage	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
all	NULL

present	NULL
advantages	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
away	NULL
this	NULL
revelation	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Jemima	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
keep	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
at	NULL
arm	NULL
's	NULL
length	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
night	NULL
's	NULL
rest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
meantime	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
a	NULL
clear	NULL
head	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
contemplation	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
judicious	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
stimulated	NULL
by	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
shock	NULL
,	NULL
Solomon	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
suppose	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
scarcely	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
clearly	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
perceive	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
best	NULL
,	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
judicious	NULL
passive	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
crouching	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
so	NULL
giddy	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
scarcely	NULL
stand	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
head	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
queer	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
singing	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
ears	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
herself	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
changed	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
position	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
answered	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
steadiness	NULL
and	NULL
self-possession	NULL
in	NULL
almost	NULL
any	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL
blood	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
running	NULL
a	NULL
race	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
veins	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
strangest	NULL
noises	NULL
hummed	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
ears	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
weakness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
weak	NULL
with	NULL
grief	NULL
and	NULL
excitement	NULL
and	NULL
comparative	NULL
fasting	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
told	NULL
for	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
probably	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
inability	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
so	NULL
unlooked-for	NULL
a	NULL
blow	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
for	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
see	NULL
everything	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
utterly	NULL
indifferent	NULL
and	NULL
unconscious	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
cry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
relieved	NULL
her	NULL
giddiness	NULL
by	NULL
reviving	NULL
her	NULL
grief	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
minute	NULL
a	NULL
bewildering	NULL
wonder	NULL
seized	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
become	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
triumphs	NULL
--	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
live	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
sick	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
brought	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
singing	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
ears	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
tea	NULL
very	NULL
quietly	NULL
with	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Jemima	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
kept	NULL
breaking	NULL
into	NULL
continual	NULL
snatches	NULL
of	NULL
lamentation	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
checked	NULL
by	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
composed	NULL
looks	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
heard	NULL
this	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
news	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
turn	NULL
round	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
soft	NULL
hush	NULL
of	NULL
exhaustion	NULL
and	NULL
grief	NULL
subdued	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
grief	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
too	NULL
urgent	NULL
,	NULL
comes	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
is	NULL
over	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
comfort	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
warm	NULL
firelight	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
room	NULL
--	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
living	NULL
shut	NULL
up	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
blinds	NULL
down	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
dresses	NULL
everywhere	NULL
about	NULL

for	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
dreary	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

John	NULL
Brown	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
charge	NULL
of	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
affairs	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
explained	NULL
everything	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lawyer	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
one	NULL
short	NULL
interview	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
client	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
borne	NULL
it	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
face	NULL
had	NULL
changed	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
drawn	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
shivering	NULL
long	NULL
breath	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Poor	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
Mr	NULL
Brown	NULL
could	NULL
say	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
the	NULL
shock	NULL
had	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
very	NULL
scanty	NULL
information	NULL
which	NULL
gave	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
pang	NULL
of	NULL
sorrow	NULL

consolation	NULL

he	NULL
patted	NULL
me	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

with	NULL
tender	NULL
tears	NULL

felt	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL

all	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL

the	NULL

which	NULL
belonged	NULL

more	NULL

was	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

settled	NULL
down	NULL

She	NULL

them	NULL

Whatever	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
that	NULL

in	NULL

then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL

might	NULL
let	NULL
it	NULL

to	NULL
tell	NULL

it	NULL
went	NULL

her	NULL
heart	NULL

moment	NULL

think	NULL

letting	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

having	NULL
the	NULL
patients	NULL
come	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL

the	NULL
lamp	NULL
lighted	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL

nothing	NULL
changed	NULL

the	NULL
central	NULL
figure	NULL

She	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
above	NULL
such	NULL
sentimental	NULL
ideas	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
whole	NULL
hundred	NULL

was	NULL
in	NULL
question	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

which	NULL
of	NULL
itself	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
phenomenon	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL

that	NULL

there	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL

She	NULL
might	NULL
still	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
abroad	NULL

and	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
extent	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
limited	NULL
share	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
section	NULL
of	NULL
English	NULL

Or	NULL
she	NULL

attractions	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
rich	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
different	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
there	NULL
gradually	NULL
dawned	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
germ	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
plan	NULL
she	NULL
ultimately	NULL
adopted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
that	NULL
commended	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
feelings	NULL
.	NULL

Going	NULL
away	NULL
was	NULL
expensive	NULL
and	NULL
troublesome	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
at	NULL
Elsworthy	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
expedient	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
charged	NULL
a	NULL
pound	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
kinds	NULL
of	NULL
extras	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
having	NULL
the	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
of	NULL
feeling	NULL
yourself	NULL
in	NULL
your	NULL
own	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

Under	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impressed	NULL
upon	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
natural	NULL
course	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
still	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
no	NULL
change	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
should	NULL
she	NULL
make	NULL
any	NULL
change	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
house	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
cost	NULL
anything	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
Nancy	NULL
would	NULL
but	NULL
stand	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
good	NULL
maid	NULL
----	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
venture	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
equal	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
mathematician	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
clever	NULL
at	NULL
mental	NULL
arithmetic	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
practical	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
down	NULL
lines	NULL
upon	NULL
lines	NULL
of	NULL
figures	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
musing	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
worked	NULL
them	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
wonderful	NULL
skill	NULL
and	NULL
speed	NULL
and	NULL
accuracy	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
should	NULL
she	NULL
retreat	NULL
and	NULL
leave	NULL
her	NULL
native	NULL
soil	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
neighbourhood	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
poor	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
trouble	NULL
?	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
poor	NULL
--	NULL
nor	NULL
even	NULL
frightened	NULL
by	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
understood	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
--	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
frightened	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
shock	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
poverty	NULL
even	NULL
been	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
absolute	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
alone	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
as	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
island	NULL
of	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
undisturbed	NULL
seclusion	NULL
and	NULL
calm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
that	NULL
outside	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL
sea	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
advice	NULL
would	NULL
surge	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
visible	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
these	NULL
circumstances	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
took	NULL
by	NULL
instinct	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
wise	NULL
course	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
there	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL
unanimity	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
seldom	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
gained	NULL
when	NULL
counsellors	NULL
are	NULL
admitted	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
decided	NULL
upon	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
fly	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
misfortune	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
confront	NULL
fate	NULL
and	NULL
take	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
lawful	NULL
burden	NULL
and	NULL
stay	NULL
still	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
wisest	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
easiest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
heroic	NULL
course	NULL
to	NULL
adopt	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
beforehand	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
approved	NULL
of	NULL
by	NULL
nobody	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
steadily	NULL
faced	NULL
and	NULL
considered	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
alone	NULL
;	NULL
although	NULL
silence	NULL
and	NULL
solitude	NULL
and	NULL
desolation	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
suddenly	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
taken	NULL
possession	NULL
all	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
once	NULL
gay	NULL
and	NULL
brilliant	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
final	NULL
decision	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
rejoined	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
everybody	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
trying	NULL
moment	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
mother	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Jemima	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
changed	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
since	NULL
her	NULL
brother-in-law	NULL
's	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
meant	NULL
every	NULL
word	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
about	NULL
giving	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
meant	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
so	NULL
certain	NULL
now	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
about	NULL

at	NULL
this	NULL

and	NULL
for	NULL
another	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
prowling	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
furniture	NULL

Aunt	NULL

With	NULL
this	NULL
idea	NULL
Mrs	NULL
John	NULL
gave	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
unnecessary	NULL
fatigue	NULL

and	NULL
gave	NULL
much	NULL
offence	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
servants	NULL
by	NULL
making	NULL
pilgrimages	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

turning	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
unlikely	NULL
places	NULL

poking	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
frequented	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
perfectly	NULL
virtuous	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
amiable	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL

for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL

she	NULL

that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

to	NULL
a	NULL

it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
nice	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

feel	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL

then	NULL
such	NULL
delicate	NULL
motives	NULL
are	NULL
seldom	NULL
appreciated	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL

downstairs	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL

air	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL

were	NULL
the	NULL

still	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

at	NULL

a	NULL
most	NULL
fertile	NULL
subject	NULL

Carlingford	NULL

oft-renewed	NULL
comparing	NULL

The	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
ladies	NULL
as	NULL
good	NULL

betted	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

whether	NULL

go	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
aunt	NULL

pay	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Beverley	NULL

Deanery	NULL

retire	NULL

a	NULL
little	NULL

where	NULL
those	NULL
good	NULL

Miss	NULL
Blounts	NULL

so	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Each	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
opinions	NULL
had	NULL
its	NULL
backers	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
profane	NULL
to	NULL

so	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
discussion	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
Miss	NULL

would	NULL
choose	NULL

very	NULL

It	NULL
almost	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL

out	NULL

and	NULL
indeed	NULL
the	NULL
election	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sadly	NULL
damaged	NULL

the	NULL
sad	NULL

most	NULL
unexpected	NULL
event	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL

it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL

the	NULL

of	NULL
guilt	NULL

horror	NULL
which	NULL
filled	NULL
many	NULL

The	NULL

been	NULL

not	NULL

that	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL

also	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
poor	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL

supposed	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL

As	NULL

remained	NULL

,	NULL
even	NULL
though	NULL
retired	NULL

in	NULL
crape	NULL

constitutional	NULL

was	NULL
still	NULL
present	NULL
among	NULL
her	NULL
subjects	NULL

and	NULL
nobody	NULL
could	NULL
usurp	NULL
her	NULL
place	NULL
or	NULL
show	NULL
that	NULL
utter	NULL
indifference	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
regulations	NULL
which	NULL
some	NULL
revolutionaries	NULL
had	NULL
dreamed	NULL
of	NULL

Such	NULL
an	NULL

gone	NULL
direct	NULL

the	NULL
British	NULL

the	NULL

But	NULL
everybody	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
speculated	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
proceedings	NULL
disapproved	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
most	NULL
unlooked-for	NULL

Some	NULL

bear	NULL
it	NULL

staying	NULL
on	NULL
there	NULL

some	NULL

some	NULL

spiteful	NULL

Ashburton	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
justify	NULL
her	NULL
lingering	NULL

If	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
supported	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
conscious	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
tones	NULL
half	NULL
gruff	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
tender	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
downstairs	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
greatcoat	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
aid	NULL
of	NULL
Thomas	NULL

stand	NULL
warming	NULL
the	NULL
tips	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

she	NULL
obeyed	NULL
him	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
unsteady	NULL
but	NULL
kind	NULL
old	NULL
arm	NULL
to	NULL
lean	NULL
upon	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
first	NULL
saw	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
familiar	NULL
world	NULL
looked	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
mist	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
strange	NULL
change	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL

and	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
blackness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
crape	NULL
veil	NULL

But	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
succeeded	NULL
in	NULL
satisfying	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL

she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
secure	NULL
their	NULL
approval	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
objections	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
plan	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL

the	NULL
good	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
spoke	NULL

looking	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
pretty	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
warm	NULL

cheery	NULL

bright	NULL

where	NULL
the	NULL

neat	NULL

precise	NULL
as	NULL

come	NULL
out	NULL

a	NULL
box	NULL

was	NULL
standing	NULL
poking	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL

It	NULL
looked	NULL
all	NULL
very	NULL
solid	NULL

substantial	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
unstable	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
gossamer	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
careless	NULL
passenger	NULL
might	NULL
brush	NULL
away	NULL

The	NULL
two	NULL

people	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
old	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL

remember	NULL

were	NULL
old	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
neither	NULL
did	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL

partly	NULL
said	NULL

it	NULL

This	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL
details	NULL

at	NULL

so	NULL
happy	NULL

disturbed	NULL

decision	NULL

uncomfortable	NULL

either	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL

herself	NULL

the	NULL

look	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL

upstairs	NULL

when	NULL
she	NULL
sank	NULL

into	NULL

put	NULL
up	NULL

him	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL

The	NULL
depressing	NULL

this	NULL

week	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL

walk	NULL

her	NULL

with	NULL
his	NULL

the	NULL
last	NULL
climax	NULL
of	NULL
painful	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL

so	NULL
discouraged	NULL

all	NULL

herself	NULL

her	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL

mood	NULL

She	NULL
kissed	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
counsellors	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
(	NULL

heard	NULL
them	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sweetest	NULL
patience	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
better	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

Notwithstanding	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
commotion	NULL
of	NULL
public	NULL
opinion	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
impression	NULL
upon	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
thoughts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
community	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
almost	NULL
everybody	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
frame	NULL
an	NULL
ideal	NULL
existence	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
or	NULL
she	NULL
regarded	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
seldom	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
has	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
power	NULL
,	NULL
consciously	NULL
and	NULL
evidently	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
regulate	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
whatever	NULL
he	NULL
wants	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
be	NULL
something	NULL
very	NULL
limited	NULL
and	NULL
unsatisfactory	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
her	NULL
musings	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
but	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
many	NULL
times	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
last	NULL
conversation	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
up	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
thawed	NULL
and	NULL
muddy	NULL
snow	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Doctor	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
cut	NULL
out	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
woman	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
candour	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
philosophical	NULL
speculativeness	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
allowed	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
--	NULL
unless	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
rich	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
very	NULL
rich	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
would	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
extent	NULL
,	NULL
different	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
oddly	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Rose	NULL
Lake	NULL
's	NULL
suggestion	NULL
which	NULL
came	NULL
after	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
smile	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
some	NULL
people	NULL
might	NULL
expect	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
sinking	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
nobody	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
giving	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
acting	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
fellow-creatures	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
being	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL

much	NULL

determined	NULL
that	NULL
whatever	NULL
she	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
she	NULL
shall	NULL
certainly	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
nonentity	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
position	NULL
is	NULL
one	NULL
that	NULL
demands	NULL
thought	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
serving	NULL
her	NULL
fellow-creatures	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
very	NULL
willing	NULL
and	NULL
well	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
serve	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
herself	NULL
up	NULL
entirely	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
to	NULL
relinquish	NULL
her	NULL
personal	NULL
prospects	NULL
--	NULL
vague	NULL
though	NULL
these	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
tough	NULL
problem	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
caused	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
unusual	NULL
disturbance	NULL
in	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
well-regulated	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
she	NULL
remembered	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
what	NULL
deep	NULL
mourning	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL

no	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
action	NULL
,	NULL
either	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
kind	NULL
or	NULL
another	NULL

could	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
need	NULL
for	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
final	NULL
decision	NULL
,	NULL
either	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
parish-work	NULL

or	NULL
about	NULL
taking	NULL
Inmates	NULL

Aunt	NULL
Jemima	NULL
proposed	NULL

or	NULL
about	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
single	NULL
suggestion	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
offered	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
any	NULL
necessity	NULL
for	NULL
asking	NULL
what	NULL
her	NULL
cousin	NULL
Tom	NULL
's	NULL
last	NULL
letter	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
about	NULL

or	NULL
why	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
looked	NULL
so	NULL
guilty	NULL
and	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Grief	NULL
has	NULL
its	NULL
privileges	NULL
and	NULL
exemptions	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
other	NULL
great	NULL
principles	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
recollection	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
about	NULL
anything	NULL

filled	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
soothing	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
consolation	NULL
and	NULL
refreshing	NULL
calm	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
other	NULL
events	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
occupy	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
election	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
exciting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
away	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
superfluous	NULL
energy	NULL
of	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
had	NULL
carried	NULL
all	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
balance	NULL
had	NULL
changed	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Bury	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
Low-Church	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
persuaded	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
penitent	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
Man	NULL
for	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
solved	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
intrenched	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
mere	NULL
respectability	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
trusted	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
good	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
considered	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
clear	NULL
conscience	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
chance	NULL
against	NULL
a	NULL
repentant	NULL
sinner	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
done	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
quite	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
penitent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
everything	NULL
was	NULL
expressed	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Rector	NULL
was	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL
means	NULL
contemptible	NULL
,	NULL
either	NULL
as	NULL
an	NULL
adversary	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
supporter	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
embracing	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
's	NULL
claims	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
scarcely	NULL
help	NULL
speaking	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
bad	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
feeling	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
rise	NULL
rather	NULL
high	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
anything	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
deepened	NULL
the	NULL
intensity	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
grief	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
affairs	NULL
might	NULL
go	NULL
badly	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
candidate	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
shut	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
give	NULL
no	NULL
aid	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
hard	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
hard	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
candidates	NULL
themselves	NULL
--	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
had	NULL
thus	NULL
become	NULL
generally	NULL
disapproved	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
doing	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
deserve	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
occupied	NULL
the	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
painful	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
promotion	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
repentant	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
character	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
wonder	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Centum	NULL
grew	NULL
pale	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
creature	NULL
as	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
throwing	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
poor	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
's	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
wrong	NULL
step	NULL
one	NULL
way	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
relapse	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
ways	NULL
of	NULL
wickedness	NULL
--	NULL
might	NULL
undo	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
cost	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
's	NULL
support	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
grievously	NULL
counterbalanced	NULL
by	NULL
what	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
uncertainty	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
especially	NULL
as	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
committee	NULL
lamented	NULL
secretly	NULL
among	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
strong	NULL
will	NULL
or	NULL
business	NULL
habits	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
whom	NULL
implicit	NULL
confidence	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
placed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
might	NULL
get	NULL
restive	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
throw	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
over	NULL
just	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
critical	NULL
moment	NULL
;	NULL
or	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
relapse	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
lazy	NULL
Continental	NULL
habits	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
give	NULL
up	NULL
church-going	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
good	NULL
practices	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
shown	NULL
very	NULL
tolerable	NULL
perseverance	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Mr	NULL
Bury	NULL
's	NULL
influence	NULL
thrown	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
scale	NULL
had	NULL
equalised	NULL
matters	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
contest	NULL
very	NULL
exciting	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
heard	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
from	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
candidate	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
to	NULL
calling	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
steady	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
never	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
any	NULL
effusions	NULL
of	NULL
sympathy	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
that	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
man	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
shake	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
people	NULL
must	NULL
submit	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
decrees	NULL
of	NULL
Providence	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
speak	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
election	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
chances	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
was	NULL
despondent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
cheered	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
very	NULL
good	NULL
hopes	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
very	NULL
glad	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
occasions	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
loss	NULL
to	NULL
me	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
shall	NULL
never	NULL
forget	NULL
our	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
here	NULL
_	NULL
that	NULL
_	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
person	NULL
that	NULL
found	NULL
me	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
any	NULL
cleverness	NULL
of	NULL
mine	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
my	NULL
mind	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
spirit-rapping	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seems	NULL
so	NULL
strange	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
_	NULL
now	NULL
_	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
such	NULL
changes	NULL
since	NULL
then	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
looks	NULL
like	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
steady	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
is	NULL
nothing	NULL
that	NULL
really	NULL
makes	NULL
time	NULL
look	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
we	NULL
must	NULL
all	NULL
bow	NULL
to	NULL
these	NULL
dispensations	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
election	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
amuse	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
writs	NULL
are	NULL
out	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
takes	NULL
place	NULL
on	NULL
Monday	NULL
week	NULL

"	NULL

Upon	NULL
which	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
smiled	NULL
upon	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
held	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
gesture	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
which	NULL
said	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
know	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
have	NULL
_	NULL
all	NULL

my	NULL
best	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
candidate	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
moved	NULL
--	NULL
more	NULL
moved	NULL
than	NULL
at	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
I	NULL
succeed	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
whom	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
thank	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
fervently	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
climax	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
bathos	NULL
to	NULL
plunge	NULL
into	NULL
ordinary	NULL
details	NULL
after	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
holding	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
clasped	NULL
it	NULL
almost	NULL
tenderly	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
good-bye	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mourning	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
black	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
style	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
gone	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
looked	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
even	NULL
embellished	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
natural	NULL
tears	NULL
which	NULL
still	NULL
shone	NULL
by	NULL
times	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
bewilderment	NULL
after	NULL
this	NULL
interview	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
forgot	NULL
his	NULL
overcoat	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
confusing	NULL
circumstance	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
gentle	NULL
excitement	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Would	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
wonder	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
asking	NULL
himself	NULL
whether	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
would	NULL
or	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
present	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
Lady	NULL
Richmond	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
family	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Blue	NULL
Boar	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
brightening	NULL
and	NULL
quickening	NULL
influence	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
movements	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
doubt	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
whatever	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
discouraging	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
piquant	NULL
,	NULL
stimulating	NULL
,	NULL
exciting	NULL
doubt	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
but	NULL
proposed	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
committee	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
filled	NULL
these	NULL
gentlemen	NULL
with	NULL
wonder	NULL
and	NULL
dismay	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
carried	NULL
it	NULL
home	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
trotted	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Firs	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
walk	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
house	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
examined	NULL
all	NULL
its	NULL
capabilities	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
particular	NULL
motive	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
pains	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
housekeeper	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Would	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
wonder	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
retired	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
;	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
an	NULL
unusual	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
iteration	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
sensible	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
so	NULL
fully	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
important	NULL
affairs	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
asking	NULL
herself	NULL
any	NULL
questions	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
letting	NULL
things	NULL
take	NULL
their	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
interfering	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
consequently	NULL
,	NULL
nothing	NULL
that	NULL
happened	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
carried	NULL

As	NULL

it	NULL

gradually	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL

everybody	NULL

Mr	NULL

Mr	NULL

at	NULL

stick	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
night	NULL

and	NULL
neglected	NULL
no	NULL
means	NULL

up	NULL

the	NULL
morning	NULL

get	NULL
early	NULL

went	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
it	NULL

prevent	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
lounging	NULL

which	NULL
were	NULL
utterly	NULL
out	NULL

little	NULL
idleness	NULL

poor	NULL
Mr	NULL

was	NULL
two	NULL
stone	NULL
lighter	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
eve	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
election	NULL
than	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
canvass	NULL
began	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
a	NULL
contrast	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
any	NULL
man	NULL
angry	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
was	NULL
goaded	NULL
into	NULL
more	NULL
activity	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
decisive	NULL
moment	NULL
approached	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
performed	NULL
what	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
unparalleled	NULL
feats	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
fate	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
accident	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
which	NULL
brought	NULL
such	NULL
dismay	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
supporters	NULL
.	NULL

Our	NULL
own	NULL
opinion	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
materially	NULL
affect	NULL
the	NULL
issue	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
contest	NULL
one	NULL
way	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
reverse	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
feeling	NULL
which	NULL
prevailed	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
election	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
seemed	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
meeting	NULL
a	NULL
Dissenting	NULL
committee	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
leaving	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
Grove	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
ordinary	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
occasion	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
a	NULL
later	NULL
period	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
motion	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
obedience	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
committee	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
ordered	NULL
him	NULL
about	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
nigger	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
spring	NULL
afternoon	NULL
was	NULL
darkening	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Dissenters	NULL
(	NULL
almost	NULL
wholly	NULL
unimpressed	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
arguments	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
remarking	NULL
more	NULL
strongly	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
where	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
"	NULL
dealt	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
everybody	NULL
knew	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
)	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
dispersed	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
natural	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
Grove	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
other	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
played	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
different	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
certain	NULL
softening	NULL
influences	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
possession	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
a	NULL
voice	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
Jove	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
very	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
shrill	NULL
pipe	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

To	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
person	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
resentment	NULL
against	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
done	NULL
him	NULL
any	NULL
harm	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
of	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
once	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
unquestionably	NULL
done	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
who	NULL
first	NULL
showed	NULL
herself	NULL
candidly	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
stout	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
all	NULL
along	NULL
had	NULL
supported	NULL
and	NULL
encouraged	NULL
his	NULL
rival	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
pique	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
mixed	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
anger	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
sins	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
counterbalancing	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
still	NULL
remained	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
one	NULL
supereminently	NULL
wise	NULL
thing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
still	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL

to	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
instantly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
's	NULL

and	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL

do	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
absurdity	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
marry	NULL
him	NULL

after	NULL
which	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL

pecuniarily	NULL

otherwise	NULL
(	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
poor	NULL

a	NULL

It	NULL
did	NULL

occur	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL

married	NULL
him	NULL

even	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
gone	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL

perhaps	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
any	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
woman	NULL

and	NULL
his	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
strengthened	NULL
than	NULL
otherwise	NULL
the	NULL
revolt	NULL

his	NULL
heart	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL

.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
figure	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
shawl	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
gracefully	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
making	NULL
her	NULL
look	NULL
very	NULL
square	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
shoulders	NULL
and	NULL
bunchy	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
neck	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
robe	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
whisked	NULL
past	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
peculiar	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
faded	NULL
silk	NULL
gown	NULL
which	NULL
looks	NULL
and	NULL
rustles	NULL
like	NULL
tin	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
thin	NULL
metallic	NULL
substance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
made	NULL
that	NULL
momentary	NULL
pause	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
following	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
merely	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
pursuing	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
course	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
into	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
farther	NULL
end	NULL
as	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
along	NULL
very	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
walked	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
with	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
bounce	NULL
of	NULL
excitement	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL
's	NULL
door	NULL
long	NULL
before	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
reached	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
level	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
parlour	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
partially	NULL
open	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
positively	NULL
started	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
associations	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
rising	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
pouring	NULL
forth	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
half-open	NULL
window	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
volume	NULL
of	NULL
melody	NULL
as	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
heard	NULL
for	NULL
years	NULL
in	NULL
Grove	NULL
Street	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
freshness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
surprise	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
hearer	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
critical	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
volume	NULL
and	NULL
force	NULL
seemed	NULL
even	NULL
greater	NULL
than	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
already	NULL
mentioned	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
history	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
contralto	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
special	NULL
charm	NULL
for	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
struck	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
stock-still	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
knowing	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
wavered	NULL
for	NULL
another	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
allegorical	NULL
crisis	NULL
had	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
Pleasure	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
magnificent	NULL
gush	NULL
of	NULL
song	NULL
,	NULL
wooed	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Duty	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
still	NULL
small	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
called	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
wavered	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
fifty	NULL
seconds	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
issue	NULL
was	NULL
uncertain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
victim	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
within	NULL
reach	NULL
of	NULL
salvation	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
depends	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
upon	NULL
whether	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
really	NULL
likes	NULL
doing	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL
means	NULL
an	NULL
invariable	NULL
necessity	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
abstract	NULL
no	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
his	NULL
unless	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
consequently	NULL
his	NULL
resistance	NULL
to	NULL
temptation	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
feeble	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
knocking	NULL
at	NULL
Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL
's	NULL
door	NULL
before	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
thoughts	NULL
appropriate	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
occasion	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
sitting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
sofa	NULL
in	NULL
Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL
's	NULL
parlour	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
ten	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
explain	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
surely	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
enchantment	NULL
altogether	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
deeply	NULL
offended	NULL
by	NULL
hearing	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
seriously	NULL
coupled	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
who	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
anywhere	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
here	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
eve	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
election	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
keeping	NULL
watch	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
conduct	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Barbara	NULL
who	NULL
sat	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
piano	NULL
singing	NULL
--	NULL
singing	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
songs	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
the	NULL
entire	NULL
interval	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
occupation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
anything	NULL
else	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sensation	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
strange	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
excused	NULL
for	NULL
feeling	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
uncertainty	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
whether	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dreaming	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
answer	NULL
himself	NULL
the	NULL
graver	NULL
question	NULL
whether	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
out	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
or	NULL
ten	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
--	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
free	NULL
to	NULL
amuse	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
stout	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
upon	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
anxious	NULL
constituency	NULL
were	NULL
fixed	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
being	NULL
so	NULL
virtuous	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
length	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
forbidden	NULL
pleasure	NULL
was	NULL
sweet	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
's	NULL
ideas	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
gradually	NULL
arranged	NULL
themselves	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
haircloth	NULL
sofa	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
differences	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
bewildering	NULL
resemblances	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
and	NULL
past	NULL
.	NULL

Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
changed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
insult	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
fresh	NULL
looks	NULL
and	NULL
mischievous	NULL
candour	NULL
about	NULL
"	NULL
going	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Barbara	NULL
_	NULL
had	NULL
_	NULL
gone	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
acknowledge	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
expanded	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
contralto	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
blacker	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
brilliant	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
eyes	NULL
which	NULL
owned	NULL
an	NULL
indescribable	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
usage	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
wore	NULL
the	NULL
deep	NULL
roses	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
deepened	NULL
and	NULL
fixed	NULL
by	NULL
wear	NULL
and	NULL
tear	NULL
.	NULL

Instead	NULL
of	NULL
feeling	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
presence	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
felt	NULL
somehow	NULL
consoled	NULL
and	NULL
justified	NULL
and	NULL
sympathetic	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Poor	NULL
soul	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
by	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
singing	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wars	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
scatheless	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
reproach	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
commiserate	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
mixture	NULL
of	NULL
wonder	NULL
and	NULL
tolerance	NULL
and	NULL
pity	NULL
which	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
had	NULL
manifested	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
remark	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
stout	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
fallen	NULL
,	NULL
fallen	NULL
,	NULL
fallen	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
high	NULL
estate	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
Barbara	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
herself	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
pinnacles	NULL
of	NULL
youth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sang	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
sung	NULL
ten	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
received	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
flutter	NULL
of	NULL
suppressed	NULL
delight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
excitement	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hardworked	NULL
candidate	NULL
sank	NULL
deeper	NULL
and	NULL
deeper	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sofa	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
music	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
very	NULL
soothing	NULL
and	NULL
pleasant	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
everybody	NULL
had	NULL
united	NULL
in	NULL
goading	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
petting	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
month	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
something	NULL
about	NULL
yourself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
song	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Barbara	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL

old	NULL
times	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
like	NULL

said	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
went	NULL
because	NULL

I	NULL
went	NULL

"	NULL
"	NULL
Why	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL
go	NULL

"	NULL
asked	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Because	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
stay	NULL
here	NULL
any	NULL
longer	NULL

said	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
vehemence	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
because	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL

about	NULL

And	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
tear	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
eye	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
knocked	NULL
about	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL

and	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
learned	NULL
much	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL

not	NULL

Upon	NULL
which	NULL
Barbara	NULL
lifted	NULL
her	NULL
black	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
scarcely	NULL
done	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
bright	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
softened	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stare	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
grown	NULL
habitual	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
crimson	NULL
cheeks	NULL
glowed	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
untidy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
worn	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
creature	NULL
much	NULL
buffeted	NULL
about	NULL
by	NULL
wind	NULL
and	NULL
waves	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
what	NULL
connoisseurs	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
article	NULL
call	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
full	NULL
at	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
cast	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
see	NULL
any	NULL
difference	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
tremor	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
youth	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
fond	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
naturally	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
touched	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
Barbara	NULL
again	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
reproof	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
trembled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
presence	NULL
here	NULL
made	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL
as	NULL
great	NULL
an	NULL
impression	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
palmiest	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
greater	NULL
impression	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
old	NULL
commerce	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
stormy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
interrupted	NULL
by	NULL
many	NULL
a	NULL
hurricane	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Barbara	NULL
then	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
,	NULL
many	NULL
strings	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
bow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
changed	NULL
:	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
this	NULL
old	NULL
hope	NULL
should	NULL
revive	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
away	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
gratification	NULL
of	NULL
temper	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
remember	NULL
ever	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
tremble	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
too	NULL
was	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
curious	NULL
revival	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
anything	NULL
of	NULL
deeper	NULL
importance	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
Rose	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
household	NULL
affairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL
to	NULL
tea	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
candidate	NULL
recollected	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
sister	NULL
also	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
different	NULL
ways	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
flattering	NULL
reception	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
pledged	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
vote	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
interest	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
how	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
enthusiastic	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
success	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Rose	NULL
scowled	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
dangerous	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
comings	NULL
and	NULL
goings	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
without	NULL
apprehension	NULL
;	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
unexpected	NULL
pleasure	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
startled	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
how	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
commotion	NULL
his	NULL
presence	NULL
made	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
pressed	NULL
Barbara	NULL
's	NULL
hand	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
dinner	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
heart	NULL
which	NULL
certainly	NULL
beat	NULL
lighter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
pleasant	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
returning	NULL
self-confidence	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
chief	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
Dissenting	NULL
supporters	NULL
,	NULL
accompanied	NULL
(	NULL
for	NULL
Mr	NULL
Bury	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
Low-Church	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
loved	NULL
,	NULL
wherever	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
in	NULL
unison	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
Dissenting	NULL
brethren	NULL
)	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
's	NULL
churchwarden	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
stopped	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
curiously	NULL
critical	NULL
air	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Candidate	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
every	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
friend	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
being	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
look	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
eyes	NULL
sent	NULL
an	NULL
icy	NULL
chill	NULL
through	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
the	NULL
forbidden	NULL
pleasure	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sweet	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
thinking	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
going	NULL
back	NULL
ten	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
feeling	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
doubtful	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
or	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
mused	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
continually	NULL
connecting	NULL
and	NULL
contrasting	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
jealous	NULL
Queen	NULL
Eleanor	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
take	NULL
possession	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
she	NULL
choose	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
effort	NULL
;	NULL
while	NULL
Barbara	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Rosamond	NULL
,	NULL
dilapidated	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
always	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
and	NULL
console	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
bower	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
unconscious	NULL
sentiment	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
mused	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
wise	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
part	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
still	NULL
probably	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
into	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
travelled	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
way	NULL
beyond	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
passed	NULL
her	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
in	NULL
seeing	NULL
how	NULL
diminished	NULL
the	NULL
lights	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
once	NULL
radiant	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
!	NULL

but	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
afford	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
money	NULL
upon	NULL
wax	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
Continental	NULL
church	NULL
might	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
odd	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
power	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
pleasure	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
coming	NULL
down	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
pride	NULL
and	NULL
diminution	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
lights	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
her	NULL
door	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
reflection	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

sitting	NULL

her	NULL

the	NULL
room	NULL

was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
lighted	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL

heard	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
coming	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL
's	NULL

that	NULL
Barbara	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
singing	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
telling	NULL
what	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
A	NULL

Thomas	NULL
said	NULL
indignantly	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
his	NULL
former	NULL
mistress	NULL

visit	NULL

to	NULL
assure	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
brother-in-law	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
free-spoken	NULL
than	NULL

now	NULL

naturally	NULL

an	NULL
occurrence	NULL
which	NULL

regarded	NULL

the	NULL

an	NULL

to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
startled	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
quickly	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
about	NULL

then	NULL
stopped	NULL
herself	NULL

turned	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
upon	NULL
Thomas	NULL

and	NULL
poked	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
energetic	NULL
way	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
even	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL

make	NULL
all	NULL
tidy	NULL
after	NULL

that	NULL

a	NULL
thing	NULL

said	NULL
Thomas	NULL

"	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
actually	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
moisture	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eye	NULL

he	NULL
took	NULL
that	NULL

Mr	NULL

pitied	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

less	NULL

Thomas	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
far	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL

_	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
probable	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
considered	NULL
the	NULL
indulgence	NULL
above	NULL
recorded	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
excusable	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Saturday	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
nomination	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
place	NULL
on	NULL
Monday	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Saturday	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
could	NULL
he	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
repose	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
naturally	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
putting	NULL
himself	NULL
so	NULL
skilfully	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
temptation	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
questions	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
entered	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
of	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
being	NULL
Sunday	NULL
would	NULL
effectually	NULL
neutralise	NULL
any	NULL
harm	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
visit	NULL
so	NULL
simple	NULL
and	NULL
natural	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
neither	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
nor	NULL
his	NULL
committee	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
powers	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
awe	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
hear	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
election	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
decided	NULL
for	NULL
good	NULL
or	NULL
for	NULL
evil	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
comfort	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
falsest	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
deceitful	NULL
consolation	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
intervening	NULL
Sunday	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
severer	NULL
calamity	NULL
for	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
than	NULL
half	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
ordinary	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
general	NULL
excitement	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
so	NULL
high	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
chances	NULL
on	NULL
both	NULL
sides	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
discussed	NULL
and	NULL
debated	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
new	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
water	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
thirsting	NULL
constituency	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
story	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
through	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
St	NULL
Roque	NULL
's	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
wilderness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
North	NULL
End	NULL
,	NULL
tingled	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
special	NULL
allusion	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
sermon	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
tone	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
services	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
sad	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
fine	NULL
countenance	NULL
looked	NULL
so	NULL
melancholy	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Bury	NULL
's	NULL
devoted	NULL
followers	NULL
could	NULL
all	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
something	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Mr	NULL
Tufton	NULL
at	NULL
Salem	NULL
Chapel	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
reticent	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
quite	NULL
famous	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
extempore	NULL
gifts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
rather	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
preach	NULL
about	NULL
any	NULL
very	NULL
recent	NULL
public	NULL
event	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
evident	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
hearers	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
found	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
prepared	NULL
"	NULL
discourse	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
sermon	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
was	NULL
upon	NULL
wickedness	NULL
in	NULL
high	NULL
places	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
sought	NULL
the	NULL
confidence	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
fellows	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
betray	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
offered	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
poor	NULL
man	NULL
a	NULL
hand	NULL
red	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
(	NULL
metaphorical	NULL
)	NULL
blood	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
wrong	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
tone	NULL
of	NULL
public	NULL
opinion	NULL
in	NULL
Grove	NULL
Street	NULL
;	NULL
most	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL
,	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
wolf	NULL
thirsting	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
lamb	NULL
's	NULL
blood	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
rather	NULL
himself	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
lamb	NULL
caught	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
thicket	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
offered	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
many	NULL
influential	NULL
persons	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
wavering	NULL
hitherto	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
inclining	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
's	NULL
liberal	NULL
principles	NULL
and	NULL
supposed	NULL
Low-Church	NULL
views	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
man	NULL
whose	NULL
hand	NULL
is	NULL
red	NULL
metaphorically	NULL
with	NULL
your	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
blood	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
a	NULL
highly	NULL
objectionable	NULL
personage	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
doubtful	NULL
whether	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
enlightened	NULL
constituency	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
consider	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
a	NULL
perfectly	NULL
unstained	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
so	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
unsatisfactory	NULL
a	NULL
sister	NULL
as	NULL
more	NULL
objectionable	NULL
still	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
indignation	NULL
of	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
at	NULL
Barbara	NULL
's	NULL
reappearance	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fury	NULL
of	NULL
George	NULL
Street	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
of	NULL
Wharfside	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
bargees	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
scoff	NULL
openly	NULL
.	NULL

Society	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
worse	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
quote	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
assert	NULL
that	NULL
"	NULL
these	NULL
artist	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
adventurers	NULL
"	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
forget	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
"	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
"	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
dismiss	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
consideration	NULL
her	NULL
black	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
level	NULL
brows	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
magnificent	NULL
contralto	NULL
;	NULL
whereas	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
region	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Member	NULL
for	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
marrying	NULL
"	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
cast	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
into	NULL
temporary	NULL
delirium	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
deadly	NULL
offence	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
people	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
exceptional	NULL
standing	NULL
which	NULL
poor	NULL
Mr	NULL
Lake	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
daughter	NULL
Rose	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
lay	NULL
claim	NULL
to	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
rank	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
"	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
possessed	NULL
as	NULL
artists	NULL
--	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pretension	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
disagreeable	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
shopkeepers	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
society	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
sense	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
worst	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
ill-timed	NULL
indulgence	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
guilt	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
with	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
critics	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
perfectly	NULL
well	NULL
and	NULL
innocently	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
entertained	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
guilty	NULL
intentions	NULL
ever	NULL
conceived	NULL
by	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
misfortunes	NULL
were	NULL
increased	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
intervening	NULL
day	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Sunday	NULL
.	NULL

Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
saying	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
cared	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
natural	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
under	NULL
pretence	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
pew	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
assurance	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
people	NULL
remarked	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
aisle	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
same	NULL
silk	NULL
dress	NULL
which	NULL
rustled	NULL
like	NULL
tin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
more	NULL
demonstration	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
richest	NULL
draperies	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pew-opener	NULL
disapproved	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
everybody	NULL
else	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
turn	NULL
the	NULL
intruder	NULL
out	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
Barbara	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
curiously	NULL
inspected	NULL
by	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
near	NULL
her	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
seat	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
rustling	NULL
silk	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
where	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
deep	NULL
mourning	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
model	NULL
of	NULL
every	NULL
righteous	NULL
observance	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
poor	NULL
Barbara	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
too	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
exemplary	NULL
in	NULL
church	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
meant	NULL
nobody	NULL
any	NULL
harm	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
the	NULL
flashing	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
big	NULL
black	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
level	NULL
line	NULL
above	NULL
them	NULL
gave	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
appearance	NULL
of	NULL
obliqueness	NULL
--	NULL
nor	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
deny	NULL
herself	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
advantages	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
omit	NULL
to	NULL
"	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
"	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
canticles	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
melodious	NULL
liquid	NULL
tones	NULL
as	NULL
made	NULL
everybody	NULL
stop	NULL
and	NULL
look	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
indeed	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
everybody	NULL
's	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
aid	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
ability	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
church-music	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
parish	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
persisted	NULL
in	NULL
saying	NULL
in	NULL
answer	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
objections	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
was	NULL
great	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
congregation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
himself	NULL
was	NULL
seen	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
colour	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
eye	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
unlucky	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
knew	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
start	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
received	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
by	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
turned	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
stone	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
did	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr	NULL
Centum	NULL
turned	NULL
a	NULL
solemnly	NULL
inquiring	NULL
reproachful	NULL
gaze	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
aisle	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
Harry	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
kill	NULL
me	NULL
with	NULL
vexation	NULL
!	NULL

why	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
goodness	NULL
'	NULL
sake	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
come	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
whispered	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Good	NULL
heavens	NULL
!	NULL

how	NULL
could	NULL
I	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
cried	NULL
poor	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
loud	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
heard	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
slight	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
imperceptible	NULL
,	NULL
hum	NULL
around	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
committee	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
their	NULL
eyes	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
thankful	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
lesson	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
bury	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
punishment	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
indiscretion	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
perhaps	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
concerned	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
pitied	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
staked	NULL
his	NULL
honour	NULL
upon	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
's	NULL
repentance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
going	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
publicly	NULL
to	NULL
wallow	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mire	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Sunday	NULL
when	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
worldly	NULL
subject	NULL
ought	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
permitted	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
less	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
discussed	NULL
and	NULL
acted	NULL
upon	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
if	NULL
anything	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
this	NULL
sacred	NULL
day	NULL
remaining	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL

undo	NULL
the	NULL
mischief	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
too	NULL
great	NULL
confidence	NULL
in	NULL
human	NULL
nature	NULL
had	NULL
wrought	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
back	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
hard	NULL

he	NULL
himself	NULL

though	NULL
generally	NULL

was	NULL
unsettled	NULL

actually	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

the	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
shook	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
contradict	NULL

he	NULL
pressed	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL

was	NULL
equivalent	NULL
to	NULL

it	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

enough	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL

her	NULL

feel	NULL

that	NULL
it	NULL

a	NULL

everybody	NULL
was	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
for	NULL

as	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
intuitive	NULL
rapidity	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
characteristic	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
genius	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
remarked	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
everybody	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL
from	NULL
church	NULL
and	NULL
chapel	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Sunday	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
town	NULL
thrilled	NULL
and	NULL
throbbed	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
great	NULL
question	NULL
.	NULL

People	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
condone	NULL
a	NULL
sin	NULL
or	NULL
wink	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
backsliding	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
few	NULL
so	NULL
bigoted	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
faith	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
marrying	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
could	NULL
ever	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
for	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
flourishing	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
green	NULL
bay-tree	NULL
,	NULL
withered	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
him	NULL
knew	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hustings	NULL
were	NULL
erected	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
central	NULL
spot	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Blue	NULL
Boar	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
and	NULL
George	NULL
Street	NULL
meet	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
central	NULL
point	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
near	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
shouts	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
music	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
divers	NULL
noises	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
election	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
and	NULL
strained	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
,	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
trying	NULL
position	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
linger	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
proceedings	NULL
or	NULL
excitement	NULL
of	NULL
Monday	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
nomination	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
speeches	NULL
were	NULL
made	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
show	NULL
of	NULL
hands	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
thought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
's	NULL
favour	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
trial	NULL
.	NULL

Lady	NULL
Richmond	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
party	NULL
drove	NULL
past	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
early	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
windows	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
congratulated	NULL
themselves	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
early	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
poor	NULL
dear	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
additional	NULL
pain	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
them	NULL
go	NULL
past	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
did	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
usual	NULL
good	NULL
sense	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
kept	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
blind	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
never	NULL
did	NULL
anything	NULL
absurd	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
early	NULL
rising	NULL
on	NULL
ordinary	NULL
occasions	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
restrain	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
excitement	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
her	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
earlier	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
music	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
cabs	NULL
rattling	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
if	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
quicker	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
important	NULL
crisis	NULL
for	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
than	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
person	NULL
,	NULL
save	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
foolish	NULL
to	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
assert	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
what	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
meant	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
imagined	NULL
how	NULL
hard	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
upon	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
thus	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
outside	NULL
row	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
assembly	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
distant	NULL
shouts	NULL
and	NULL
sounds	NULL
,	NULL
everything	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
noisy	NULL
and	NULL
inarticulate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
conveyed	NULL
no	NULL
meaning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
reach	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
really	NULL
inform	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
window	NULL
the	NULL
cabs	NULL
rushing	NULL
past	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
violet-and-green	NULL
colours	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
blue-and-yellow	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
sometimes	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
blue-and-yellow	NULL
predominated	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
carriages	NULL
which	NULL
mounted	NULL
the	NULL
hostile	NULL
standard	NULL
carried	NULL
voters	NULL
in	NULL
larger	NULL
numbers	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
enthusiastic	NULL
condition	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
load	NULL
of	NULL
bargemen	NULL
that	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
farther	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
Wharf	NULL
side	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
Blues	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
spectator	NULL
is	NULL
thus	NULL
held	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
event	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
suspense	NULL
which	NULL
grows	NULL
every	NULL
moment	NULL
more	NULL
intolerable	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
or	NULL
she	NULL
is	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
worse	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
or	NULL
her	NULL
absence	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
wonder	NULL
if	NULL
that	NULL
spectator	NULL
becomes	NULL
nervous	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sees	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
dangers	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
darkest	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
if	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
old	NULL
liking	NULL
and	NULL
friendship	NULL
had	NULL
prevailed	NULL
over	NULL
that	NULL
beautiful	NULL
optimism	NULL
which	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
instil	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
minds	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
townsfolk	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
if	NULL
something	NULL
more	NULL
mercenary	NULL
and	NULL
less	NULL
elevating	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
ideal	NULL
search	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
hoped	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
was	NULL
engaged	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
swayed	NULL
the	NULL
popular	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
?	NULL

All	NULL
these	NULL
painful	NULL
questions	NULL
went	NULL
through	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
crept	NULL
on	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
suspense	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
aggravated	NULL
by	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Jemima	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
real	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
election	NULL

kept	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
thought	NULL
so	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
quaked	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
and	NULL
squeezed	NULL
herself	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL

to	NULL
try	NULL
whether	NULL
it	NULL

not	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
catch	NULL
a	NULL
glimpse	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL

her	NULL

rewarded	NULL

the	NULL
extremity	NULL

the	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
continual	NULL
dropping	NULL
of	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Jemima	NULL
's	NULL
questions	NULL
drove	NULL
her	NULL
wild	NULL

Honiton	NULL
design	NULL

for	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
prize	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
moment	NULL

instead	NULL

nourishing	NULL
the	NULL

designs	NULL
which	NULL
everybody	NULL
laid	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
charge	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
content	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
innocent	NULL
privilege	NULL

talking	NULL
a	NULL

her	NULL

Mr	NULL

But	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

time	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
been	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL

she	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
anxious	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
win	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL

women	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
finding	NULL
out	NULL

she	NULL
could	NULL

what	NULL

going	NULL
on	NULL

and	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
everything	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
young	NULL
brothers	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
anxiety	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
fun	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
as	NULL
great	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
arrayed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tin	NULL
dress	NULL
--	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
available	NULL
garment	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
long	NULL

the	NULL

which	NULL

Barbara	NULL
scorned	NULL

tuck	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL

was	NULL
continually	NULL
getting	NULL
trodden	NULL
on	NULL

talked	NULL
about	NULL

reviled	NULL
at	NULL

on	NULL
that	NULL

The	NULL

even	NULL

then	NULL
poor	NULL

thought	NULL
it	NULL

She	NULL

could	NULL

Mrs	NULL

not	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
to	NULL

content	NULL
when	NULL
reasonable	NULL
hope	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
clung	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
possibility	NULL
desperately	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pertinacity	NULL
beyond	NULL
all	NULL
reason	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
swore	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Barbara	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cursed	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
best	NULL
energies	NULL
;	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
these	NULL
are	NULL

days	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
which	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
culprit	NULL
no	NULL
possible	NULL

.	NULL

When	NULL
Barbara	NULL
herself	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
promenade	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
altered	NULL
numbers	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
again	NULL
clasped	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
together	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
faint	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
ill	NULL
fortune	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
fault	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
sympathetic	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
consoling	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
defeated	NULL
candidate	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
before	NULL
everybody	NULL
;	NULL
probably	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
afterwards	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
and	NULL
offered	NULL
her	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
been	NULL
near	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
anybody	NULL
wonder	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
things	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
advantages	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
loser	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fight	NULL
?	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
worsted-work	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
's	NULL
first	NULL
note	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
rival	NULL
's	NULL
name	NULL
stood	NULL
above	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
quite	NULL
composed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Jemima	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
teasing	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
senseless	NULL
questions	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
lingering	NULL
progress	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
hours	NULL
from	NULL
one	NULL
o'clock	NULL
to	NULL
four	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
cabs	NULL
furiously	NULL
driven	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
distant	NULL
shouts	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
hum	NULL
of	NULL
indefinite	NULL
din	NULL
that	NULL
filled	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
exciting	NULL
every	NULL
moment	NULL
a	NULL
keener	NULL
curiosity	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
giving	NULL
no	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
or	NULL
information	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
driven	NULL
a	NULL
less	NULL
large	NULL
intelligence	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
wits	NULL
.	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
bore	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
doing	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
worsted-work	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saying	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
nobody	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
occasional	NULL
word	NULL
to	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Jemima	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
an	NULL
answer	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
walking	NULL
about	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
repeating	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
prayer	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
success	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
candidate	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
Barbara	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
easiest	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
uncertainty	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
report	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
fingers	NULL
trembled	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
opened	NULL
it	NULL

so	NULL
great	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
emotion	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
recovered	NULL
herself	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
by	NULL
magic	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
grew	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
sob	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
laugh	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finally	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
worsted-work	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
basket	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
threw	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
's	NULL
note	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

drying	NULL
her	NULL

she	NULL
awoke	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

Mr	NULL

was	NULL

the	NULL

in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL

to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
wife	NULL
of	NULL

Member	NULL
for	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
.	NULL

Long	NULL
,	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
career	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
that	NULL
everybody	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
ideal	NULL
fitness	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
position	NULL
had	NULL
struck	NULL
everybody	NULL
.	NULL

Circumstances	NULL
had	NULL
changed	NULL
since	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
worthier	NULL
hero	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
placed	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
stead	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
person	NULL
was	NULL
changed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
remained	NULL
unaltered	NULL
.	NULL

Natural	NULL
fitness	NULL
was	NULL
indeed	NULL
so	NULL
apparent	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
many	NULL
people	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
independent	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL
eligible	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
other	NULL
respect	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
Member	NULL
for	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
assure	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
anything	NULL
particular	NULL
in	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
manner	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
with	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
pure	NULL
optimism	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
quick	NULL
intelligence	NULL
had	NULL
divined	NULL
it	NULL
sooner	NULL
than	NULL
anybody	NULL
else	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

Whether	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
anything	NULL
more	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
own	NULL
impression	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
accept	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
complain	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
encouragement	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
himself	NULL
jilted	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
drove	NULL
home	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
being	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
desponding	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
very	NULL
nearly	NULL
as	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
already	NULL
standing	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
Rector	NULL
in	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
Church	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
won	NULL
one	NULL
victory	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
naturally	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
feel	NULL
more	NULL
confident	NULL
of	NULL
winning	NULL
another	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
without	NULL
entertaining	NULL
any	NULL
over-exalted	NULL
opinion	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
evident	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
thirty	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
to	NULL
reject	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
offer	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
furthest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
from	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
fool	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
respect	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
world	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
nature	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
excited	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
the	NULL
quiet	NULL
life	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
led	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Firs	NULL
,	NULL
biding	NULL
his	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
busy	NULL
and	NULL
important	NULL
existence	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
spent	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
commotion	NULL
and	NULL
ceaseless	NULL
stir	NULL
of	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
new	NULL
career	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
important	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
district	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
wonder	NULL
if	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
excited	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
fatigued	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
fatigued	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
disposed	NULL
for	NULL
sleep	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
united	NULL
influences	NULL
swayed	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
unlike	NULL
his	NULL
ordinary	NULL
sensible	NULL
calm	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
his	NULL
excitement	NULL
culminated	NULL
so	NULL
in	NULL
thoughts	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
Member	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
truly	NULL
a	NULL
lover	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
late	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
candle	NULL
and	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
survey	NULL
all	NULL
alone	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
solitary	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
could	NULL
look	NULL
more	NULL
dismal	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
neither	NULL
light	NULL
nor	NULL
fire	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
desert	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
example	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
stood	NULL
unchanged	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
grand-aunts	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
old	NULL
ladies	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
bequeathed	NULL
the	NULL
Firs	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
scarcely	NULL
ever	NULL
used	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
keeping	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
library	NULL
and	NULL
dining-room	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
always	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
preparing	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
due	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
moment	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
arrived	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
excitement	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
desolate	NULL
room	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
candle	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
just	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
visible	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
dusky	NULL
curtains	NULL
and	NULL
faded	NULL
carpet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
indescribable	NULL
fossil	NULL
air	NULL
which	NULL
everything	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
odd	NULL
little	NULL
spider-legged	NULL
stands	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
Miss	NULL
Penrhyns	NULL
had	NULL
placed	NULL
their	NULL
work-boxes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
sofas	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
sat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
floods	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
tapestry-work	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
decorated	NULL
their	NULL
favourite	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
chilled	NULL
the	NULL
Member	NULL
for	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
sad	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
this	NULL
same	NULL
room	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
fitted	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
suit	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
complexion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
gay	NULL
with	NULL
light	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
presence	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
to	NULL
realise	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
mistress	NULL
so	NULL
active	NULL
and	NULL
energetic	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
place	NULL
would	NULL
change	NULL
its	NULL
aspect	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
glow	NULL
forth	NULL
resplendent	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
twilight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
central	NULL
point	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
fatigue	NULL
which	NULL
gained	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
just	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
repulsed	NULL
all	NULL
livelier	NULL
thoughts	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
is	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
however	NULL
willing	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
might	NULL
turn	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
image	NULL
was	NULL
coy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
more	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
possession	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
the	NULL
grim	NULL
images	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
old	NULL
Miss	NULL
Penrhyns	NULL
walked	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
and	NULL
asserted	NULL
their	NULL
prior	NULL
claims	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
even	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
there	NULL
his	NULL
fire	NULL
was	NULL
burning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
lamp	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
left	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
elected	NULL
Member	NULL
for	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
yield	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
weakness	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
ordinary	NULL
mortal	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

Thoughts	NULL
very	NULL
different	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
even	NULL
more	NULL
disturbing	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL

"	NULL
Mr	NULL
Woodburn	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
coarse	NULL
way	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
to	NULL
refrain	NULL
from	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL

quite	NULL
enough	NULL

see	NULL
any	NULL

why	NULL

should	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
any	NULL

He	NULL
strolled	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
doors	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
in	NULL
commotion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
but	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

had	NULL
paled	NULL
to-day	NULL
at	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL

She	NULL

Heaven	NULL

might	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
reason	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
fault	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL

never	NULL
perceived	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
stout	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
changed	NULL
from	NULL
old	NULL
times	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
entertained	NULL
these	NULL
thoughts	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
steps	NULL
going	NULL
down	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
gradually	NULL
quickened	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
where	NULL

going	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
roundabout	NULL

as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mean	NULL
it	NULL

as	NULL

up	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
far-off	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL

walk	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL

and	NULL
free	NULL
himself	NULL
from	NULL

as	NULL
he	NULL

it	NULL
would	NULL

about	NULL

For	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

take	NULL
refuge	NULL

conclude	NULL
that	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL

She	NULL

more	NULL

the	NULL

above	NULL

who	NULL

Carlingford	NULL

was	NULL
going	NULL

offer	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
acceptance	NULL

put	NULL
his	NULL
happiness	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL

while	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
commotion	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
embroidery	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
strange	NULL
indeed	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
show	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
how	NULL
Aunt	NULL

could	NULL
sit	NULL
there	NULL
so	NULL
quietly	NULL
opposite	NULL
her	NULL

as	NULL
if	NULL
nothing	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
with	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Jemima	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
signs	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
companion	NULL
's	NULL
agitation	NULL

Mrs	NULL
John	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
her	NULL
niece	NULL
to	NULL
shut	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
to	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
's	NULL
evident	NULL
meaning	NULL

now	NULL
that	NULL

visibly	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
crisis	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
panic	NULL

horror	NULL
had	NULL
seized	NULL
her	NULL

What	NULL
would	NULL
Tom	NULL
say	NULL
?	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
by	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
prize	NULL
snapped	NULL
up	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
account	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
give	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
son	NULL
of	NULL

how	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
explain	NULL
her	NULL

as	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
_	NULL
his	NULL
_	NULL
wishes	NULL
and	NULL

her	NULL
absolute	NULL
avoidance	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
conversations	NULL
with	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
?	NULL

While	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
marvelled	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
emotion	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
breast	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
invisible	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Jemima	NULL
's	NULL
insensibility	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
bosom	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
good	NULL
woman	NULL
was	NULL
throbbing	NULL
with	NULL
equal	NULL
excitement	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
each	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
indifferent	NULL
remark	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
panted	NULL
after	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
utterance	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
exhausting	NULL
emotions	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
so	NULL
great	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
preoccupation	NULL
of	NULL
both	NULL
that	NULL
neither	NULL
observed	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
faring	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Jemima	NULL
that	NULL
suffered	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
flattering	NULL
,	NULL
nothing	NULL
gratifying	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
change	NULL
or	NULL
increased	NULL
happiness	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
any	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
splendours	NULL
of	NULL
imagination	NULL
involved	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
displeasure	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
son	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
disappointment	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL

up	NULL
in	NULL

that	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
Tom	NULL
any	NULL
good	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
anxious	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
his	NULL
cousin	NULL

now	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL

fortune	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
but	NULL
two	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
silent	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
tea	NULL
together	NULL
at	NULL
eight	NULL
o'clock	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
noisy	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
thrown	NULL
some	NULL
light	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
problem	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
discussing	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
some	NULL
guidance	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
difficulties	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
was	NULL
inviting	NULL
her	NULL
image	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
fossil	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
finding	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
grim	NULL
shades	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Miss	NULL
Penrhyns	NULL
answer	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
call	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
because	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
image	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
upon	NULL
more	NULL
potently	NULL
from	NULL
another	NULL
quarter	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
familiar	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
after	NULL
this	NULL
exhausting	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
late	NULL
sitting-up	NULL
,	NULL
everybody	NULL
was	NULL
late	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
slept	NULL
little	NULL
all	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
settled	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
returned	NULL
which	NULL
probably	NULL
would	NULL
bring	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
speedy	NULL
decision	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
country	NULL
held	NULL
by	NULL
two	NULL
armies	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
by	NULL
turns	NULL
swept	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
driven	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
turn	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
the	NULL
unaccountable	NULL
stupidity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
public	NULL
--	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
Cavendishes	NULL
,	NULL
Beverleys	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Riders	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
power	NULL
to	NULL
distinguish	NULL
themselves	NULL
by	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
making	NULL
her	NULL
an	NULL
offer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
done	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
here	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
good	NULL
faith	NULL
,	NULL
honesty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
promptitude	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
appeared	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
superior	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
reason	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
particular	NULL
,	NULL
sensible	NULL
like	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
public-spirited	NULL
like	NULL
herself	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
whose	NULL
pursuits	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
enter	NULL
into	NULL
fully	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
perfectly	NULL
ideal	NULL
position	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
whose	NULL
person	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
of	NULL
desirable	NULL
qualities	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
considered	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
over	NULL
all	NULL
their	NULL
recent	NULL
intercourse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
terms	NULL
of	NULL
friendship	NULL
into	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
election	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
felt	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
sensible	NULL
person	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
answer	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
neglected	NULL
or	NULL
played	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
devotion	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
certainly	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
would	NULL
deserve	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
another	NULL
such	NULL
possibility	NULL
afforded	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
merited	NULL
nothing	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
and	NULL
die	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
woman	NULL
on	NULL
two	NULL
hundred	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
rush	NULL
forth	NULL
a	NULL
crowd	NULL
of	NULL
quick-coming	NULL
and	NULL
fantastic	NULL
suggestions	NULL
which	NULL
took	NULL
away	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
breath	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
loud	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
"	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
"	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
ever	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
's	NULL
name	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
her	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
fortune	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
reasonable	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
himself	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
heap	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
fool	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
possible	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
sake	NULL
?	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
soul	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
sense	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
her	NULL
ruling	NULL
quality	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
forsake	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
consent	NULL
to	NULL
yield	NULL
herself	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
pure	NULL
unreason	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
struggle	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
fought	NULL
manfully	NULL
,	NULL
womanfully	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
weakness	NULL
which	NULL
hitherto	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
lying	NULL
hidden	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
out-of-the-way	NULL
corner	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

Probably	NULL
if	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
excitement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
election	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
unpremeditated	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
saved	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
self-torment	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
hard	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
proposal	NULL
hanging	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
uncertainty	NULL
or	NULL
mystery	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
full	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
accounting	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
curious	NULL
force	NULL
and	NULL
vividness	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
that	NULL
strange	NULL
idea	NULL
about	NULL
"	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Jemima	NULL
would	NULL
throw	NULL
no	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
frightful	NULL
chaos	NULL
of	NULL
uncertainty	NULL
when	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
was	NULL
shown	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
ring	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
thus	NULL
deprived	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
possible	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
decision	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
faced	NULL
and	NULL
confronted	NULL
her	NULL
fate	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
jump	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
recovered	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rose	NULL
up	NULL
without	NULL
faltering	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Jemima	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
equal	NULL
to	NULL
facing	NULL
the	NULL
emergency	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
evading	NULL
or	NULL
postponing	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
way	NULL
running	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
again	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
sofa	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sitting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
composed	NULL
herself	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
despairing	NULL
tranquillity	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
trusted	NULL
in	NULL
Providence	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
thrown	NULL
herself	NULL
on	NULL
other	NULL
occasions	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
never	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
equally	NULL
important	NULL
crisis	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
inspiration	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
forsake	NULL

now	NULL

"	NULL

Mr	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL
candidate	NULL
nervously	NULL

he	NULL
cleared	NULL
his	NULL

What	NULL
caused	NULL
this	NULL
question	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
changed	NULL
colour	NULL

and	NULL
given	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL

taken	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL

it	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
Mr	NULL

it	NULL

it	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL

the	NULL
door	NULL
bell	NULL
pealed	NULL
wildly	NULL
below	NULL
in	NULL
correction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mistake	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
evident	NULL
that	NULL
somebody	NULL
wanted	NULL
admission	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
to	NULL
lose	NULL

who	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL

at	NULL
whatever	NULL

in	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL

Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
who	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
amused	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
alarmed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
much	NULL
annoyed	NULL
at	NULL
bottom	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
natural	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
interruption	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
well	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
accepted	NULL
or	NULL
rejected	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
equally	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
in	NULL
either	NULL
case	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
a	NULL
stop	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ringing	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
ghostly	NULL
bell	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
meaning	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
immediately	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
know	NULL
his	NULL
fate	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
heart	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL

having	NULL
fully	NULL
ascertained	NULL
who	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL

was	NULL
now	NULL
choking	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
beating	NULL

Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
clear	NULL
everything	NULL
up	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
he	NULL
heard	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
throw	NULL
any	NULL
distinct	NULL
light	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL

his	NULL

it	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
return	NULL

and	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
sat	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
sofa	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
clasped	NULL
together	NULL
to	NULL
support	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
leaping	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
mouth	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL
frenzy	NULL
of	NULL
suspense	NULL
,	NULL
listening	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
whole	NULL
heart	NULL

soul	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
prevent	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
crowd	NULL
of	NULL
thoughts	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
persecuting	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
twenty-four	NULL
hours	NULL
from	NULL
keeping	NULL
up	NULL
their	NULL
wild	NULL
career	NULL
as	NULL
before	NULL

What	NULL
reason	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
to	NULL
suppose	NULL
that	NULL
"	NULL

Who	NULL
could	NULL
arrive	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
accidental	NULL
way	NULL

without	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL

And	NULL
what	NULL

had	NULL
she	NULL

The	NULL

or	NULL
rather	NULL
the	NULL
seconds	NULL

passed	NULL
over	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
like	NULL
hours	NULL

as	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
thus	NULL
waiting	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
daring	NULL
to	NULL
stir	NULL
lest	NULL
the	NULL

keep	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
ears	NULL
some	NULL
sound	NULL
from	NULL
below	NULL

till	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
the	NULL
interval	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
sink	NULL

and	NULL
her	NULL
excitement	NULL
to	NULL
fail	NULL

It	NULL
could	NULL

if	NULL
it	NULL

Lydia	NULL

or	NULL
somebody	NULL

----	NULL
When	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
suddenly	NULL
mounted	NULL
up	NULL
again	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
spring	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
ears	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
heard	NULL
neither	NULL
words	NULL
nor	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
something	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
as	NULL
great	NULL
an	NULL
effect	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
either	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
landing	NULL
half-way	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
from	NULL
time	NULL
immemorial	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
china	NULL
bowl	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
cards	NULL
of	NULL
visitors	NULL
were	NULL
placed	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
bowl	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
full	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
anybody	NULL
rushing	NULL
upstairs	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
reckless	NULL
way	NULL
might	NULL
easily	NULL
upset	NULL
table	NULL
and	NULL
cards	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
progress	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
happened	NULL
while	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
sat	NULL
listening	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
rumble	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
crash	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
sound	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
falling	NULL
leaves	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
jump	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
ears	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
cards	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
her	NULL
composure	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
miracle	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
unclasped	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
holding	NULL
pressed	NULL
painfully	NULL
together	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
supporting	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
sigh	NULL
of	NULL
unutterable	NULL
relief	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
whirl	NULL
of	NULL
thought	NULL
stopped	NULL
and	NULL
cleared	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
instantaneous	NULL
rapidity	NULL
.	NULL

Everything	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
explained	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
sound	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
never	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
greater	NULL
change	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
looks	NULL
and	NULL
feelings	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
passed	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
looks	NULL
and	NULL
feelings	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
interval	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
drawing	NULL
up	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
cab	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rush	NULL
of	NULL
Tom	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
commotion	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
staircase	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
doubt	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
even	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
strength	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hold	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
welcome	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
arms	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
beard	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
changed	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
person	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
ventured	NULL
to	NULL
kiss	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
Tom	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
her	NULL
cousin	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
dared	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
such	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
audacity	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
arm	NULL
's	NULL
length	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
appearance	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
repeated	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
salutation	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL

and	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
reins	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL

"	NULL

Who	NULL

said	NULL
Tom	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
astonished	NULL
air	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
I	NULL

you	NULL

Ah	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL

I	NULL

Then	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Jemima	NULL
had	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
Mr	NULL

a	NULL

she	NULL

not	NULL
grateful	NULL

however	NULL
kind	NULL

intentions	NULL
might	NULL

But	NULL
Tom	NULL
was	NULL
holding	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL

and	NULL
looking	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
while	NULL
this	NULL
thought	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL

Miss	NULL

Tom	NULL
energetically	NULL

he	NULL

both	NULL

The	NULL

that	NULL

was	NULL
to	NULL

To	NULL

Tom	NULL
behaved	NULL
at	NULL

if	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
anything	NULL
absolutely	NULL
without	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
wasted	NULL
no	NULL

no	NULL

left	NULL
no	NULL

Mr	NULL

one	NULL

Now	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL

he	NULL
took	NULL

it	NULL

utterly	NULL

the	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

back	NULL

her	NULL

the	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
hastily	NULL

not	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL

colour	NULL

for	NULL
it	NULL

then	NULL
only	NULL
Tom	NULL

bethought	NULL
himself	NULL

rushed	NULL
upstairs	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
made	NULL
various	NULL
suggestions	NULL

still	NULL
doubtfully	NULL

no	NULL
telling	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL

Mr	NULL

had	NULL
looked	NULL
dangerous	NULL

Nancy	NULL
had	NULL

a	NULL

many	NULL
dangers	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

then	NULL
she	NULL

half-way	NULL

up	NULL

about	NULL

found	NULL
with	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL

broken	NULL

All	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
pathos	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
indeed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
encounter	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
place	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
each	NULL

for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
enough	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
contemplated	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
tender	NULL
sentimental	NULL
interest	NULL

as	NULL
any	NULL
gentle	NULL
moralist	NULL
might	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
field	NULL

What	NULL
feelings	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
minds	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
met	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
each	NULL

What	NULL
a	NULL
dread	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
disappointment	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
;	NULL
what	NULL
sharp	NULL
stimulation	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
!	NULL

Thus	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
stood	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
landing	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
encounter	NULL
,	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
pensive	NULL
interest	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
away	NULL
as	NULL
completely	NULL

Mr	NULL

was	NULL
in	NULL

or	NULL
Mr	NULL
Cavendish	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
Barbara	NULL
Lake	NULL

The	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
so	NULL
sudden	NULL
a	NULL
revolution	NULL
made	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
giddy	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
thoughtfully	NULL
upstairs	NULL
.	NULL

Poor	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL

It	NULL
hardly	NULL
seemed	NULL
real	NULL
even	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
again	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL

when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
downstairs	NULL
again	NULL

his	NULL
mother	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
herself	NULL

over	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
weakness	NULL

for	NULL

a	NULL
very	NULL

Tom	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL

soon	NULL

late	NULL

and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
fruits	NULL

her	NULL
little	NULL

treachery	NULL
were	NULL
accordingly	NULL
lost	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
treachery	NULL
itself	NULL
remained	NULL

revealed	NULL
at	NULL

to	NULL
one	NULL
person	NULL

the	NULL
very	NULL
clearest	NULL
light	NULL

It	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL

the	NULL
excitement	NULL

her	NULL

Therefore	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
blank	NULL
countenance	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs	NULL

came	NULL
downstairs	NULL

She	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL

kiss	NULL
her	NULL

take	NULL
her	NULL

her	NULL

Tom	NULL
looking	NULL

she	NULL
gave	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL

And	NULL
when	NULL
Tom	NULL

dismissed	NULL

his	NULL

Aunt	NULL

When	NULL

time	NULL

suddenly	NULL

it	NULL
also	NULL
had	NULL
its	NULL
difficulties	NULL

like	NULL
everything	NULL

Her	NULL

the	NULL

might	NULL

had	NULL
it	NULL

Mr	NULL

instead	NULL

In	NULL
that	NULL

she	NULL

gone	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL

to	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL

sprang	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
redoubled	NULL
vigour	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
maze	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL

been	NULL

Her	NULL

had	NULL
suspended	NULL

to	NULL
speak	NULL

all	NULL
its	NULL
ordinary	NULL
operations	NULL
for	NULL
twenty-four	NULL
hours	NULL

busy	NULL
investigating	NULL

when	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
old	NULL
Doctor	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
thoughts	NULL

been	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL

almost	NULL
as	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL

it	NULL

all	NULL
over	NULL

the	NULL
decision	NULL
made	NULL

no	NULL

question	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
active	NULL
mind	NULL
sprang	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
renewed	NULL
energy	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
beginning	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
everything	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
settled	NULL
and	NULL
arranged	NULL

Her	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
while	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
were	NULL
busy	NULL
putting	NULL
away	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
Indian	NULL
presents	NULL

Tom	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
--	NULL
presents	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
chronological	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL

accumulate	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

It	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL

be	NULL
touching	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

see	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL

her	NULL

all	NULL
these	NULL
years	NULL

but	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
being	NULL

of	NULL
a	NULL
nobly	NULL

her	NULL

instead	NULL
of	NULL
dallying	NULL
with	NULL
these	NULL
tokens	NULL

the	NULL
past	NULL

went	NULL
forward	NULL
with	NULL
serious	NULL
solicitude	NULL

The	NULL
marriage	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL

out	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL

accordingly	NULL

Tom	NULL

no	NULL

was	NULL
very	NULL

that	NULL

him	NULL

Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
was	NULL
revolving	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL

when	NULL
she	NULL
laid	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
by	NULL
chance	NULL

upon	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
Carlingford	NULL

inky	NULL

which	NULL

been	NULL
laid	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL

It	NULL
contained	NULL

of	NULL
course	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL

but	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
well	NULL
acquainted	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
beforehand	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
condescending	NULL
to	NULL
derive	NULL
her	NULL
information	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
newspaper	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
advertisements	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
eye	NULL
which	NULL
saw	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
without	NULL
pausing	NULL
upon	NULL
anything	NULL
in	NULL
particular	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
usual	NULL
notice	NULL
about	NULL
marmalade	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
announcement	NULL
that	NULL
young	NULL
Mr	NULL

who	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
himself	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
known	NULL

Carlingford	NULL

was	NULL
to	NULL
preach	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

naturally	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
moderate	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
details	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
eye	NULL

which	NULL

if	NULL

ever	NULL

had	NULL

kindled	NULL
up	NULL

and	NULL
all	NULL
its	NULL
usual	NULL
energy	NULL
and	NULL
intelligence	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL

Her	NULL
thoughtful	NULL
face	NULL
woke	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL

Her	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
drooping	NULL
in	NULL

grew	NULL
erect	NULL

her	NULL

She	NULL
clasped	NULL

said	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL

with	NULL
her	NULL
usual	NULL

then	NULL
she	NULL
folded	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL

square	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

struck	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL

placed	NULL
it	NULL

Tom	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
fail	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL

went	NULL
upstairs	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

"	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
proposition	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
thus	NULL
unfolded	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
away	NULL
Tom	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
breath	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
(	NULL
young	NULL
)	NULL
lady	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
confused	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
slightly	NULL
unintelligible	NULL
conditions	NULL
about	NULL
doing	NULL
good	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
fellow-creatures	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
trifling	NULL
or	NULL
romantic	NULL
suggestion	NULL
.	NULL

Tom	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
remember	NULL
Marchbank	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
careful	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
explained	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ignorant	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
correct	NULL
pronunciation	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
name	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
concluding	NULL
address	NULL
,	NULL
Tom	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
ears	NULL
very	NULL
wide	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
trotting	NULL
about	NULL
with	NULL
small	NULL
steps	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
red-brick	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
neglected	NULL
gardens	NULL
at	NULL
Marchbank	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
let	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
many	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
miserable	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
lands	NULL
and	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
neither	NULL
the	NULL
lands	NULL
nor	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
were	NULL
bad	NULL
of	NULL
themselves	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Tom	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
perfectly	NULL
well	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
idea	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
direction	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
thoughts	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
brought	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bar	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
lover	NULL
of	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
reality	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
young	NULL
Englishmen	NULL
,	NULL
better	NULL
qualified	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shape	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
country	NULL
gentleman	NULL
than	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
profession	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
his	NULL
profession	NULL
behind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
most	NULL
urgent	NULL
want	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
give	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
lover	NULL
's	NULL
abject	NULL
submission	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
over	NULL
for	NULL
twenty-four	NULL
hours	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
spare	NULL
moments	NULL
,	NULL
--	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
smoking	NULL
his	NULL
evening	NULL
cigar	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
studying	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
lady	NULL
's	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
asleep	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
sallied	NULL
forth	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
blinds	NULL
were	NULL
drawn	NULL
up	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
had	NULL
fairly	NULL
awoke	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
brilliant	NULL
ability	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
that	NULL
sure	NULL
and	NULL
steady	NULL
eye	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
secret	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
position	NULL
which	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
revealed	NULL
to	NULL
every	NULL
competent	NULL
critic	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
wonderful	NULL
clear-sightedness	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
wise	NULL
persistence	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
held	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
necessity	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
immediate	NULL
choice	NULL
between	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
alternative	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
no	NULL
delay	NULL
nor	NULL
divergence	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
same	NULL
quality	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
helped	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
pretty	NULL
addition	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
small	NULL
patrimony	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
settle	NULL
on	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
now	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
acquisition	NULL
of	NULL
Marchbank	NULL
an	NULL
easy	NULL
thing	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
though	NULL
Tom	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
wise	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
of	NULL
investment	NULL
in	NULL
land	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
investment	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
way	NULL
agreeable	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
arrow	NULL
went	NULL
straight	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
mark	NULL
--	NULL
straighter	NULL
even	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
besides	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
substantial	NULL
considerations	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
Tom	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
a	NULL
sweet	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
poetic	NULL
justice	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
poor	NULL
uncle	NULL
's	NULL
failure	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
thought	NULL
him	NULL
good	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
give	NULL
this	NULL
coveted	NULL
possession	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
cousin	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
Marchbank	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
market	NULL
in	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
herself	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
money	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
bought	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
little	NULL
chance	NULL
for	NULL
Tom	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
changed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
Tom	NULL
's	NULL
hands	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
wealth	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
lay	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
alone	NULL
carry	NULL
out	NULL
what	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
more	NULL
original	NULL
genius	NULL
suggested	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
the	NULL
Doctor	NULL
could	NULL
but	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
formed	NULL
plans	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
different	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
perhaps	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
Dr	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
that	NULL
Providence	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
ill-advised	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
once	NULL
thought	NULL
in	NULL
committing	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
care	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
creative	NULL
intelligence	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
withholding	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
and	NULL
stated	NULL
her	NULL
conviction	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
herself	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
trouble	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
granted	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
true	NULL
wisdom	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
unfortunately	NULL
so	NULL
rare	NULL
among	NULL
women	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
overmuch	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
display	NULL
any	NULL
feverish	NULL
anxiety	NULL
about	NULL
Marchbank	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
suggestion	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
faith	NULL
in	NULL
Tom	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
tranquillising	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
now	NULL
knowing	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
extent	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
lay	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
sphere	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
sphere	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
find	NULL
herself	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
near	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
a	NULL
watchful	NULL
eye	NULL
upon	NULL
society	NULL
and	NULL
give	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
benefit	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
experience	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
translated	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
her	NULL
influence	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
of	NULL
untold	NULL
advantage	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
modestly	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
fellow-creatures	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
village	NULL
not	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
gates	NULL
at	NULL
Marchbank	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
every	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
village	NULL
nuisance	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
are	NULL
very	NULL
tragical	NULL
about	NULL
village	NULL
nuisances	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
are	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
assail	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
loathing	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
duty	NULL
forced	NULL
upon	NULL
their	NULL
consciences	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
was	NULL
neither	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
thinking	NULL
nor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
liveliest	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
disorder	NULL
and	NULL
disarray	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Marchbank	NULL
village	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
fingers	NULL
itched	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
crooked	NULL
things	NULL
straight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
clean	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
rubbish	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
set	NULL
everything	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
sound	NULL
foundation	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
model	NULL
village	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
prize	NULL
flower-gardens	NULL
and	NULL
clean	NULL
as	NULL
Arcadia	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
given	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
half	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
pleasure	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
recollection	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
wretched	NULL
hovels	NULL
and	NULL
miserable	NULL
cottages	NULL
exhilarated	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
stupid	NULL
and	NULL
ungrateful	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
like	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
warm	NULL
and	NULL
comfortable	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
hungry	NULL
always	NULL
makes	NULL
a	NULL
difference	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
highest	NULL
motive	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
as	NULL
actuated	NULL
by	NULL
lofty	NULL
sentiments	NULL
of	NULL
philanthropy	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
persons	NULL
acquainted	NULL
with	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
biographer	NULL
would	NULL
scorn	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
any	NULL
pretence	NULL

What	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
spirit	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
boundless	NULL
activity	NULL
and	NULL
benevolent	NULL
impulses	NULL
if	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nobody	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
self-devotion	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
race	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
no	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
charitable	NULL
ministrations	NULL
?	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
of	NULL
use	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
fellow-creatures	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
relinquish	NULL
one	NULL
branch	NULL
of	NULL
usefulness	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
prevented	NULL
from	NULL
entering	NULL
into	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Marchbank	NULL
village	NULL
did	NULL
her	NULL
good	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
justified	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
choice	NULL
of	NULL
Tom	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
good	NULL

might	NULL
perhaps	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
merely	NULL
selfish	NULL
personal	NULL
preference	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
regard	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
loftier	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
was	NULL
sweet	NULL
to	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
beautiful	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
helping	NULL
her	NULL
neighbour	NULL
would	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
extent	NULL
impracticable	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
many	NULL
occupations	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Member	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
difficult	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
way	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
otherwise	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
moment	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
difficulty	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
in	NULL
persuading	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
first	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
reality	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
justice	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
step	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
.	NULL

Most	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL
all	NULL
about	NULL
Tom	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
intentions	NULL
and	NULL
prospects	NULL
were	NULL
discussed	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
uncommon	NULL
for	NULL
people	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
There	NULL
was	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
cousin	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
"	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
nobody	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
given	NULL
very	NULL
much	NULL
heed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
suggestion	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Chiley	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
inadequately	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
surprise	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
intelligence	NULL
was	NULL
received	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
seemed	NULL
natural	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
on	NULL
very	NULL
steadily	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
thinking	NULL
particularly	NULL
about	NULL
anybody	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
eligible	NULL
and	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
person	NULL
who	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
present	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
warm	NULL
corner	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
for	NULL
Tom	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
eligible	NULL
person	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
worried	NULL
and	NULL
wearied	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
losses	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
most	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL

Going	NULL
back	NULL
upon	NULL
their	NULL

most	NULL

were	NULL

verify	NULL
the	NULL

that	NULL

first	NULL
was	NULL
beyond	NULL

as	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL

did	NULL

romance	NULL

round	NULL
off	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
upset	NULL
everybody	NULL

made	NULL
an	NULL
altogether	NULL
original	NULL

And	NULL
nothing	NULL

have	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
more	NULL

after	NULL
the	NULL
election	NULL

when	NULL

felt	NULL
the	NULL
blank	NULL
of	NULL
ordinary	NULL
existence	NULL
just	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
settle	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
again	NULL

It	NULL
kept	NULL
all	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
in	NULL

a	NULL
longer	NULL
time	NULL

might	NULL
be	NULL
supposed	NULL

what	NULL

where	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
Tom	NULL
himself	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
visible	NULL
about	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
heaps	NULL

things	NULL

baggage	NULL

recollected	NULL
so	NULL
affectionately	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
he	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL

dispensed	NULL
his	NULL
curiosities	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
liberal	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
of	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
was	NULL
touched	NULL

had	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
miscalculating	NULL
distances	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
said	NULL

and	NULL
exercised	NULL
some	NULL
kind	NULL

magnetic	NULL
influence	NULL
upon	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
tables	NULL

unsteady	NULL
articles	NULL

looked	NULL

them	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL

John	NULL
Brown	NULL

had	NULL
in	NULL

the	NULL
sale	NULL

Marchbank	NULL

found	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
straightforward	NULL

clear-headed	NULL

The	NULL
two	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
preliminaries	NULL
arranged	NULL

any	NULL

went	NULL

it	NULL

proof	NULL

Lucilla	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Mr	NULL

everything	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
naturally	NULL
proud	NULL

formed	NULL
the	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
probably	NULL
from	NULL

enthusiasm	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
subject	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
traced	NULL
the	NULL
commencement	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
singular	NULL
revolution	NULL
of	NULL
sentiment	NULL
in	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL

which	NULL
suddenly	NULL
woke	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL

how	NULL

to	NULL
recognise	NULL
the	NULL

Mr	NULL

the	NULL

over	NULL

under	NULL

her	NULL

indeed	NULL
a	NULL
pleasure	NULL

It	NULL
occupied	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL

the	NULL

did	NULL

which	NULL
Tom	NULL

arranging	NULL

for	NULL

that	NULL

the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL

up	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
went	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
moral	NULL
wilderness	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
practical	NULL
glance	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
statesman	NULL

and	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sanguine	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
philanthropist	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
capable	NULL

and	NULL
already	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
imagination	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
desert	NULL
blossomed	NULL
like	NULL

before	NULL
her	NULL

the	NULL

then	NULL

Tom	NULL

his	NULL
qualities	NULL

one	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL

that	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
gift	NULL

was	NULL
scarcely	NULL
to	NULL

for	NULL
him	NULL

made	NULL
his	NULL
character	NULL
as	NULL
near	NULL
perfect	NULL
as	NULL

Lucilla	NULL
felt	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
drove	NULL
away	NULL

that	NULL
approbation	NULL
of	NULL

a	NULL

_	NULL
one	NULL

there	NULL
could	NULL

spirit	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL
sighed	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
veil	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
natural	NULL
sentiment	NULL

still	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL

,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL

said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
rose	NULL
up	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
vision	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
celestial	NULL
vision	NULL
which	NULL
floated	NULL
before	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
drove	NULL
into	NULL
Carlingford	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL
good	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
achieved	NULL
in	NULL

native	NULL
town	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
natural	NULL
culmination	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
career	NULL
that	NULL
transferred	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL

held	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL

serving	NULL

generation	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
twofold	NULL

a	NULL

for	NULL
Grange	NULL
Lane	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
lose	NULL

breathed	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
sweetened	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
of	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
gain	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lighter	NULL
preface	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
past	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
comfort	NULL
of	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
its	NULL
course	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
benefit	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
fellow-creatures	NULL

and	NULL
now	NULL
a	NULL
larger	NULL
sphere	NULL
opened	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
arrangements	NULL
of	NULL
Providence	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
discrimination	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
vain	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
much	NULL
further	NULL
into	NULL
detail	NULL
.	NULL

Mr	NULL
Ashburton	NULL
never	NULL
said	NULL
anything	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
disappointment	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
expected	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
mention	NULL
that	NULL
eventful	NULL
day	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
accidentally	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
calling	NULL
on	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
her	NULL
cousin	NULL
came	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
the	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
affairs	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
sent	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
nice	NULL
present	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
married	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
her	NULL
fault	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Providence	NULL
had	NULL
ordained	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
Tom	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
could	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
fly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
ordinance	NULL
?	NULL

and	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
both	NULL
parties	NULL
the	NULL
consoling	NULL
reflection	NULL

that	NULL
whatever	NULL
might	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
individuals	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
chosen	NULL
for	NULL
Carlingford	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
abiding	NULL
benefit	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
concerned	NULL
.	NULL

Under	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
looked	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Marjoribanks	NULL
's	NULL
spirits	NULL
should	NULL
improve	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mourning	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

with	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
clung	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
should	NULL
yield	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
changed	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
affairs	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Lucilla	NULL
took	NULL
heart	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL

over	NULL
it	NULL

point	NULL

even	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL

It	NULL

the	NULL

nobody	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
kind	NULL

simplified	NULL

very	NULL
much	NULL

could	NULL
not	NULL

pull	NULL
Lucilla	NULL

mutter	NULL
indistinct	NULL
remarks	NULL

the	NULL
