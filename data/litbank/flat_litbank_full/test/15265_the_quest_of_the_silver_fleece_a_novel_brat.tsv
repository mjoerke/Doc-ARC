that	NULL

out	NULL

certain	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL

the	NULL

gone	NULL

trial	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
anticipated	NULL

possibly	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
more	NULL

was	NULL

rather	NULL
daintily	NULL

favorable	NULL

she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
an	NULL
aristocrat	NULL

an	NULL
epicure	NULL

Here	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
teaching	NULL
dirty	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
smell	NULL
of	NULL
confused	NULL
odors	NULL
and	NULL
bodily	NULL
perspiration	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
unbearable	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
color	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL
fact	NULL

she	NULL
almost	NULL
said	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
escape	NULL
it	NULL

Theoretically	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
treated	NULL

here	NULL

brought	NULL

their	NULL
color	NULL
struck	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
terror	NULL

it	NULL
seemed	NULL
ominous	NULL
and	NULL
forbidding	NULL

She	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
shrinking	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
gripping	NULL
herself	NULL
lest	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
perceive	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL

think	NULL

"	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
world	NULL
problem	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
looked	NULL
sordid	NULL
and	NULL
small	NULL
at	NULL
close	NULL
range	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
hundredth	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
today	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
alone	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
barn	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
slowly	NULL
down	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
bottoms	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
paused	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
and	NULL
nodded	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
boys	NULL
at	NULL
work	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
cotton	NULL
field	NULL

Cotton	NULL

She	NULL
paused	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
remembered	NULL
with	NULL
what	NULL
interest	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
read	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
little	NULL
thread	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
almost	NULL
forgotten	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
here	NULL
within	NULL
touch	NULL
and	NULL
sight	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vision	NULL
of	NULL
Cotton	NULL
was	NULL
mirrored	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
glimmering	NULL
sea	NULL
of	NULL
delicate	NULL
leaves	NULL
whispered	NULL
and	NULL
murmured	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
stretching	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Northward	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
beyond	NULL
this	NULL
little	NULL
world	NULL
it	NULL
stretched	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
--	NULL
how	NULL
far	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
trembling	NULL
sea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
foam	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
mighty	NULL
waters	NULL
would	NULL
one	NULL
time	NULL
flood	NULL
the	NULL
ends	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
glimpsed	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
with	NULL
parted	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
sighed	NULL
impatiently	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
poetry	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
place	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
desperate	NULL
prose	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
glanced	NULL
absently	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
boys	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
was	NULL
Bles	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
black	NULL
lad	NULL

Bles	NULL

she	NULL
mused	NULL

--	NULL
now	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
naming	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
"	NULL
Blessed	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
save	NULL
these	NULL
incomprehensible	NULL
creatures	NULL
!	NULL
)	NULL

Her	NULL
regard	NULL
shifted	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
stalks	NULL
and	NULL
leaves	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
her	NULL
New	NULL
England	NULL
conscience	NULL
stepped	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
ought	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
these	NULL
students	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
of	NULL
encouragement	NULL
or	NULL
instruction	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
rather	NULL
primly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boys	NULL
touched	NULL
their	NULL
hats	NULL
and	NULL
murmured	NULL
something	NULL
indistinctly	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
much	NULL
about	NULL

at	NULL

one	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
carelessly	NULL

The	NULL
farther	NULL
boy	NULL
coughed	NULL
and	NULL
Bles	NULL
raised	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

then	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
pause	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
slowly	NULL

(	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
is	NULL

over	NULL
there	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL

although	NULL
she	NULL
really	NULL

n't	NULL

"	NULL
Goobers	NULL

answered	NULL
the	NULL
smaller	NULL

uncomprehendingly	NULL

Then	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
explosion	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
smaller	NULL
boy	NULL
just	NULL
snorted	NULL
with	NULL
irrepressible	NULL
laughter	NULL
and	NULL
bolted	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
fields	NULL

Bles	NULL
--	NULL
was	NULL
Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
deceived	NULL

he	NULL
chuckling	NULL

She	NULL
reddened	NULL

drew	NULL
herself	NULL
up	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
dropping	NULL
her	NULL
primness	NULL

rippled	NULL
with	NULL
laughter	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL

looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
twinkling	NULL
eyes	NULL

The	NULL

often	NULL
on	NULL
Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
's	NULL
lips	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
recognized	NULL

Despite	NULL

again	NULL

outright	NULL

His	NULL
eyes	NULL
lighted	NULL

for	NULL

was	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL

leaned	NULL

dreamily	NULL

up	NULL

he	NULL
saw	NULL

arose	NULL
hastily	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

said	NULL
moving	NULL

at	NULL
first	NULL
very	NULL

then	NULL
more	NULL

more	NULL
slowly	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
puzzled	NULL
look	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
realize	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
pleasant	NULL
little	NULL
chat	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
's	NULL
color	NULL
had	NULL
quite	NULL
escaped	NULL
her	NULL

and	NULL
what	NULL
especially	NULL
puzzled	NULL
her	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
happened	NULL
before	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
here	NULL
four	NULL
months	NULL

yet	NULL
every	NULL
moment	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
vividly	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
painfully	NULL
conscious	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
woman	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
black	NULL
folk	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
little	NULL
half-hour	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
--	NULL
no	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
that	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
talking	NULL

just	NULL
talking	NULL

there	NULL
were	NULL

persons	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL

just	NULL
things	NULL
--	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
:	NULL
Cotton	NULL

She	NULL
started	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
cotton	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
she	NULL
pulled	NULL
herself	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
aspect	NULL
.	NULL

Always	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
veiled	NULL
from	NULL
these	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
veil	NULL
there	NULL

Had	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
hung	NULL
it	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL

had	NULL
they	NULL
hidden	NULL
timidly	NULL
behind	NULL
its	NULL

was	NULL
it	NULL

them	NULL

The	NULL
longer	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL

the	NULL
more	NULL
bewildered	NULL
she	NULL
grew	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
seemed	NULL
no	NULL
analogy	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL

Here	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
unique	NULL
thing	NULL

she	NULL
climbed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
bedroom	NULL
and	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
stars	NULL

TOWN	NULL
John	NULL
Taylor	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
then	NULL
write	NULL

it	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
hurried	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
without	NULL
further	NULL
remark	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
patient	NULL
with	NULL
black	NULL
folk	NULL
than	NULL
with	NULL
white	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
hanging	NULL
just	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
tallest	NULL
trees	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
when	NULL
Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
,	NULL
weary	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
climbed	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
buggy	NULL
beside	NULL
Bles	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
wheeled	NULL
comfortably	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
sombre	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
black-green	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
heading	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
golden-green	NULL
of	NULL
waving	NULL
cotton	NULL
fields	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
lay	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
listlessly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
drank	NULL
the	NULL
soft	NULL
warm	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
languorous	NULL
Spring	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
golden	NULL
sheen	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cotton	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
cold	NULL
March	NULL
winds	NULL
of	NULL
New	NULL
England	NULL
;	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL
who	NULL
apparently	NULL
noted	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
leaves	NULL

winds	NULL
and	NULL
seasons	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mighty	NULL
Cresswells	NULL
whom	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
so	NULL
evidently	NULL
disliked	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
she	NULL
became	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
long	NULL
silence	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Bles	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
didactically	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
where	NULL
are	NULL
you	NULL
from	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
glanced	NULL
across	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
answered	NULL
shortly	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Georgia	NULL
,	NULL
ma'am	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
tried	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Georgia	NULL

a	NULL
large	NULL
State	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
tentatively	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
ma'am	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
stopped	NULL
,	NULL
puzzled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
horse	NULL
jogged	NULL
lazily	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Bles	NULL
switched	NULL
him	NULL
unavailingly	NULL
.	NULL

Somehow	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
missed	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
today	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Veil	NULL
hung	NULL
thick	NULL
,	NULL
sombre	NULL
,	NULL
impenetrable	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
slowly	NULL
she	NULL
nestled	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
watched	NULL
the	NULL
far-off	NULL
green	NULL
and	NULL
golden	NULL
radiance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cotton	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Bles	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
impulsively	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
shall	NULL
I	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Golden	NULL
Fleece	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
'm	NULL
,	NULL
please	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
settled	NULL
herself	NULL
almost	NULL
luxuriously	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
Jason	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Argonauts	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
remained	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
still	NULL
sat	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
elbow	NULL
on	NULL
knee	NULL
,	NULL
absently	NULL
flicking	NULL
the	NULL
jogging	NULL
horse	NULL
and	NULL
staring	NULL
ahead	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
horizon	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
doubtfully	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
disappointment	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
hearing	NULL
had	NULL
apparently	NULL
shared	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
joy	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
telling	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
mingled	NULL
a	NULL
vague	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
lowered	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
too	NULL
familiar	NULL
fellowship	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
--	NULL
this	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
straightened	NULL
herself	NULL
instinctively	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
remark	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
restore	NULL
proper	NULL
relations	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
slowly	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
All	NULL
yon	NULL
is	NULL
Jason	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
,	NULL
puzzled	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
pointed	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
sweep	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
long	NULL
arm	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
quivering	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
green-gold	NULL
foliage	NULL
that	NULL
swept	NULL
from	NULL
swamp	NULL
to	NULL
horizon	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
yon	NULL
golden	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
repeated	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
--	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
's	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
suddenly	NULL
understood	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
had	NULL
sunk	NULL
deeply	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
you	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
methodically	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
for	NULL
Jason	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
brave	NULL
adventurer	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL
thief	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

now	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
answered	NULL
sharply	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Bles	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
ashamed	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
you	NULL
talk	NULL
so	NULL
of	NULL
your	NULL
neighbors	NULL
simply	NULL
because	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
white	NULL

"	NULL

But	NULL
Bles	NULL
continued	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
This	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
Black	NULL
Sea	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
pointing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dull	NULL
cabins	NULL
that	NULL
crouched	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
twinkling	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
black	NULL
folk	NULL
darting	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
strangers	NULL
ride	NULL
by	NULL
.	NULL

Despite	NULL
herself	NULL
Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
caught	NULL
the	NULL
allegory	NULL
and	NULL
half	NULL
whispered	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Lo	NULL

King	NULL

as	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
man	NULL

from	NULL

was	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sweeping	NULL
bow	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
strode	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
stopped	NULL
him	NULL

for	NULL

looked	NULL
interesting	NULL

and	NULL
might	NULL
answer	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
back	NULL

stood	NULL
regarding	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
sorrowful	NULL
eyes	NULL

ugly	NULL
mouth	NULL

Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
tried	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
comforting	NULL

say	NULL

seemed	NULL
inadequate	NULL

cheer	NULL
the	NULL

after	NULL
a	NULL

they	NULL
rode	NULL
on	NULL

leaving	NULL
the	NULL

now	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL

Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
puzzled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
became	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
battery	NULL
of	NULL
eyes	NULL

Everybody	NULL
seemed	NULL
craning	NULL

listening	NULL

she	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
embarrassment	NULL

a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
half-veiled	NULL
hostility	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL

she	NULL
escaped	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL

The	NULL

seemed	NULL
loafing	NULL

lolling	NULL

quadrangle	NULL
stretched	NULL

deadness	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
temple	NULL

the	NULL

And	NULL
they	NULL
wheeled	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
square	NULL

Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
was	NULL
tired	NULL

the	NULL
hastily	NULL
scribbled	NULL
letter	NULL

dropped	NULL

the	NULL
post	NULL

A	NULL
great-voiced	NULL
giant	NULL
,	NULL
brown	NULL

bearded	NULL

drove	NULL
past	NULL
them	NULL

roaring	NULL
a	NULL
hymn	NULL

He	NULL
greeted	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
comprehensive	NULL
wave	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
Bles	NULL

but	NULL
Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
disgusted	NULL
to	NULL
answer	NULL
.	NULL

Further	NULL
on	NULL
they	NULL
overtook	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
young	NULL
yellow	NULL
boy	NULL
walking	NULL
awkwardly	NULL
beside	NULL
a	NULL
handsome	NULL
,	NULL
bold-faced	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
white	NULL
men	NULL
came	NULL
riding	NULL
by	NULL

One	NULL
leered	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
laughed	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
yellow	NULL
boy	NULL
strode	NULL
sullenly	NULL
ahead	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
white	NULL
riders	NULL
approached	NULL
the	NULL
buggy	NULL
one	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL

they	NULL
'll	NULL

something	NULL

and	NULL
they	NULL
rode	NULL
slowly	NULL
by	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
felt	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
heard	NULL
their	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
fell	NULL
fast	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
shadows	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
swept	NULL
soft	NULL
coolness	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
red	NULL
road	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
afar	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
a	NULL
curled	NULL
cloud	NULL
of	NULL
white	NULL
dust	NULL
arose	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
galloping	NULL
horses	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

's	NULL

asked	NULL
Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL

"	NULL

But	NULL
already	NULL

with	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
desire	NULL

meet	NULL
them	NULL

just	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
glanced	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
sifting	NULL
blood-red	NULL
lances	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL

A	NULL
little	NULL
wagon-road	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
wood	NULL

disappeared	NULL

Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL

said	NULL
suddenly	NULL

On	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
galloping	NULL
horses	NULL

Bles	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
surprise	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
silently	NULL
turned	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
horses	NULL
flew	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
hoof-beats	NULL
dying	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
dark	NULL
green	NULL
silence	NULL
lay	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
lit	NULL
by	NULL
mighty	NULL
crimson	NULL
glories	NULL
beyond	NULL

Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
leaned	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
watched	NULL
it	NULL
dreamily	NULL
till	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
oppression	NULL
grew	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL

was	NULL
sinking	NULL
fast	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL

immediately	NULL

I	NULL
thought	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
Bles	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
turning	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
approaching	NULL
the	NULL

again	NULL
when	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
fluttering	NULL
as	NULL

a	NULL

beating	NULL
its	NULL

amid	NULL

Then	NULL
a	NULL

Her	NULL

cabin	NULL

Elspeth	NULL
her	NULL
port	NULL

a	NULL
child	NULL

the	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
searched	NULL

him	NULL

the	NULL

she	NULL
gripped	NULL
him	NULL

her	NULL

Yet	NULL
this	NULL

a	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL

At	NULL

she	NULL

mirthful	NULL

almost	NULL

when	NULL

after	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
crept	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL

again	NULL

half	NULL
fascinated	NULL

Possessed	NULL

the	NULL

she	NULL

chant	NULL

when	NULL
he	NULL

the	NULL
boy	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL

trying	NULL

express	NULL
scornful	NULL
disbelief	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
truth	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
awed	NULL
and	NULL
doubtful	NULL

Always	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
glance	NULL
involuntarily	NULL
back	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
path	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
her	NULL
low	NULL
birdlike	NULL
laughter	NULL
would	NULL
rise	NULL
and	NULL
ring	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
passed	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
her	NULL
wayward	NULL
teasing	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
almost	NULL
painful	NULL
thrill	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
tale-telling	NULL
nettled	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
drove	NULL
him	NULL
away	NULL

For	NULL
long	NULL
months	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
meet	NULL
her	NULL

until	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
deep	NULL
eyes	NULL
fixed	NULL
longingly	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
thicket	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
and	NULL
greeted	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
no	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
nested	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
greenwood	NULL
with	NULL
passionate	NULL
,	NULL
proud	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sued	NULL
long	NULL
for	NULL
peace	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
in	NULL
sudden	NULL
new	NULL
friendship	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
led	NULL
him	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL

showing	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
swamp-world	NULL

great	NULL
shadowy	NULL
oaks	NULL

sweet	NULL
flowers	NULL

the	NULL
whispering	NULL

flitting	NULL
of	NULL
wild	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
winging	NULL
of	NULL
furtive	NULL
birds	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
dropped	NULL
the	NULL
impish	NULL
mischief	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL

and	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
beneath	NULL
it	NULL
rose	NULL
a	NULL
wistful	NULL

a	NULL
mighty	NULL
half-confessed	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL

And	NULL
today	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
home	NULL

supped	NULL

he	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
twilight	NULL
under	NULL

whistled	NULL
the	NULL

considered	NULL

did	NULL

warned	NULL

had	NULL
come	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
acquiescence	NULL

took	NULL
a	NULL
primer	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL

,	NULL
lighting	NULL
a	NULL
match	NULL

showed	NULL

the	NULL
alphabet	NULL

said	NULL

out	NULL

she	NULL
disputed	NULL
,	NULL
disappearing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wood	NULL

returning	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pine-knot	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
lighted	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
smoky	NULL
flame	NULL
threw	NULL
wavering	NULL
shadows	NULL
about	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
the	NULL
leaves	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
picture	NULL

she	NULL
studied	NULL
intently	NULL

it	NULL

commanded	NULL

read	NULL

Again	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

making	NULL
him	NULL
point	NULL
out	NULL
each	NULL
word	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
after	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
accurately	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
perfect	NULL
expression	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
book	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
nod	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Saturday	NULL
and	NULL
dark	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
never	NULL
asked	NULL
Bles	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
home	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
mysterious	NULL
black	NULL
cabin	NULL
in	NULL
mid-swamp	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
her	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL

and	NULL
delicately	NULL
refrained	NULL
from	NULL
going	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
tonight	NULL
she	NULL
slipped	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
stopped	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
his	NULL
footsteps	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
pike	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
flew	NULL
homeward	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
black	NULL
cabin	NULL
loomed	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
wide	NULL
flapping	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
woman	NULL
was	NULL
bending	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
stirring	NULL
some	NULL
savory	NULL
mess	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
yellow	NULL
girl	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
baby	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
arm	NULL
was	NULL
placing	NULL
dishes	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
rickety	NULL
wooden	NULL
table	NULL
when	NULL
Zora	NULL
suddenly	NULL
and	NULL
noiselessly	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL

is	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL

grumbled	NULL
the	NULL
hag	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Zora	NULL
deigned	NULL
no	NULL
answer	NULL

She	NULL
walked	NULL
placidly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
handful	NULL
of	NULL
cold	NULL
corn-bread	NULL
and	NULL
meat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
went	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
curled	NULL
up	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
.	NULL

Elspeth	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
talked	NULL
and	NULL
laughed	NULL
coarsely	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
wore	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
loud	NULL
laughter	NULL
and	NULL
tramping	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
numerous	NULL
footsteps	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
listened	NULL
,	NULL
leapt	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
and	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
crone	NULL
threw	NULL
an	NULL
epithet	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL

she	NULL
flashed	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
lighted	NULL
doorway	NULL

gone	NULL

followed	NULL

the	NULL
oath	NULL

the	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
hut	NULL
night	NULL
fled	NULL
with	NULL
wild	NULL
song	NULL

revel	NULL

day	NULL
dawned	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Out	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
fastness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wood	NULL
crept	NULL
Zora	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stopped	NULL
and	NULL
bathed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
pool	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
combed	NULL
her	NULL
close-clung	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
entered	NULL
silently	NULL
to	NULL
breakfast	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
began	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
swamp	NULL
that	NULL
primal	NULL
battle	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Word	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
hated	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
despised	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
pride	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
arms	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
one	NULL
great	NULL
life	NULL
friendship	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
balance	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
fought	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
dogged	NULL
persistence	NULL
that	NULL
brought	NULL
word	NULL
after	NULL
word	NULL
of	NULL
praise	NULL
and	NULL
interest	NULL
from	NULL
Bles	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
once	NULL
well	NULL
begun	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
busy	NULL
,	NULL
eager	NULL
mind	NULL
flew	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
rapidity	NULL
that	NULL
startled	NULL

the	NULL
stories	NULL
especially	NULL
she	NULL
devoured	NULL
--	NULL
tales	NULL
of	NULL
strange	NULL
things	NULL
and	NULL
countries	NULL
and	NULL
men	NULL
gripped	NULL
her	NULL
imagination	NULL
and	NULL
clung	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
memory	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

n't	NULL
I	NULL
tell	NULL

there	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

she	NULL
retorted	NULL

every	NULL

Spring	NULL
ripened	NULL
to	NULL
summer	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
reading	NULL
well	NULL
and	NULL
writing	NULL
some	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
announced	NULL
one	NULL
morning	NULL
under	NULL
their	NULL
forest	NULL
oak	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
school	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
eyed	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
surprised	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
've	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

she	NULL
admitted	NULL

there	NULL

She	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
open-eyed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
wonder	NULL
crept	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
battling	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
assurance	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
bare	NULL
brown	NULL
feet	NULL
and	NULL
torn	NULL
gown	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
money	NULL

Zora	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
lifted	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
earn	NULL
mine	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
doubtfully	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
pick	NULL
cotton	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Can	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Course	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
hard	NULL
work	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
hesitated	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
mused	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

So	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
yellowed	NULL
and	NULL
silvered	NULL
into	NULL
fall	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
vacation	NULL
days	NULL
Bles	NULL
worked	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
farm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Zora	NULL
read	NULL
and	NULL
dreamed	NULL
and	NULL
studied	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wood	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
lay	NULL
white	NULL
with	NULL
harvest	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
warning	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
appeared	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cotton-field	NULL
beside	NULL
Bles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
picked	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
hot	NULL
,	NULL
sore	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
blazed	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
bent	NULL
and	NULL
untrained	NULL
back	NULL
pained	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
soft	NULL
little	NULL
hands	NULL
bled	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
no	NULL
complaint	NULL
passed	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
never	NULL
wavered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
met	NULL
his	NULL
steadily	NULL
and	NULL
gravely	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
bade	NULL
him	NULL
good-night	NULL
,	NULL
cheerily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
stole	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
wood	NULL
,	NULL
crouching	NULL
beneath	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
oak	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
biting	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
groans	NULL
that	NULL
trembled	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

Often	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
fell	NULL
supperless	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
great	NULL
tears	NULL
creeping	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
tired	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
school-time	NULL
came	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
money	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
cotton-picking	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
far	NULL
advanced	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
Zora	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
no	NULL
money	NULL
from	NULL
Bles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
worked	NULL
earnestly	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Meantime	NULL
there	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
the	NULL
momentous	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
clothes	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
Zora	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
feared	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
little	NULL
of	NULL
clothes	NULL
and	NULL
cared	NULL
less	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
town	NULL
he	NULL
dropped	NULL
into	NULL
Caldwell	NULL
's	NULL
"	NULL
Emporium	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
glanced	NULL
hesitantly	NULL
at	NULL
certain	NULL
ready-made	NULL
dresses	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
caught	NULL
his	NULL
eye	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
Easterly	NULL
mills	NULL
in	NULL
New	NULL
England	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
red	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
vivid	NULL
red	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
glowing	NULL
warmth	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
cloth	NULL
of	NULL
cotton	NULL
caught	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
of	NULL
Bles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
bought	NULL
the	NULL
gown	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
dollar	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
carried	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Zora	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wood	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
unrolled	NULL
it	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
that	NULL
danced	NULL
with	NULL
glad	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
wide	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
fetched	NULL
needle	NULL
and	NULL
thread	NULL
and	NULL
scissors	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
full	NULL
month	NULL
after	NULL
school	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
,	NULL
together	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
shadowed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
foliage	NULL
,	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
fashion	NULL
the	NULL
wonderful	NULL
garment	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
laid	NULL
ten	NULL
dollars	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
hard-earned	NULL
money	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

Bles	NULL
assured	NULL
her	NULL

delighted	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
next	NULL

you	NULL
must	NULL

brought	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
curled	NULL
down	NULL
so	NULL
earnestly	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
puzzling	NULL
task	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
pity	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL

swept	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL

He	NULL
bent	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL

nervously	NULL

eagerly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
laid	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL

sat	NULL

passive	NULL

burning	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
quietly	NULL

with	NULL
something	NULL

her	NULL

that	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL

startled	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL

flushing	NULL
in	NULL

stretched	NULL
his	NULL

out	NULL

taking	NULL
hers	NULL

it	NULL
lightly	NULL

she	NULL
quivered	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL

Up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

Miss	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

rather	NULL

something	NULL

sat	NULL
dreaming	NULL

of	NULL
his	NULL
watching	NULL
was	NULL
frankly	NULL

to	NULL
himself	NULL

Notwithstanding	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
died	NULL

leaving	NULL
the	NULL

but	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
spiritual	NULL
heir	NULL
,	NULL
John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Taylor	NULL
had	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
modest	NULL
salary	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
financial	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
knowledge	NULL

business	NULL
daring	NULL
--	NULL
effrontery	NULL
even	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
determination	NULL
was	NULL
fixed	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
millionaire	NULL
at	NULL
no	NULL
distant	NULL
date	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
cautious	NULL
fliers	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
market	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
enough	NULL
surplus	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
Mary	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
school	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
country	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
New	NULL
Hampshire	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
afterward	NULL
through	NULL
Wellesley	NULL
College	NULL
;	NULL
although	NULL
just	NULL
why	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
should	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
through	NULL
college	NULL
was	NULL
inexplicable	NULL
to	NULL
John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
uncertain	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
wisdom	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
charity	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
offer	NULL
to	NULL
teach	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
South	NULL
,	NULL
John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
hurried	NULL
her	NULL
off	NULL
for	NULL
two	NULL
reasons	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
profoundly	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cotton-belt	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
of	NULL
service	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
secondly	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
intended	NULL
to	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
an	NULL
investment	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
consider	NULL
Mary	NULL
a	NULL
success	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
letters	NULL
intimated	NULL
very	NULL
strongly	NULL
her	NULL
intention	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
's	NULL
School	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
also	NULL
brought	NULL
information	NULL
--	NULL
disjointed	NULL
and	NULL
incomplete	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
mightily	NULL
interested	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Taylor	NULL
and	NULL
sent	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
atlases	NULL
,	NULL
encyclopædias	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
census-reports	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
little	NULL
lunch	NULL
with	NULL
old	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
cotton-belt	NULL
just	NULL
yet	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
lunch	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rich	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
crisis	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
fortunes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
elderly	NULL
lady	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
uncertain	NULL
years	NULL
beyond	NULL
fifty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
left	NULL
suddenly	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
millions	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
easily	NULL
count	NULL
.	NULL

Personally	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
her	NULL
money	NULL
in	NULL
bettering	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
right	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
ways	NULL
as	NULL
might	NULL
from	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
time	NULL
seem	NULL
attractive	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
course	NULL

husband	NULL
's	NULL

partner	NULL
and	NULL
present	NULL
executor	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Edward	NULL
Easterly	NULL

not	NULL
only	NULL
foolish	NULL
but	NULL
wicked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
incidentally	NULL
,	NULL
distinctly	NULL
unprofitable	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
expressed	NULL
himself	NULL
strongly	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
last	NULL
night	NULL
at	NULL
dinner	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
reinforced	NULL
his	NULL
argument	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
pointed	NULL
letter	NULL
written	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
's	NULL
disposal	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
income	NULL
was	NULL
unbelievable	NULL
blasphemy	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
memory	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL

he	NULL
became	NULL
watchful	NULL

He	NULL
ate	NULL
his	NULL
soup	NULL
in	NULL

said	NULL
Taylor	NULL

finally	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
was	NULL
delighted	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
combination	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
she	NULL
needed	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
college-girl	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
direct	NULL
her	NULL
philanthropies	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
etiquette	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
.	NULL

Forthwith	NULL
Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
received	NULL
an	NULL
intimation	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL
that	NULL
vast	NULL
interests	NULL
depended	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
summer	NULL
vacation	NULL

Thus	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL

came	NULL
to	NULL
Lake	NULL
George	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
vacation	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
year	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Smith	NULL
School	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
had	NULL
silently	NULL
agreed	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
left	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
gods	NULL

thought	NULL
otherwise	NULL

that	NULL

she	NULL

she	NULL

Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
ultra-fashionable	NULL

but	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
wealth	NULL
and	NULL
leisure	NULL
and	NULL
some	NULL
breeding	NULL
.	NULL

Especially	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
true	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
circumscribed	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
exclusive	NULL
,	NULL
set	NULL
which	NULL
centred	NULL
around	NULL
the	NULL
Vanderpools	NULL
of	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
and	NULL
Boston	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
Mr.	NULL

were	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Wells	NULL

endured	NULL
Lake	NULL
George	NULL
now	NULL

then	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL

sake	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
she	NULL
regarded	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
as	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
joke	NULL

This	NULL
summer	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
unusually	NULL
lonesome	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
meditating	NULL
a	NULL
retreat	NULL

she	NULL
chanced	NULL

meet	NULL
Mary	NULL

at	NULL
a	NULL
miscellaneous	NULL
dinner	NULL

found	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
discovered	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
talk	NULL
books	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
no	NULL

enough	NULL

one	NULL

were	NULL
lounging	NULL

the	NULL

She	NULL
stretched	NULL
her	NULL
silken	NULL
limbs	NULL
,	NULL
lazily	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
sat	NULL
silently	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
waters	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
then	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
drove	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
new	NULL
red	NULL
motor	NULL
.	NULL

Up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
's	NULL
arrival	NULL
the	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Vanderpools	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
chiefly	NULL
of	NULL
smiling	NULL
bows	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
came	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
calls	NULL
and	NULL
casual	NULL
intercourse	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
's	NULL
great	NULL
gratification	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
's	NULL
mingled	NULL
amusement	NULL
and	NULL
annoyance	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
announced	NULL
the	NULL
arrival	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Easterlys	NULL
and	NULL
John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
week-end	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
nothing	NULL
less	NULL
boring	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
consented	NULL
to	NULL
dine	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
's	NULL
ornate	NULL
cottage	NULL
was	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Vanderpools	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
display	NULL
of	NULL
wealth	NULL
and	NULL
splendor	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
barbaric	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
liked	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
more	NULL
subtly	NULL
satisfying	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
grim	NULL
power	NULL
beneath	NULL
the	NULL
Greys	NULL
'	NULL
mahogany	NULL
and	NULL
velvets	NULL
that	NULL
thrilled	NULL
while	NULL
it	NULL
appalled	NULL
.	NULL

Precisely	NULL
that	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
little	NULL
or	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
plain	NULL
elegance	NULL
yonder	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
here	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
Japanese	NULL
vase	NULL
that	NULL
cost	NULL
no	NULL
cent	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
thousand	NULL
dollars	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
duplicate	NULL
it	NULL
some	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Grey	NULL
was	NULL
poor	NULL
and	NULL
less	NULL
knowing	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
sixty	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dead	NULL
millionaire	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
his	NULL
fortune	NULL
by	NULL
buying	NULL
and	NULL
selling	NULL
cotton	NULL
--	NULL
travelling	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
South	NULL
in	NULL
reconstruction	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sending	NULL
his	NULL
agents	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
thousands	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
forward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
following	NULL
the	NULL
prices	NULL
induced	NULL
the	NULL
prices	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
small	NULL
cotton	NULL
corners	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
his	NULL
tens	NULL
of	NULL
thousands	NULL
.	NULL

About	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
Easterly	NULL
joined	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
road	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
buying	NULL
and	NULL
selling	NULL
of	NULL
stock	NULL
in	NULL
various	NULL
cotton-mills	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
industrial	NULL
enterprises	NULL
.	NULL

Grey	NULL
hesitated	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Easterly	NULL
pushed	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
hundreds	NULL
of	NULL
thousands	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Easterly	NULL
proposed	NULL
buying	NULL
controlling	NULL
interests	NULL
in	NULL
certain	NULL
large	NULL
mills	NULL
and	NULL
gradually	NULL
consolidating	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
plan	NULL
grew	NULL
and	NULL
succeeded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Grey	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
millions	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Grey	NULL
stopped	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
money	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
venture	NULL
no	NULL
farther	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
"	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
retire	NULL
and	NULL
eat	NULL
peanuts	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
chuckle	NULL
.	NULL

Easterly	NULL
was	NULL
disgusted	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
millions	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
many	NULL
as	NULL
Grey	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
simply	NULL
money	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
power	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lust	NULL
of	NULL
financial	NULL
dominion	NULL
had	NULL
gripped	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
vision	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
vast	NULL
trust	NULL
of	NULL
cotton	NULL
manufacturing	NULL
covering	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
this	NULL
incessantly	NULL
into	NULL
Grey	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Grey	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
shake	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
big	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
bent	NULL
on	NULL
retiring	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
set	NULL
the	NULL
date	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
hence	NULL
he	NULL
inadvertently	NULL
died	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Easterly	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
partner	NULL
's	NULL
definite	NULL
withdrawal	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
his	NULL
capital	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
his	NULL
vast	NULL
plans	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
circumvented	NULL
by	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
withdrawing	NULL
this	NULL
capital	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
control	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
To	NULL
give	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
niggers	NULL
and	NULL
Chinamen	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
snorted	NULL
to	NULL
John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
strode	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
veranda	NULL
.	NULL

John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
removed	NULL
his	NULL
coat	NULL
,	NULL
lighted	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
cigar	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
elevated	NULL
his	NULL
heels	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
ladies	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
parlor	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
female	NULL
Easterlys	NULL
were	NULL
prostrating	NULL
themselves	NULL
before	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Just	NULL
what	NULL
is	NULL
your	NULL
plan	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
asked	NULL
Taylor	NULL
,	NULL
quite	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL

Why	NULL

"	NULL
asked	NULL
Taylor	NULL
,	NULL
imperturbably	NULL
puffing	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Easterly	NULL
eyed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
regarded	NULL
Taylor	NULL
hitherto	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
valuable	NULL
asset	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
business	NULL

judgment	NULL

honesty	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
detected	NULL
tonight	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
tone	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
clerk	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
almost	NULL
authoritative	NULL
and	NULL
self-reliant	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
paused	NULL
and	NULL
smiled	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Bigger	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
in	NULL
earnest	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL

rose	NULL
up	NULL

a	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL

down	NULL

heard	NULL
the	NULL

down	NULL

upon	NULL
Zora	NULL

Zora	NULL
sat	NULL
thinking	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
neither	NULL

the	NULL
long	NULL

She	NULL
heard	NULL
neither	NULL

did	NULL
she	NULL
hear	NULL
Miss	NULL

Zora	NULL

She	NULL
heard	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
none	NULL

She	NULL
only	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
prattle	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
wood	NULL

far	NULL
down	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL

cotton-planting	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL

the	NULL
gray	NULL

drizzle	NULL
of	NULL
December	NULL

past	NULL

the	NULL

of	NULL
January	NULL

Already	NULL
a	NULL

stolen	NULL

the	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
Swamp	NULL
was	NULL
calling	NULL
its	NULL
child	NULL
with	NULL
low	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL

bursting	NULL

where	NULL
tiny	NULL
flowers	NULL
nestled	NULL

A	NULL
wistful	NULL

was	NULL
stealing	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL

This	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
call	NULL

but	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
heed	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
tiresome	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
forever	NULL
doing	NULL
and	NULL
saying	NULL
silly	NULL
things	NULL

So	NULL
Zora	NULL
paid	NULL
no	NULL
attention	NULL

sat	NULL
still	NULL

thought	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
show	NULL
Bles	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL
night	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
kept	NULL
it	NULL

him	NULL

out	NULL

tonight	NULL

after	NULL
school	NULL

he	NULL
met	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

road	NULL

clothes	NULL

she	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
him	NULL

show	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL

Soon	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
school	NULL

been	NULL
dismissed	NULL

she	NULL
leisurely	NULL
gathered	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
books	NULL

rose	NULL

Mary	NULL

regarded	NULL

perplexed	NULL
despair	NULL

If	NULL

it	NULL

what	NULL

doing	NULL

twice	NULL

Her	NULL
classification	NULL

nearly	NULL

her	NULL
classification	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
reached	NULL
up	NULL
impatiently	NULL

removed	NULL
the	NULL
gold	NULL
pin	NULL

She	NULL
laid	NULL
the	NULL

on	NULL
sudden	NULL

looking	NULL

telling	NULL

the	NULL

flew	NULL
fast	NULL

faster	NULL

he	NULL
followed	NULL

laughing	NULL

calling	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
twinkling	NULL

saw	NULL
them	NULL

all	NULL
about	NULL

fell	NULL

his	NULL

whirled	NULL

He	NULL
paused	NULL
uncertainly	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL

crying	NULL
:	NULL

fell	NULL

there	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
slow-growing	NULL
silence	NULL

,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
flutter	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL

laughing	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL

with	NULL
mocking	NULL
voice	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL

could	NULL
only	NULL
clasp	NULL
her	NULL

again	NULL
down	NULL

raced	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
wood	NULL

All	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
changed	NULL

chilled	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
dull	NULL
grayness	NULL

started	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL

waters	NULL

and	NULL
long	NULL
pendent	NULL
streamings	NULL

moss-like	NULL
tears	NULL
dripped	NULL
from	NULL

Slowly	NULL

warily	NULL
they	NULL
threaded	NULL
their	NULL
way	NULL

inquired	NULL
anxiously	NULL

she	NULL
answered	NULL

skipping	NULL
sure-footed	NULL
onward	NULL

He	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
tightly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
pace	NULL
never	NULL
slackened	NULL
.	NULL

Around	NULL
them	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
and	NULL

They	NULL
felt	NULL

saw	NULL
the	NULL

slowly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

waters	NULL
growing	NULL

At	NULL

they	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL

dismally	NULL
the	NULL

with	NULL
its	NULL

met	NULL

Mary	NULL

Bles	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
walking	NULL
toward	NULL
him	NULL
rapidly	NULL
with	NULL
axe	NULL
and	NULL
hoe	NULL
on	NULL
shoulder	NULL
,	NULL
whistling	NULL
merrily	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
saw	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
almost	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
moment	NULL
and	NULL
whistle	NULL
and	NULL
smile	NULL
faded	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
Negro	NULL
by	NULL
sight	NULL
and	NULL
disliked	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
belonged	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
younger	NULL
class	NULL
of	NULL
half-educated	NULL
blacks	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
impudent	NULL
and	NULL
disrespectful	NULL
toward	NULL
their	NULL
superiors	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
touching	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

Moreover	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
this	NULL
boy	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
talking	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
familiarly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cotton-field	NULL
last	NULL
Spring	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
offence	NULL
doubly	NULL
heinous	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
first	NULL
impulse	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
halt	NULL
the	NULL
Negro	NULL
then	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
and	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
plain	NULL
truths	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
quarrelsome	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
nothing	NULL
very	NULL
tangible	NULL
to	NULL
justify	NULL
a	NULL
berating	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fellow	NULL
's	NULL
impudence	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
to	NULL
increase	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
!	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
merely	NULL
reined	NULL
his	NULL
horse	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
better	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
foot-path	NULL
and	NULL
rode	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Bles	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
well-dressed	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
milk-white	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
overbearing	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
expect	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
greeted	NULL
with	NULL
raised	NULL
hat	NULL
but	NULL
Bles	NULL
bit	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
and	NULL
pulled	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
cap	NULL
firmly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
axe	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
indistinct	NULL
way	NULL
felt	NULL
good	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
horse	NULL
coming	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pathway	NULL
and	NULL
stepping	NULL
aside	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dust	NULL
continued	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
neither	NULL
looking	NULL
nor	NULL
speaking	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
they	NULL
passed	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
Bles	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
apparently	NULL
ignorant	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
's	NULL
very	NULL
existence	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
space	NULL
widened	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
vindictive	NULL
anger	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
dares	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
puppy	NULL
to	NULL
ignore	NULL
a	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
highway	NULL
?	NULL

If	NULL
this	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
would	NULL
surely	NULL
come	NULL
when	NULL
Negroes	NULL
felt	NULL
no	NULL
respect	NULL
or	NULL
fear	NULL
whatever	NULL
for	NULL
whites	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
--	NULL
my	NULL
God	NULL
!	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
struck	NULL
his	NULL
mare	NULL
a	NULL
vicious	NULL
blow	NULL
and	NULL
dashed	NULL
toward	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
black	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
in	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
burning	NULL
rage	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
should	NULL
he	NULL
be	NULL
elbowed	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
roadside	NULL
dust	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
insolent	NULL
bully	NULL
?	NULL

Why	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
stood	NULL
his	NULL
ground	NULL
?	NULL

Pshaw	NULL
!	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
fine	NULL
frenzy	NULL
was	NULL
useless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sweat	NULL
oozed	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
forehead	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
man	NULL
against	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
dragged	NULL
the	NULL
pale	NULL
puppy	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
horse	NULL
and	NULL
rubbed	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
n't	NULL
even	NULL
one	NULL
against	NULL
many	NULL
,	NULL
else	NULL
how	NULL
willingly	NULL
,	NULL
swinging	NULL
his	NULL
axe	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
stood	NULL
his	NULL
ground	NULL
before	NULL
a	NULL
mob	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
against	NULL
a	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
world	NULL
of	NULL
power	NULL
,	NULL
opinion	NULL
,	NULL
wealth	NULL
,	NULL
opportunity	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
must	NULL
cringe	NULL
and	NULL
bear	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
lest	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
crash	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
ears	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
slowly	NULL
plodded	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
bitter	NULL
silence	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
was	NULL
balmy	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
was	NULL
beautiful	NULL
;	NULL
contempt	NULL
slowly	NULL
succeeded	NULL
anger	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hope	NULL
soon	NULL
triumphed	NULL
over	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
yonder	NULL
was	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
poised	NULL
,	NULL
waiting	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
Field	NULL
of	NULL
Dreams	NULL
.	NULL

_	NULL
Nine	NULL
_	NULL
THE	NULL
PLANTING	NULL
Zora	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
Bles	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
knees	NULL
in	NULL
mud	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
toil	NULL
was	NULL
beyond	NULL
exhilaration	NULL
--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
sickening	NULL
weariness	NULL
and	NULL
panting	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
great	NULL
roots	NULL
,	NULL
twined	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
unbroken	NULL
snarl	NULL
,	NULL
clung	NULL
frantically	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
soil	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
vines	NULL
and	NULL
bushes	NULL
fought	NULL
back	NULL
with	NULL
thorn	NULL
and	NULL
bramble	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
stood	NULL
wiping	NULL
the	NULL
blood	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
Bles	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
gnarled	NULL
fingers	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tough	NULL
little	NULL
trees	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
fingers	NULL
of	NULL
Elspeth	NULL
down	NULL
there	NULL
beneath	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
pulling	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL

Slowly	NULL
Zora	NULL
forgot	NULL
her	NULL
blood	NULL
and	NULL
pain	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
would	NULL
win	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
witch	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
Jason	NULL
?	NULL

Bles	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
bleeding	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
bound	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Zora	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
cry	NULL
seemed	NULL
wrung	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
by	NULL
contrition	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
known	NULL

not	NULL
seen	NULL
before	NULL

"	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
come	NULL
right	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
!	NULL

down	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
rest	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
unwaveringly	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
flinching	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
spirit	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
So	NULL

was	NULL
her	NULL
reply	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
himself	NULL
over	NULL
ruefully	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dropping	NULL
his	NULL
axe	NULL
,	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
log	NULL
.	NULL

Silently	NULL
they	NULL
contemplated	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
indeed	NULL
a	NULL
hopeless	NULL
task	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
in	NULL
sudden	NULL
,	NULL
unspoken	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
failure	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL

only	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
sighed	NULL
.	NULL

Immediately	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
lighted	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
parted	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
presently	NULL
bounded	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Never	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL

"	NULL
Zora	NULL
announced	NULL
positively	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
promise	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
sake	NULL
to	NULL
rest	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
path	NULL
together	NULL
and	NULL
parted	NULL
diffidently	NULL

he	NULL
watching	NULL
her	NULL
flit	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
sorrowful	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
disturbed	NULL

puzzled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
burden	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
voluntarily	NULL
assumed	NULL

but	NULL
never	NULL
dreaming	NULL
of	NULL
drawing	NULL
back	NULL

Zora	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
far	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
sooner	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
know	NULL
herself	NULL
well	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
sight	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
dropped	NULL
lightly	NULL
down	NULL
beside	NULL
the	NULL
path	NULL
,	NULL
listening	NULL
intently	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
echo	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
footsteps	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
cabin	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
toil	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
cut	NULL
straight	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
skirted	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
road	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
half-hour	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
meadows	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
plantations	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
tired	NULL
stock	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
graze	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wood	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
lingered	NULL
.	NULL

Slowly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
infinite	NULL
patience	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
broke	NULL
one	NULL
strand	NULL
after	NULL
another	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
barbed-wire	NULL
fencing	NULL
,	NULL
watching	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
grow	NULL
great	NULL
and	NULL
crimson	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
die	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
in	NULL
mighty	NULL
splendor	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
dimmer	NULL
westward	NULL
forests	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
voices	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
hostlers	NULL
grew	NULL
fainter	NULL
and	NULL
thinner	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
of	NULL
purple	NULL
twilight	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
disappeared	NULL
.	NULL

Silence	NULL
fell	NULL
,	NULL
deep	NULL
and	NULL
soft	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
sinking	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
until	NULL
then	NULL
did	NULL
Zora	NULL
steal	NULL
forth	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
hiding-place	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
chosen	NULL
her	NULL
mule	NULL
long	NULL
before	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
big	NULL
,	NULL
black	NULL
beast	NULL
,	NULL
snorting	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
pile	NULL
of	NULL
corn	NULL
,	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
gliding	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
gathered	NULL
his	NULL
supper	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
skirt	NULL
,	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
stout	NULL
halter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fed	NULL
him	NULL
sparingly	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
followed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Quickly	NULL
she	NULL
unfastened	NULL
the	NULL
pieces	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fence	NULL
,	NULL
led	NULL
the	NULL
animal	NULL
through	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
spliced	NULL
them	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
fox-like	NULL
caution	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
guided	NULL
her	NULL
prize	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
labyrinthine	NULL
windings	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
haunting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ever	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
rose	NULL
lonely	NULL
night	NULL
cries	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
trembled	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
plodded	NULL
resolutely	NULL
on	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
dim	NULL
silver	NULL
disk	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
half-moon	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
glimmer	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
pressed	NULL
on	NULL
more	NULL
swiftly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fed	NULL
more	NULL
scantily	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
finally	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
moonlight	NULL
pouring	NULL
over	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
lagoon	NULL
,	NULL
Zora	NULL
attempted	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
the	NULL
animal	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
still	NULL
waters	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
loud	NULL
protesting	NULL
snort	NULL
and	NULL
balked	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
subtle	NULL
temptings	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
that	NULL
plenty	NULL
lay	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
waters	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
quickly	NULL
swinging	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
she	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
ride	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lagoon	NULL
,	NULL
petting	NULL
and	NULL
whispering	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
things	NULL
beyond	NULL
.	NULL

Slowly	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
grew	NULL
wide	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
riding	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
dreamland	NULL
on	NULL
some	NULL
hobgoblin	NULL
beast	NULL
.	NULL

Deeper	NULL
and	NULL
deeper	NULL
they	NULL
penetrated	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
waters	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
they	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
slime	NULL
;	NULL
now	NULL
they	NULL
stumbled	NULL
on	NULL
hidden	NULL
roots	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
deeper	NULL
and	NULL
deeper	NULL
they	NULL
waded	NULL
until	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
the	NULL
animal	NULL
's	NULL
head	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
jerk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
giving	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
sharp	NULL
stroke	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
whip	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
headed	NULL
straight	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
island	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
beast	NULL
snorted	NULL
and	NULL
plunged	NULL
;	NULL
higher	NULL
and	NULL
higher	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL

the	NULL

They	NULL

up	NULL
her	NULL

swirled	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
breasts	NULL
and	NULL
gleamed	NULL
green	NULL
and	NULL
slimy	NULL
along	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
wild	NULL
terror	NULL
gripped	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Maybe	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
riding	NULL
the	NULL
devil	NULL

and	NULL
these	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
yawning	NULL
gates	NULL
of	NULL
hell	NULL

black	NULL
and	NULL
sombre	NULL
beneath	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL

black	NULL
and	NULL
claw-like	NULL
fingers	NULL
of	NULL
Elspeth	NULL
gripping	NULL
and	NULL
dragging	NULL
her	NULL
down	NULL

A	NULL
scream	NULL
struggled	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL

,	NULL
her	NULL
fingers	NULL
relaxed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
beast	NULL
,	NULL
stretching	NULL
his	NULL

neck	NULL
,	NULL
rose	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
mighty	NULL
plunge	NULL
and	NULL
planted	NULL
his	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL

hurrying	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
with	NULL
new	NULL

and	NULL
new	NULL
determination	NULL
,	NULL
stopped	NULL
and	NULL
stared	NULL
in	NULL
blank	NULL
amazement	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
was	NULL
perched	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
tree	NULL
singing	NULL
softly	NULL
and	NULL
beneath	NULL
a	NULL
fat	NULL
black	NULL
mule	NULL
was	NULL
finishing	NULL
his	NULL
breakfast	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Zora	NULL

he	NULL
gasped	NULL

"	NULL
how	NULL

how	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL

it	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
only	NULL
smiled	NULL
and	NULL
sang	NULL
a	NULL
happier	NULL
measure	NULL

pausing	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
whisper	NULL
:	NULL

"	NULL

Bles	NULL
frowned	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
irresolute	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
song	NULL
proceeded	NULL
with	NULL
less	NULL
assurance	NULL
,	NULL
slower	NULL
and	NULL
lower	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
stopped	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
singer	NULL
dropped	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
,	NULL
watching	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
wide	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
slight	NULL
,	NULL
tired	NULL
,	NULL
scratched	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
undaunted	NULL
,	NULL
striving	NULL
blindly	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
with	NULL
stanch	NULL
,	NULL
unfaltering	NULL
faith	NULL

A	NULL
pity	NULL
surged	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
and	NULL
murmured	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
poor	NULL
,	NULL
brave	NULL
child	NULL

"	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
shivered	NULL
with	NULL
joy	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
day	NULL
Saturday	NULL
and	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
Sunday	NULL
they	NULL
worked	NULL
feverishly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
trees	NULL
crashed	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
stumps	NULL
groaned	NULL
and	NULL
crept	NULL
up	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
brambles	NULL
blazed	NULL
and	NULL
smoked	NULL
;	NULL
little	NULL
frightened	NULL

fled	NULL
for	NULL
shelter	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
wide	NULL
black	NULL
patch	NULL
of	NULL
rich	NULL
loam	NULL
broadened	NULL
and	NULL
broadened	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
kissed	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
every	NULL
side	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
sheltered	NULL
east	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
waters	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

Late	NULL
Sunday	NULL
night	NULL
the	NULL
mule	NULL
again	NULL
swam	NULL
the	NULL
slimy	NULL
lagoon	NULL

and	NULL
disappeared	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
Cresswell	NULL

Then	NULL
Bles	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
beside	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
facing	NULL
the	NULL
fields	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gravely	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
quick	NULL

breathless	NULL
fear	NULL

"	NULL
Zora	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
silently	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL

held	NULL

That	NULL

for	NULL

Bles	NULL
entered	NULL
Zora	NULL

On	NULL

cheerily	NULL

The	NULL

Zora	NULL
watched	NULL

came	NULL
slowly	NULL
back	NULL

sat	NULL
by	NULL

Out	NULL

voices	NULL

the	NULL

Bles	NULL
hesitated	NULL

before	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL

Zora	NULL
was	NULL
saying	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL

Bles	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
awkwardly	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
staring	NULL
wide-eyed	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
picture	NULL

and	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
was	NULL
earnest	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
so	NULL
old	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL

that	NULL

She	NULL
wheeled	NULL
quickly	NULL
toward	NULL
him	NULL

asked	NULL
him	NULL
eagerly	NULL

She	NULL
trembled	NULL
happily	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
little	NULL
breaking	NULL
voice	NULL
and	NULL
gesture	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
sob	NULL
struggled	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
throat	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

course	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
whispered	NULL
tenderly	NULL

hiding	NULL
her	NULL

hands	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL

she	NULL
whispered	NULL
,	NULL
lifting	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
streaming	NULL
with	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

Silently	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
on	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
revealing	NULL
word	NULL
was	NULL
spoken	NULL
;	NULL
no	NULL
vows	NULL
were	NULL
given	NULL
,	NULL
none	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
bond	NULL
held	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
grew	NULL
older	NULL
,	NULL
quieter	NULL
,	NULL
taller	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
humbler	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
tender	NULL
and	NULL
reverent	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
toiled	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
passed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
burned	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
heavens	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
silvered	NULL
glory	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL
grew	NULL
fainter	NULL
and	NULL
fainter	NULL
and	NULL
each	NULL
night	NULL
it	NULL
rose	NULL
later	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
Zora	NULL
whispered	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Tonight	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

Bles	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
cabin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
and	NULL
Zora	NULL
and	NULL
Elspeth	NULL
sat	NULL
silently	NULL
around	NULL
the	NULL
fire-place	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
meagre	NULL
embers	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
night	NULL
was	NULL
balmy	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
;	NULL
only	NULL
occasionally	NULL
a	NULL
wandering	NULL
breeze	NULL
searching	NULL
the	NULL
hidden	NULL
places	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
call	NULL
and	NULL
song	NULL
of	NULL
night	NULL
birds	NULL
,	NULL
jarred	NULL
the	NULL
stillness	NULL
.	NULL

Long	NULL
they	NULL
sat	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
crept	NULL
into	NULL
Bles	NULL
's	NULL
flesh	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stretching	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
touched	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
clasping	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
woman	NULL
rose	NULL
and	NULL
hobbled	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
big	NULL
black	NULL
chest	NULL
.	NULL

Out	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
she	NULL
brought	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
bag	NULL
of	NULL
cotton	NULL
seed	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
white-green	NULL
seed	NULL
which	NULL
Bles	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
known	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
small	NULL
,	NULL
smooth	NULL
black	NULL
seeds	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
handled	NULL
carefully	NULL
,	NULL
dipping	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
deep	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
letting	NULL
them	NULL
drop	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
gnarled	NULL
fingers	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
so	NULL
again	NULL
they	NULL
sat	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
no	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
stars	NULL
of	NULL
midnight	NULL
had	NULL
swung	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
zenith	NULL
did	NULL
they	NULL
start	NULL
down	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
.	NULL

Bles	NULL
sought	NULL
to	NULL
guide	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
shadowy	NULL
figure	NULL
darting	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
trunks	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
crossed	NULL
the	NULL
tree	NULL
bridge	NULL
,	NULL
moved	NULL
ever	NULL
noiselessly	NULL
ahead	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
motioned	NULL
the	NULL
boy	NULL
and	NULL
girl	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
thicket	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
and	NULL
black	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cleared	NULL
island	NULL
.	NULL

Bles	NULL
slipped	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
protectingly	NULL
around	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
glancing	NULL
fearfully	NULL
about	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

Slowly	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
cry	NULL
rose	NULL
and	NULL
swept	NULL
the	NULL
island	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
struck	NULL
madly	NULL
and	NULL
sharply	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
died	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
uneasy	NULL
murmuring	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
afar	NULL
there	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
the	NULL
echo	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
answer	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
call	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
Elspeth	NULL
blurred	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
dimly	NULL
far	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
disappearing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
growing	NULL
blacker	NULL
and	NULL
larger	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
whispering	NULL
"	NULL
_	NULL
swish-swish	NULL
_	NULL
"	NULL
of	NULL
falling	NULL
seed	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
heavy	NULL
tread	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
coming	NULL
body	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
woman	NULL
suddenly	NULL
loomed	NULL
black	NULL
above	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
hovering	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
formless	NULL
and	NULL
vast	NULL
then	NULL
fading	NULL
again	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL

swish-swish	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
falling	NULL

alone	NULL
rose	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
long	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
seemed	NULL
suddenly	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
great	NULL
and	NULL
awful	NULL
cry	NULL
;	NULL
its	NULL
echoing	NULL
answer	NULL
screamed	NULL
afar	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
raucous	NULL
voice	NULL

Elspeth	NULL
beating	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
ears	NULL

his	NULL

the	NULL

continued	NULL

At	NULL
this	NULL

the	NULL
door	NULL
opened	NULL

a	NULL
young	NULL
lady	NULL
entered	NULL

Helen	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
was	NULL
twenty	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL

her	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL

Her	NULL

"	NULL
Good-morning	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL

She	NULL
sauntered	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL

kissed	NULL
him	NULL

hung	NULL
over	NULL

John	NULL

John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
had	NULL
prospered	NULL
since	NULL
summer	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
cotton	NULL
manufacturers	NULL
'	NULL
combine	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
fact	NULL
;	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Easterly	NULL
had	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
chief	NULL
clerk	NULL
's	NULL
sense	NULL
and	NULL
executive	NULL
ability	NULL
were	NULL
invaluable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
was	NULL
slated	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
salary	NULL
in	NULL
five	NULL
figures	NULL
when	NULL
things	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
finally	NULL
settled	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
mention	NULL
a	NULL
generous	NULL
slice	NULL
of	NULL
stock	NULL
--	NULL
watery	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
warranted	NULL
to	NULL
ripen	NULL
early	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Easterly	NULL
still	NULL
regarded	NULL
Taylor	NULL
's	NULL
larger	NULL
trust	NULL
as	NULL
chimerical	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
occurrences	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fall	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
respectful	NULL
attitude	NULL
toward	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
final	NULL
clauses	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
combine	NULL
agreement	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
signed	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
appeared	NULL
a	NULL
shortage	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cotton-crop	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
prices	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
soar	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
cause	NULL
was	NULL
obviously	NULL
the	NULL
unexpected	NULL
success	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
Farmers	NULL
'	NULL
League	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
cotton-growers	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Easterly	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
comparatively	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
overthrow	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
flurry	NULL
made	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
manufacturers	NULL
timid	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
trust	NULL
agreement	NULL
was	NULL
postponed	NULL
until	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
later	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
experience	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
persistence	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Taylor	NULL
induced	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Easterly	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
larger	NULL
project	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
let	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
eager	NULL
outside	NULL
capital	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
safer	NULL
manufacturing	NULL
scheme	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
withdrew	NULL
a	NULL
corresponding	NULL
amount	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
's	NULL
money	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
into	NULL
John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
's	NULL
hands	NULL
to	NULL
invest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
South	NULL
in	NULL
bank	NULL
stock	NULL
and	NULL
industries	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
playing	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
financial	NULL
situation	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
risk	NULL
,	NULL
Taylor	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
'll	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
risk	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
it	NULL
's	NULL
safer	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
damned	NULL
foolishness	NULL
she	NULL
has	NULL
in	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

So	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
that	NULL
John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
went	NULL
South	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
after	NULL
large	NULL
investments	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Easterly	NULL
expressed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
back	NULL
facts	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
dreams	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

His	NULL
investment	NULL
matters	NULL
went	NULL
quickly	NULL
and	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
wider	NULL
and	NULL
bigger	NULL
scheme	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wrote	NULL
the	NULL
Cresswells	NULL
tentatively	NULL
,	NULL
expecting	NULL
no	NULL
reply	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
an	NULL
evasive	NULL
one	NULL
;	NULL
planning	NULL
to	NULL
circle	NULL
around	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
drawing	NULL
his	NULL
nets	NULL
closer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
trying	NULL
them	NULL
again	NULL
later	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
his	NULL
surprise	NULL
they	NULL
responded	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Humph	NULL
!	NULL

Hard	NULL
pressed	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
decided	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hurried	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
after	NULL
Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
's	NULL

that	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL
John	NULL
Taylor	NULL

he	NULL
announced	NULL

Sam	NULL

Sam	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
wait	NULL
a	NULL
half-hour	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL
sake	NULL
of	NULL
discipline	NULL

then	NULL
brought	NULL
father	NULL

Taylor	NULL

John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
desultory	NULL
talk	NULL
,	NULL
followed	NULL
his	NULL
host	NULL
up-stairs	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
next	NULL
afternoon	NULL
John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
beside	NULL
Helen	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
porch	NULL
which	NULL
overlooked	NULL
the	NULL
terrace	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
less	NULL
of	NULL
cotton	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
several	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
cotton	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
it	NULL
mechanically	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
long	NULL
habit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
thinking	NULL
how	NULL
charming	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
Helen	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
fascinated	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
Taylor	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
superiority	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
contempt	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
and	NULL
argue	NULL
about	NULL
things	NULL
men	NULL
knew	NULL
!	NULL

He	NULL
admired	NULL
the	NULL
dashing	NULL
and	NULL
handsome	NULL
Miss	NULL
Easterly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
scared	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
angrily	NULL
awkward	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
lounged	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
amused	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
asked	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
child-like	NULL
questions	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
required	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
quite	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
adjust	NULL
her	NULL
pillows	NULL

hand	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
bon-bons	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hunt	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
lost	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Taylor	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
waited	NULL
on	NULL
anybody	NULL
since	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
died	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
quite	NULL
inexplicable	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
little	NULL
domesticities	NULL
.	NULL

Several	NULL
times	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
watch	NULL
and	NULL
frowned	NULL
;	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
quite	NULL
happily	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
her	NULL
part	NULL
Miss	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
was	NULL
vastly	NULL
amused	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
with	NULL
men	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
wide	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
thorough	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
class	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
well-dressed	NULL
and	NULL
leisurely	NULL
,	NULL
fairly	NULL
good	NULL
looking	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
words	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
paid	NULL
her	NULL
compliments	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
expect	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
charmingly	NULL
deferential	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
dropped	NULL
handkerchiefs	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
tyrannical	NULL
of	NULL
opinion	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
thoughtful	NULL
about	NULL
candy	NULL
and	NULL
flowers	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
thoughtless	NULL
about	NULL
feelings	NULL
and	NULL
income	NULL
.	NULL

Altogether	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
delightful	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
cloying	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
startlingly	NULL
different	NULL
;	NULL
ungainly	NULL
and	NULL
always	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
desperate	NULL
,	NULL
unaccountable	NULL
hurry	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
no	NULL
pretty	NULL
speeches	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
certainly	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
measure	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
standard	NULL
of	NULL
breeding	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
somehow	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
new	NULL
to	NULL
Helen	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
above-stairs	NULL
lingered	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
's	NULL

the	NULL
older	NULL

again	NULL

opened	NULL

said	NULL
nothing	NULL

next	NULL
day	NULL
Miss	NULL

her	NULL
when	NULL

came	NULL
in	NULL

closed	NULL

Taylor	NULL

it	NULL

Day	NULL
after	NULL
day	NULL
Bles	NULL

Zora	NULL
visited	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL

ever	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
lay	NULL
an	NULL
unrelieved	NULL
black	NULL
beneath	NULL
the	NULL

sun	NULL

they	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
reluctantly	NULL
home	NULL
again	NULL

today	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
work	NULL

Zora	NULL
labored	NULL
steadily	NULL

eagerly	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL

gaining	NULL
in	NULL
deftness	NULL

care	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
Bles	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
wagon	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
light	NULL
shower	NULL
flew	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
south	NULL
,	NULL
lingered	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
and	NULL
fled	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
a	NULL
fragrance	NULL
in	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
Zora	NULL
paused	NULL

and	NULL
her	NULL
nostrils	NULL
quivered	NULL

then	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL

she	NULL
slipped	NULL
down-stairs	NULL

glided	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL

sped	NULL
away	NULL

swung	NULL

a	NULL
low	NULL

it	NULL

rushed	NULL

bewilderment	NULL

Zora	NULL
hesitated	NULL

It	NULL
came	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
one	NULL
great	NULL
all-absorbing	NULL
thing	NULL
meant	NULL

Would	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

"	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
ventured	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
crouched	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
the	NULL
dream	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
.	NULL

Many	NULL
factors	NULL
were	NULL
involved	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
quite	NULL
foreign	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
older	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
nature	NULL
and	NULL
training	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
recital	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
New	NULL
England	NULL
mind	NULL
many	NULL
questions	NULL
of	NULL
policy	NULL
and	NULL
propriety	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
hot	NULL
with	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
seemed	NULL
somehow	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

Slowly	NULL
and	NULL
lightly	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
slipped	NULL
her	NULL
arm	NULL
about	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
nodded	NULL
and	NULL
smiled	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL
understanding	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
looked	NULL
out	NULL
together	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
darkening	NULL
twilight	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

Zora	NULL
sat	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
noisy	NULL
flaming	NULL
cabin	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
swamp	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
contrasting	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
bed	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
timid	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
slowly	NULL
she	NULL
shook	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
led	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Here	NULL
are	NULL
things	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
wear	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
pointed	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
opening	NULL
the	NULL
bureau	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
bath-room	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
time	NULL
Zora	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
often	NULL
at	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
's	NULL
cottage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
new	NULL
and	NULL
unknown	NULL
ways	NULL
of	NULL
living	NULL
and	NULL
dressing	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
still	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
board	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
cost	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
pay	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
accept	NULL
no	NULL
charity	NULL
.	NULL

Gradually	NULL
an	NULL
undemonstrative	NULL
friendship	NULL
sprang	NULL
up	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
pale	NULL
old	NULL
gray-haired	NULL
teacher	NULL

the	NULL
dark	NULL
young	NULL
black-haired	NULL

too	NULL

gradually	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
companionship	NULL
of	NULL
Bles	NULL

Zora	NULL
was	NULL

alone	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
noon	NULL
Bles	NULL
would	NULL
run	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
linger	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
hurry	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
school	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
working	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
busy	NULL
in	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
's	NULL
office	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
returning	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
linger	NULL
awhile	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
Zora	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
day	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
busied	NULL
herself	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
tasks	NULL
.	NULL

Saturday	NULL
mornings	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
and	NULL
work	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sometimes	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
,	NULL
stealing	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
curious	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
sit	NULL
and	NULL
talk	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
toiled	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
those	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
souls	NULL
,	NULL
earth	NULL
came	NULL
very	NULL
near	NULL
to	NULL
heaven	NULL
.	NULL

Both	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
mighty	NULL
change	NULL
from	NULL
youth	NULL
to	NULL
womanhood	NULL
and	NULL
manhood	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
manner	NULL
toward	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
by	NULL
degrees	NULL
grew	NULL
shyer	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
thoughtful	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
of	NULL
comradeship	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
meant	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rough	NULL
good	NULL
fellowship	NULL
was	NULL
silently	NULL
put	NULL
aside	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
lightly	NULL
clasped	NULL
hands	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
each	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
wondered	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
painful	NULL
self-consciousness	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
cared	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
began	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
subtle	NULL
change	NULL
wherein	NULL
a	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
now	NULL
unmindful	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
wrappings	NULL
,	NULL
comes	NULL
suddenly	NULL
to	NULL
consciousness	NULL
of	NULL
body	NULL
and	NULL
clothes	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
gropes	NULL
and	NULL
tries	NULL
to	NULL
adjust	NULL
one	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
through	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
inner	NULL
deeper	NULL
self	NULL
,	NULL
finer	NULL
and	NULL
fuller	NULL
expression	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
easily	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
's	NULL
Sunday	NULL
suit	NULL
,	NULL
vivid	NULL
neckties	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
awkward	NULL
fads	NULL
.	NULL

Slower	NULL
,	NULL
subtler	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
more	NULL
striking	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
earn	NULL
bits	NULL
of	NULL
pin	NULL
money	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
to	NULL
sew	NULL
.	NULL

Dresses	NULL
hung	NULL
straighter	NULL
;	NULL
belts	NULL
served	NULL
a	NULL
better	NULL
purpose	NULL
;	NULL
stockings	NULL
were	NULL
smoother	NULL
;	NULL
underwear	NULL
was	NULL
daintier	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
great	NULL
dark	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
immovable	NULL
infinitely	NULL
curled	NULL
hair	NULL
--	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
subdued	NULL
and	NULL
twisted	NULL
and	NULL
combed	NULL
until	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
steady	NULL
pains	NULL
and	NULL
study	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
thick	NULL
twisted	NULL
braids	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
velvet	NULL
forehead	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
some	NULL
shadowed	NULL
halo	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
came	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
slowly	NULL
and	NULL
spasmodically	NULL
than	NULL
one	NULL
tells	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Few	NULL
noticed	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
much	NULL
;	NULL
none	NULL
noticed	NULL
all	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
night	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
student	NULL
's	NULL
social	NULL
--	NULL
when	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
suddenness	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
teachers	NULL
and	NULL
pupils	NULL
,	NULL
realized	NULL
the	NULL
newness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
Bles	NULL
was	NULL
startled	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
Christmas	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
white	NULL
satin	NULL
slippers	NULL
,	NULL
partly	NULL
to	NULL
test	NULL
the	NULL
smallness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
younger	NULL
days	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
rallied	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
partly	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
mentioned	NULL
a	NULL
possible	NULL
white	NULL
dress	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
cheap	NULL
,	NULL
plain	NULL
pair	NULL
but	NULL
dainty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
fitted	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
students	NULL
were	NULL
marching	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
teachers	NULL
,	NULL
save	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
sitting	NULL
rather	NULL
primly	NULL
apart	NULL
and	NULL
commenting	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
late	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
hush	NULL
greeted	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
inimitable	NULL
drawl	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
race	NULL
,	NULL
pushed	NULL
back	NULL
his	NULL
ice-cream	NULL
and	NULL
addressed	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
mournful	NULL
head-shake	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Go	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
honey	NULL
,	NULL
yo	NULL
'	NULL
los	NULL
'	NULL
yo	NULL
'	NULL
tas	NULL
'	NULL
e!	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
dress	NULL
was	NULL
plain	NULL
and	NULL
fitted	NULL
every	NULL
curving	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
healthy	NULL
girlish	NULL
form	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
paused	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
white-bodied	NULL
and	NULL
white-limbed	NULL
but	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
velvet-armed	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
full	NULL
neck	NULL
and	NULL
oval	NULL
head	NULL
rising	NULL
rich	NULL
and	NULL
almost	NULL
black	NULL
above	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
deep-lighted	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
crown	NULL
of	NULL
silent	NULL
darkling	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
some	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
revelation	NULL
of	NULL
grace	NULL
and	NULL
womanliness	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
hoyden	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
gentle	NULL
swelling	NULL
of	NULL
lankness	NULL
to	NULL
beauty	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
lowliness	NULL
to	NULL
shy	NULL
self-poise	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
joy	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
others	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
blindness	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
was	NULL
perplexed	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
indefinite	NULL
way	NULL
amazed	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
teachers	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
beauty	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
strangeness	NULL
that	NULL
brought	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
know	NULL
beauty	NULL
by	NULL
convention	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
find	NULL
it	NULL
lip-ringed	NULL
,	NULL
hoop-skirted	NULL
,	NULL
tattooed	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
corsetted	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
place	NULL
decree	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
neither	NULL
cataclysmic	NULL
nor	NULL
revolutionary	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
yet	NULL
far	NULL
--	NULL
very	NULL
far	NULL
--	NULL
from	NULL
complete	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
still	NULL
ran	NULL
and	NULL
romped	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
woods	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dreamed	NULL
her	NULL
dreams	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
still	NULL
was	NULL
passionately	NULL
independent	NULL
and	NULL
"	NULL
queer	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Tendencies	NULL
merely	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
manifest	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
dominant	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
unhindered	NULL
,	NULL
develop	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
brilliant	NULL
,	NULL
sumptuous	NULL
womanhood	NULL
;	NULL
proud	NULL
,	NULL
conquering	NULL
,	NULL
full-blooded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
deep	NULL
bosomed	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
passionate	NULL
mother	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

Herein	NULL
lay	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
early	NULL
wildness	NULL
and	NULL
strangeness	NULL
.	NULL

Herein	NULL
lay	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
half	NULL
hidden	NULL
,	NULL
dimly	NULL
sensed	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
unspoken	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mighty	NULL
all-compelling	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
human	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
through	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
souls	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
lay	NULL
growing	NULL
and	NULL
developing	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
shyness	NULL
and	NULL
comeliness	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
bold	NULL
,	NULL
searching	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
possibilities	NULL
were	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
expression	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
new-born	NULL
green	NULL
things	NULL
hidden	NULL
far	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
begotten	NULL
in	NULL
want	NULL
and	NULL
mystery	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
living	NULL
wonderful	NULL
fairy	NULL
tale	NULL
come	NULL
true	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
latent	NULL
mother	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
brooded	NULL
over	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
brilliant	NULL
fancy	NULL
wove	NULL
itself	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
her	NULL
dream-children	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
tended	NULL
them	NULL
jealously	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
her	NULL
Hope	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
worshipped	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
rabbits	NULL
tried	NULL
the	NULL
tender	NULL
plants	NULL
she	NULL
watched	NULL
hours	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
them	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
catching	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
a	NULL
pulsing	NULL
pink-eyed	NULL
invader	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
earnestly	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Brer	NULL
Rabbit	NULL
--	NULL
poor	NULL
little	NULL
Brer	NULL
Rabbit	NULL

Naughty	NULL

naughty	NULL
Brer	NULL
Rabbit	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
show	NULL
it	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
gathered	NULL
piles	NULL
of	NULL
fragrant	NULL
weeds	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
fellows	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
golden	NULL
green	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
leaves	NULL
darkened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
plants	NULL
sprang	NULL
forward	NULL
steadily	NULL
.	NULL

Never	NULL
before	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
magnificent	NULL
beginning	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
full	NULL
month	NULL
ahead	NULL
of	NULL
other	NULL
cotton	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rain	NULL
swept	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
laughing	NULL
,	NULL
bubbling	NULL
showers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
laved	NULL
their	NULL
thirsty	NULL
souls	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Zora	NULL
held	NULL
her	NULL
beating	NULL
breast	NULL
day	NULL
by	NULL
day	NULL
lest	NULL
it	NULL
rain	NULL
too	NULL
long	NULL
or	NULL
too	NULL
heavily	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
burned	NULL
fiercely	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
cotton	NULL
plants	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
hastened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
lifted	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
in	NULL
darker	NULL
,	NULL
wilder	NULL
luxuriance	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
hoeing	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
days	NULL
were	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
alternate	NULL
hope	NULL
and	NULL
doubt	NULL
with	NULL
Bles	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
.	NULL

Strength	NULL
and	NULL
ambition	NULL
and	NULL
inarticulate	NULL
love	NULL
were	NULL
fighting	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
thousands	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
kind	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
mighty	NULL
calling	NULL
to	NULL
deeds	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
becoming	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
narrowness	NULL
and	NULL
straightness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
black	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
red	NULL
anger	NULL
flashed	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
ever	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
bonds	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
mental	NULL
horizon	NULL
was	NULL
broadening	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
college	NULL
of	NULL
next	NULL
year	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
faintly	NULL
grasping	NULL
the	NULL
wider	NULL
,	NULL
fuller	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
thoughts	NULL
and	NULL
aspirations	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
beside	NULL
and	NULL
around	NULL
and	NULL
above	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
subtle	NULL
,	NULL
permeating	NULL
ether	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
--	NULL
Zora	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
feelings	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
definite	NULL
,	NULL
expressed	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
grasped	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
rather	NULL
the	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
occurred	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
felt	NULL
and	NULL
judged	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
an	NULL
amusing	NULL
pastime	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
companion	NULL
and	NULL
thought-mate	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
beyond	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
insensibly	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
drifting	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
silenter	NULL
,	NULL
mightier	NULL
mingling	NULL
of	NULL
souls	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
drifting	NULL
,	NULL
merely	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
arrived	NULL
;	NULL
going	NULL
gently	NULL
,	NULL
irresistibly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
realized	NULL
goal	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
stirring	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mighty	NULL
force	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
teasing	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fellows	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
common	NULL
love-gossip	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
yard	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
far	NULL
different	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
plight	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
laughed	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
indignantly	NULL
denied	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
,	NULL
restless	NULL
,	NULL
unhappy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
fancied	NULL
Zora	NULL
cared	NULL
less	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
company	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
less	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
was	NULL
puzzled	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
time	NULL
hanging	NULL
so	NULL
empty	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
wretchedly	NULL
empty	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
together	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
days	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
less	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
magic	NULL
wilfulness	NULL
opened	NULL
both	NULL
their	NULL
mouths	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
found	NULL
their	NULL
companionship	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
series	NULL
of	NULL
awkward	NULL
silences	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
silences	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
walks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
sittings	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
companionship	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
glow	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
satisfaction	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
nowhere	NULL
else	NULL
on	NULL
earth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
wondered	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
both	NULL
wondering	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
watched	NULL
their	NULL
cotton	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
seemingly	NULL
bounded	NULL
forward	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
night	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
hoed	NULL
forthwith	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
,	NULL
hoeing	NULL
was	NULL
murder	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
ruthless	NULL
cutting	NULL
away	NULL
of	NULL
tenderer	NULL
plants	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
sturdier	NULL
might	NULL
thrive	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
grow	NULL
.	NULL

Bles	NULL
leaned	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL

considered	NULL

Zora	NULL

dropping	NULL

they	NULL

not	NULL
utterly	NULL
departed	NULL

however	NULL

came	NULL
crowding	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
moments	NULL

excitement	NULL

At	NULL

she	NULL
clothed	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
drifting	NULL
away	NULL

the	NULL

So	NULL
it	NULL

the	NULL

these	NULL

Zora	NULL
never	NULL

when	NULL
her	NULL

she	NULL
slipped	NULL

prayed	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
's	NULL

was	NULL
due	NULL

no	NULL

Taylor	NULL

Slowly	NULL
but	NULL
surely	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
new	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
attuned	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
set	NULL
for	NULL
different	NULL
music	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
veil	NULL
of	NULL
color	NULL
and	NULL
race	NULL
still	NULL
hung	NULL
thickly	NULL
between	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
pupils	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
some	NULL
points	NULL
of	NULL
penetration	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
meet	NULL
daily	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
light-hearted	NULL
,	NULL
good-natured	NULL
children	NULL
without	NULL
feeling	NULL
drawn	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
cross	NULL
the	NULL
thresholds	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cabins	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
and	NULL
well-known	NULL
problems	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
striving	NULL
.	NULL

More	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
met	NULL
Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
's	NULL
approval	NULL

she	NULL
told	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
definite	NULL
conclusions	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
believed	NULL
it	NULL
wrong	NULL
to	NULL
encourage	NULL
the	NULL
ambitions	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
children	NULL
to	NULL
any	NULL
great	NULL
extent	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
believed	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
servants	NULL
and	NULL
farmers	NULL
,	NULL
content	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
under	NULL
present	NULL
conditions	NULL
until	NULL
those	NULL
conditions	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
changed	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
believed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
local	NULL
white	NULL
aristocracy	NULL
,	NULL
helped	NULL
by	NULL
Northern	NULL
philanthropy	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
take	NULL
charge	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
gradual	NULL
changes	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
conclusions	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
pretend	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
originated	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
adopted	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
reading	NULL
and	NULL
conversation	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
hesitating	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
before	NULL
such	NULL
puzzling	NULL
contradictions	NULL
as	NULL
Bles	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
and	NULL
Harry	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
conclude	NULL
to	NULL
treat	NULL
Bles	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
despite	NULL
his	NULL
color	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
impossible	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
a	NULL
criminal	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
compromise	NULL
was	NULL
imperative	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
save	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
pleasure	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
's	NULL
company	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
leave	NULL
open	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
fulfilling	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
's	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
black	NULL
boy	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
this	NULL
compromise	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
wrote	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
suggesting	NULL
a	NULL
chain	NULL
of	NULL

Negro	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
acquiesced	NULL
gladly	NULL
and	NULL
announced	NULL
her	NULL
plan	NULL

eventually	NULL
writing	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL

she	NULL
hoped	NULL

The	NULL
sharpness	NULL
of	NULL

Far	NULL

the	NULL

for	NULL

the	NULL

was	NULL

hating	NULL

only	NULL

hated	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
sell	NULL
any	NULL

was	NULL
sure	NULL

even	NULL
now	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
promise	NULL

faced	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
lay	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
closed	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
lightly	NULL
asleep	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
slept	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL

came	NULL
toiling	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL

out	NULL

hooded	NULL

aproned	NULL

with	NULL
great	NULL
round	NULL
head	NULL

was	NULL

One	NULL

threw	NULL
a	NULL
veil	NULL

her	NULL

answered	NULL
steadily	NULL

Five	NULL

Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
replied	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
hesitated	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
would	NULL
buy	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
money	NULL
was	NULL
needed	NULL
to	NULL
develop	NULL
and	NULL
run	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
to	NULL
install	NULL
tenants	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
new	NULL
teachers	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
nodding	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
polite	NULL
bow	NULL
,	NULL
departed	NULL
.	NULL

Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
had	NULL
noticed	NULL
her	NULL
hesitation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
settled	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
cigar	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Bles	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
arose	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
and	NULL
examined	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
critically	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
feared	NULL
rain	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
season	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
quite	NULL
wet	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
particularly	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
land	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
but	NULL
yesterday	NULL
Bles	NULL
had	NULL
viewed	NULL
his	NULL
dykes	NULL
with	NULL
apprehension	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
pool	NULL
scowled	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
heavy	NULL
rain	NULL
might	NULL
do	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
wonderful	NULL
island	NULL
of	NULL
cotton	NULL
which	NULL
now	NULL
stood	NULL
fully	NULL
five	NULL
feet	NULL
high	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
flowers	NULL
and	NULL
squares	NULL
and	NULL
budding	NULL
bolls	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
rain	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
safest	NULL
thing	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
at	NULL
those	NULL
dykes	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
started	NULL
for	NULL
spade	NULL
and	NULL
hoe	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
heard	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
calling	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Bles	NULL
--	NULL
hitch	NULL
up	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
vexed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
hurry	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
replied	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
unmistakable	NULL
positiveness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
started	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hesitated	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
Jim	NULL
do	NULL
to	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
sharply	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL

particularly	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

At	NULL
another	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
observed	NULL
his	NULL
anxiety	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
today	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
agitated	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
critical	NULL
step	NULL
.	NULL

Slowly	NULL
Bles	NULL
hitched	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
all	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
rain	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
argued	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
jogged	NULL
toward	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
silence	NULL
they	NULL
rode	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Bles	NULL
kept	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
skies	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
south	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
darker	NULL
and	NULL
darker	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
might	NULL
rain	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
might	NULL
rain	NULL
only	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
suppose	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
rain	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
--	NULL
two	NULL
days	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
?	NULL

Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
skies	NULL
and	NULL
despite	NULL
the	NULL
promised	NULL
sunrise	NULL
they	NULL
loomed	NULL
darkly	NULL
.	NULL

Five	NULL
thousand	NULL
was	NULL
needed	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
another	NULL
thousand	NULL
for	NULL
repairs	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
thousand	NULL
would	NULL
"	NULL
buy	NULL
"	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
dozen	NULL
desirable	NULL
tenants	NULL
by	NULL
paying	NULL
their	NULL
debts	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
present	NULL
landlords	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
two	NULL
thousand	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
wanted	NULL
for	NULL
new	NULL
teachers	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
carpenter	NULL
shop	NULL
--	NULL
ten	NULL
thousand	NULL
dollars	NULL
!	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
temptation	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
once	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
past-masters	NULL
of	NULL
debt-manipulation	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
her	NULL
school	NULL
be	NULL
safe	NULL
?	NULL

Suppose	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
Grey	NULL
gift	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
caught	NULL
her	NULL
breath	NULL
sharply	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
wet	NULL
splash	NULL
of	NULL
rain	NULL
struck	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
forehead	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
.	NULL

God	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
cruel	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
pushed	NULL
her	NULL
bonnet	NULL
back	NULL
:	NULL
how	NULL
good	NULL
and	NULL
cool	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
felt	NULL
!	NULL

But	NULL
on	NULL
Bles	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
raised	NULL
the	NULL
buggy	NULL
top	NULL
it	NULL
felt	NULL
hot	NULL
and	NULL
fiery	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
coming	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
great	NULL
calamity	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
rain	NULL
might	NULL
stay	NULL
for	NULL
days	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
downpour	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL

the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL

the	NULL
end	NULL

everything	NULL

He	NULL
gulped	NULL
in	NULL
despairing	NULL
anger	NULL
and	NULL
hit	NULL
the	NULL
staid	NULL
old	NULL
horse	NULL

smartest	NULL

called	NULL

something	NULL

Mr.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

had	NULL
met	NULL

a	NULL

was	NULL
therefore	NULL
most	NULL

Mr.	NULL

Mr.	NULL

explained	NULL

No	NULL

I	NULL

The	NULL

here	NULL
heartily	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

was	NULL
mystified	NULL

hardly	NULL

Fourteen	NULL
_	NULL
LOVE	NULL
The	NULL
rain	NULL
was	NULL
sweeping	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
great	NULL
thick	NULL
winding	NULL
sheets	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wind	NULL
screamed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ancient	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
oaks	NULL
and	NULL
swirled	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
in	NULL
loud	NULL
,	NULL
wild	NULL
gusts	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
waters	NULL
roared	NULL
and	NULL
gurgled	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
streams	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
roadside	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
fell	NULL
murmuring	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
clouds	NULL
grew	NULL
blacker	NULL
and	NULL
blacker	NULL
and	NULL
rain	NULL
in	NULL
long	NULL
slim	NULL
columns	NULL
fell	NULL
straight	NULL
from	NULL
Heaven	NULL
to	NULL
earth	NULL
digging	NULL
itself	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
and	NULL
throwing	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
red	NULL
mud	NULL
in	NULL
angry	NULL
flashes	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
it	NULL
rained	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
long	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
for	NULL
seven	NULL
endless	NULL
days	NULL
Bles	NULL
watched	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
leaden	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
and	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
--	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
ruined	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
great	NULL
sorrow	NULL

life	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
the	NULL
loss	NULL

cotton	NULL
itself	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
fantasy	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
hopes	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
dreams	NULL
built	NULL
around	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
failed	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
they	NULL
fail	NULL
?	NULL

Was	NULL
not	NULL
this	NULL
angry	NULL
beating	NULL
rain	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
dull	NULL
spiritless	NULL
drizzle	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
wild	NULL
war	NULL
of	NULL
air	NULL

earth	NULL

but	NULL
foretaste	NULL

the	NULL

futility	NULL

But	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
despair	NULL
was	NULL
great	NULL
his	NULL
pain	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
plight	NULL
of	NULL
Zora	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
almost	NULL
unbearable	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
seven	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
pictured	NULL
her	NULL
huddled	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cheerless	NULL

cabin	NULL
with	NULL
worse	NULL
than	NULL
no	NULL
companions	NULL
.	NULL

Ah	NULL
!	NULL

the	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
cruel	NULL
swamp	NULL
!	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fearful	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rain	NULL
.	NULL

Its	NULL
oozing	NULL
mud	NULL
and	NULL
fetid	NULL
vapors	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
clinging	NULL
slimy	NULL
draperies	NULL
,	NULL
--	NULL
how	NULL
they	NULL
twined	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
bones	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
victims	NULL
and	NULL
chilled	NULL
their	NULL
hearts	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
here	NULL
his	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
--	NULL
his	NULL
poor	NULL
disappointed	NULL
child	NULL
--	NULL
was	NULL
imprisoned	NULL
.	NULL

Child	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
child	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
inward	NULL
illumination	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
dark	NULL
days	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
neither	NULL
child	NULL
nor	NULL
sister	NULL
nor	NULL
friend	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
One	NULL
Woman	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
revelation	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
lighted	NULL
and	NULL
brightened	NULL
slowly	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
flamed	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
sunrise	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
burning	NULL
wonder	NULL

He	NULL
panted	NULL

she	NULL

knew	NULL

knew	NULL

was	NULL
so	NULL
strange	NULL

human	NULL

To	NULL
her	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
meant	NULL
something	NULL

nothing	NULL

Was	NULL
this	NULL
rain	NULL
beating	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
back	NULL
her	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
loved	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
gripping	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
peering	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
misty	NULL
windows	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
--	NULL
rain	NULL
,	NULL
rain	NULL
,	NULL
rain	NULL
,	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
rain	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
water	NULL
veiled	NULL
in	NULL
mists	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
midday	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
shot	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
hot	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
;	NULL
no	NULL
breath	NULL
of	NULL
air	NULL
stirred	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
blue	NULL
steel	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
steamed	NULL
.	NULL

Bles	NULL
rushed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
there	NULL
irresolute	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
had	NULL
but	NULL
drained	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
cotton	NULL
!	NULL

--	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
strong	NULL
and	NULL
tall	NULL
!	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
pshaw	NULL
!	NULL

Where	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
imagining	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
lagoon	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
level	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
dykes	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
ago	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
almost	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL
,	NULL
bedraggled	NULL
,	NULL
drowned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rolling	NULL
beneath	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
lake	NULL
of	NULL
slime	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
early	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
lured	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
grave	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
hope	NULL
and	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
resurrect	NULL
new	NULL
love	NULL
and	NULL
strength	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
waiting	NULL
,	NULL
weeping	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
started	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hurried	NULL
forth	NULL
sadly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rain-drops	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
dripping	NULL
and	NULL
gleaming	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
,	NULL
flashing	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
heavy	NULL
yellow	NULL
sunlight	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
splashed	NULL
and	NULL
stamped	NULL
along	NULL
,	NULL
farther	NULL
and	NULL
farther	NULL
onward	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
neared	NULL
the	NULL
rampart	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
clearing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
foot	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
tree-bridge	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lagoon	NULL
was	NULL
dry	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stood	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
bewildered	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
turned	NULL
and	NULL
rushed	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
island	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
great	NULL
sheet	NULL
of	NULL
dazzling	NULL
sunlight	NULL
swept	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
beneath	NULL
lay	NULL
a	NULL
mighty	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
olive	NULL
green	NULL
,	NULL
thick	NULL
,	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
wet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
willowy	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
squares	NULL
of	NULL
cotton	NULL
,	NULL
sharp-edged	NULL
,	NULL
heavy	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
just	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
burst	NULL
to	NULL
bolls	NULL
!	NULL

And	NULL
underneath	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
lay	NULL
carefully	NULL
drained	NULL
and	NULL
black	NULL
!	NULL

For	NULL
one	NULL
long	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
paused	NULL
,	NULL
stupid	NULL
,	NULL
agape	NULL
with	NULL
utter	NULL
amazement	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
leaned	NULL
dizzily	NULL
against	NULL
a	NULL
tree	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
eternal	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
drained	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
deepest	NULL
fastness	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
how	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
gazed	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
perplexed	NULL
,	NULL
astonished	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
a	NULL
field	NULL
of	NULL
cotton	NULL
!	NULL

what	NULL
a	NULL
marvellous	NULL
field	NULL
!	NULL

But	NULL
how	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
been	NULL
saved	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
skirted	NULL
the	NULL
island	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
stopping	NULL
near	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
oak	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
reading	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
riddle	NULL
:	NULL
with	NULL
infinite	NULL
work	NULL
and	NULL
pain	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
dug	NULL
a	NULL
canal	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
lagoon	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
creek	NULL
,	NULL
into	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
former	NULL
had	NULL
drained	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
crooked	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
thus	NULL
allowing	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
empty	NULL
directly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
canal	NULL
went	NULL
straight	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
through	NULL
stubborn	NULL
soil	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
oozing	NULL
now	NULL
with	NULL
slimy	NULL
waters	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
weak	NULL
,	NULL
bewildered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
thought	NULL
was	NULL
uppermost	NULL
--	NULL
Zora	NULL
!	NULL

And	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
moan	NULL
of	NULL
pain	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wheeled	NULL
and	NULL
leapt	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
dripping	NULL
shelter	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tree	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
she	NULL
lay	NULL
--	NULL
wet	NULL
,	NULL
bedraggled	NULL
,	NULL
motionless	NULL
,	NULL
gray-pallid	NULL
beneath	NULL
her	NULL
dark-drawn	NULL
skin	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
burning	NULL
eyes	NULL
searching	NULL
restlessly	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
lost	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
a-moaning	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
dumb	NULL
despair	NULL
he	NULL
dropped	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
gathered	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
earth	NULL
staggered	NULL
beneath	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
stumbled	NULL
on	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
mud	NULL
splashed	NULL
and	NULL
sunlight	NULL
glistened	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
long	NULL
snakes	NULL
slithering	NULL
across	NULL
his	NULL
path	NULL
and	NULL
fear-struck	NULL
beasts	NULL
fleeing	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
coming	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
paused	NULL
for	NULL
neither	NULL
path	NULL
nor	NULL
way	NULL
but	NULL
went	NULL
straight	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
running	NULL
in	NULL
mighty	NULL
strides	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
gently	NULL
,	NULL
listening	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
moans	NULL
that	NULL
struck	NULL
death	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
he	NULL
fell	NULL
headlong	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
wrench	NULL
held	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
harm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
minded	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
that	NULL
shot	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
ribs	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
yellow	NULL
sunshine	NULL
beat	NULL
fiercely	NULL
around	NULL
and	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
stumbled	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
highway	NULL
,	NULL
lurched	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
mud-strewn	NULL
road	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
panted	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
porch	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
--	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
gasped	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
--	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
dying	NULL
were	NULL
ten	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
that	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
death	NULL
emerged	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
silent	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
grave	NULL
,	NULL
working	NULL
furiously	NULL
and	NULL
haunting	NULL
,	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
window	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
gray	NULL
morning	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
was	NULL
stillest	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
She	NULL
will	NULL
live	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
stars	NULL
,	NULL
lifted	NULL
his	NULL
long	NULL
arms	NULL
and	NULL
sobbed	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Curse	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
O	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
lose	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
God	NULL
remembered	NULL
this	NULL
in	NULL
after	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hope	NULL
and	NULL
dream	NULL
of	NULL
harvest	NULL
was	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
cotton	NULL
crop	NULL
was	NULL
short	NULL
and	NULL
poor	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
rain	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
had	NULL
saved	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
price	NULL
had	NULL
soared	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
black-belt	NULL
green	NULL
and	NULL
luxuriant	NULL
with	NULL
thickening	NULL
flecks	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
coming	NULL
foam	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cotton	NULL
.	NULL

Up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sick	NULL
room	NULL
Zora	NULL
lay	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
white	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
net	NULL
and	NULL
web	NULL
of	NULL
endless	NULL
things	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
crawling	NULL
and	NULL
creeping	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
struggled	NULL
in	NULL
dumb	NULL
,	NULL
speechless	NULL
terror	NULL
against	NULL
some	NULL
mighty	NULL
grasping	NULL
that	NULL
strove	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
gnarled	NULL
and	NULL
creeping	NULL
fingers	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
weakly	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
opened	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
questioned	NULL
.	NULL

Bles	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
Sun	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Swamp	NULL
?	NULL

Then	NULL
finding	NULL
all	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
closed	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
slept	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
some	NULL
days	NULL
they	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
sit	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
Bles	NULL
pass	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
drew	NULL
back	NULL
timidly	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
flutter	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
gown	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
waved	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
walk	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
porch	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
flickering	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
strength	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
different	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
buxom	NULL
comeliness	NULL
was	NULL
spiritualized	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
looked	NULL
smaller	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
masses	NULL
of	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
brought	NULL
low	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
ears	NULL
,	NULL
heightened	NULL
her	NULL
ghostly	NULL
beauty	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
skin	NULL
was	NULL
darkly	NULL
transparent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
looked	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
velvet	NULL
veils	NULL
of	NULL
gloom	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
dreamy	NULL
pleasure	NULL
at	NULL
sun	NULL
and	NULL
bird	NULL
and	NULL
tree	NULL
.	NULL

Bles	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
yet	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
down	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
soon	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
searching	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
each	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
pressed	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
hands	NULL
against	NULL
her	NULL
breast	NULL
to	NULL
still	NULL
the	NULL
beating	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
bursting	NULL
wonder	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
suddenly	NULL
a	NULL
panic	NULL
seized	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
her	NULL
here	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
here	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
yonder	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
rose	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
fleeting	NULL
glance	NULL
,	NULL
gathered	NULL
the	NULL
shawl	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
gliding	NULL
forward	NULL
,	NULL
wavering	NULL
,	NULL
tremulous	NULL
,	NULL
slipped	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
and	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dark	NULL
mystery	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Swamp	NULL
swept	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
was	NULL
hers	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
born	NULL
within	NULL
its	NULL
borders	NULL
;	NULL
within	NULL
its	NULL
borders	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
lived	NULL
and	NULL
grown	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
within	NULL
its	NULL
borders	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
her	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
she	NULL
hurried	NULL
until	NULL
,	NULL
sweeping	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
lagoon	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
island	NULL
,	NULL
lo	NULL
!	NULL

the	NULL
cotton	NULL
lay	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
!	NULL

A	NULL
great	NULL
white	NULL
foam	NULL
was	NULL
spread	NULL
upon	NULL
its	NULL
brown	NULL
and	NULL
green	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
field	NULL
was	NULL
waving	NULL
and	NULL
shivering	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sunlight	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
low	NULL
cry	NULL
of	NULL
pleasure	NULL
burst	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
forgot	NULL
her	NULL
weakness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
picking	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
bridge	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
cotton	NULL
that	NULL
nestled	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
clasping	NULL
it	NULL
lovingly	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
down-stairs	NULL
and	NULL
ran	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
beating	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
chair	NULL
was	NULL
empty	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
place	NULL
then	NULL
for	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
souls	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
feared	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ran	NULL
with	NULL
startled	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
island	NULL
,	NULL
ethereal	NULL
,	NULL
splendid	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
some	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gorgeous	NULL
flower	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
storied	NULL
East	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
green	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cotton	NULL
billowed	NULL
and	NULL
foamed	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
breasts	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
red	NULL
scarf	NULL
burned	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
neck	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
brown	NULL
velvet	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
skin	NULL
pulsed	NULL
warm	NULL
and	NULL
tremulous	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
uprushing	NULL
blood	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midnight	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
great	NULL
eyes	NULL
flamed	NULL
the	NULL
mighty	NULL
fires	NULL
of	NULL
long-concealed	NULL
and	NULL
new-born	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
darted	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
and	NULL
paused	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
man	NULL
strongly	NULL
but	NULL
slimly	NULL
made	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
threw	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
way	NULL
and	NULL
hallooed	NULL
;	NULL
happily	NULL
she	NULL
crooned	NULL
back	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
mother-melody	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
fixed	NULL
,	NULL
hungry	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
threading	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
Fleece	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
move	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
lifted	NULL
both	NULL
her	NULL
dark	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
white	NULL
with	NULL
cotton	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
casting	NULL
it	NULL
suddenly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
winds	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
tears	NULL
and	NULL
laughter	NULL

The	NULL

the	NULL

in	NULL
four	NULL

rolled	NULL
beneath	NULL

The	NULL
Christmas	NULL
"	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
Southern	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
busy	NULL
.	NULL

Few	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
busier	NULL
than	NULL
Bles	NULL
and	NULL
Zora	NULL
.	NULL

Slowly	NULL
,	NULL
wonderfully	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
heaven	NULL
bent	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
dying	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL

kissed	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tremor	NULL
thrilled	NULL
all	NULL
lands	NULL

Everything	NULL
was	NULL
good	NULL

all	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
happy	NULL

and	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
were	NULL
happiest	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL

Out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shadows	NULL
and	NULL
hesitations	NULL
of	NULL
childhood	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
stepped	NULL
suddenly	NULL
into	NULL
manhood	NULL
and	NULL
womanhood	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
firm	NULL
feet	NULL
and	NULL
uplifted	NULL
heads	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
theirs	NULL
they	NULL
worked	NULL
,	NULL
picking	NULL
the	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL
--	NULL
picking	NULL
it	NULL
tenderly	NULL
and	NULL
lovingly	NULL
from	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
brown	NULL

spent	NULL
bodies	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
utterly	NULL
yielded	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
beauty	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL
fruition	NULL

this	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
silken	NULL
tendril	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
white	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cotton	NULL

November	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
flew	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
the	NULL
unexhausted	NULL
field	NULL
yielded	NULL
its	NULL
frothing	NULL
fruit	NULL
.	NULL

Today	NULL
seemed	NULL
doubly	NULL
glorious	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Bles	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL

they	NULL
walked	NULL
the	NULL
leafy	NULL
way	NULL

Unconscious	NULL

rapt	NULL

they	NULL
stepped	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
Big	NULL
Road	NULL
skirting	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL

the	NULL
swamp	NULL

Why	NULL
not	NULL
?	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
King	NULL

Highway	NULL

And	NULL
Love	NULL

King	NULL

So	NULL
they	NULL
talked	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
unknowing	NULL
that	NULL
far	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
the	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
coaches	NULL
were	NULL
wheeling	NULL
along	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL

Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
was	NULL
lolling	NULL
luxuriously	NULL

but	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
stiff	NULL
from	NULL
long	NULL
travel	NULL

sat	NULL
upright	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
looked	NULL
clean-cut	NULL

handsome	NULL

Miss	NULL

seemed	NULL
complacent	NULL

The	NULL

soothed	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
insensibly	NULL

playfully	NULL

celebrated	NULL

laughed	NULL

touched	NULL
her	NULL

even	NULL

him	NULL

drew	NULL

the	NULL

lifting	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL

needed	NULL

"	NULL

asked	NULL

horses	NULL
started	NULL

turning	NULL
the	NULL
battery	NULL

her	NULL
eyes	NULL
full	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL

Cresswell	NULL

himself	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
lovers	NULL

fell	NULL
like	NULL

Zora	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
grayish	NULL
horror	NULL
mottled	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
burning	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL

Bles	NULL
started	NULL
in	NULL
anger	NULL

paused	NULL
in	NULL
shivering	NULL
doubt	NULL

What	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
?	NULL

They	NULL
knew	NULL

yet	NULL
involuntarily	NULL
their	NULL

hold	NULL
her	NULL

he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
offer	NULL
the	NULL
farewell	NULL

but	NULL
stood	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL

A	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
paused	NULL

looked	NULL
back	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
painfully	NULL

she	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
path	NULL
back	NULL

the	NULL
field	NULL

the	NULL
Fleece	NULL

and	NULL
reaching	NULL
it	NULL
after	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
long	NULL
minutes	NULL
,	NULL
began	NULL
mechanically	NULL
to	NULL
pick	NULL
the	NULL
cotton	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
cotton	NULL
glowed	NULL
crimson	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
failing	NULL
sun	NULL

Bles	NULL
walked	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
?	NULL

he	NULL
kept	NULL
asking	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
question	NULL
the	NULL
awful	NULL
shape	NULL
that	NULL
sat	NULL
somewhere	NULL

cold	NULL

still	NULL

behind	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL

He	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
hoofs	NULL

again	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL

brought	NULL

the	NULL

He	NULL
raised	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
return	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
pausing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL

her	NULL
too	NULL

thus	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL

She	NULL
faced	NULL
him	NULL

flinched	NULL

the	NULL

paused	NULL

She	NULL
stepped	NULL
back	NULL

scandalized	NULL

raised	NULL

off	NULL

dumbly	NULL

as	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL

almost	NULL
frightened	NULL
at	NULL

The	NULL

in	NULL
his	NULL

screamed	NULL

wheeled	NULL

whispered	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
suddenly	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
staggering	NULL
and	NULL
faltering	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL

The	NULL

bent	NULL
curiously	NULL

upon	NULL

He	NULL

A	NULL

suddenly	NULL

life	NULL

slower	NULL
he	NULL
ran	NULL

more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
the	NULL
thoughts	NULL
crowded	NULL
his	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
first	NULL
red	NULL
night	NULL

the	NULL
yelling	NULL
and	NULL
singing	NULL
and	NULL
wild	NULL
dancing	NULL

he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Cresswell	NULL

he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Zora	NULL
telling	NULL
how	NULL

out	NULL
nights	NULL

he	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
built	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cotton	NULL
field	NULL

A	NULL
wild	NULL
fear	NULL
struggled	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
anger	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
repeating	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
clenched	NULL
his	NULL

Slowly	NULL

more	NULL
slowly	NULL
he	NULL
ran	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
--	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
waiting	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
drew	NULL
near	NULL
huge	NULL
hands	NULL
held	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL

and	NULL
heavy	NULL
weights	NULL
clogged	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL

His	NULL
heart	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
Slow	NULL

He	NULL
hurled	NULL
the	NULL

aside	NULL

crashed	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
barrier	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
still	NULL
and	NULL
listening	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
huge	NULL
basket	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
piled	NULL
froth	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL

One	NULL
long	NULL
brown	NULL
arm	NULL

tender	NULL
with	NULL
curvings	NULL
,	NULL
balanced	NULL
the	NULL
cotton	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL

poised	NULL

balanced	NULL
the	NULL

Bending	NULL
she	NULL
listened	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
shining	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
apart	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
bosom	NULL
fluttering	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
well-known	NULL
step	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
view	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
fury	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
beast	NULL
,	NULL
rending	NULL
the	NULL
wood	NULL
away	NULL
and	NULL
trampling	NULL
the	NULL
underbrush	NULL
,	NULL
reeling	NULL
and	NULL
muttering	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
hands	NULL
dropped	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
very	NULL
still	NULL
with	NULL
drawn	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
grayish-brown	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
hands	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
out-stretched	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
cotton	NULL
swaying	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
deep	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
dimly	NULL
,	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
horror	NULL
lit	NULL
and	NULL
grew	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
paused	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
came	NULL
slowly	NULL
onward	NULL
doggedly	NULL
,	NULL
drunkenly	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
torn	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
flying	NULL
collar	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
red	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
paused	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
beyond	NULL
arm	NULL
's	NULL
-	NULL
length	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
fear-struck	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
cotton	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
shivered	NULL
and	NULL
dropped	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
pure	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
white	NULL
and	NULL
silvery	NULL
snow	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
limbs	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
hands	NULL
fell	NULL
limply	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
horror	NULL
flamed	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
wet	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
struggled	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
grated	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
hoarse	NULL
and	NULL
hard	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
quivering	NULL
throat	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL

her	NULL

went	NULL
all	NULL
a-tremble	NULL

He	NULL
stepped	NULL
forward	NULL
until	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
almost	NULL
touch	NULL
him	NULL

there	NULL
standing	NULL
straight	NULL

he	NULL
glared	NULL
down	NULL

he	NULL
whispered	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL

A	NULL
misery	NULL

her	NULL

of	NULL
this	NULL
boy	NULL
and	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
blossoming	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
beneath	NULL
her	NULL
tender	NULL
care	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
sacred	NULL
,	NULL
wonderful	NULL
history	NULL
that	NULL
revived	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL
memories	NULL
of	NULL
long-forgotten	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
above	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
vision	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
redeemed	NULL
and	NULL
enlarged	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
future	NULL
safe	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
usefulness	NULL
broadened	NULL
--	NULL
small	NULL
wonder	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
Sarah	NULL
Smith	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
in	NULL
November	NULL
almost	NULL
golden	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
things	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
wrong	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
transfer	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Tolliver	NULL
land	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
been	NULL
effected	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Tolliver	NULL
seemed	NULL
busy	NULL
or	NULL
hesitating	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
came	NULL
this	NULL
news	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
's	NULL
probable	NULL
conditions	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
here	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
Christmas	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Sarah	NULL
Smith	NULL
's	NULL
castles	NULL
lay	NULL
almost	NULL
in	NULL
ruins	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
moaned	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
fitful	NULL
sleep	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
soothed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Poor	NULL
child	NULL
!	NULL

here	NULL
too	NULL
was	NULL
work	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
strong	NULL
soul	NULL
cruelly	NULL
stricken	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
youth	NULL
.	NULL

Could	NULL
she	NULL
be	NULL
brought	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
useful	NULL
life	NULL
?	NULL

How	NULL
she	NULL
needed	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
,	NULL
clear-eyed	NULL
helper	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
crisis	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
!	NULL

Would	NULL
Zora	NULL
make	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
would	NULL
this	NULL
blow	NULL
send	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
perdition	NULL
?	NULL

Not	NULL
if	NULL
Sarah	NULL
Smith	NULL
could	NULL
save	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
resolved	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stared	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
pale	NULL
red	NULL
dawn	NULL
was	NULL
sending	NULL
its	NULL
first	NULL
rays	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
white-pillared	NULL
mansion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Cresswells	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
columns	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
lay	NULL
lazily	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
soft	NULL
white	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
delicious	NULL
languor	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
late	NULL
lingering	NULL
fall	NULL
of	NULL
Alabama	NULL
that	NULL
suited	NULL
her	NULL
perfectly	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
appointments	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
luxury	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
mansion	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
finish	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
elegance	NULL
and	NULL
staid	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
hospitality	NULL
that	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
tremendously	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
warmed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
Helen	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
moments	NULL
of	NULL
spasmodic	NULL
caring	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sick	NULL
and	NULL
afflicted	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
estate	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
better	NULL
guardian	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
philanthropies	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
than	NULL
these	NULL
same	NULL
Cresswells	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
go	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
dear	NULL
Sarah	NULL
Smith	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
really	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
prospects	NULL
seemed	NULL
most	NULL
alluring	NULL
.	NULL

Later	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Easterly	NULL
talked	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
on	NULL
routine	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
impressed	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL

with	NULL

South	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL

"	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
heard	NULL
this	NULL
delicate	NULL
flattery	NULL
complacently	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
streak	NULL
of	NULL
thrift	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wanted	NULL
her	NULL
business	NULL
capacity	NULL
recognized	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
listened	NULL
attentively	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
For	NULL
this	NULL
reason	NULL

fortunately	NULL

wise	NULL

sympathetic	NULL
advisers	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Cresswells	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
agreed	NULL
entirely	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
,	NULL
alone	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
committee	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
commission	NULL
so	NULL
seriously	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
are	NULL
to	NULL
visit	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL

she	NULL
reminded	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL

looking	NULL

watch	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
afraid	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
remark	NULL
created	NULL
mild	NULL
consternation	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
hunting	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
arisen	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Boldish	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
hoarse	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Easterly	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
over	NULL
some	NULL
plantations	NULL
with	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bocombe	NULL
was	NULL
engrossed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
novel	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Clever	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
true	NULL
to	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Finally	NULL
the	NULL
clergyman	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Bocombe	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Grey	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
started	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
Harry	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
after	NULL
lunch	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
delay	NULL
and	NULL
suppressed	NULL
excitement	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
folks	NULL
had	NULL
upset	NULL
things	NULL
considerably	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
visitors	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
rang	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
party	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
laughing	NULL
and	NULL
chatting	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
greeted	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
cordially	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Boldish	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
story	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
silence	NULL
fell	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
children	NULL
had	NULL
gathered	NULL
,	NULL
quietly	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
timidly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
distinguished	NULL
company	NULL
realized	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
that	NULL
battery	NULL
of	NULL
four	NULL
hundred	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
human	NULL
eye	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
wonderful	NULL
thing	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
simply	NULL
waits	NULL
and	NULL
watches	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
little	NULL
things	NULL
alone	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
worth	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
became	NULL
mighty	NULL
,	NULL
portentous	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Bocombe	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
note-book	NULL
and	NULL
wrote	NULL
furiously	NULL
therein	NULL
.	NULL

Dr.	NULL
Boldish	NULL
,	NULL
naturally	NULL
the	NULL
appointed	NULL
spokesman	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
helplessly	NULL
about	NULL
and	NULL
whispered	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL

With	NULL

the	NULL

sat	NULL
down	NULL
amid	NULL
a	NULL

slowly	NULL
from	NULL

rose	NULL
a	NULL

tremulously	NULL

It	NULL

almost	NULL
broke	NULL

then	NULL
swelled	NULL

such	NULL

Zora	NULL
watched	NULL
it	NULL
weighed	NULL

received	NULL
the	NULL

entered	NULL
the	NULL

Only	NULL
the	NULL

there	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
closing	NULL

He	NULL
pointed	NULL
her	NULL
carelessly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL

,	NULL
and	NULL
laying	NULL
the	NULL
cotton-check	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
desk	NULL

stood	NULL
waiting	NULL

Slowly	NULL
the	NULL
hopelessness	NULL

bitterness	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
whelming	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL

was	NULL
lost	NULL

again	NULL

she	NULL
dropped	NULL

listlessly	NULL

wearily	NULL

stood	NULL

half	NULL
conscious	NULL

the	NULL
door	NULL
opened	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Harry	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
dimly	NULL
lighted	NULL
room	NULL

She	NULL
opened	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL

Somewhere	NULL
way	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
depths	NULL

her	NULL
nature	NULL
the	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
suddenly	NULL
alive	NULL
from	NULL

Harry	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
paused	NULL
a	NULL

swept	NULL
her	NULL
full	NULL

with	NULL
his	NULL
eye	NULL

her	NULL

the	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
softly	NULL

walked	NULL
slowly	NULL
toward	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
stood	NULL
like	NULL

without	NULL

her	NULL

followed	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
steadily	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
passed	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
desk	NULL

Slowly	NULL
he	NULL
lighted	NULL
a	NULL

compared	NULL

took	NULL

pushed	NULL

back	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL

took	NULL
the	NULL

walked	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL

stolen	NULL

What	NULL
should	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
penniless	NULL

it	NULL
would	NULL

What	NULL
would	NULL
Elspeth	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL

One	NULL
never	NULL
knew	NULL

Zora	NULL
walked	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
hour	NULL
ago	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
last	NULL
blow	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
killed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
different	NULL

Into	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
despair	NULL

crept	NULL

in	NULL
one	NULL
fierce	NULL
moment	NULL

grim	NULL
determination	NULL

Somewhere	NULL

sat	NULL
a	NULL

Injustice	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
veiled	NULL
the	NULL

before	NULL
her	NULL

just	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
raised	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL

With	NULL
the	NULL
veiling	NULL

death	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
into	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL

they	NULL

some	NULL
way	NULL
up	NULL

the	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
formed	NULL
itself	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
fall	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
pit	NULL
opening	NULL

her	NULL

Somehow	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL
never	NULL

be	NULL
utterly	NULL
despicable	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL

re-kindled	NULL
love	NULL
;	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
she	NULL
placed	NULL
sadly	NULL
and	NULL
gently	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
past	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
awful	NULL
earnestness	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
future	NULL
;	NULL
struggling	NULL
blindly	NULL
,	NULL
groping	NULL
in	NULL
half	NULL
formed	NULL
plans	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
came	NULL
thus	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
where	NULL
sat	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
,	NULL
strangely	NULL
pallid	NULL
beneath	NULL
her	NULL
dusky	NULL
skin	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
lay	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL

_	NULL
Eighteen	NULL
_	NULL
THE	NULL
COTTON	NULL
CORNER	NULL
All	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL

cotton	NULL
had	NULL
foamed	NULL
in	NULL
great	NULL
white	NULL
flakes	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
sun	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL
lay	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
mighty	NULL
mantle	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
.	NULL

Black	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
mules	NULL
had	NULL
staggered	NULL
beneath	NULL
its	NULL
burden	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
deep	NULL
songs	NULL
welled	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hearts	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Fleece	NULL
was	NULL
goodly	NULL
and	NULL
gleaming	NULL
and	NULL
soft	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
men	NULL
dreamed	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
gold	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
buy	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
roads	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
lined	NULL
with	NULL
wagons	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
million	NULL
wagons	NULL
speeding	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
fro	NULL
with	NULL
straining	NULL
mules	NULL
and	NULL
laughing	NULL
black	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
bearing	NULL
bubbling	NULL
masses	NULL
of	NULL
piled	NULL
white	NULL
Fleece	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
gins	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
roaring	NULL
and	NULL
spitting	NULL
flames	NULL
and	NULL
smoke	NULL
--	NULL
fifty	NULL
thousand	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
town	NULL
and	NULL
vale	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
hoarse	NULL
iron	NULL
throats	NULL
were	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
fifteen	NULL
billion	NULL
pounds	NULL
of	NULL
white-fleeced	NULL
,	NULL
black-specked	NULL
cotton	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
whirling	NULL
saws	NULL
to	NULL
tear	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
seed	NULL
and	NULL
fling	NULL
five	NULL
thousand	NULL
million	NULL
pounds	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
silken	NULL
fibre	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
press	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
men	NULL
sang	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
dark	NULL
earth-spirits	NULL
flitting	NULL
in	NULL
twilight	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
presses	NULL
creaked	NULL
and	NULL
groaned	NULL
;	NULL
closer	NULL
and	NULL
closer	NULL
they	NULL
pressed	NULL
the	NULL
silken	NULL
fleece	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
quivered	NULL
,	NULL
trembled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
lay	NULL
cramped	NULL
,	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
massive	NULL
,	NULL
hard	NULL
,	NULL
square	NULL
bundles	NULL
,	NULL
tied	NULL
with	NULL
iron	NULL

Out	NULL
fell	NULL
the	NULL
heavy	NULL
bales	NULL
,	NULL
thousand	NULL
upon	NULL
thousand	NULL
,	NULL
million	NULL
upon	NULL
million	NULL

until	NULL
they	NULL
settled	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL

like	NULL

Colonel	NULL

looked	NULL

taking	NULL
paper	NULL

Cresswell	NULL

Taylor	NULL

one-half	NULL

clicked	NULL

machine	NULL

Cresswell	NULL
arose	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
slowly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
wide	NULL
flat	NULL
desk	NULL
where	NULL
Taylor	NULL
was	NULL
working	NULL
feverishly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
heavily	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
chair	NULL
opposite	NULL
and	NULL
tried	NULL
quietly	NULL
to	NULL
regain	NULL
his	NULL
self-control	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
liabilities	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Cresswells	NULL
already	NULL
amounted	NULL
to	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
value	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
property	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
fair	NULL
market	NULL
valuation	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
cotton	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
debts	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
falling	NULL
in	NULL
value	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
fourth	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cent	NULL
fall	NULL
meant	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
figured	NULL
it	NULL
again	NULL
tremblingly	NULL
--	NULL
meant	NULL
one	NULL
hundred	NULL
thousand	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
liabilities	NULL

If	NULL
cotton	NULL
fell	NULL
to	NULL
six	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
n't	NULL
a	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
stayed	NULL
there	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
faintness	NULL
stealing	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
beat	NULL
it	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
gulped	NULL
down	NULL
another	NULL
glass	NULL

fiery	NULL
liquor	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
protecting	NULL
instinct	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
clan	NULL
gripped	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Slowly	NULL
,	NULL
quietly	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
moved	NULL
back	NULL
until	NULL
it	NULL
grasped	NULL
the	NULL
hilt	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
start	NULL
.	NULL

Today	NULL
Mary	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
North	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
quite	NULL
forgotten	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wild	NULL
excitement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cotton	NULL
corner	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
neglected	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
the	NULL
hovering	NULL
doubt	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
really	NULL
wanted	NULL
her	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL

She	NULL

the	NULL
form	NULL

her	NULL
beauty	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
not	NULL
startling	NULL

was	NULL
young	NULL

firm	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
independence	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
associate	NULL
with	NULL
women	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
thoughts	NULL

notions	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
Southern	NULL
training	NULL
,	NULL
hardly	NULL
feminine	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
even	NULL
they	NULL
piqued	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
spurred	NULL
him	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
untrained	NULL
colt	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL

beneath	NULL

But	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
desire	NULL
her	NULL

He	NULL
rather	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL

And	NULL
if	NULL

he	NULL
must	NULL

today	NULL

perceptibly	NULL

At	NULL

poise	NULL
and	NULL
will	NULL
.	NULL

Indeed	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fine	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
aristocracy	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
term	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
heart	NULL
voiced	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pleaded	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
confusion	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
awful	NULL
doubt	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
kept	NULL
ringing	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
ears	NULL
!	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
will	NULL
marry	NULL
this	NULL
man	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
heaven	NULL
help	NULL
you	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

So	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
somehow	NULL
felt	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
speak	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
footsteps	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
filled	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
sudden	NULL
panic	NULL
.	NULL

Without	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
she	NULL
slipped	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
pillars	NULL
and	NULL
ran	NULL
down	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
oaks	NULL
and	NULL
sauntered	NULL
out	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
road	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
caught	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
flutter	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
smiled	NULL
indulgently	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
watched	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
and	NULL
lightly	NULL
puffed	NULL
his	NULL
cigarette	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
morning	NULL
was	NULL
splendid	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
first	NULL
delicious	NULL
languor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
which	NULL
breathes	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
Southland	NULL
in	NULL
February	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
filled	NULL
her	NULL
lungs	NULL
,	NULL
lifted	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
aloft	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turning	NULL
,	NULL
stepped	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
deep	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
.	NULL

Abruptly	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
subtly	NULL
changed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
closeness	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
tremor	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
brooding	NULL
terror	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
languid	NULL
sombre	NULL
winds	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
gold	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sunlight	NULL
faded	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
sickly	NULL
green	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
was	NULL
black	NULL
and	NULL
burned	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
paused	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
back	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
caught	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
silhouette	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
tall	NULL
white	NULL
pillars	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mansion	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
fled	NULL
deeper	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
forest	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
hush	NULL
of	NULL
death	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
one	NULL
great	NULL
Voice	NULL
.	NULL

Slowly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
mysteriously	NULL
it	NULL
loomed	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
squat	NULL
and	NULL
darksome	NULL
cabin	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
fitly	NULL
set	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wilderness	NULL
,	NULL
beside	NULL
its	NULL
crawling	NULL
slime	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
paused	NULL
in	NULL
sudden	NULL
certainty	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
answer	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
doubts	NULL
and	NULL
mistrust	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
impelled	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
forward	NULL
and	NULL
ask	NULL
--	NULL
what	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
still	NULL
this	NULL
war	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
bosom	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
seldom	NULL
seen	NULL
Elspeth	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
cabin	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
an	NULL
inconquerable	NULL
aversion	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
evil	NULL
hag	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shivered	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
warm	NULL
breeze	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
full	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
paused	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
step	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cabin	NULL
,	NULL
framed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
doorway	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
Zora	NULL
.	NULL

Measured	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
squat	NULL
cabin	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
in	NULL
height	NULL
colossal	NULL
;	NULL
slim	NULL
,	NULL
straight	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
pine	NULL
,	NULL
motionless	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
long	NULL
outstretched	NULL
arm	NULL
pointing	NULL
to	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
path	NULL
swept	NULL
onward	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
far	NULL
for	NULL
words	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
lay	NULL
strangely	NULL
clear	NULL
and	NULL
sharp-cut	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
mystery	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sunlight	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
that	NULL
motionless	NULL
,	NULL
fateful	NULL
figure	NULL
crouched	NULL
a	NULL
slighter	NULL
,	NULL
smaller	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
dishevelled	NULL
,	NULL
clutching	NULL
her	NULL
breast	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
bent	NULL
and	NULL
rose	NULL
--	NULL
hesitated	NULL
--	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
plead	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
turning	NULL
,	NULL
clasped	NULL
in	NULL
passionate	NULL
embrace	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
whose	NULL
head	NULL
was	NULL
hid	NULL
in	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
gown	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
instant	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
staggering	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
path	NULL
whither	NULL
Zora	NULL
pointed	NULL
.	NULL

Slowly	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
darkened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
plaintive	NULL
murmurings	NULL
pulsed	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
wood	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
oppression	NULL
and	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
redoubled	NULL
in	NULL
Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
gave	NULL
no	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stood	NULL
tall	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
golden-haired	NULL
girl	NULL
still	NULL
sobbed	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
gown	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
into	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
paused	NULL
in	NULL
awe	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
face	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
neither	NULL
the	NULL
beautifully	NULL
mischievous	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
the	NULL
pain-stricken	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
face	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
mask-like	NULL
,	NULL
regular	NULL
and	NULL
comely	NULL
;	NULL
clothed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
mighty	NULL
calm	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
subtly	NULL
,	NULL
masterfully	NULL
veiling	NULL
behind	NULL
itself	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
unfathomed	NULL
misery	NULL
and	NULL
wild	NULL
revolt	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Good-morning	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Taylor	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Mary	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
wont	NULL
to	NULL
teach	NULL
this	NULL
woman	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
lately	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
--	NULL
searched	NULL
in	NULL
vain	NULL
for	NULL
words	NULL
to	NULL
address	NULL
her	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stood	NULL
bare-haired	NULL
and	NULL
hesitating	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pale	NULL
green	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
darkened	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
fit	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
deep	NULL
groan	NULL
of	NULL
pain	NULL
should	NULL
gather	NULL
itself	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
mysterious	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
drop	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
pall	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
portal	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cabin	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
brought	NULL
Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
impulse	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
--	NULL
is	NULL
anything	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
nervously	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Elspeth	NULL
is	NULL
sick	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
replied	NULL
Zora	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
she	NULL
very	NULL
sick	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
called	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
solemnly	NULL
returned	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
was	NULL
puzzled	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Called	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
repeated	NULL
vaguely	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL

the	NULL
night	NULL

End	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
occur	NULL
to	NULL
Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
to	NULL
question	NULL
this	NULL
mysticism	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
understood	NULL
--	NULL
perhaps	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
riddle	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
melancholy	NULL
eyes	NULL
that	NULL
so	NULL
steadily	NULL
regarded	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
Zora	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
gladly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
leave	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
looks	NULL
--	NULL
evil	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
evil	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
yet	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
stay	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Zora	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
now	NULL
fixed	NULL
far	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
human	NULL
face	NULL
forming	NULL
itself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
vast	NULL
rafters	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
forest	NULL
.	NULL

Its	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
wet	NULL
with	NULL
pain	NULL
and	NULL
anger	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
child	NULL
furtively	NULL
uncovered	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
stranger	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
blue-eyed	NULL
and	NULL
golden-haired	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Whose	NULL
child	NULL
is	NULL
this	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
queried	NULL
Mary	NULL
,	NULL
curiously	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
looked	NULL
coldly	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
Bertie	NULL
's	NULL

"	NULL

Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
started	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
shock	NULL
.	NULL

Impulsively	NULL
she	NULL
moved	NULL
forward	NULL
with	NULL
hands	NULL
that	NULL
wanted	NULL

stretch	NULL
themselves	NULL
in	NULL
appeal	NULL

Zora	NULL

Zora	NULL

_	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
girl	NULL
drew	NULL
proudly	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
_	NULL
am	NULL
_	NULL
there	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
returned	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
unmistakable	NULL
simplicity	NULL
of	NULL
absolute	NULL
conviction	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
white	NULL
woman	NULL
shrank	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
wrung	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
more	NULL

to	NULL
explain	NULL

to	NULL
ask	NULL

there	NULL
came	NULL
welling	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
a	NULL
flood	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
know	NULL

But	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
again	NULL
was	NULL
masked	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

before	NULL
Mary	NULL
could	NULL
speak	NULL

"	NULL
Good-bye	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
groaning	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cabin	NULL
swallowed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
satisfied	NULL
smile	NULL

Harry	NULL
Cresswell	NULL

But	NULL

when	NULL

after	NULL
the	NULL
lapse	NULL

many	NULL
minutes	NULL

Mary	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
reappear	NULL

he	NULL
followed	NULL
her	NULL
footsteps	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL

He	NULL
frowned	NULL
as	NULL

noted	NULL
the	NULL
footprints	NULL
pointing	NULL
to	NULL
Elspeth	NULL
's	NULL
--	NULL
what	NULL
did	NULL
Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
want	NULL
there	NULL

A	NULL
fear	NULL
started	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
something	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
suddenly	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
wanted	NULL
this	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
intensely	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL

turned	NULL
Heaven	NULL

He	NULL
strode	NULL
forward	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
wood	NULL
rose	NULL
darkly	NULL
green	NULL
above	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
low	NULL
,	NULL
distant	NULL
moan	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
sound	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
breeze	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
met	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
tender	NULL
solicitude	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
beneath	NULL
hers	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL

not	NULL
from	NULL

slowly	NULL
returned	NULL

He	NULL
caught	NULL
an	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
wild	NULL
desire	NULL

a	NULL

win	NULL

At	NULL
all	NULL

glanced	NULL

My	NULL
mother	NULL
died	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
ten	NULL

left	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
tender	NULL

She	NULL
let	NULL
me	NULL
have	NULL
my	NULL
way	NULL

encouraged	NULL
the	NULL

in	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
wonder	NULL
I	NULL
escaped	NULL

ruin	NULL

Her	NULL
cabin	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
rendezvous	NULL
for	NULL
drinking	NULL

carousing	NULL

I	NULL
told	NULL
my	NULL
father	NULL

he	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
lazy	NULL
indifference	NULL

declared	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
no	NULL
worse	NULL
than	NULL
all	NULL
Negro	NULL

and	NULL
did	NULL
nothing	NULL

I	NULL
ceased	NULL
my	NULL

Still	NULL
she	NULL
tried	NULL
every	NULL

set	NULL
false	NULL

among	NULL
the	NULL
Negroes	NULL

even	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
sought	NULL

I	NULL
tell	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
appeal	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
stirred	NULL
Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
many	NULL
respects	NULL
an	NULL
inexperienced	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Harry	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
too	NULL
that	NULL
many	NULL
other	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

Moreover	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
argued	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
fair	NULL
chance	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
school-ma	NULL
'	NULL
am	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
leaped	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
teaching	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
he	NULL
needed	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
superior	NULL
person	NULL
like	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
deliberately	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL
and	NULL
lifted	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
kissed	NULL
.	NULL

Back	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL
they	NULL
wandered	NULL
,	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
Big	NULL
Road	NULL
,	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
mansion	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
steps	NULL
stood	NULL
John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
and	NULL
Helen	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
hand	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
smiled	NULL
at	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Colonel	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
smiling	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Easterly	NULL
's	NULL

he	NULL
beamed	NULL

the	NULL
stock	NULL

Cotton	NULL
Combine	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
paused	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
smile	NULL
faded	NULL
slowly	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
red	NULL
blood	NULL
mounted	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
forehead	NULL
.	NULL

Anger	NULL
struggled	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
surprise	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
before	NULL
it	NULL
burst	NULL
forth	NULL
silently	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
turned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
muttering	NULL
some	NULL
unintelligible	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
slowly	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
slammed	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
for	NULL
Harry	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
burst	NULL
,	NULL
flamed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
waned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
suddenly	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
him	NULL
dull	NULL

gray	NULL

for	NULL
Mary	NULL

her	NULL
brother	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
North	NULL

Helen	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

Outside	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
was	NULL
gusty	NULL
and	NULL
lowering	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
chill	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
paced	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
fitfully	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
happy	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
gnawed	NULL
his	NULL
mustache	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
already	NULL
his	NULL
quick	NULL
,	NULL
changeable	NULL
nature	NULL
was	NULL
feeling	NULL
the	NULL
rebound	NULL
from	NULL
glory	NULL
to	NULL
misery	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
exaltation	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
doubtful	NULL
and	NULL
uncertain	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
stooped	NULL
low	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
Yankee	NULL
school-ma	NULL
'	NULL
am	NULL
,	NULL
lower	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
stooped	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

Usually	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
played	NULL
at	NULL
loving	NULL

women	NULL
grovelled	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL

?	NULL

Would	NULL
this	NULL
woman	NULL
recognize	NULL
that	NULL
fact	NULL

respect	NULL
him	NULL
accordingly	NULL
?	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
Zora	NULL
;	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
and	NULL
hinted	NULL
to	NULL
Mary	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
wench	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
eluding	NULL
and	NULL
mocking	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
devil	NULL
!	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
pshaw	NULL
!	NULL

--	NULL
he	NULL
poured	NULL
himself	NULL
a	NULL
glass	NULL
of	NULL
brandy	NULL
--	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
rich	NULL
and	NULL
young	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
valet	NULL
knocked	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Sam	NULL
.	NULL

Cresswell	NULL
walked	NULL
thoughtfully	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
swept	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
curtain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
lowered	NULL
threateningly	NULL
;	NULL
behind	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL

was	NULL
tinged	NULL
with	NULL
blood	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
shut	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
glow	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
restless	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
devil	NULL
danced	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
veins	NULL
and	NULL
burned	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
forehead	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
hands	NULL
shook	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
rustle	NULL
of	NULL
departing	NULL
feet	NULL
beneath	NULL
his	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
a	NULL
pause	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL
halloo	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
went	NULL
downstairs	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
door	NULL
there	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
faintly	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
ululation	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
prolonged	NULL
cry	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
wild	NULL
bird	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
wail	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
mourning	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

Within	NULL
the	NULL
cabin	NULL
,	NULL
Elspeth	NULL
heard	NULL
.	NULL

Tremblingly	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
swayed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
haggard	NULL
,	NULL
awful	NULL
sight	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
motioned	NULL
Zora	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stretching	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
palms	NULL
upward	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
,	NULL
cried	NULL
with	NULL
dry	NULL
and	NULL
fear-struck	NULL
gasp	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
smiled	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
dreaming	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
red	NULL
flame	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
firelight	NULL
set	NULL
the	NULL
gold	NULL
to	NULL
dancing	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
shrank	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
shadows	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
heavy	NULL
footsteps	NULL
crashing	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
underbrush	NULL
--	NULL
coming	NULL
,	NULL
coming	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

She	NULL
shrank	NULL
still	NULL
farther	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
shadow	NULL
swept	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mighty	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
black	NULL
and	NULL
white-haired	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
bent	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
uplifting	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
stretching	NULL
his	NULL
great	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
palms	NULL
touched	NULL
the	NULL
blackened	NULL
rafters	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
started	NULL
forward	NULL
.	NULL

Thick	NULL
memories	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
forgotten	NULL
past	NULL
came	NULL
piling	NULL
in	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Where	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
known	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL

Slowly	NULL
Elspeth	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
quivering	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
unwound	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
and	NULL
snake-like	NULL
object	NULL
that	NULL
always	NULL
guarded	NULL
her	NULL
breast	NULL
.	NULL

Without	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
flew	NULL
heavenward	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
and	NULL
fearful	NULL
moan	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
woman	NULL
lurched	NULL
sideways	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
crashed	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
fallen	NULL
pine	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
hearthstone	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
lay	NULL
still	NULL
--	NULL
dead	NULL

Three	NULL
times	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
passed	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
wave-like	NULL
,	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

Three	NULL
times	NULL
he	NULL
murmured	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
burned	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
shadows	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
trembled	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
heavy	NULL
feet	NULL
crashing	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
underbrush	NULL

on	NULL

on	NULL

fainter	NULL

fainter	NULL

as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL

Zora	NULL
shook	NULL
herself	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
trance-like	NULL
horror	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
across	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
nightmare	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL

there	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
hearth	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
firelight	NULL
flashing	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL

a	NULL
bloated	NULL

hideous	NULL

twisted	NULL

distorted	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

A	NULL
moment	NULL
Zora	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
cold	NULL
body	NULL
whence	NULL
the	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
stared	NULL
death	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL

A	NULL
mighty	NULL
questioning	NULL

a	NULL

as	NULL

Zora	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
swing	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL

she	NULL
pulled	NULL
the	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL

this	NULL

he	NULL
cried	NULL

and	NULL
snatching	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sheet	NULL

dragged	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

corpse	NULL

He	NULL
shuddered	NULL

for	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL

saw	NULL
the	NULL
twisted	NULL

oozing	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
hag	NULL

blue-black	NULL
and	NULL
hideous	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
back	NULL
behind	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
a	NULL
shriek	NULL
split	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL

flame	NULL

a	NULL
great	NULL
ringing	NULL
scream	NULL

cracked	NULL

stopped	NULL

With	NULL
one	NULL

the	NULL
man	NULL
hurled	NULL
himself	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL

through	NULL
the	NULL

Panting	NULL

flashed	NULL
his	NULL

cracked	NULL

the	NULL

The	NULL

from	NULL
his	NULL

the	NULL
terror	NULL

With	NULL

in	NULL

he	NULL
tripped	NULL

shone	NULL
yellow-white	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sunlight	NULL

Many	NULL

The	NULL

the	NULL
Colonel	NULL

Freed	NULL
from	NULL

praised	NULL

his	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

in	NULL
his	NULL

Yet	NULL
today	NULL

poking	NULL

at	NULL

This	NULL

these	NULL

not	NULL

It	NULL

a	NULL

of	NULL
a	NULL

pricked	NULL
him	NULL
tenderly	NULL

it	NULL
savored	NULL
grossly	NULL
of	NULL
bargain	NULL

His	NULL
neighbors	NULL
regarded	NULL
it	NULL

They	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
an	NULL

millions	NULL
an	NULL
honor	NULL

Cresswell	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
thumped	NULL
the	NULL
nearer	NULL

vigorously	NULL

His	NULL
cane	NULL
slipped	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL

suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
lurching	NULL
forward	NULL
,	NULL
clutched	NULL
in	NULL
space	NULL

save	NULL
himself	NULL

touched	NULL
a	NULL
human	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
shadowed	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
farther	NULL
bale	NULL
,	NULL
drew	NULL
back	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
quickly	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
contact	NULL

and	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Who	NULL

"	NULL
thundered	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
angry	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL

Zora	NULL

the	NULL

"	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

He	NULL
glared	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
taller	NULL

thinner	NULL

formerly	NULL

darkly	NULL
transparent	NULL

and	NULL
her	NULL
dark	NULL
eyes	NULL
shone	NULL
in	NULL
strange	NULL

dusky	NULL
brilliance	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
indignant	NULL
and	NULL
surprised	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
lifted	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
sharply	NULL

Awaiting	NULL
no	NULL
reply	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
,	NULL
already	NULL
half	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
vehemence	NULL

stormed	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
sunlight	NULL

climbed	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
bay	NULL
mare	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Zora	NULL
still	NULL
stood	NULL
silent	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL
,	NULL
hearing	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
not	NULL
hearing	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
searching	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Way	NULL

groping	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
threads	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
seeking	NULL
almost	NULL
wildly	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
the	NULL

understanding	NULL

piteously	NULL
asking	NULL

life	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL
rose	NULL
straight	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL

narrow	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
continue	NULL
in	NULL
school	NULL
meant	NULL
charity	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
nowhere	NULL

go	NULL

nothing	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
refuse	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Cresswells	NULL
meant	NULL
trouble	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
arrest	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
work	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fields	NULL
meant	NULL
endless	NULL
toil	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
vista	NULL
that	NULL
opened	NULL
upon	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

Like	NULL
a	NULL
hunted	NULL

the	NULL
girl	NULL
turned	NULL
and	NULL
twisted	NULL
in	NULL

faced	NULL

dreamlike	NULL
without	NULL

her	NULL
shut	NULL

held	NULL
back	NULL
seething	NULL
fires	NULL
within	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
spirit	NULL
of	NULL
revolt	NULL
that	NULL
gathered	NULL

Above	NULL
all	NULL

the	NULL
memory	NULL

the	NULL

Over	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
she	NULL
whispered	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
:	NULL

what	NULL

she	NULL

she	NULL
dared	NULL

dream	NULL

One	NULL

alone	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
wild	NULL
fancy	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
Silver	NULL

Like	NULL
a	NULL
brooding	NULL
mother	NULL

Zora	NULL
had	NULL
watched	NULL
it	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL

been	NULL
cleaned	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL

how	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL

carefully	NULL
covered	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
proud	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL

how	NULL
daily	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
visitors	NULL
to	NULL

it	NULL

he	NULL
assured	NULL
them	NULL

this	NULL

it	NULL

an	NULL

When	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
(	NULL

involuntarily	NULL

she	NULL
haunted	NULL
the	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL

He	NULL
distrusted	NULL
himself	NULL

The	NULL
devil	NULL
within	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
fond	NULL
of	NULL
taking	NULL
the	NULL
bit	NULL
in	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
remember	NULL

his	NULL

one	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL

He	NULL
wanted	NULL
the	NULL

sometimes	NULL
against	NULL

within	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
walked	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
arriving	NULL
from	NULL
New	NULL
Orleans	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
curiously	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
tragic	NULL
figure	NULL
that	NULL
leaned	NULL
so	NULL
dolorously	NULL
beside	NULL
the	NULL
freight	NULL
car	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bales	NULL
were	NULL
loaded	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
express	NULL
car	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
pulled	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
hoarse	NULL
snorting	NULL
waking	NULL
vague	NULL
echoes	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
forest	NULL
beyond	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
who	NULL
stood	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
End	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
outward	NULL
to	NULL
darkness	NULL
,	NULL
those	NULL
echoes	NULL
roared	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
crack	NULL
of	NULL
doom	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
passing	NULL
band	NULL
of	NULL
contract	NULL
hands	NULL
called	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mockingly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
black	NULL
giant	NULL
,	NULL
laughing	NULL
loudly	NULL
,	NULL
gripped	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL
,	NULL
honey	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
shouted	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
you	NULL
'	NULL
se	NULL
a	NULL
'	NULL
dreaming	NULL
!	NULL

Come	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
honey	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
abruptly	NULL
and	NULL
gripped	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
drowning	NULL
grips	NULL
anything	NULL
offered	NULL
--	NULL
gripped	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
winced	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
laughed	NULL
a	NULL
loud	NULL
mirthless	NULL
laugh	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
came	NULL
pouring	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
sob	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
deep	NULL
lungs	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL
on	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
mocked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
joined	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
motley	NULL
crowd	NULL
,	NULL
ragged	NULL
,	NULL
swaggering	NULL
,	NULL
jolly	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
husky	NULL
,	NULL
big-limbed	NULL
youths	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
bold-faced	NULL
,	NULL
loud-tongued	NULL
girls	NULL
.	NULL

To-morrow	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
start	NULL
up-country	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
backwoods	NULL
barony	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
kingdom	NULL
of	NULL
cotton	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
work	NULL
till	NULL
Christmas	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Today	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
in	NULL
town	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
craftily	NULL
advanced	NULL
money	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
pockets	NULL
and	NULL
riot	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
hearts	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
gathering	NULL
twilight	NULL
they	NULL
marched	NULL
noisily	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
midst	NULL
,	NULL
wide-eyed	NULL
and	NULL
laughing	NULL
almost	NULL
hysterically	NULL
,	NULL
marched	NULL
Zora	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
meantime	NULL
rode	NULL
thoughtfully	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
town	NULL
toward	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
Oaks	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
returning	NULL
from	NULL
witnessing	NULL
the	NULL
Mardi	NULL
Gras	NULL
festivities	NULL
at	NULL
New	NULL
Orleans	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
urgent	NULL
invitation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Cresswells	NULL
had	NULL
stopped	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
might	NULL
even	NULL
stay	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
wedding	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
plans	NULL
matured	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
upset	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
French	NULL
maid	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
depended	NULL
absolutely	NULL
for	NULL
five	NULL
years	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
a	NULL
colored	NULL
maid	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
the	NULL
Cresswells	NULL
,	NULL
laughingly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
drove	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
have	NULL
sweet	NULL
voices	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
ca	NULL
n't	NULL
doff	NULL
their	NULL
uniform	NULL
.	NULL

Helene	NULL
without	NULL
her	NULL
cap	NULL
and	NULL
apron	NULL
was	NULL
often	NULL
mistaken	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
lady	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
New	NULL
Orleans	NULL
a	NULL
French	NULL
confectioner	NULL
married	NULL
her	NULL
under	NULL
some	NULL
such	NULL
delusion	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
about	NULL
here	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
declared	NULL
Harry	NULL
decisively	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
ask	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
colored	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

Again	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
laughed	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
after	NULL
tea	NULL
she	NULL
wandered	NULL
idly	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
was	NULL
crimsoning	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
strolled	NULL
alone	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
Sarah	NULL
Smith	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
cordiality	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL
's	NULL
greeting	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
caller	NULL
's	NULL
errand	NULL
her	NULL
attention	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
arrested	NULL
and	NULL
held	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
interests	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
charges	NULL
were	NULL
always	NULL
uppermost	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ca	NULL
n't	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
Zora	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
inquired	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
started	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
Zora	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL
instant	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
later	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
momentarily	NULL
expecting	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
tall	NULL
form	NULL
moving	NULL
languidly	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
walk	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
gave	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
a	NULL
searching	NULL
look	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
glanced	NULL
involuntarily	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
gown	NULL
and	NULL
smiled	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Could	NULL
I	NULL
trust	NULL
you	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
human	NULL
soul	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
asked	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
abruptly	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
half	NULL
mocking	NULL
answer	NULL
that	NULL
rose	NULL
involuntarily	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
was	NULL
checked	NULL
.	NULL

Within	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
puzzled	NULL
at	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
girl	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
human	NULL
interest	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
first	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
this	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
would	NULL
she	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
maid	NULL
?	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
dangerous	NULL
experiment	NULL
?	NULL

Why	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
certainly	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
intended	NULL
to	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
continued	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Here	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
in	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
fountains	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
deep	NULL
are	NULL
suddenly	NULL
broken	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
peace	NULL
and	NULL
care	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
find	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
is	NULL
strong	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
here	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
peace	NULL
.	NULL

Slavery	NULL
of	NULL
soul	NULL
and	NULL
body	NULL
awaits	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
powerless	NULL
to	NULL
protect	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
going	NULL
away	NULL
may	NULL
make	NULL
or	NULL
ruin	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knows	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
working	NULL
for	NULL
wages	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
has	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
servant	NULL
's	NULL
humility	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
has	NULL
loyalty	NULL
and	NULL
pluck	NULL

For	NULL
one	NULL
she	NULL
loves	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
nothing	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
do	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
driven	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
rather	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
is	NULL
driven	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
rouse	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
devil	NULL
incarnate	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
needs	NULL
not	NULL
exactly	NULL
affection	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
almost	NULL
resent	NULL
that	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
intelligent	NULL
interest	NULL
and	NULL
care	NULL

In	NULL
return	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
she	NULL
will	NULL
gradually	NULL
learn	NULL
to	NULL
serve	NULL
and	NULL
serve	NULL
loyally	NULL

Frankly	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
chosen	NULL
you	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
task	NULL

Indeed	NULL

God	NULL

you	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL

I	NULL

quietly	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
had	NULL
hardly	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
Oaks	NULL
before	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
was	NULL
driving	NULL
toward	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
small	NULL
cabin	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
's	NULL
ragged	NULL
fringe	NULL
was	NULL
crowded	NULL
to	NULL
suffocation	NULL
.	NULL

Within	NULL
arose	NULL
noisy	NULL
shouts	NULL
,	NULL
loud	NULL
songs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
raucous	NULL
laughter	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
scraping	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fiddle	NULL
and	NULL
whine	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
accordion	NULL
.	NULL

Liquor	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
appear	NULL
and	NULL
happy	NULL
faces	NULL
grew	NULL
red-eyed	NULL
and	NULL
sodden	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
dances	NULL
whirled	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
orgy	NULL
stood	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
wild-eyed	NULL
and	NULL
bewildered	NULL
,	NULL
mad	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
that	NULL
gripped	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
hammered	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL

crying	NULL

the	NULL
frenzied	NULL
music	NULL

Abruptly	NULL
she	NULL
recognized	NULL
a	NULL
face	NULL
despite	NULL
the	NULL
wreck	NULL
and	NULL
ruin	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Bertie	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
cried	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
seized	NULL
the	NULL
mother	NULL

little	NULL

by	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
Zora	NULL
sprang	NULL
forward	NULL
and	NULL
seized	NULL
the	NULL
burning	NULL
liquid	NULL
in	NULL
both	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
dozen	NULL
hands	NULL
clapped	NULL
a	NULL
devil	NULL
's	NULL
tattoo	NULL

A	NULL
score	NULL
of	NULL
voices	NULL
yelled	NULL

laughed	NULL

The	NULL
shriek	NULL
of	NULL

drowned	NULL
beneath	NULL

stamping	NULL

above	NULL

Zora	NULL

she	NULL
glided	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL

the	NULL

tip-toed	NULL
with	NULL
skirts	NULL

the	NULL
liquor	NULL

her	NULL
lips	NULL

paused	NULL

looked	NULL
into	NULL

A	NULL
silence	NULL

like	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL

Zora	NULL

THE	NULL
MARRIAGE	NULL
MORNING	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
watched	NULL
Zora	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
path	NULL
beneath	NULL
the	NULL
oaks	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
walks	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
observed	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
laying	NULL
aside	NULL
her	NULL
book	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
waited	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
marked	NULL
curiosity	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
greeting	NULL
was	NULL
brief	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
curt	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
unintentionally	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
easily	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
lurked	NULL
an	NULL
impatient	NULL
hunger	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
greetings	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
murmured	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
straight	NULL
and	NULL
tall	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
squarely	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
something	NULL
strange	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
new	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
very	NULL
old	NULL
--	NULL
stirred	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
her	NULL
stood	NULL
this	NULL
tall	NULL
black	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
quietly	NULL
returning	NULL
her	NULL
look	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
judged	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
weighed	NULL
,	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
arose	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL
an	NULL
impulse	NULL
to	NULL
self-justification	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
smiled	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
sweetly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Wo	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
sit	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
despite	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
seemed	NULL
leaping	NULL
backward	NULL
a	NULL
thousand	NULL
years	NULL
;	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
simpler	NULL
,	NULL
primal	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
frail	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fettered	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
dusky	NULL
magnificence	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
bejewelled	NULL
barbarian	NULL
queen	NULL
and	NULL
sought	NULL
to	NULL
justify	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
shook	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
phantasy	NULL
,	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
how	NULL
well	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
stood	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
stand	NULL
still	NULL
and	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Please	NULL
sit	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
repeated	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
softest	NULL
charm	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
dreaming	NULL
that	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
white	NULL
persons	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
ask	NULL
this	NULL
girl	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
presence	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
even	NULL
this	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
move	NULL
Zora	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
walking	NULL
,	NULL
standing	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
simple	NULL
directness	NULL
which	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
sensed	NULL
and	NULL
met	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
need	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
me	NULL

to	NULL
do	NULL
my	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
serve	NULL
my	NULL
coffee	NULL

and	NULL
dress	NULL

take	NULL
care	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
work	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
hard	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
can	NULL
travel	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL

live	NULL
well	NULL

Would	NULL
you	NULL
like	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
returned	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
slowly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
rapidly	NULL
--	NULL
Was	NULL
this	NULL
the	NULL
Way	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
sounded	NULL
wonderful	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
World	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
mysterious	NULL
World	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
stretched	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
and	NULL
into	NULL
which	NULL
Bles	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
--	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
lead	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Way	NULL
?	NULL

But	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
there	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
she	NULL
see	NULL
and	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
as	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
pictured	NULL
?	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
like	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
asked	NULL
Zora	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
smiled	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
meant	NULL
great	NULL
active	NULL
cities	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
back	NULL

it	NULL
all	NULL

what	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
really	NULL

What	NULL
does	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Heavens	NULL
,	NULL
child	NULL
!	NULL

Do	NULL
n't	NULL
ask	NULL

Really	NULL

it	NULL

worth	NULL

peering	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL

sure	NULL

be	NULL
disappointed	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
what	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
seeing	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
must	NULL
live	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
why	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
happy	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
answered	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
,	NULL
amused	NULL
,	NULL
baffled	NULL
,	NULL
spurred	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
being	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
chronic	NULL
_	NULL
ennui	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL
happy	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
retorted	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
her	NULL
over	NULL
carefully	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
silken	NULL
stockings	NULL
to	NULL
garden	NULL
hat	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
laid	NULL
aside	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
mockery	NULL
and	NULL
met	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
bravely	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
replied	NULL
simply	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
eyes	NULL
grew	NULL
old	NULL
and	NULL
tired	NULL
.	NULL

Involuntarily	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
hand	NULL
crept	NULL
out	NULL
protectingly	NULL
and	NULL
lay	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
jewelled	NULL
fingers	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
quickly	NULL
recovering	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
started	NULL
hastily	NULL
to	NULL
withdraw	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
fingers	NULL
closed	NULL
around	NULL
the	NULL
darker	NULL
ones	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
became	NULL
dim	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
need	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
the	NULL
half-formed	NULL
question	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
need	NULL
me	NULL
;	NULL
we	NULL
need	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
lies	NULL
opportunity	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
help	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Zora	NULL
rose	NULL
abruptly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
feared	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
tightening	NULL
of	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
this	NULL
strangely	NULL
alluring	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
come	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Zora	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
lunch	NULL
,	NULL
reaction	NULL
and	NULL
lingering	NULL
doubts	NULL
came	NULL
trouping	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
replace	NULL
the	NULL
daintiest	NULL
of	NULL
trained	NULL
experts	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
baffling	NULL
semi-barbarian	NULL
,	NULL
well	NULL
!	NULL

"	NULL
Have	NULL
you	NULL
hired	NULL
a	NULL
maid	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
asked	NULL
Helen	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
engaged	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
laughed	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
,	NULL
lightly	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
wondering	NULL
whether	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
jewel	NULL
or	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
elephant	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Probably	NULL
neither	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
remarked	NULL
Harry	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
,	NULL
drily	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
avoided	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
's	NULL
inquiring	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
morning	NULL
Zora	NULL
came	NULL
easily	NULL
into	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
's	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
duties	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
learn	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
deftness	NULL
and	NULL
divination	NULL
almost	NULL
startling	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
quietness	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
quickness	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
young	NULL
strength	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
soothing	NULL
balm	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tired	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
sunk	NULL
back	NULL
contentedly	NULL
into	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
strong	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
jewel	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
decided	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
this	NULL
verdict	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
agreed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
servants	NULL
waited	NULL
on	NULL
"	NULL
Miss	NULL
Zora	NULL
"	NULL
gladly	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
scarcely	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
ladies	NULL
ran	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
help	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
sorts	NULL
.	NULL

Harry	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
this	NULL
transformation	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
amused	NULL
smile	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
simply	NULL
evidence	NULL
of	NULL
dangerous	NULL
obstinacy	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
girl	NULL
who	NULL
hitherto	NULL
had	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
express	NULL
package	NULL
was	NULL
received	NULL
from	NULL
John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
.	NULL

Its	NULL
unwrapping	NULL
brought	NULL
a	NULL
cry	NULL
of	NULL
pleasure	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
ladies	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
lay	NULL
a	NULL
bolt	NULL
of	NULL
silken-like	NULL
cambric	NULL
of	NULL
wondrous	NULL
fineness	NULL
and	NULL
lustre	NULL
,	NULL
marked	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
For	NULL
the	NULL
wedding-dress	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
explanation	NULL
accompanied	NULL
the	NULL
package	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
similar	NULL
piece	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
North	NULL
.	NULL

Helen	NULL
and	NULL
Harry	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cablegram	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Paris	NULL
tailor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Helen	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
steps	NULL
toward	NULL
having	NULL
the	NULL
cambric	NULL
dress	NULL
made	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
wedding	NULL
invitations	NULL
appeared	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
A	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
married	NULL
in	NULL
cotton	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

Helen	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
in	NULL
tears	NULL
lest	NULL
the	NULL
Paris	NULL
gown	NULL
be	NULL
delayed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sure	NULL
enough	NULL
a	NULL
cablegram	NULL
came	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
likelihood	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
gown	NULL
being	NULL
ready	NULL
by	NULL
Easter	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
shipped	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
earliest	NULL
convenience	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
catch	NULL
the	NULL
necessary	NULL
boat	NULL
.	NULL

Helen	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
cry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
wild	NULL
rush	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
's	NULL
cloth	NULL
ready	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
Helen	NULL
was	NULL
querulous	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
silk	NULL
embroidery	NULL
must	NULL
embellish	NULL
the	NULL
skirt	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dressmaker	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
despair	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
spare	NULL
worker	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
declared	NULL
.	NULL

Helen	NULL
was	NULL
appealing	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
asked	NULL
the	NULL
dressmaker	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
satisfied	NULL
nod	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Show	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dressmaker	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
rebellion	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Zora	NULL
sews	NULL
beautifully	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
added	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
cloth	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
spread	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
glossy	NULL
cloud	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
trembled	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
beauty	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
vague	NULL
inner	NULL
yearning	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
some	NULL
subtle	NULL
magic	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
woven	NULL
web	NULL
were	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
its	NULL
story	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
worked	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
faithfully	NULL
and	NULL
lovingly	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
spare	NULL
hour	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
long	NULL
nights	NULL
of	NULL
dreaming	NULL
.	NULL

Wilfully	NULL
she	NULL
departed	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
set	NULL
pattern	NULL
and	NULL
sewed	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
cloth	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
new	NULL
and	NULL
intricate	NULL
ways	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
soft	NULL
shadowings	NULL
and	NULL
coverings	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
wove	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
white	NULL
veil	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
strange	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
watched	NULL
her	NULL
curiously	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

Meantime	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
arranged	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
double	NULL
wedding	NULL
at	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
Oaks	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
John	NULL
and	NULL
Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
suitable	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
brides	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
forth	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
mansion	NULL
.	NULL

Accordingly	NULL
the	NULL
Taylors	NULL
arrived	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
wedding	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
home	NULL
took	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
festive	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
expanded	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
genial	NULL
influences	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
still	NULL
protested	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
respect	NULL
John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
's	NULL
undoubted	NULL
ability	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
lovely	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
assumption	NULL
of	NULL
cleverness	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
approve	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
scenes	NULL
with	NULL
mingled	NULL
feelings	NULL
.	NULL

Especially	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
startled	NULL
at	NULL
seeing	NULL
Zora	NULL
a	NULL
member	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
household	NULL
and	NULL
apparently	NULL
high	NULL
in	NULL
favor	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
brought	NULL
back	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
uneasiness	NULL
and	NULL
suspicion	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
she	NULL
soon	NULL
forgot	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
cadence	NULL
of	NULL
Harry	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
's	NULL
pleasant	NULL
voice	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
caressing	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
handsomer	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
sleep	NULL
and	NULL
temperance	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
wooing	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
a	NULL
tinge	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
marble	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
smoothed	NULL
the	NULL
puffs	NULL
beneath	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
distinguished	NULL
bearing	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
firmer	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Mary	NULL
Taylor	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
differently	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
money	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
planning	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
pet	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
extraordinarily	NULL
precious	NULL
and	NULL
valuable	NULL
.	NULL

Taylor	NULL
eagerly	NULL
inquired	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
cloth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
followed	NULL
the	NULL
ladies	NULL
to	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
adjoining	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
lay	NULL
uncut	NULL
and	NULL
shimmering	NULL
,	NULL
covered	NULL
with	NULL
dim	NULL
silken	NULL
tracery	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
delicacy	NULL
and	NULL
beauty	NULL
which	NULL
brought	NULL
an	NULL
exclamation	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
's	NULL
what	NULL
we	NULL
can	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
Alabama	NULL
cotton	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
cried	NULL
John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
in	NULL
triumph	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
incredulously	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
"	NULL
No	NULL
'	NULL

about	NULL

the	NULL
two	NULL
bales	NULL

me	NULL

woven	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
silk	NULL
woof	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
particularly	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
Zora	NULL
had	NULL
hastily	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
done	NULL

an	NULL

I	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
chuckled	NULL
gayly	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Zora	NULL
was	NULL
striding	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
halls	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
blood	NULL
surging	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
ears	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
gone	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
doors	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
dropped	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
knees	NULL
and	NULL
buried	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
filmy	NULL
folds	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL

I	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
whispered	NULL
in	NULL
mingled	NULL
tears	NULL
and	NULL
joy	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
called	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL

"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
talisman	NULL
new-found	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
love	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
stolen	NULL
dream	NULL
come	NULL
true	NULL

Now	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
face	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
;	NULL
God	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
it	NULL
straight	NULL
again	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
and	NULL
find	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
Love	NULL

but	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
greater	NULL

Outside	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
came	NULL
voices	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
dressmaker	NULL
's	NULL
tones	NULL

Helen	NULL
's	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL

accents	NULL

Her	NULL
face	NULL
went	NULL
suddenly	NULL
gray	NULL

The	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
hers	NULL
!	NULL

It	NULL
belonged	NULL
--	NULL
She	NULL
rose	NULL
hastily	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
door	NULL
opened	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
cutting	NULL
must	NULL
begin	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL

they	NULL
all	NULL
agreed	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
it	NULL

Zora	NULL

"	NULL
inquired	NULL
Helen	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

Zora	NULL
quietly	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
not	NULL

tomorrow	NULL

early	NULL

"	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
alone	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
considered	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
lunch	NULL

she	NULL
folded	NULL
the	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL
carefully	NULL

locked	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
new	NULL
trunk	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
hide	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
she	NULL
sent	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL

oil-cloth	NULL

bade	NULL
the	NULL

Miss	NULL

make	NULL
a	NULL
cedar	NULL
box	NULL

tight	NULL

tarred	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
she	NULL
prepared	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
's	NULL
breakfast	NULL
with	NULL
unusual	NULL
care	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
sorry	NULL
for	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL

and	NULL
sorry	NULL
for	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL

understand	NULL

What	NULL
would	NULL
happen	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL

she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL
had	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
buried	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
whence	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
alternative	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
keep	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
wait	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
dressmaker	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
her	NULL
step	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
stair	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
Harry	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
's	NULL
buggy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
scurrying	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
door	NULL

On	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
dressmaker	NULL
's	NULL
footsteps	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
her	NULL
door	NULL
was	NULL
unceremoniously	NULL
burst	NULL
open	NULL

Helen	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
stood	NULL
there	NULL
radiant	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
dressmaker	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
wreathed	NULL
in	NULL
smiles	NULL

She	NULL
carried	NULL
a	NULL
big	NULL
red-sealed	NULL
bundle	NULL

"	NULL
Zora	NULL

"	NULL
cried	NULL
Helen	NULL
in	NULL
ecstasy	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

"	NULL

Zora	NULL
regarded	NULL
her	NULL
coldly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
at	NULL
bay	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dressmaker	NULL
was	NULL
ripping	NULL
and	NULL
snipping	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
there	NULL
lay	NULL
revealed	NULL
before	NULL
them	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
Paris	NULL
gown	NULL

Helen	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
raptures	NULL

but	NULL
her	NULL
conscience	NULL
pricked	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ought	NULL
I	NULL

You	NULL

look	NULL
miserably	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
dressmaker	NULL
was	NULL
voluble	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
Helen	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL

and	NULL
so	NULL
forth	NULL
.	NULL

Helen	NULL
pursed	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
and	NULL
petulantly	NULL
tapped	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
foot	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL

"	NULL
Where	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL

asked	NULL
the	NULL
dressmaker	NULL

looking	NULL
about	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
Helen	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
dislike	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
declared	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
besides	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
n't	NULL
room	NULL

"	NULL

Of	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
she	NULL
leaned	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
whispered	NULL
to	NULL
Zora	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Zora	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL

And	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
Zora	NULL
seemed	NULL
no	NULL
surprise	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
Way	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
opening	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
talisman	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
trunk	NULL

So	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
Easter	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
golden	NULL
with	NULL
jasmine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
crimson	NULL
with	NULL
azalea	NULL
;	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darker	NULL
places	NULL
gleamed	NULL
the	NULL
misty	NULL
glory	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dogwood	NULL
;	NULL
new	NULL
cotton	NULL
shook	NULL
,	NULL
glimmered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
blossomed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
fields	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
soft	NULL
Southern	NULL
sun	NULL
poured	NULL
its	NULL
awakening	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
happiness	NULL
and	NULL
hope	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cabins	NULL

hope	NULL

--	NULL
if	NULL

happiness	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

Zora	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
forgetting	NULL
the	NULL
wedding	NULL

stood	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
mirror	NULL
.	NULL

Laying	NULL
aside	NULL
her	NULL
dress	NULL

she	NULL
draped	NULL
her	NULL
shimmering	NULL
cloth	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL

dragging	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
mass	NULL
over	NULL
ears	NULL
and	NULL
neck	NULL
until	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL
bride	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
awed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
mystical	NULL
union	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
dead	NULL
love	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
living	NULL
new	NULL
born	NULL
self	NULL

there	NULL
came	NULL
drifting	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL

faintly	NULL

the	NULL
soft	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
far-off	NULL

'T	NULL

Two	NULL
white	NULL

white-swathed	NULL

were	NULL
coming	NULL
slowly	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
staircase	NULL
of	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
Oaks	NULL

and	NULL
two	NULL
white	NULL
and	NULL
black-clothed	NULL
bridegrooms	NULL
awaited	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Either	NULL

looked	NULL
gladly	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

his	NULL
sister	NULL

almost	NULL
darkly	NULL
at	NULL

Up	NULL
floated	NULL
the	NULL
song	NULL

Zora	NULL
listened	NULL

_	NULL
Twenty-two	NULL

MISS	NULL
CAROLINE	NULL
WYNN	NULL
Bles	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
was	NULL
seated	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
anteroom	NULL
of	NULL
Senator	NULL
Smith	NULL
's	NULL
office	NULL
in	NULL
Washington	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL

had	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL

there	NULL
were	NULL
others	NULL
waiting	NULL

too	NULL

The	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
corner	NULL
,	NULL
dreaming	NULL
.	NULL

Washington	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
great	NULL
city	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
never-ending	NULL
delight	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL

the	NULL
buildings	NULL

the	NULL
crowds	NULL

the	NULL
shops	NULL

and	NULL
lights	NULL

and	NULL
noise	NULL

the	NULL
kaleidoscopic	NULL

the	NULL
myriad	NULL
forms	NULL
and	NULL
faces	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
talk	NULL
and	NULL
laughter	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
wonderful	NULL
magic	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
boy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
stretched	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
and	NULL
filled	NULL
his	NULL
lungs	NULL
and	NULL
cried	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Here	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
live	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

Especially	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
attracted	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
people	NULL

They	NULL
seemed	NULL
transformed	NULL

revivified	NULL

Some	NULL

be	NULL
mistaken	NULL
for	NULL
field	NULL
hands	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
holiday	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
many	NULL

Others	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
recognize	NULL

they	NULL
seemed	NULL
strange	NULL

alien	NULL
--	NULL
sharper	NULL

quicker	NULL

at	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
yet	NULL
others	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
Bles	NULL
stood	NULL
straighter	NULL
and	NULL
breathed	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
well	NULL
dressed	NULL

and	NULL
well	NULL
appearing	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
walked	NULL
upright	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seemed	NULL
like	NULL
persons	NULL
of	NULL
affairs	NULL

money	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
arrived	NULL
--	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
men	NULL

they	NULL
filled	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
's	NULL
ideal	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
like	NULL
going	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
grasping	NULL
their	NULL
hands	NULL

saying	NULL

Continually	NULL
such	NULL

through	NULL

they	NULL
were	NULL
rioting	NULL

it	NULL
again	NULL

You	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
Senator	NULL
rose	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
is	NULL
my	NULL
sister	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
absently	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
worried	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
hopeful	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
endowment	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
left	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
Senator	NULL
held	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
;	NULL
Bles	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
remembered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
beg	NULL
pardon	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
wanted	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
on	NULL
another	NULL
matter	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
Senator	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
a	NULL
school-teacher	NULL
,	NULL
Senator	NULL
Smith	NULL

like	NULL
all	NULL

rest	NULL

deeply	NULL
interested	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
you	NULL

the	NULL
district	NULL

those	NULL
things	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
Senator	NULL
hastily	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
believe	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
abolishing	NULL
the	NULL
school-board	NULL

concentrating	NULL
power	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
superintendent	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Precisely	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
I	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
you	NULL

Senator	NULL

that	NULL
the	NULL
interests	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
back	NULL

"	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
extracted	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
reticule	NULL
a	NULL
typewritten	NULL
paper	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
and	NULL
read	NULL
it	NULL
intently	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
keenly	NULL
scrutinized	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
steadily	NULL
returned	NULL
his	NULL
regard	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
am	NULL
I	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
this	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Follow	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
mused	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Where	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL
get	NULL
these	NULL
facts	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
suddenly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
smiled	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
hardly	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
persisted	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
if	NULL
I	NULL
were	NULL
sure	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
source	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
know	NULL
my	NULL

better	NULL

--	NULL
my	NULL
obligation	NULL

you	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
greater	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
laughed	NULL
and	NULL
glanced	NULL
toward	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
moved	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
earshot	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
waiting	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
a	NULL
teacher	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
M	NULL
Street	NULL
High	NULL
School	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
we	NULL
have	NULL
some	NULL
intelligent	NULL
boys	NULL
there	NULL
who	NULL
work	NULL
their	NULL
way	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
Senator	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Some	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
continued	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
,	NULL
tapping	NULL
her	NULL
boot	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
carpet	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
some	NULL
--	NULL
wait	NULL
on	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
Senator	NULL
slowly	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
can	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
If	NULL
Judge	NULL
Haynes	NULL
is	NULL
reappointed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
school-board	NULL
I	NULL

teach	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
M	NULL
Street	NULL
High	NULL
School	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
slowly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Senator	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
memorandum	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
not	NULL
forget	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
--	NULL
nor	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL

"	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
bowed	NULL
,	NULL
glancing	NULL
at	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
woman	NULL
contemplated	NULL
Bles	NULL
in	NULL
momentary	NULL
perplexity	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
bowing	NULL
in	NULL
turn	NULL
,	NULL
left	NULL
.	NULL

Bles	NULL
followed	NULL
,	NULL
debating	NULL
just	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
far	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
venture	NULL
to	NULL
accompany	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
easily	NULL
settled	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thank	NULL
you	NULL
--	NULL
good-bye	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
briefly	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

Bles	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
whether	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
relieved	NULL
or	NULL
provoked	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
disappointed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
compromise	NULL
felt	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
three	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
received	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
appointment	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
clerkship	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Treasury	NULL
Department	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
salary	NULL
of	NULL
nine	NULL
hundred	NULL
dollars	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sum	NULL
seemed	NULL
fabulous	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
seventh	NULL
heaven	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
many	NULL
days	NULL
the	NULL
consciousness	NULL
of	NULL
wealth	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
duties	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
scenes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
life	NULL
kept	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
busy	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
planned	NULL
to	NULL
study	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
arranged	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
professor	NULL
at	NULL
Howard	NULL
University	NULL
to	NULL
guide	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
bought	NULL
an	NULL
armful	NULL
of	NULL
books	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
desk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
plunged	NULL
desperately	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

Gradually	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
routine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hours	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
weary	NULL
of	NULL
study	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
time	NULL
hanging	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
heavily	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
;	NULL
indeed	NULL
--	NULL
although	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
acknowledge	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
lonesome	NULL
,	NULL
homesick	NULL
,	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
myriad	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
busy	NULL
city	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
argued	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
absurd	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
longing	NULL
for	NULL
human	NULL
companionship	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
fellowship	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
dilemma	NULL
:	NULL
those	NULL
black	NULL
folk	NULL
in	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
recognized	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
sweet-tempered	NULL
Negro	NULL
traits	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
also	NULL
looser	NULL
,	NULL
uglier	NULL
manners	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
shrank	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
upper	NULL
classes	NULL
of	NULL
Negroes	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
still	NULL
observed	NULL
from	NULL
afar	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
strangers	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
but	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
coldness	NULL
and	NULL
aloofness	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
them	NULL
cease	NULL
to	NULL
seem	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
kind	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
seemed	NULL
almost	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
like	NULL
black	NULL
white	NULL
people	NULL
--	NULL
strangers	NULL
in	NULL
way	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
shake	NULL
off	NULL
this	NULL
feeling	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
clung	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
in	NULL
sheer	NULL
desperation	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
night	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
fellow	NULL
clerk	NULL
who	NULL
rather	NULL
boasted	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
people	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
soon	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
strange	NULL
company	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
a	NULL
newcomer	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
doorway	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
,	NULL
hello	NULL
,	NULL
Sam	NULL
!	NULL

Sam	NULL
Stillings	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
delightedly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
soon	NULL
grasping	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
slim	NULL
,	NULL
well-dressed	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
perhaps	NULL
thirty	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
yellow	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
curling	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shifting	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

of	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL

Bles	NULL
--	NULL

ah	NULL
--	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
!	NULL

Thought	NULL
you	NULL
were	NULL
hoeing	NULL
cotton	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Bles	NULL
laughed	NULL
and	NULL
continued	NULL
shaking	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
foolishly	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
former	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
butler	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
but	NULL
slightly	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
face	NULL
brought	NULL
back	NULL
unuttered	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
faster	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
yearning	NULL
surge	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
Chicago	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
cried	NULL
Bles	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
goin	NULL
'	NULL
into	NULL
politics	NULL
--	NULL
having	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL

field	NULL

I	NULL
came	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
you	NULL
graduated	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Bless	NULL
admitted	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
sadly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
coming	NULL
north	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
Senator	NULL
Smith	NULL
's	NULL
influence	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
how	NULL
are	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Abruptly	NULL
Sam	NULL
hooked	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
into	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
's	NULL
and	NULL
pulled	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

Stillings	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
type	NULL
.	NULL

Up	NULL
from	NULL
servility	NULL
and	NULL
menial	NULL
service	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
struggling	NULL
to	NULL
climb	NULL
to	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
power	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
shrewd	NULL
,	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
stoop	NULL
to	NULL
anything	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
win	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
very	NULL
slights	NULL
and	NULL
humiliations	NULL
of	NULL
prejudice	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
advantage	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
learned	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
particulars	NULL
of	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
's	NULL
visit	NULL
to	NULL
Senator	NULL
Smith	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
cordial	NULL
reception	NULL
he	NULL
judged	NULL
it	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
in	NULL
touch	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
forthwith	NULL
invited	NULL
Bles	NULL
to	NULL
accompany	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
night	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Fifteenth	NULL
Street	NULL
Presbyterian	NULL
Church	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
'll	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
people	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
aristocracy	NULL

The	NULL
Treble	NULL

a	NULL
concert	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
everybody	NULL
that	NULL
's	NULL
anybody	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
met	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
following	NULL
evening	NULL
and	NULL
proceeded	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
simple	NULL
but	NULL
pleasant	NULL
auditorium	NULL
,	NULL
nearly	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
well-dressed	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
programme	NULL
Bles	NULL
applauded	NULL
vociferously	NULL
every	NULL
number	NULL
that	NULL
pleased	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
stamped	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
realized	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
attracting	NULL
considerable	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
entertainment	NULL
straightway	NULL
lost	NULL
all	NULL
its	NULL
charm	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
painfully	NULL
embarrassed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
remainder	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
was	NULL
awkwardly	NULL
self-conscious	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
audience	NULL
rose	NULL
leisurely	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
little	NULL
knots	NULL
and	NULL
eddies	NULL
,	NULL
laughing	NULL
and	NULL
talking	NULL
;	NULL
many	NULL
moved	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
singers	NULL
and	NULL
players	NULL
,	NULL
Stillings	NULL
stepped	NULL
aside	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Bles	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
miserably	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
man	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
white-faced	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
slightly	NULL
curling	NULL
close	NULL
gray	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
high-bred	NULL
ascetic	NULL
countenance	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
are	NULL
a	NULL
stranger	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
pleasantly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Bles	NULL
liked	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
fell	NULL
to	NULL
talking	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
pastor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
you	NULL

Bles	NULL
turned	NULL

She	NULL

him	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL

slowly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
smiled	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
uttered	NULL
twice	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
difference	NULL
cadence	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
amusement	NULL
lurked	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eye	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
quietly	NULL
presented	NULL
Bles	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Stillings	NULL
hovered	NULL
unnoticed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

"	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Teerswell	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Teerswell	NULL
was	NULL
handsome	NULL
and	NULL
indolent	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
indecision	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
cynical	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
Bles	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
subtle	NULL
antagonism	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
group	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
intruder	NULL
.	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Teerswell	NULL
nodded	NULL
easily	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
continuing	NULL
his	NULL
conversation	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
ladies	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
was	NULL
perverse	NULL
and	NULL
interrupted	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
you	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
the	NULL
concert	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
ladies	NULL
rippled	NULL
audibly	NULL
.	NULL

Bles	NULL
darkened	NULL
painfully	NULL
,	NULL
realizing	NULL
that	NULL
these	NULL
people	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
just	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
answered	NULL
frankly	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
immensely	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
hope	NULL

"	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Teerswell	NULL
,	NULL
compelled	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL

laughed	NULL
drily	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Plantation	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
cadence	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Bles	NULL
simply	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
slight	NULL
pause	NULL
ensued	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
surprise	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
for	NULL
Bles	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
his	NULL
inexperienced	NULL
eye	NULL
could	NULL
discern	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
popular	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
rivals	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
attentions	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
graciously	NULL
,	NULL
rising	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
going	NULL

all	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
called	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
bowed	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Teerswell	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
placed	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
lightly	NULL
on	NULL
Bles	NULL
's	NULL
arm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
paused	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
thrill	NULL
ran	NULL
through	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
weight	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
beautiful	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
warm	NULL
quiver	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
body	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
awoke	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
lighted	NULL
church	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
moving	NULL
,	NULL
well-dressed	NULL
throng	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
small	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
well-gloved	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
somehow	NULL
the	NULL
fancy	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
sympathetic	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
touch	NULL

Twenty-three	NULL

THE	NULL
TRAINING	NULL
OF	NULL
ZORA	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
large	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
remarked	NULL
Zora	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
flew	NULL
east	NULL
and	NULL
northward	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
New	NULL
York-New	NULL
Orleans	NULL
limited	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
herself	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sheer	NULL
delight	NULL
of	NULL
motion	NULL
.	NULL

Gazing	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
compared	NULL
the	NULL
lands	NULL
she	NULL
passed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
lands	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
:	NULL
noting	NULL
the	NULL
formation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cotton	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
and	NULL
growth	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
roads	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
comparisons	NULL
became	NULL
infinite	NULL
,	NULL
endless	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
stretched	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
until	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
mere	NULL
distance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
suddenly	NULL
realized	NULL
how	NULL
vast	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
and	NULL
spoke	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
was	NULL
amused	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL
much	NULL
smaller	NULL
than	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
think	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
responded	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
Atlanta	NULL
Zora	NULL
stared	NULL
and	NULL
wrinkled	NULL
her	NULL
brows	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
large	NULL
city	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
other	NULL
towns	NULL
were	NULL
replicas	NULL
of	NULL
Toomsville	NULL
;	NULL
strange	NULL
in	NULL
number	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
kind	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
different	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
senseless	NULL
and	NULL
unreasonable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
so	NULL
strangely	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
loss	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
questions	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
solemn	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
rode	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL
night	NULL
came	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
dreams	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
awoke	NULL
in	NULL
Washington	NULL
to	NULL
new	NULL
fairylands	NULL
and	NULL
wonders	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
endless	NULL
going	NULL
and	NULL
coming	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
;	NULL
great	NULL
piles	NULL
that	NULL
challenged	NULL
heaven	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
homes	NULL
crowded	NULL
on	NULL
homes	NULL
till	NULL
one	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
living	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
rolled	NULL
by	NULL
Baltimore	NULL
and	NULL
Philadelphia	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
every-day	NULL
matters	NULL
:	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
which	NULL
alone	NULL
stood	NULL
steadfast	NULL
amid	NULL
whirling	NULL
change	NULL
;	NULL
of	NULL
bits	NULL
of	NULL
empty	NULL
earth	NULL
that	NULL
shook	NULL
themselves	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
loose	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
burden	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lay	NULL
naked	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cold	NULL
shining	NULL
sunlight	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
questions	NULL
were	NULL
beating	NULL
and	NULL
curling	NULL
and	NULL
building	NULL
themselves	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
brain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
above	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
wondering	NULL
why	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
before	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
mighty	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
too	NULL
familiar	NULL
for	NULL
comment	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
no	NULL
word	NULL
;	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
,	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
ears	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
tuned	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
flew	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
towering	NULL
ramparts	NULL
of	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
up	NULL
big	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
terror	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
thought	NULL
:	NULL
suppose	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
were	NULL
full	NULL
yet	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
nor	NULL
dream	NULL
of	NULL
?	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
find	NULL
out	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
finally	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
settled	NULL
in	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
high	NULL
up	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Fifth	NULL
Avenue	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hotel	NULL
,	NULL
gradually	NULL
the	NULL
inarticulate	NULL
questioning	NULL
found	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
albeit	NULL
strange	NULL
ones	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
reminds	NULL
me	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
returned	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
shopping	NULL
tour	NULL
,	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
laughter	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

yes	NULL

"	NULL
cried	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
eagerly	NULL
,	NULL
brushing	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
rumpled	NULL
hair	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL

to	NULL
me	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Still	NULL

?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
buildings	NULL
and	NULL
forgot	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
buildings	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
tall	NULL
and	NULL
silent	NULL
against	NULL
Heaven	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
I	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
suddenly	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
always	NULL
restless	NULL
and	NULL
changing	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
more	NULL
beautiful	NULL

"	NULL
suggested	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
,	NULL
slipping	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
lounging-robe	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

no	NULL
;	NULL
not	NULL
nearly	NULL
so	NULL
beautiful	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL

more	NULL
interesting	NULL

"	NULL

Then	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
puzzled	NULL
look	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
wonder	NULL
why	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Perhaps	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL

people	NULL

things	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
's	NULL

asserted	NULL
Zora	NULL

dreamily	NULL

smoothing	NULL
out	NULL

wistfully	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL

The	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
cynicism	NULL
was	NULL
lost	NULL
upon	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
possessed	NULL
the	NULL

effect	NULL

stimulating	NULL

she	NULL
protested	NULL

Zora	NULL
gathered	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL

shaded	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

Zora	NULL
softly	NULL
bent	NULL

passed	NULL
her	NULL
cool	NULL

over	NULL
her	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

said	NULL
Zora	NULL
as	NULL

noiselessly	NULL
left	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tears	NULL
blinded	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
quiet	NULL
darkened	NULL
room	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
puzzled	NULL
smile	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
month	NULL
ago	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
dreamed	NULL
that	NULL
human	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
anybody	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
so	NULL
strong	NULL
a	NULL
hold	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
liking	NULL
for	NULL
Zora	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
unusual	NULL
personal	NULL
charm	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
interest	NULL
and	NULL
affections	NULL
were	NULL
seldom	NULL
stirred	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
she	NULL
been	NULL
compelled	NULL
to	NULL
earn	NULL
a	NULL
living	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
successful	NULL
teacher	NULL
or	NULL
manipulator	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
viewed	NULL
the	NULL
human	NULL
scene	NULL
with	NULL
detached	NULL
and	NULL
cynical	NULL
interest	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
children	NULL

few	NULL
near	NULL
relations	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
husband	NULL
who	NULL
went	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
.	NULL

Essentially	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
was	NULL
unmoral	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
held	NULL
the	NULL
code	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
social	NULL
set	NULL
with	NULL
sportsmanlike	NULL
honor	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
even	NULL
beyond	NULL
this	NULL
she	NULL
stooped	NULL
to	NULL
no	NULL
intrigue	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL

Mr.	NULL
Easterly	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL

She	NULL
spoke	NULL
a	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
shown	NULL
a	NULL
disconcerting	NULL

the	NULL

felt	NULL
very	NULL
distinctly	NULL
that	NULL

him	NULL

was	NULL

THE	NULL
EDUCATION	NULL
OF	NULL
ALWYN	NULL
Miss	NULL
Caroline	NULL
Wynn	NULL
of	NULL
Washington	NULL
had	NULL
little	NULL
faith	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

Nor	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
wholly	NULL
her	NULL
fault	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
world	NULL
had	NULL
dealt	NULL
cruelly	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
dreams	NULL
and	NULL
youthful	NULL
ambitions	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
;	NULL
partly	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
usual	NULL
heartlessness	NULL
,	NULL
partly	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
cynical	NULL
and	NULL
deadening	NULL
reserve	NULL
fund	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
has	NULL
today	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL
darker	NULL
peoples	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
had	NULL
bitterly	NULL
resented	NULL
her	NULL
experiences	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
brilliant	NULL
and	NULL
well-trained	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
real	NULL
talent	NULL
for	NULL
sculpture	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
studied	NULL
considerably	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sprung	NULL
from	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
three	NULL
generations	NULL
of	NULL
respectable	NULL
mulattoes	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
competence	NULL
which	NULL
yielded	NULL
her	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
hundred	NULL
dollars	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

Furthermore	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
not	NULL
precisely	NULL
pretty	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
good-looking	NULL
and	NULL
interesting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
acquired	NULL
the	NULL
marks	NULL
and	NULL
insignia	NULL
of	NULL
good	NULL
breeding	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
wore	NULL
her	NULL
manners	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
trifle	NULL
consciously	NULL
;	NULL
perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
morbid	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
fail	NULL
of	NULL
recognition	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
lady	NULL
.	NULL

Nor	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
unnatural	NULL
:	NULL
her	NULL
brown	NULL
skin	NULL
invited	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
assumption	NULL
.	NULL

Despite	NULL
this	NULL
almost	NULL
unconscious	NULL
mental	NULL
aggressiveness	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
unusually	NULL
presentable	NULL
and	NULL
always	NULL
well-groomed	NULL
and	NULL
pleasant	NULL
of	NULL
speech	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
nearly	NULL
all	NULL
careers	NULL
closed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
accidental	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
luck	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
attributed	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
sex	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
beyond	NULL
chance	NULL
and	NULL
womanhood	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
colorline	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
hemming	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
convinced	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
imagination	NULL
play	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
line	NULL
even	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
exist	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
her	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
property	NULL
and	NULL
brilliant	NULL
parts	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
many	NULL
suitors	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
refused	NULL
one	NULL
after	NULL
another	NULL
for	NULL
reasons	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
have	NULL
explained	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
years	NULL
now	NULL
Tom	NULL
Teerswell	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
her	NULL
escort	NULL
.	NULL

Whether	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
Caroline	NULL
Wynn	NULL
would	NULL
every	NULL
marry	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
perennial	NULL
subject	NULL
of	NULL
speculation	NULL
among	NULL
their	NULL
friends	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
usually	NULL
ended	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
verdict	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
afford	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
financially	NULL
impossible	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
were	NULL
usually	NULL
seen	NULL
in	NULL
public	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
although	NULL
she	NULL
often	NULL
showed	NULL
her	NULL
quiet	NULL
mastery	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL
,	NULL
seldom	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
snubbed	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
openly	NULL
as	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Treble	NULL
Clef	NULL
concert	NULL
.	NULL

Teerswell	NULL
was	NULL
furious	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
plot	NULL
vengeance	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
was	NULL
attracted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
personality	NULL
of	NULL
Bles	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
.	NULL

Southern	NULL
country	NULL
Negroes	NULL
were	NULL
rare	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
set	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
intelligence	NULL
and	NULL
keenness	NULL
coupled	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
amazing	NULL
frankness	NULL
and	NULL
modesty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perceptibly	NULL
shadowed	NULL
by	NULL
sorrow	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
combination	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
observed	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
rare	NULL
and	NULL
temporary	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
disposed	NULL
to	NULL
watch	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
case	NULL
purely	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
intellectual	NULL
curiosity	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
walk	NULL
of	NULL
unusual	NULL
interest	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
friends	NULL
in	NULL
next	NULL
Tuesday	NULL
night	NULL
;	NULL
wo	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
morning	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
rather	NULL
repented	NULL
her	NULL
hasty	NULL
invitation	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
nothing	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
?	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
telephone	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
suggestion	NULL
to	NULL
Bles	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
profitably	NULL
extend	NULL
his	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
sent	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
tailor	NULL
shop	NULL
kept	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tailor	NULL
guarded	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
suspicion	NULL
of	NULL
intrigue	NULL
entering	NULL
Bles	NULL
's	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
quite	NULL
as	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
had	NULL
designed	NULL
;	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Grey	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
tailor	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
Bles	NULL
some	NULL
points	NULL
on	NULL
dressing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
Southern	NULL
fashion	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
frock-coat	NULL
for	NULL
dress	NULL
wear	NULL
that	NULL
set	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
fine	NULL
figure	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
gathering	NULL
at	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
's	NULL
Bles	NULL
dressed	NULL
with	NULL
care	NULL
,	NULL
hesitating	NULL
long	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
necktie	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
choosing	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
recently	NULL
purchased	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
pleased	NULL
him	NULL
particularly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
prompt	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
minute	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
consequently	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
guest	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
's	NULL
greeting	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
quietly	NULL
cordial	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
embarrassment	NULL
soon	NULL
fled	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
him	NULL
over	NULL
at	NULL
leisure	NULL
and	NULL
sighed	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
tie	NULL
;	NULL
otherwise	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
presentable	NULL
according	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
strictest	NULL
Washington	NULL
standard	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
generalities	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
an	NULL
idea	NULL
occurring	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
conducted	NULL
the	NULL
conversation	NULL
by	NULL
devious	NULL
paths	NULL
to	NULL
ties	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fad	NULL
of	NULL
collecting	NULL
ties	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
showed	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
sofa	NULL
pillow	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Your	NULL
tie	NULL
quite	NULL
attracted	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
dash	NULL
of	NULL
color	NULL
I	NULL
need	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
new	NULL
pillow	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
welcome	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
send	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
!	NULL

A	NULL
bird	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
trade	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL
now	NULL
for	NULL
another	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Done	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
exchange	NULL
was	NULL
soon	NULL
made	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
tying	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
one	NULL
herself	NULL
and	NULL
sticking	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
carved	NULL
pin	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Bles	NULL
slowly	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
pause	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Thank	NULL
you	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
quite	NULL
serious	NULL
and	NULL
good-natured	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
explained	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
we	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
much	NULL
about	NULL
ties	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
well-balanced	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
lost	NULL
her	NULL
aplomb	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
only	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
must	NULL
all	NULL
learn	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
replied	NULL
with	NULL
penetration	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
their	NULL
friendship	NULL
was	NULL
established	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
company	NULL
now	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
gather	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
the	NULL
double	NULL
parlor	NULL
held	NULL
an	NULL
assemblage	NULL
of	NULL
twenty-five	NULL
or	NULL
thirty	NULL
persons	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
formed	NULL
a	NULL
picturesque	NULL
group	NULL
:	NULL
conventional	NULL
but	NULL
graceful	NULL
in	NULL
dress	NULL
;	NULL
animated	NULL
in	NULL
movement	NULL
;	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
good-natured	NULL
laughter	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
quite	NULL
un-American	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
modulation	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
speaking	NULL
tones	NULL
;	NULL
chiefly	NULL
noticeable	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
stranger	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
vast	NULL
variety	NULL
of	NULL
color	NULL
in	NULL
skin	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
imparted	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
throng	NULL
a	NULL
piquant	NULL
and	NULL
unusual	NULL
interest	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
color	NULL
was	NULL
here	NULL
;	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
brown	NULL
of	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
customarily	NULL
accounted	NULL
black	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
pale	NULL
pink-white	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Jones	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
"	NULL
pass	NULL
for	NULL
white	NULL
"	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
greatest	NULL
difficulties	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
"	NULL
pass	NULL
"	NULL
for	NULL
black	NULL
.	NULL

Midway	NULL
between	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
extremes	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
sallow	NULL
pastor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
creamy	NULL
Miss	NULL
Williams	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
golden	NULL
yellow	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Teerswell	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
golden	NULL
brown	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Johnson	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
velvet	NULL
brown	NULL
of	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Grey	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
guest	NULL
themselves	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
notice	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
asking	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
color	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
asks	NULL
of	NULL
height	NULL
and	NULL
weight	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
simply	NULL
an	NULL
extra	NULL
dimension	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
world	NULL
whereby	NULL
to	NULL
classify	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

Beyond	NULL
this	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
to	NULL
distinguish	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
modern	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
women	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
speech	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
softened	NULL
English	NULL
,	NULL
purely	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
correctly	NULL
spoken	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
almost	NULL
unfamiliar	NULL
to	NULL
Bles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
experienced	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
among	NULL
strangers	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
missed	NULL
the	NULL
loud	NULL
but	NULL
hearty	NULL
good-nature	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
called	NULL
"	NULL
his	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
experienced	NULL
observer	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
noted	NULL
a	NULL
lively	NULL
,	NULL
excitable	NULL
tropical	NULL
temperament	NULL
set	NULL
and	NULL
cast	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
Northern	NULL
mould	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
flashing	NULL
fire	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
anomalous	NULL
out-bursting	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Bles	NULL
missed	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
slipped	NULL
and	NULL
lost	NULL
his	NULL
bearings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
characteristics	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
simple	NULL
world	NULL
were	NULL
rolling	NULL
curiously	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
stood	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yonder	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
woman	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
Negro	NULL
's	NULL
musical	NULL
cadences	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
brown	NULL
girl	NULL
with	NULL
exactly	NULL
Miss	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
's	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yonder	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Williams	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
wistful	NULL
willfulness	NULL
.	NULL

Bles	NULL
was	NULL
bewildered	NULL
and	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
great	NULL
undying	NULL
sorrow	NULL
sank	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
with	NULL
sickening	NULL
hopeless	NULL
weight	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
hands	NULL
got	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
no	NULL
natural	NULL
nook	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
those	NULL
wide	NULL
and	NULL
tastefully	NULL
furnished	NULL
rooms	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
he	NULL
discovered	NULL
himself	NULL
standing	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
marble	NULL
statue	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
nude	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
edged	NULL
away	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
stumbled	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
rug	NULL
and	NULL
saved	NULL
himself	NULL
only	NULL
to	NULL
step	NULL
on	NULL
Miss	NULL
Jones	NULL
's	NULL
silken	NULL
train	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Jones	NULL
's	NULL
smile	NULL
of	NULL
pardon	NULL
was	NULL
wintry	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
approach	NULL
a	NULL
group	NULL
and	NULL
listen	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
seemed	NULL
speaking	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
foreign	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
usually	NULL
of	NULL
people	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
homes	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
doings	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
daughters	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
fathers	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
people	NULL
intimately	NULL
who	NULL
lived	NULL
far	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

at	NULL
Miss	NULL

there	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL

the	NULL
eve	NULL

great	NULL
party	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
night	NULL
Sam	NULL
Stillings	NULL
came	NULL
around	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
some	NULL
crumbs	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
assembly	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
inner	NULL
circle	NULL
,	NULL
into	NULL
which	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL

unaccountably	NULL
snatched	NULL

outside	NULL

,	NULL
despite	NULL
his	NULL
endeavors	NULL

Stillings	NULL
lingered	NULL

seemed	NULL
destined	NULL

Stillings	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
patient	NULL

man	NULL
beneath	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
Bles	NULL
a	NULL
stepping	NULL
stone	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
drop	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
lodgings	NULL

tonight	NULL
invited	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Bethel	NULL

had	NULL
half	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL

the	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
Stillings	NULL

told	NULL
him	NULL
also	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL

Alwyn	NULL
reached	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
hat	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
arrived	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
basement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
church	NULL
was	NULL
filling	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
throng	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
women	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
the	NULL
officers	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
speaker	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
appeared	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
president	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
brown	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
spoke	NULL
easily	NULL
and	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
introduced	NULL
the	NULL
main	NULL
speaker	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
hatchet-faced	NULL
black	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
clean	NULL
shaven	NULL
and	NULL
well	NULL
dressed	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
lawyer	NULL
by	NULL
profession	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
theme	NULL
was	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
Democratic	NULL
Party	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Negro	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

His	NULL
argument	NULL
was	NULL
cool	NULL
,	NULL
carefully	NULL
reasoned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
plausible	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
feeling	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
sympathy	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
audience	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
enthusiastic	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
warmed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
gradually	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
certainly	NULL
was	NULL
strongly	NULL
impressing	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Bles	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
tense	NULL
,	NULL
alert	NULL
,	NULL
nervous	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
speaker	NULL
progressed	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
man	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
spectacled	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
bushy	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
sleepy	NULL
look	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
observant	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Who	NULL
's	NULL
speaking	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
Bles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Bles	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
inquired	NULL
about	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
other	NULL
persons	NULL
.	NULL

Bles	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
inform	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Stillings	NULL
could	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

Stillings	NULL
seemed	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
devote	NULL
considerable	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Bles	NULL
forgot	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
crouching	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
spring	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
sooner	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
speaker	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
really	NULL
fine	NULL
apostrophe	NULL
to	NULL
independence	NULL
and	NULL
reason	NULL
in	NULL
voting	NULL
,	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
Bles	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
,	NULL
walking	NULL
forward	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
form	NULL
was	NULL
commanding	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
deep	NULL
and	NULL
musical	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
earnestness	NULL
terribly	NULL
evident	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hardly	NULL
waited	NULL
for	NULL
recognition	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
slightly	NULL
astonished	NULL
president	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
fairly	NULL
burst	NULL
into	NULL
speech	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
from	NULL
Alabama	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
earnestly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
Democratic	NULL
Party	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
of	NULL
government	NULL
and	NULL
conditions	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Black	NULL
Belt	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lying	NULL
,	NULL
oppression	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
helplessness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sodden	NULL
black	NULL
masses	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
reminded	NULL
them	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
history	NULL
of	NULL
slavery	NULL
.	NULL

Finally	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
pointed	NULL
to	NULL
Lincoln	NULL
's	NULL
picture	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
Sumner	NULL
's	NULL
and	NULL
mentioned	NULL
other	NULL
white	NULL
friends	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
brothers	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
all	NULL
dead	NULL
yet	NULL

The	NULL
gentleman	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
Senator	NULL
Smith	NULL
and	NULL
blamed	NULL
and	NULL
ridiculed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
know	NULL
Senator	NULL
Smith	NULL
but	NULL
slightly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
know	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Dropping	NULL
to	NULL
simple	NULL
narrative	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
school	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
audience	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
great	NULL
depth	NULL
of	NULL
emotion	NULL
that	NULL
welled	NULL
beneath	NULL
his	NULL
quiet	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
hesitating	NULL
,	NULL
address	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
simply	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
because	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
unspoken	NULL
story	NULL
that	NULL
lay	NULL
too	NULL
deep	NULL
for	NULL
words	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
for	NULL
nearly	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
stopped	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
his	NULL
hearers	NULL
sighed	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
sprang	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
whirlwind	NULL
of	NULL
applause	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
shouted	NULL
,	NULL
clapped	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
waved	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
blank	NULL
amazement	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
difficulty	NULL
forced	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rostrum	NULL
to	NULL
bow	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
spectacled	NULL
white	NULL
man	NULL
leaned	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
Stillings	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Who	NULL
is	NULL
he	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

Stillings	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
man	NULL
noted	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
quietly	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
sat	NULL
lost	NULL
in	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Teerswell	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
fumed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
easily	NULL
moved	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
speech	NULL
had	NULL
moved	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
thus	NULL
stir	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
himself	NULL
swayed	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
mused	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
--	NULL
invincible	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
tonight	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
moved	NULL
as	NULL
greatly	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
hearers	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
dangerous	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
his	NULL
intense	NULL
belief	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
popular	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
frowned	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
watching	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
concluded	NULL
;	NULL
quite	NULL
worth	NULL
watching	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
worth	NULL
guiding	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
accompanied	NULL
her	NULL
home	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
set	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
him	NULL
better	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
suspected	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
coming	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
best	NULL
preliminary	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
purpose	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
frankly	NULL
of	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
youth	NULL
and	NULL
training	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
ambitions	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
disappointments	NULL
.	NULL

Quite	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
her	NULL
cynicism	NULL
crept	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fore	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
in	NULL
word	NULL
and	NULL
tone	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
almost	NULL
scoffed	NULL
at	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
held	NULL
true	NULL
and	NULL
dear	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
touch	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
meaning	NULL
too	NULL
elusive	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
to	NULL
grasp	NULL
always	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
attack	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
somehow	NULL
he	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
distant	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
had	NULL
little	NULL
faith	NULL
in	NULL
Truth	NULL
and	NULL
Goodness	NULL
and	NULL
Love	NULL
.	NULL

Vaguely	NULL
shocked	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
so	NULL
silent	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
noticed	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
concluded	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
pursued	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Surely	NULL
there	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
many	NULL
friends	NULL
of	NULL
our	NULL
race	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
and	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
laughed	NULL
unpleasantly	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
mockingly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL

not	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL

was	NULL

diplomatic	NULL
--	NULL
everything	NULL

in	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
"	NULL
Negroes	NULL
"	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL

;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
Negro	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
him	NULL
valuable	NULL
information	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sought	NULL
in	NULL
vain	NULL
elsewhere	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
event	NULL
proved	NULL
it	NULL
correct	NULL
.	NULL

Suppose	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
Caroline	NULL
Wynn	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
case	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
certainly	NULL
do	NULL
no	NULL
harm	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
elect	NULL
a	NULL
Republican	NULL
president	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wrote	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
letter	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
sent	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
post	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
read	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
after	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
's	NULL
departure	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
distinct	NULL
thrill	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
luxury	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Evidently	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
kingdom	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Republican	NULL
boss	NULL
was	NULL
turning	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
confidential	NULL
information	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL

the	NULL

this	NULL
campaign	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
curled	NULL
up	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ottoman	NULL
and	NULL
considered	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
first	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
query	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
bother	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Whatever	NULL
they	NULL

wo	NULL
n't	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
decisively	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
or	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
influence	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
getting	NULL

about	NULL

what	NULL
they	NULL
wanted	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL

One	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
she	NULL
considered	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
process	NULL
of	NULL
elimination	NULL
,	NULL
finally	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
Bles	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
not	NULL
take	NULL
this	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
Negro	NULL
leader	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
protagonist	NULL
of	NULL
ten	NULL
millions	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

Would	NULL
he	NULL
be	NULL
amenable	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
training	NULL
and	NULL
become	NULL
worldly	NULL
wise	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
flattered	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
--	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
steadfast	NULL
look	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
prove	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sheer	NULL
stubbornness	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
?	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
Stillings	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
had	NULL
introduced	NULL
and	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
politician	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
nothing	NULL
else	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
dismissed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
older	NULL
set	NULL
of	NULL
office-holders	NULL
and	NULL
rounders	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
pick	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
worth	NULL
trying	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
none	NULL
other	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
brains	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
gifts	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
adorable	NULL
youth	NULL
.	NULL

Very	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wrote	NULL
two	NULL
letters	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
curled	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
novel	NULL
and	NULL
candy	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
Senator	NULL
Smith	NULL
held	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
's	NULL
letter	NULL
unopened	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL

the	NULL

Now	NULL

what	NULL

his	NULL

offered	NULL
Senator	NULL
Smith	NULL
,	NULL
contemplating	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
almost	NULL
wistfully	NULL

The	NULL
campaign	NULL
progressed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
National	NULL
Republican	NULL
Committee	NULL
said	NULL
little	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
Negro	NULL
revolt	NULL
and	NULL
affected	NULL
to	NULL
ignore	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
papers	NULL
were	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

Underneath	NULL
this	NULL
calm	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
activity	NULL
was	NULL
redoubled	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
prominent	NULL
Negroes	NULL
were	NULL
carefully	NULL
catalogued	NULL
,	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
under	NULL
personal	NULL
influence	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Negro	NULL
papers	NULL
were	NULL
quietly	NULL
subsidized	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
ridicule	NULL
and	NULL
reproach	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
leaders	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
Fall	NULL
progressed	NULL
,	NULL
mass-meetings	NULL
were	NULL
held	NULL
in	NULL
Washington	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
towns	NULL
.	NULL

Larger	NULL
and	NULL
larger	NULL
ones	NULL
were	NULL
projected	NULL

and	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
was	NULL
pushed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
developing	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
effective	NULL
speaker	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
ideas	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
above	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
intensely	NULL
in	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
other	NULL

and	NULL
eloquence	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
their	NULL
people	NULL
knew	NULL
their	NULL
record	NULL

discounted	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Alwyn	NULL
was	NULL
new	NULL
,	NULL
clear	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sincere	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
folk	NULL
hung	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
.	NULL

Large	NULL
and	NULL
larger	NULL
crowds	NULL
greeted	NULL
him	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
central	NULL
figure	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
dozen	NULL
great	NULL
negro	NULL
mass-meetings	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

culminating	NULL
in	NULL
New	NULL

the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
secret	NULL
newspaper	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
personal	NULL

of	NULL
employers	NULL

friends	NULL

the	NULL
liberal	NULL

delivered	NULL
a	NULL

the	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
--	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
doubt	NULL

With	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
doubt	NULL
disappeared	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
little	NULL
reason	NULL
for	NULL
denying	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

President	NULL
walked	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL

instrumentality	NULL

an	NULL

little	NULL
past	NULL

This	NULL
is	NULL
what	NULL
Senator	NULL
Smith	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Easterly	NULL
;	NULL
what	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
remarked	NULL
to	NULL
Zora	NULL
as	NULL
Zora	NULL
was	NULL
combing	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Wednesday	NULL
after	NULL
election	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
murmured	NULL
an	NULL
indistinct	NULL
response	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
already	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
question	NULL
and	NULL
answer	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
realize	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
had	NULL
waxed	NULL
old	NULL
in	NULL
thought	NULL
and	NULL
stature	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
now	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
last	NULL
days	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
set	NULL
over	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
immensity	NULL
and	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
surroundings	NULL
,	NULL
became	NULL
real	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lives	NULL
and	NULL
doing	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
called	NULL
great	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
a	NULL
plan	NULL
was	NULL
forming	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
herself	NULL
standing	NULL
dim	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
shadows	NULL
,	NULL
directing	NULL
the	NULL
growing	NULL
power	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
:	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
great	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
counted	NULL
greatness	NULL
,	NULL
rich	NULL
,	NULL
high	NULL
in	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
powerful	NULL
--	NULL
wonderful	NULL
because	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
black	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
never	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
worked	NULL
and	NULL
planned	NULL
,	NULL
save	NULL
perhaps	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
supreme	NULL
moment	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL
would	NULL
cry	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Redeemed	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
understand	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
this	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
and	NULL
weaving	NULL
;	NULL
not	NULL
clearly	NULL
and	NULL
definitely	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
great	NULL
blurred	NULL
clouds	NULL
of	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
slowly	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
He	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
position	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
,	NULL
certainly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
agreed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
curiously	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
What	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Zora	NULL
considered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL

she	NULL
paused	NULL

again	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
took	NULL
pains	NULL
to	NULL
repeat	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
words	NULL
to	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Easterly	NULL

considered	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
smiled	NULL
and	NULL
leaned	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
carriage	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
noted	NULL
with	NULL
considerable	NULL
interest	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
colored	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
watching	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
sidewalk	NULL
:	NULL
a	NULL
brown	NULL
,	NULL
well-appearing	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
notable	NULL
self-possession	NULL
.	NULL

Caroline	NULL
Wynn	NULL
scrutinized	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
speaking	NULL
with	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Easterly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Easterly	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
figure	NULL
of	NULL
political	NULL
importance	NULL

That	NULL
very	NULL
morning	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
had	NULL
telegraphed	NULL
Bles	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
.	NULL

Alwyn	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
Washington	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
papers	NULL
heralded	NULL
the	NULL
sweeping	NULL
Republican	NULL
victory	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
about	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
new	NULL
deference	NULL
and	NULL
new	NULL
friends	NULL

strangers	NULL
greeted	NULL
him	NULL
familiarly	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL

Sam	NULL
Stillings	NULL
became	NULL
his	NULL
shadow	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
reported	NULL
for	NULL
work	NULL
his	NULL
chief	NULL
and	NULL
fellow	NULL
clerks	NULL
took	NULL
unusual	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Have	NULL
you	NULL
seen	NULL
Senator	NULL
Smith	NULL
yet	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
asked	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
congratulation	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Bles	NULL
an	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
silly	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
--	NULL
calling	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
busy	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
errand	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
just	NULL
thank	NULL
the	NULL
Senator	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
interest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL
;	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
Senator	NULL
was	NULL
busy	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
merely	NULL
send	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
card	NULL
.	NULL

Evidently	NULL
the	NULL
Senator	NULL
was	NULL
busy	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
waiting-room	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
.	NULL

Bles	NULL
handed	NULL
the	NULL
card	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
secretary	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
of	NULL
apology	NULL

the	NULL

detained	NULL
him	NULL

"	NULL

And	NULL
soon	NULL
Bles	NULL
was	NULL
shaking	NULL
Senator	NULL
Smith	NULL
's	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

Senator	NULL
Smith	NULL
thoughtfully	NULL
looked	NULL
him	NULL
over	NULL

drew	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
letters	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL

glanced	NULL
up	NULL
keenly	NULL
and	NULL
omitted	NULL

state	NULL
what	NULL
Stillings	NULL
suggested	NULL
for	NULL

Alwyn	NULL
was	NULL
visibly	NULL

Senator	NULL
Smith	NULL
leaned	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
twiddled	NULL
his	NULL
thumbs	NULL
,	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
hot	NULL
blood	NULL
darkened	NULL
his	NULL
cheeks	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Bles	NULL
sat	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
stared	NULL
politely	NULL
but	NULL
steadily	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Senator	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
dropped	NULL

he	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL

He	NULL
handed	NULL
her	NULL

pointed	NULL
out	NULL

Bles	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
amazement	NULL

but	NULL
the	NULL
Senator	NULL
reached	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
third	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
still	NULL

At	NULL

he	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL

off	NULL
her	NULL
blonde	NULL
beauty	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
delicate	NULL
rounded	NULL
figure	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
surrounded	NULL
with	NULL
wealth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
above	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
of	NULL
aristocracy	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
yearned	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
already	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
acquiring	NULL
that	NULL
poise	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
directing	NULL
the	NULL
servants	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
showed	NULL
her	NULL
born	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
purple	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
cause	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
extremely	NULL
happy	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
herself	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
puzzled	NULL
to	NULL
understand	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
restless	NULL
and	NULL
vaguely	NULL
ill	NULL
at	NULL
ease	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
these	NULL
days	NULL
?	NULL

One	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
worry	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
right	NULL
itself	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
pictured	NULL
herself	NULL
as	NULL
directing	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
plan	NULL
to	NULL
step	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
demand	NULL
a	NULL
share	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
from	NULL
experience	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
must	NULL
prove	NULL
her	NULL
usefulness	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
will	NULL
admit	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
intended	NULL
gradually	NULL
and	NULL
tactfully	NULL
to	NULL
relieve	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
of	NULL
care	NULL
connected	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
public	NULL
life	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
realized	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
guiding	NULL
spirit	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
inspiration	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
dreamed	NULL
the	NULL
details	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
this	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
already	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
imagine	NULL
no	NULL
obstacle	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
realization	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
today	NULL
no	NULL
nearer	NULL
her	NULL
goal	NULL
than	NULL
when	NULL
first	NULL
she	NULL
married	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
because	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
share	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
because	NULL
,	NULL
apparently	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
duties	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
cares	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dim	NULL
glories	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
honeymoon	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
seemed	NULL
but	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
delicate	NULL
courtesy	NULL
toward	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
pleased	NULL
her	NULL
despite	NULL
her	NULL
thrifty	NULL
New	NULL
England	NULL
nature	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
settled	NULL
in	NULL
Washington	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
election	NULL
over	NULL
and	NULL
Congress	NULL
in	NULL
session	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
really	NULL
seemed	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
Work	NULL
and	NULL
Life	NULL
to	NULL
begin	NULL
in	NULL
dead	NULL
earnest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
New	NULL
England	NULL
Mary	NULL
was	NULL
dreaming	NULL
mighty	NULL
dreams	NULL
and	NULL
golden	NULL
futures	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Harry	NULL
apparently	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
content	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
with	NULL
doing	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
arose	NULL
at	NULL
ten	NULL
,	NULL
dined	NULL
at	NULL
seven	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
between	NULL
midnight	NULL
and	NULL
sunrise	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
some	NULL
committee	NULL
meetings	NULL
and	NULL
much	NULL
mail	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Mary	NULL
was	NULL
admitted	NULL
to	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
obvious	NULL
step	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
work	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
undertaking	NULL
Mary	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
recoiled	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
recognized	NULL
that	NULL
while	NULL
her	NULL
tastes	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
were	NULL
mostly	NULL
alike	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
also	NULL
strikingly	NULL
different	NULL
in	NULL
many	NULL
respects	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
agreed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
daintiness	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
elegance	NULL
of	NULL
detail	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
agree	NULL
always	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
things	NULL
themselves	NULL
.	NULL

Given	NULL
the	NULL
picture	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
choose	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
frame	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
choose	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
picture	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
liked	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
song	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
company	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
conversation	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
Mary	NULL
reflected	NULL
,	NULL
frowning	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
flowers	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
must	NULL
always	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
when	NULL
two	NULL
human	NULL
beings	NULL
are	NULL
thrown	NULL
into	NULL
new	NULL
and	NULL
intimate	NULL
association	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
time	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
grow	NULL
to	NULL
sweet	NULL
communion	NULL
;	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
hoped	NULL
the	NULL
communion	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
on	NULL
tastes	NULL
nearer	NULL
hers	NULL
than	NULL
those	NULL
he	NULL
sometimes	NULL
manifested	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
impatiently	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
loneliness	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
why	NULL
lonely	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
idly	NULL
fingered	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
book	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
down	NULL
sharply	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
several	NULL
attempts	NULL
at	NULL
reading	NULL
aloud	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
some	NULL
evenings	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
book	NULL
reminded	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
Jane	NULL
Addams	NULL
'	NULL
"	NULL
Newer	NULL
Ideals	NULL
of	NULL
Peace	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
yawned	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
undisguisedly	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
this	NULL
novel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
--	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
balked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
chapter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
his	NULL
"	NULL
little	NULL
prude	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
prude	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
hated	NULL
to	NULL
seem	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
prided	NULL
herself	NULL
on	NULL
emancipation	NULL
from	NULL
narrow	NULL
New	NULL
England	NULL
prejudices	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
example	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
objected	NULL
to	NULL
wine	NULL
at	NULL
dinner	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
indeed	NULL
rather	NULL
fine	NULL
,	NULL
imparting	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
flavor	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
whiskey	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Harry	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
too	NULL
lively	NULL
--	NULL
nothing	NULL
excessive	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
smell	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
color	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
too	NULL
suggestive	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
kind	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
evening	NULL
he	NULL
bent	NULL
so	NULL
gallantly	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
kiss	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
laid	NULL
fresh	NULL
flowers	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
:	NULL
could	NULL
anything	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
more	NULL
thoughtful	NULL
and	NULL
knightly	NULL
?	NULL

Just	NULL
here	NULL
again	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
puzzled	NULL
;	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
folk	NULL
,	NULL
hard	NULL
work	NULL
and	NULL
inflexible	NULL
duty	NULL
were	NULL
of	NULL
prime	NULL
importance	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
rock	NULL
foundation	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
somehow	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
counted	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
courtesies	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
as	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
them	NULL
sweet	NULL
and	NULL
beautiful	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
perhaps	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
with	NULL
Harry	NULL
as	NULL
with	NULL
others	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
set	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
depths	NULL
beneath	NULL
the	NULL
gravely	NULL
inclined	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
deferential	NULL
smile	NULL
and	NULL
ceremonious	NULL
action	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
clever	NULL
converse	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
sounded	NULL
strangely	NULL
hollow	NULL
once	NULL
or	NULL
twice	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
essayed	NULL
to	NULL
sound	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
fear	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
possessed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bell	NULL
rang	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
startled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
fright	NULL
that	NULL
struck	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
analyze	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
reality	NULL
--	NULL
pride	NULL
forbade	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
admit	NULL
it	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
feared	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
call	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
Harry	NULL
's	NULL
friends	NULL
:	NULL
some	NULL
languid	NULL
,	NULL
assured	NULL
Southern	NULL
ladies	NULL
,	NULL
perilously	NULL
gowned	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
veiled	NULL
disdain	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
interloping	NULL
Northerner	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
strong	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

Especially	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
one	NULL
from	NULL
New	NULL
Orleans	NULL
,	NULL
tall	NULL
and	NULL
dark	NULL
--	NULL
But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
caller	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
simply	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
named	NULL
Stillings	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
constituent	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
smirky	NULL
brown	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
apologetic	NULL
.	NULL

said	NULL
Stillings	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
when	NULL

was	NULL
diplomatic	NULL

Mary	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
him	NULL
wait	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
better	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
him	NULL
shown	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

Less	NULL
than	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
later	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
entered	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
quickly	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
worn	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
and	NULL
tired	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
laughed	NULL
her	NULL
concern	NULL
lightly	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL

he	NULL
declared	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
laughed	NULL
so	NULL
hilariously	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
observed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
answered	NULL
deftly	NULL

And	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
moved	NULL
toward	NULL

THE	NULL
VISION	NULL
OF	NULL
ZORA	NULL
How	NULL
Zora	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
church	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
knew	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
somehow	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
dark	NULL
wanderings	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
taking	NULL
at	NULL
nightfall	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
one	NULL
evening	NULL
before	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
looked	NULL
warm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
lonely	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
back	NULL
seat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
with	NULL
unseeing	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
said	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
else	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
have	NULL
dreamed	NULL
?	NULL

That	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
ever	NULL
marry	NULL
her	NULL
was	NULL
beyond	NULL
possibility	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
settled	NULL
long	NULL
since	NULL
--	NULL
there	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
tall	NULL

dark	NULL

wan	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
shades	NULL

that	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
marry	NULL
some	NULL

some	NULL
good	NULL

pure	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
help	NULL

She	NULL

would	NULL
help	NULL

and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
helped	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
through	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL

and	NULL
yet	NULL
why	NULL
so	NULL
suddenly	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
threads	NULL

life	NULL
let	NULL
go	NULL
?	NULL

Why	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
drifting	NULL
in	NULL
vast	NULL
waters	NULL

in	NULL
uncharted	NULL
wastes	NULL
of	NULL
sea	NULL
?	NULL

Why	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
puzzle	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
suddenly	NULL
so	NULL
intricate	NULL
when	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
week	NULL
ago	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
reading	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
beauty	NULL
and	NULL
wisdom	NULL
and	NULL
power	NULL
were	NULL
thrilling	NULL
her	NULL
delighted	NULL
hands	NULL
?	NULL

Could	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
dared	NULL
dream	NULL
a	NULL
forbidden	NULL
dream	NULL
?	NULL

No	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
rejected	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
thought	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
cared	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
hovered	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
as	NULL
some	NULL
dark	NULL
guardian	NULL
angel	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
somebody	NULL
else	NULL
was	NULL
receiving	NULL
his	NULL
gratitude	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
supposed	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
outcast	NULL
child	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
there	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
world	NULL
--	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
burden	NULL
of	NULL
whose	NULL
sin	NULL
--	NULL
But	NULL
then	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
preacher	NULL

_	NULL

She	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
intently	NULL
listening	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL

but	NULL
under	NULL

coldly	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
South	NULL
the	NULL
cries	NULL
,	NULL
contortions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
religious	NULL
frenzy	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL

untouched	NULL

she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
laugh	NULL

she	NULL
simply	NULL
sat	NULL

watched	NULL

wondered	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
North	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
wall	NULL

and	NULL
hymn	NULL

liked	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL

surplice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
preacher	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
reference	NULL
to	NULL
anything	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL

Here	NULL
suddenly	NULL
came	NULL

Zora	NULL
kissed	NULL

The	NULL
next	NULL
afternoon	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
social	NULL
settlement	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
Congressman	NULL
Todd	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
a	NULL
meeting	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Civic	NULL
Club	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
held	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
painfully	NULL
to	NULL
realize	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
career	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
plain	NULL
,	NULL
unwelcome	NULL
truth	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
great	NULL
interests	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
find	NULL
permanent	NULL
pleasure	NULL
.	NULL

Companionship	NULL
and	NULL
love	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
always	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
respects	NULL
their	NULL
lives	NULL
must	NULL
flow	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL
streams	NULL
.	NULL

Last	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
irritated	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
almost	NULL
harshly	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
brood	NULL
or	NULL
work	NULL
today	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
so	NULL
she	NULL
hunted	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
eagerly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
entered	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
carelessly	NULL
gowned	NULL
women	NULL
and	NULL
men	NULL
smart	NULL
and	NULL
shabby	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
were	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
clothes	NULL
nor	NULL
even	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
great	NULL
deeds	NULL
in	NULL
mind	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
scanning	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
toiling	NULL
for	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
same	NULL
grim	NULL
excitement	NULL
that	NULL
sends	NULL
smaller	NULL
souls	NULL
hunting	NULL
for	NULL
birds	NULL
and	NULL
rabbits	NULL
and	NULL
lions	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
them	NULL
hunting	NULL
the	NULL
enemies	NULL
of	NULL
mankind	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
bent	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
chase	NULL
,	NULL
scenting	NULL
the	NULL
game	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
the	NULL
infinite	NULL
meaning	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
hunt	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
glory	NULL
of	NULL
victory	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
had	NULL
listened	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
hour	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
world	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
small	NULL
and	NULL
sordid	NULL
and	NULL
narrow	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
trivial	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
shame	NULL
spread	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
earnest	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
expert	NULL

They	NULL
acknowledged	NULL
the	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
taking	NULL
part	NULL

Someone	NULL
mentioned	NULL
her	NULL

one	NULL

two	NULL
glances	NULL
of	NULL
interest	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
used	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
watched	NULL
this	NULL
new	NULL
group	NULL
gather	NULL
:	NULL
a	NULL
business	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
fashionable	NULL
ladies	NULL
,	NULL
three	NULL
college	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
gray-haired	NULL
colored	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
spectacled	NULL
brown	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
surprise	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
and	NULL
Zora	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
was	NULL
scarcely	NULL
seated	NULL
when	NULL
that	NULL
strange	NULL
sixth	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
needed	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
side-glance	NULL
from	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
to	NULL
indicate	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
with	NULL
folded	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
dreamy	NULL
look	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
one	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
lived	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
again	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
red	NULL
cabin	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
moving	NULL
oak	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sowing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Fleece	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
fearful	NULL
reaping	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
Bles	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
often	NULL
dreamed	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
set	NULL
a	NULL
high	NULL
ideal	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wanted	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
handsome	NULL
,	NULL
well	NULL
dressed	NULL
,	NULL
earnest	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
person	NULL
proprietorship	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
the	NULL
quickened	NULL
pulse	NULL
died	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
regular	NULL
healthy	NULL
beat	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
and	NULL
knew	NULL
.	NULL

Caroline	NULL
Wynn	NULL
deemed	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
world	NULL
's	NULL
education	NULL
to	NULL
participate	NULL
in	NULL
meetings	NULL
like	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
pleasant	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
cynicism	NULL
and	NULL
mocking	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
pleasure	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
always	NULL
roused	NULL
hostility	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
entered	NULL
:	NULL
her	NULL
gown	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
handsome	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
gloves	NULL
too	NULL
spotless	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
air	NULL
had	NULL
hauteur	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
almost	NULL
impudent	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
opinion	NULL
of	NULL
most	NULL
white	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
gradually	NULL
her	NULL
intelligence	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
cool	NULL
wit	NULL
and	NULL
self-possession	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
conquer	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
gracefully	NULL
out	NULL
leaving	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
bewildered	NULL
audience	NULL
behind	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
today	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
dark	NULL
gold	NULL
profile	NULL
toward	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
looked	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
Bles	NULL
marry	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
choked	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
sob	NULL
that	NULL
struggled	NULL
and	NULL
fought	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
throat	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
meeting	NULL
never	NULL
got	NULL
beyond	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
constraint	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Congressman	NULL
made	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
speech	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
various	NULL
sets	NULL
of	NULL
figures	NULL
read	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
workers	NULL

and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
added	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL

spice	NULL
by	NULL
several	NULL
pertinent	NULL
questions	NULL
and	NULL
comments	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
meeting	NULL
broke	NULL
up	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
came	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL

Zora	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

herself	NULL

They	NULL
exchanged	NULL
a	NULL

delicately	NULL
to	NULL
test	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL

whirled	NULL
down	NULL

before	NULL

the	NULL

thousands	NULL

From	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

It	NULL
took	NULL

at	NULL
last	NULL
the	NULL
Cresswell	NULL

escaped	NULL

off	NULL

out	NULL
again	NULL

up	NULL
14th	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
demurred	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Elspeth	NULL
's	NULL
cabin	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
dirt	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
smell	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
squalor	NULL

of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
different	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
--	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
had	NULL
little	NULL
inclination	NULL
for	NULL
slumming	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
under-world	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
intellectually	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
by	NULL
personal	NULL
contact	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
side-world	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
an	NULL
under-world	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
the	NULL
imposing	NULL
building	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
look	NULL
sordid	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Hired	NULL

"	NULL
asked	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Indeed	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
hitch	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Tickets	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Where	NULL
can	NULL
we	NULL
buy	NULL
them	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL

"	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
curt	NULL
reply	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Actually	NULL
exclusive	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
sneered	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
imagine	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
unwelcome	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
Negro	NULL
ball	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
bethought	NULL
himself	NULL
of	NULL
Sam	NULL
Stillings	NULL
and	NULL
sent	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
complimentary	NULL
tickets	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
balcony	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
leaned	NULL
forward	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
interesting	NULL
.	NULL

Beneath	NULL
her	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
ordinary	NULL
pretty	NULL
ball	NULL
--	NULL
flowered	NULL
,	NULL
silked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ribboned	NULL
;	NULL
with	NULL
swaying	NULL
whirling	NULL
figures	NULL
,	NULL
music	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
laughter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
human	NULL
fun	NULL
of	NULL
gayety	NULL
and	NULL
converse	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
impressed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
ordinary	NULL
scene	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
contrary	NULL
,	NULL
most	NULL
extraordinary	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
man	NULL
waltzing	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
woman	NULL
--	NULL
no	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
white	NULL

Mary	NULL
caught	NULL
the	NULL
cream	NULL
and	NULL
curl	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
swept	NULL
past	NULL

but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
man	NULL
(	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
white	NULL
?	NULL
)	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
color	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
was	NULL
wonderful	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hard	NULL
human	NULL
white	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
glow	NULL
and	NULL
live	NULL
and	NULL
run	NULL
a	NULL
mad	NULL
gamut	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
spectrum	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
morn	NULL
till	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
white	NULL
to	NULL
black	NULL
;	NULL
through	NULL
red	NULL
and	NULL
sombre	NULL
browns	NULL
,	NULL
pale	NULL
and	NULL
brilliant	NULL
yellows	NULL
,	NULL
dead	NULL
and	NULL
living	NULL
blacks	NULL
.	NULL

Through	NULL
her	NULL
opera-glasses	NULL
Mary	NULL
scanned	NULL
their	NULL
hair	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
noted	NULL
everything	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
infinitely	NULL
twisted	NULL
,	NULL
crackled	NULL
,	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
grayish-black	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
piled	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
red	NULL
golden	NULL
sunlight	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
eyes	NULL
went	NULL
dreaming	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
below	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
gathering	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
worlds	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
types	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
nations	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
lands	NULL
swirling	NULL
beneath	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
human	NULL
brotherhood	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
wonder	NULL
shook	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
happy	NULL
.	NULL

Surely	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
nether	NULL
world	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
upper	NULL
earth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
--	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
beckoned	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
laughing	NULL
incontinently	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
crowd	NULL
of	NULL
queer	NULL
looking	NULL
people	NULL
doing	NULL
things	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
made	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
and	NULL
appearing	NULL
absurdly	NULL
happy	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
irritated	NULL
him	NULL
unreasonably	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
See	NULL
the	NULL
washer-woman	NULL
in	NULL
red	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
whispered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Look	NULL

They	NULL
trooped	NULL
noisily	NULL
down-stairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
walked	NULL
unceremoniously	NULL
between	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
partner	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
recognized	NULL
and	NULL
greeted	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
as	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
notice	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
paused	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
start	NULL
of	NULL
recognition	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL

she	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
impetuously	NULL
,	NULL
starting	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
sincerely	NULL
pleased	NULL
at	NULL
seeing	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
remembered	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
bowed	NULL
and	NULL
smiled	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
interest	NULL
and	NULL
surprise	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
correctly	NULL
dressed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
shirt	NULL
set	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
comeliness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
black	NULL
face	NULL
in	NULL
compelling	NULL
contrast	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
carried	NULL
himself	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
bowed	NULL
with	NULL
gravity	NULL
and	NULL
dignity	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
passed	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL
ear	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
recurring	NULL
flashes	NULL
of	NULL
temper	NULL
like	NULL
this	NULL

together	NULL
with	NULL
evidences	NULL
of	NULL

a	NULL

fondness	NULL

that	NULL
drove	NULL
Mary	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
more	NULL

find	NULL
solace	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
Congressman	NULL

she	NULL
determined	NULL

faintly	NULL
again	NULL

her	NULL

entered	NULL
the	NULL
library	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL

waiting	NULL

was	NULL
rumpled	NULL

with	NULL

the	NULL

retorted	NULL
explosively	NULL

turned	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

Cresswell	NULL
drooped	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
after	NULL
eating	NULL

hesitated	NULL

reflected	NULL

opened	NULL

there	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
battle	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
wage	NULL
it	NULL
coolly	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
method	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
arrayed	NULL
the	NULL
arguments	NULL
side	NULL
by	NULL
side	NULL

on	NULL
this	NULL
side	NULL
lay	NULL
success	NULL

the	NULL

held	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
Negro	NULL
in	NULL
America	NULL

greater	NULL

Douglass	NULL

had	NULL
held	NULL

a	NULL

a	NULL

.	NULL

A	NULL
man	NULL
owed	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
success	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
plenty	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
fail	NULL
and	NULL
stumble	NULL
and	NULL
give	NULL
multiple	NULL
excuses	NULL
.	NULL

Should	NULL
he	NULL
be	NULL
one	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
viewed	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
must	NULL
he	NULL
pay	NULL
for	NULL
success	NULL
?	NULL

Aye	NULL
,	NULL
face	NULL
it	NULL
boldly	NULL
--	NULL
what	NULL
?	NULL

Mechanically	NULL
he	NULL
searched	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
mail	NULL
and	NULL
undid	NULL
the	NULL
latest	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
Colored	NULL
American	NULL
_	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
the	NULL
answer	NULL
stood	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
Teerswell	NULL
's	NULL
biting	NULL
vulgar	NULL
English	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
cartoon	NULL
:	NULL
HIS	NULL
MASTER	NULL
'S	NULL
VOICE	NULL
Alwyn	NULL

Ordered	NULL
to	NULL
Eat	NULL
His	NULL

Get	NULL
Out	NULL
Watch	NULL
Him	NULL
Do	NULL
It	NULL
Gracefully	NULL
The	NULL
Republican	NULL
Leaders	NULL
,	NULL
etc	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
threw	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
paper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
hot	NULL
blood	NULL
sang	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
ears	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sickening	NULL
thought	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
speech	NULL
demanded	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
dog	NULL
obedient	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
master	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
cold	NULL
sweat	NULL
oozed	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
;	NULL
throwing	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
drank	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Spring	NULL
breeze	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
he	NULL
once	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
so	NULL
alluring	NULL
.	NULL

Somehow	NULL
it	NULL
looked	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
less	NULL
beautiful	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
stretched	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
breathed	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Zora	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
hastily	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
desk	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
mail	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
sealed	NULL
note	NULL
carefully	NULL
written	NULL
on	NULL
heavy	NULL
paper	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
recognize	NULL
the	NULL
handwriting	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
flew	NULL
off	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
would	NULL
they	NULL
say	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
failed	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL
?	NULL

How	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
silently	NULL
hoot	NULL
and	NULL
jeer	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
upstart	NULL
who	NULL
suddenly	NULL
climbed	NULL
so	NULL
high	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Carrie	NULL
Wynn	NULL
--	NULL
poor	NULL
Carrie	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
pride	NULL
and	NULL
position	NULL
dragged	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
ruin	NULL
:	NULL
how	NULL
would	NULL
she	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
writhed	NULL
in	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
;	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
calmly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
No	NULL

to	NULL
stand	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
great	NULL
audience	NULL

say	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL

;	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
Carrie	NULL
's	NULL

and	NULL
together	NULL
face	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
and	NULL
struggle	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
newer	NULL

--	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
very	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
attainment	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ideal	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

Would	NULL
she	NULL
go	NULL
?	NULL

Would	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
lay	NULL
aside	NULL
her	NULL
pride	NULL
and	NULL
cynicism	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
dainty	NULL
ways	NULL
and	NULL
little	NULL
extravagances	NULL
?	NULL

An	NULL
odd	NULL
fancy	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
:	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
answer	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
riddle	NULL
lay	NULL
sealed	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
envelope	NULL
he	NULL
fingered	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
opened	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Within	NULL
lay	NULL
four	NULL
lines	NULL
of	NULL
writing	NULL
--	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
--	NULL
no	NULL

_	NULL
He	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
lines	NULL
.	NULL

Eleven	NULL
o'clock	NULL
--	NULL
twelve	NULL
--	NULL
one	NULL
--	NULL
chimed	NULL
the	NULL
deep-voiced	NULL
clock	NULL
without	NULL

before	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
had	NULL
kept	NULL
a	NULL
vigil	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Bles	NULL
had	NULL
influential	NULL
friends	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
urged	NULL
his	NULL
preferment	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
wise	NULL
to	NULL
enlist	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
she	NULL
fell	NULL
asleep	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
talk	NULL
with	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
from	NULL
Senator	NULL
Smith	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
lady	NULL
took	NULL
special	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
heard	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
's	NULL
story	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
inward	NULL
dismay	NULL
.	NULL

Really	NULL
the	NULL
breadth	NULL
and	NULL
depth	NULL
of	NULL
intrigue	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
city	NULL
almost	NULL
frightened	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
deeper	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
mire	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
promised	NULL
Zora	NULL
that	NULL
Bles	NULL
should	NULL
receive	NULL
his	NULL
reward	NULL
on	NULL
terms	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
wound	NULL
his	NULL
manhood	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
an	NULL
easy	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
an	NULL
obvious	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
promise	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
rather	NULL
unusual	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
asking	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
to	NULL
use	NULL
her	NULL
influence	NULL
in	NULL
making	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
bow	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
yoke	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
fenced	NULL
for	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
did	NULL
;	NULL
you	NULL
recommended	NULL
him	NULL
highly	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
knew	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
slightly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
South	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
watched	NULL
his	NULL
career	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
too	NULL
bad	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
that	NULL
career	NULL
spoiled	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
is	NULL
it	NULL
necessary	NULL
?	NULL

Suppose	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
defend	NULL
the	NULL
Education	NULL
Bill	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
criticise	NULL
the	NULL
party	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
asked	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
strong	NULL
influence	NULL
to	NULL
pull	NULL
him	NULL
through	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
if	NULL
that	NULL
strong	NULL
influence	NULL
were	NULL
found	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
thoughtfully	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
would	NULL
surely	NULL
involve	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
important	NULL
concession	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
South	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
interjection	NULL
hovered	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
price	NULL
of	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
's	NULL
manhood	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
appointment	NULL
to	NULL
Paris	NULL
?	NULL

And	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
?	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
do	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
graciously	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
afraid	NULL
that	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
hesitated	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
succeeded	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
guessing	NULL
the	NULL
source	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
's	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
appeal	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
blind	NULL
groping	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stopped	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
to	NULL
admire	NULL
a	NULL
bronze	NULL
statuette	NULL
and	NULL
find	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
are	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
bronzes	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
asked	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
;	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
far	NULL
too	NULL
poor	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
dabbled	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
in	NULL
sculpture	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Indeed	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
revealed	NULL
a	NULL
mild	NULL
interest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
was	NULL
compelled	NULL
to	NULL
depart	NULL
with	NULL
little	NULL
enlightenment	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
up	NULL
town	NULL
she	NULL
concluded	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
success	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
write	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
's	NULL
speech	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
characteristic	NULL
decision	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
her	NULL
plans	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
will	NULL
you	NULL
say	NULL
in	NULL
your	NULL
speech	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
rose	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
wavered	NULL
slightly	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
black	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fight	NULL
was	NULL
becoming	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
too	NULL
desperate	NULL
even	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
steady	NULL
nerves	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
me	NULL
to	NULL
act	NULL
dishonestly	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
involuntarily	NULL
replied	NULL
,	NULL
regretting	NULL
the	NULL
word	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
uttered	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
rare	NULL
sweet	NULL
smiles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
rising	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
realized	NULL
his	NULL
intent	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
asked	NULL
herself	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
foolish	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
somehow	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
there	NULL
alone	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
firelight	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
glad	NULL
for	NULL
once	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
above	NULL
intrigue	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
sighed	NULL
and	NULL
smiled	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
plot	NULL
anew	NULL
.	NULL

Teerswell	NULL
dropped	NULL
in	NULL
later	NULL
and	NULL
brought	NULL
his	NULL
friend	NULL
,	NULL
Stillings	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
found	NULL
their	NULL
hostess	NULL
gay	NULL
and	NULL
entertaining	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
gathered	NULL
books	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
April	NULL
and	NULL
May	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
read	NULL
up	NULL
on	NULL
education	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
marvelled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
subtlety	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
relentlessness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
very	NULL
near	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
during	NULL
these	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
ever	NULL
something	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
:	NULL
a	NULL
vision	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
pleading	NULL
eyes	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
constantly	NULL
saw	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
cool	NULL
,	NULL
keen	NULL
glance	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
two	NULL
men	NULL
:	NULL
one	NULL
man	NULL
above	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
respect	NULL
but	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
marry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
man	NULL
like	NULL
all	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
marry	NULL
but	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
respect	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
devotion	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
ideal	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
so	NULL
utterly	NULL
unpractical	NULL
,	NULL
aroused	NULL
keen	NULL
curiosity	NULL
and	NULL
admiration	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
fail	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
fail	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
somehow	NULL
,	NULL
somewhere	NULL
back	NULL
beyond	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
better	NULL
self	NULL
longed	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
herself	NULL
defeated	NULL
;	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
this	NULL
mind	NULL
stand	NULL
firm	NULL
on	NULL
principle	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
circumstances	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
believed	NULL
men	NULL
never	NULL
stood	NULL
.	NULL

Deep	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL
she	NULL
discovered	NULL
at	NULL
times	NULL
a	NULL
passionate	NULL
longing	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
somebody	NULL
;	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
bending	NULL
every	NULL
energy	NULL
to	NULL
pull	NULL
this	NULL
man	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
level	NULL
of	NULL
time-servers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
failed	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
contempt	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
stubbornness	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
great	NULL
day	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
notes	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
suggestions	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
hints	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
intimation	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
finally	NULL
say	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Will	NULL
you	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
me	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
murmured	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
is	NULL
best	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
added	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
you	NULL
ever	NULL
to	NULL
despise	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
answered	NULL
sharply	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
despise	NULL
you	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

Did	NULL
he	NULL
understand	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sure	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
sorry	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
it	NULL
fiercely	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
four	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
at	NULL
eight	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
down	NULL
early	NULL
,	NULL
despite	NULL
some	NULL
dawdling	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
toilet	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
brought	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL

Zora	NULL
pondered	NULL
aloud	NULL

I	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
sadly	NULL
at	NULL

the	NULL
fear	NULL
that	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

arose	NULL

over	NULL

her	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

knew	NULL

her	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
again	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

her	NULL

crept	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
cushions	NULL

she	NULL

with	NULL

her	NULL
voice	NULL

after	NULL
a	NULL

"	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
looked	NULL
out	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
beautiful	NULL
city	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
surprised	NULL
at	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
almost	NULL
anything	NULL
for	NULL
Zora	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
living	NULL
soul	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
raised	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
deep	NULL
an	NULL
affection	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
the	NULL
cost	NULL
was	NULL
great	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
Zora	NULL
for	NULL
Paris	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
rapid	NULL
ride	NULL
even	NULL
now	NULL
might	NULL
secure	NULL
high	NULL
office	NULL
for	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
and	NULL
make	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
ambassador	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
difficult	NULL
but	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
inclination	NULL
to	NULL
attempt	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
aloud	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
mockingly	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
are	NULL
right	NULL

Zora	NULL

Two	NULL
months	NULL
later	NULL
they	NULL
parted	NULL
simply	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
well	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
forever	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
wrote	NULL
a	NULL
check	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Use	NULL
this	NULL
in	NULL
your	NULL
work	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL

Zora	NULL
smiled	NULL
and	NULL
thanked	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
sealed	NULL
envelope	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
trunk	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
contact	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
untouched	NULL
package	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
silently	NULL
and	NULL
opened	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
lightened	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
walked	NULL
alone	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
vaulted	NULL
station	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
a	NULL
Pullman	NULL
ticket	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
the	NULL
journey	NULL
was	NULL
thirty-six	NULL
hours	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
difficult	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
impossible	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
preferred	NULL
to	NULL
share	NULL
the	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
foremost	NULL
car	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
leaned	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
car	NULL
seemed	NULL
clean	NULL
and	NULL
comfortable	NULL
but	NULL
strangely	NULL
short	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
realized	NULL
that	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
smokers	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
swung	NULL
whiffs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
smoke	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
content	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
eighteen	NULL
little	NULL
months	NULL
ago	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
ridden	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
with	NULL
widening	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
?	NULL

Everything	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
well	NULL
she	NULL
remembered	NULL
her	NULL
coming	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
reflection	NULL
of	NULL
yonder	NULL
gilded	NULL
dome	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
soaring	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
capitol	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
swelling	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
inarticulate	NULL
wonder	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
pain	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
thirst	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
and	NULL
understand	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
much	NULL
now	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
learned	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
things	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
some	NULL
things	NULL
she	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Ticket	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
tone	NULL
was	NULL
harsh	NULL
and	NULL
abrupt	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
started	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
noted	NULL
how	NULL
polite	NULL
conductors	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
--	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
simply	NULL
because	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
and	NULL
rich	NULL
lady	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
held	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
ticket	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
snatched	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
muttering	NULL
some	NULL
direction	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
beg	NULL
your	NULL
pardon	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Change	NULL
at	NULL
Charlotte	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
snapped	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Zora	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
discourtesy	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
forced	NULL
:	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
betrayed	NULL
into	NULL
some	NULL
show	NULL
of	NULL
consideration	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
woman	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
no	NULL
anger	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
simply	NULL
wondered	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
feared	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
increasing	NULL
smell	NULL
of	NULL
tobacco	NULL
smoke	NULL
started	NULL
her	NULL
coughing	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
only	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
smoker	NULL
standing	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
passenger	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
car	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
conductor	NULL
and	NULL
puffing	NULL
heartily	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
porter	NULL
passed	NULL
her	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
gently	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Is	NULL
smoking	NULL
allowed	NULL
in	NULL
here	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
ai	NULL
n't	NULL
non	NULL
o	NULL
'	NULL
my	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
flung	NULL
back	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
moved	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
day	NULL
white	NULL
men	NULL
passed	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
forward	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
car	NULL
as	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
thoroughfare	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
talked	NULL
loudly	NULL
and	NULL
laughed	NULL
and	NULL
joked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
smoke	NULL
they	NULL
carried	NULL
their	NULL
lighted	NULL
cigars	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
her	NULL
they	NULL
stared	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
comments	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
lounged	NULL
almost	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
seat	NULL
,	NULL
inquiring	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
reply	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
neither	NULL
looked	NULL
nor	NULL
stirred	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
kept	NULL
whispering	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
with	NULL
something	NULL
like	NULL
awe	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
This	NULL
is	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
must	NULL
endure	NULL
--	NULL
my	NULL
poor	NULL
people	NULL

"	NULL

At	NULL
Lynchburg	NULL
a	NULL
newsboy	NULL
boarded	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
wares	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
conductor	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
appropriated	NULL
two	NULL
seats	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
newsboy	NULL
routed	NULL
out	NULL
two	NULL
colored	NULL
passengers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
usurped	NULL
two	NULL
other	NULL
seats	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
especially	NULL
annoying	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
joked	NULL
and	NULL
wrestled	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
porter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
every	NULL
occasion	NULL
pushed	NULL
his	NULL
wares	NULL
at	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
insisting	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
buying	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ai	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
got	NULL
no	NULL
money	NULL

asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Where	NULL

going	NULL

"	NULL
Say	NULL

he	NULL
whispered	NULL
another	NULL
time	NULL

Zora	NULL
sat	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
keeping	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
worked	NULL
nervously	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
threw	NULL
a	NULL
book	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
picture	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
half-dressed	NULL
woman	NULL
directly	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
dropped	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
storm	NULL
and	NULL
demanded	NULL
pay	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
conductor	NULL
glared	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
conductor	NULL
's	NULL
seat	NULL
whispered	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
row	NULL
suddenly	NULL
stopped	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
gang	NULL
of	NULL
colored	NULL
section	NULL
hands	NULL
got	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
dirty	NULL
and	NULL
loud	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
sprawled	NULL
about	NULL
and	NULL
smoked	NULL
,	NULL
drank	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
bought	NULL
candy	NULL
and	NULL
cheap	NULL
gewgaws	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
eyed	NULL
her	NULL
respectfully	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
she	NULL
talked	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
awkwardly	NULL
fingered	NULL
his	NULL
cap	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
wore	NULL
on	NULL
Zora	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
strangely	NULL
weary	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
simply	NULL
the	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
kept	NULL
happening	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
continued	NULL
apprehension	NULL
of	NULL
unknown	NULL
possibilities	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
realize	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL

Travelling	NULL
with	NULL
Mrs.	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
a	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL

asked	NULL

Zora	NULL
viewed	NULL
her	NULL
plight	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
dismay	NULL
--	NULL
twelve	NULL
hours	NULL
without	NULL

How	NULL

her	NULL

turned	NULL
desperately	NULL
to	NULL

she	NULL
inquired	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

the	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
herself	NULL

she	NULL

tried	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL

remembered	NULL

had	NULL
often	NULL
gone	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL

Night	NULL
came	NULL

She	NULL
scrambled	NULL
out	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL

the	NULL
platform	NULL

her	NULL
bag	NULL
was	NULL
heavy	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
porter	NULL
was	NULL
busy	NULL
helping	NULL
the	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL

And	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
look	NULL
clean	NULL

Zora	NULL
was	NULL
ravenous	NULL

The	NULL
white	NULL
smoker	NULL
now	NULL
had	NULL

the	NULL

proceeded	NULL

use	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL

Zora	NULL

They	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
their	NULL
coats	NULL

stretched	NULL
themselves	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

Zora	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
dozing	NULL
wearily	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL

found	NULL
the	NULL
porter	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
seat	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL

arm	NULL
thrown	NULL
familiarly	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL

She	NULL
rose	NULL
abruptly	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

he	NULL
started	NULL
up	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

Zora	NULL
sat	NULL
slowly	NULL
down	NULL

he	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL

left	NULL

She	NULL
determined	NULL

Yet	NULL
a	NULL

the	NULL
vision	NULL

Away	NULL
yonder	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

Toomsville	NULL

Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
sat	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
coming	NULL
of	NULL

absently	NULL
attending	NULL
the	NULL
duties	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
office	NULL

Dark	NULL
little	NULL
heads	NULL

hands	NULL
bobbed	NULL
by	NULL
and	NULL
soft	NULL
voices	NULL
called	NULL

Yet	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
voices	NULL
that	NULL
summoned	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
earth	NULL
were	NULL
less	NULL
clamorous	NULL

in	NULL

far	NULL

full	NULL

and	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
observed	NULL
the	NULL
falling	NULL
off	NULL
with	NULL
grave	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
condition	NULL
was	NULL
patently	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cotton	NULL
corner	NULL

the	NULL
subsequent	NULL
manipulation	NULL

When	NULL
cotton	NULL
rose	NULL

the	NULL

already	NULL
sold	NULL
their	NULL
cotton	NULL

when	NULL
cotton	NULL

the	NULL

When	NULL
cotton	NULL
rose	NULL
again	NULL

up	NULL
went	NULL

So	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
bewildered	NULL
black	NULL
serf	NULL
dawdled	NULL
in	NULL
listless	NULL
inability	NULL

a	NULL

half	NULL

all	NULL
this	NULL
the	NULL

looked	NULL
off	NULL

Then	NULL
came	NULL

seized	NULL

it	NULL

In	NULL
vain	NULL
her	NULL

Zora	NULL

as	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL

her	NULL

There	NULL

now	NULL

you	NULL
've	NULL
been	NULL
dreaming	NULL

You	NULL
must	NULL
rest	NULL
quietly	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
nod	NULL
he	NULL
passed	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
room	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
satisfied	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
dreaming	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
tell	NULL
Harry	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
often	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
ask	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
arose	NULL
unsteadily	NULL
and	NULL
swayed	NULL
noiselessly	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
leaned	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
opened	NULL
it	NULL
slightly	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
came	NULL
distinctly	NULL
and	NULL
clearly	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
other	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
doctor	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Because	NULL
the	NULL
sins	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fathers	NULL
are	NULL
visited	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
unto	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
and	NULL
fourth	NULL
generation	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Slowly	NULL
,	NULL
softly	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
crept	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
mind	NULL
seemed	NULL
very	NULL
clear	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
journey	NULL
to	NULL
reach	NULL
her	NULL
window	NULL
and	NULL
chair	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
long	NULL
journey	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
she	NULL
sank	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
chair	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
dry-eyed	NULL
,	NULL
wondering	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
conceived	NULL
this	NULL
world	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
why	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
afterward	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
lying	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
awake	NULL
,	NULL
conscious	NULL
,	NULL
clear-minded	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
as	NULL
little	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
pain	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
listened	NULL
gladly	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
without	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
solemn	NULL
beating	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
mighty	NULL
rhythmic	NULL
beating	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
.	NULL

Long	NULL
days	NULL
she	NULL
lay	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
beside	NULL
those	NULL
vast	NULL
and	NULL
speaking	NULL
waters	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
their	NULL
voice	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sea-calm	NULL
soothed	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
one	NULL
brief	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
herself	NULL
clearly	NULL
:	NULL
a	NULL
well-meaning	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
ambitious	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
curiously	NULL
narrow	NULL
;	NULL
not	NULL
willing	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
long	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Vision	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
leaping	NULL
at	NULL
it	NULL
rashly	NULL
,	NULL
blindly	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
deep-seated	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
duty	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
source	NULL
of	NULL
offence	NULL
by	NULL
preening	NULL
and	NULL
parading	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
forcing	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
ill-timed	NULL
notice	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
means	NULL
not	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
absorb	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
work	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
glory	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
idealized	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
uses	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
human	NULL
man	NULL
whose	NULL
life	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
sin	NULL
and	NULL
fault	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL
atone	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
sooner	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
brief	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
see	NULL
herself	NULL
honestly	NULL
than	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
habits	NULL
swept	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
tumultuously	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
ordinary	NULL
atonement	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
vast	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
must	NULL
stand	NULL
in	NULL
wonder	NULL
before	NULL
this	NULL
clever	NULL
woman	NULL
sinking	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
and	NULL
raising	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
sheer	NULL
will	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
highest	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
after	NULL
six	NULL
endless	NULL
months	NULL
Mary	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
walked	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
Washington	NULL
home	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
changed	NULL
in	NULL
appearance	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL
to	NULL
note	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
until	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
stare	NULL
--	NULL
almost	NULL
the	NULL
recoil	NULL
--	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
muttered	NULL
exclamation	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
studied	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
overdone	NULL
welcome	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mirror	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
knew	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
strong	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
well	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
slight	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
scrawny	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
beauty	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
forever	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
blonde	NULL
white-and-pink	NULL
type	NULL
that	NULL
fades	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
flash	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
going	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
body	NULL
flattened	NULL
and	NULL
angular	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
skin	NULL
drawn	NULL
and	NULL
dead	NULL
white	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
sunken	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
radiant	NULL
girl	NULL
whom	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
earlier	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
was	NULL
startling	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
the	NULL
contrast	NULL
seemed	NULL
even	NULL
greater	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
glory	NULL
then	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
her	NULL
abundant	NULL
and	NULL
almost	NULL
golden	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
that	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
faded	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
falling	NULL
so	NULL
fast	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
the	NULL
doctor	NULL
advised	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
it	NULL
short	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
ill-shaped	NULL
head	NULL
exposed	NULL
and	NULL
emphasized	NULL
the	NULL
sunken	NULL
hollows	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
changed	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
realize	NULL
how	NULL
changed	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
now	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
and	NULL
gazed	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
hesitate	NULL
but	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
set	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
new	NULL
life	NULL
task	NULL
.	NULL

Characteristically	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
started	NULL
dramatically	NULL
and	NULL
largely	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
an	NULL
endless	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
revivify	NULL
the	NULL
manhood	NULL
in	NULL
Harry	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
return	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
partnership	NULL
of	NULL
soul	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
complete	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
and	NULL
sinking	NULL
soul	NULL
in	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Mary	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
had	NULL
attempted	NULL
less	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
accomplished	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
well	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
tactfully	NULL
,	NULL
seeming	NULL
to	NULL
note	NULL
no	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
manner	NULL
toward	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
manner	NULL
had	NULL
changed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
studiously	NULL
,	NULL
scrupulously	NULL
polite	NULL
in	NULL
private	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
public	NULL
devoted	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
feeling	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
polished	NULL
shell	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
clan	NULL
reflected	NULL
conventional	NULL
light	NULL
even	NULL
more	NULL
carefully	NULL
than	NULL
formerly	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
shell	NULL
was	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
empty	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
little	NULL
flashes	NULL
of	NULL
anger	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
poutings	NULL
nor	NULL
sweet	NULL
reconciliations	NULL
.	NULL

Life	NULL
ran	NULL
very	NULL
smoothly	NULL
and	NULL
courteously	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
try	NULL
to	NULL
regain	NULL
the	NULL
affection	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
strove	NULL
to	NULL
enthrall	NULL
his	NULL
intellect	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
supplied	NULL
a	NULL
sub-committee	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
serving	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
directly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
through	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
with	NULL
figures	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
reports	NULL
,	NULL
books	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
papers	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
received	NULL
special	NULL
commendations	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
praise	NULL
that	NULL
piqued	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
pleased	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
implied	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
surprise	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
damned	NULL
Yankees	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
sneered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
think	NULL
they	NULL
've	NULL
got	NULL
the	NULL
brains	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
nation	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
speech	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
suggested	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
laughed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
matter	NULL
under	NULL
discussion	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
cotton-goods	NULL
schedule	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
tariff	NULL
bill	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
which	NULL
really	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
placed	NULL
every	NULL
temptation	NULL
to	NULL
knowledge	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
inspiring	NULL
Senator	NULL
Smith	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
defend	NULL
that	NULL
schedule	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
low-tariff	NULL
advocate	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
worked	NULL
with	NULL
redoubled	NULL
energy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
nearly	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
Harry	NULL
staid	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
nights	NULL
and	NULL
studied	NULL
.	NULL

Thanks	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
the	NULL
speech	NULL
was	NULL
unusually	NULL
informing	NULL
and	NULL
well	NULL
put	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
prominent	NULL
free-trader	NULL
spoke	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
afternoon	NULL
gave	NULL
it	NULL
publicity	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Easterly	NULL
saw	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
press	NULL
despatches	NULL
.	NULL

Cresswell	NULL
subscribed	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
clipping-bureau	NULL
and	NULL
tasted	NULL
the	NULL
sweets	NULL
of	NULL
dawning	NULL
notoriety	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
arranged	NULL
a	NULL
select	NULL
dinner-party	NULL
which	NULL
included	NULL
a	NULL
cabinet	NULL
officer	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
foreign	NULL
ambassador	NULL
,	NULL
two	NULL
millionaires	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
leading	NULL
Southern	NULL
Congressmen	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
talk	NULL
came	NULL
around	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
failure	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Senate	NULL
to	NULL
confirm	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
generally	NULL
assumed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
President	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
force	NULL
the	NULL
issue	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
nominated	NULL
?	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
several	NULL
suggestions	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
knot	NULL
of	NULL
Southern	NULL
Congressmen	NULL
about	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
declared	NULL
emphatically	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
Southerner	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
prominent	NULL
Southerner	NULL
represented	NULL
America	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
first-class	NULL
foreign	NULL
court	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
shameful	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
was	NULL
ripe	NULL
for	NULL
change	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
who	NULL
?	NULL

Here	NULL
opinions	NULL
differed	NULL
widely	NULL
.	NULL

Nearly	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
mentioned	NULL
a	NULL
candidate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
refrain	NULL
from	NULL
motives	NULL
of	NULL
personal	NULL
modesty	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
sped	NULL
her	NULL
departing	NULL
guests	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
distinct	NULL
purpose	NULL
in	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL
make	NULL
herself	NULL
leader	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Southern	NULL
set	NULL
in	NULL
Washington	NULL
and	NULL
concentrate	NULL
its	NULL
whole	NULL
force	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
appointment	NULL
of	NULL
Harry	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
as	NULL
ambassador	NULL
to	NULL
France	NULL
.	NULL

Quick	NULL
reward	NULL
and	NULL
promotion	NULL
were	NULL
essential	NULL
to	NULL
Harry	NULL
's	NULL
success	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
one	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
strain	NULL
of	NULL
effort	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Unless	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
tangible	NULL
results	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
liable	NULL
to	NULL
relapse	NULL
into	NULL
old	NULL
habits	NULL
.	NULL

Therefore	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
succeed	NULL
and	NULL
succeed	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
preferred	NULL
a	NULL
less	NULL
ornamental	NULL
position	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
ambassadorship	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
openings	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Alabama	NULL
senators	NULL
were	NULL
firmly	NULL
seated	NULL
for	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
four	NULL
years	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Governorship	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
carefully	NULL
arranged	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
term	NULL
of	NULL
four	NULL
years	NULL
abroad	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
bring	NULL
Harry	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
greater	NULL
advancement	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
tangible	NULL
offering	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mary	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
silently	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
mistake	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
tactful	NULL
hostess	NULL
,	NULL
pleasing	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
guests	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
another	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
aim	NULL
openly	NULL
at	NULL
social	NULL
leadership	NULL
and	NULL
political	NULL
influence	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
insignia	NULL
of	NULL
success	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
dinners	NULL
became	NULL
of	NULL
real	NULL
political	NULL
significance	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
figured	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
leading	NULL
Southerner	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
result	NULL
was	NULL
two-fold	NULL
.	NULL

Cresswell	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
selfishness	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
rising	NULL
popularity	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
fruits	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
work	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
rising	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
valuable	NULL
speeches	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
becoming	NULL
a	NULL
social	NULL
power	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
only	NULL
handicap	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
plain	NULL
and	NULL
over-ambitious	NULL
wife	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
forgot	NULL
two	NULL
pitfalls	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
cleft	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
Southern	NULL
aristocracy	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
pushing	NULL
new	NULL
Southerners	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
above	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
Northern	NULL
birth	NULL
and	NULL
presumably	NULL
pro-Negro	NULL
sympathies	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
forgot	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
sensed	NULL
unerringly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
with	NULL
uneasiness	NULL
of	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
's	NULL
renewed	NULL
candidacy	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
Paris	NULL
ambassadorship	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
set	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
block	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
worked	NULL
hard	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
President	NULL
stood	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
appointment	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Senate	NULL
whenever	NULL
Easterly	NULL
could	NULL
assure	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
favorable	NULL
action	NULL
.	NULL

Easterly	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
interviews	NULL
with	NULL
several	NULL
senators	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
Todd	NULL
insurgents	NULL
were	NULL
losing	NULL
heart	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
prospect	NULL
of	NULL
choosing	NULL
between	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
and	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
present	NULL
four	NULL
Southern	NULL
votes	NULL
were	NULL
needed	NULL
to	NULL
confirm	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
Easterly	NULL
declared	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
good	NULL
politics	NULL
to	NULL
nominate	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
and	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
Republican	NULL
support	NULL
.	NULL

Manifestly	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
's	NULL
task	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
discredit	NULL
the	NULL
Cresswells	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Southerners	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
liking	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
die	NULL
was	NULL
cast	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
refused	NULL
to	NULL
contemplate	NULL
defeat	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
result	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
while	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
was	NULL
giving	NULL
large	NULL
and	NULL
brilliant	NULL
parties	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
Southern	NULL
contingent	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
was	NULL
engineering	NULL
exclusive	NULL
dinners	NULL
where	NULL
old	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
met	NULL
stately	NULL
Charleston	NULL
and	NULL
gossiped	NULL
interestingly	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
such	NULL
occasions	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
hinted	NULL
not	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
many	NULL
times	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Cresswells	NULL
were	NULL
well	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
upstart	NULL
wife	NULL
who	NULL
presumed	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
social	NULL
precedence	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
's	NULL
plan	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
all-Southern	NULL
art	NULL
exhibit	NULL
in	NULL
Washington	NULL
that	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
flash	NULL
of	NULL
inspiration	NULL
,	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
chance	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
annual	NULL
exhibit	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Corcoran	NULL
Art	NULL
Gallery	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
Southern	NULL
girl	NULL
had	NULL
nearly	NULL
won	NULL
first	NULL
prize	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
Western	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
concensus	NULL
of	NULL
Southern	NULL
opinion	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
judgment	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
unfair	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
was	NULL
convinced	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
quick	NULL
intuition	NULL
she	NULL
suggested	NULL
a	NULL
Southern	NULL
exhibit	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
social	NULL
prestige	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
impress	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
proposal	NULL
caught	NULL
the	NULL
imagination	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Southern	NULL
set	NULL
.	NULL

None	NULL
suspected	NULL
a	NULL
possible	NULL
intrusion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
eternal	NULL
race	NULL
issue	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
Negroes	NULL
were	NULL
allowed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Corcoran	NULL
exhibit	NULL
or	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
easily	NULL
ascertained	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
justice	NULL
combined	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
way	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
political	NULL
intrigue	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
undoing	NULL
of	NULL
Mary	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
's	NULL
very	NULL
first	NULL
cautious	NULL
inquiries	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
stairs	NULL
brought	NULL
gratifying	NULL
response	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
all	NULL
black	NULL
Washington	NULL
know	NULL
well	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
in	NULL
sculpture	NULL
done	NULL
by	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Samuel	NULL
Stillings	NULL
,	NULL
_	NULL
nee	NULL
_	NULL
Wynn	NULL
?	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
remembered	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Stillings	NULL
perfectly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
through	NULL
unobtrusive	NULL
thoroughfares	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
on	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Stillings	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Stillings	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
art	NULL
movement	NULL
?	NULL

Did	NULL
she	NULL
intend	NULL
to	NULL
exhibit	NULL
?	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Stillings	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
intend	NULL
to	NULL
exhibit	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
welcome	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
bust	NULL
accepted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
Corcoran	NULL
Art	NULL
Gallery	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
colored	NULL
they	NULL
returned	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
especially	NULL
invited	NULL
?	NULL

That	NULL
would	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
difference	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
even	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
line	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
drawn	NULL
somehow	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Would	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
worth	NULL
a	NULL
fight	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
suggested	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
heightening	NULL
of	NULL
color	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
pale	NULL
cheek	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Stillings	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
brought	NULL
out	NULL
some	NULL
specimens	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
was	NULL
both	NULL
ashamed	NULL
and	NULL
grateful	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
money	NULL
and	NULL
leisure	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Stillings	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
in	NULL
New	NULL
York	NULL
and	NULL
Boston	NULL
the	NULL
training	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
denied	NULL
in	NULL
Washington	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
color	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
things	NULL
she	NULL
exhibited	NULL
really	NULL
had	NULL
merit	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
curiously	NULL
original	NULL
group	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
tremendously	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Send	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
counseled	NULL
with	NULL
strangely	NULL
contradictory	NULL
feelings	NULL
of	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
added	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Enter	NULL
it	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
Wynn	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

In	NULL
addition	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
invitations	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
art	NULL
exhibit	NULL
numbers	NULL
of	NULL
special	NULL
ones	NULL
were	NULL
issued	NULL
to	NULL
promising	NULL
Southern	NULL
amateurs	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
exhibited	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
these	NULL
a	NULL
prize	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
long-term	NULL
scholarship	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
smaller	NULL
prizes	NULL
were	NULL
offered	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
suggested	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
"	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
among	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
special	NULL
invitation	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
sound	NULL
to	NULL
distinguish	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
names	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
invitation	NULL
went	NULL
duly	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
a	NULL
result	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
exhibit	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
group	NULL
called	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
Outcasts	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
a	NULL
masterly	NULL
thing	NULL
and	NULL
sent	NULL
the	NULL
director	NULL
,	NULL
Signor	NULL
Alberni	NULL
,	NULL
into	NULL
hysterical	NULL
commendation	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
private	NULL
view	NULL
and	NULL
award	NULL
of	NULL
prizes	NULL
which	NULL
preceded	NULL
the	NULL
larger	NULL
social	NULL
function	NULL
the	NULL
jury	NULL
hesitated	NULL
long	NULL
between	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
Outcasts	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
painting	NULL
from	NULL
Georgia	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
was	NULL
enthusiastic	NULL
and	NULL
voluble	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
sculpture	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
finally	NULL
won	NULL
the	NULL
vote	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
prize	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
President	NULL
was	NULL
coming	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
diplomatic	NULL
corps	NULL
,	NULL
high	NULL
officers	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
army	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
social	NULL
leaders	NULL
.	NULL

Congress	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
well	NULL
represented	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
boom	NULL
for	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
as	NULL
ambassador	NULL
to	NULL
France	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
visible	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
paused	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
in	NULL
triumph	NULL
looking	NULL
back	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
darkened	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
woman	NULL
fluttered	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
whispered	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
you	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
gossip	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
--	NULL
what	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
Wynn	NULL
woman	NULL
they	NULL
say	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
nigger	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
are	NULL
whispering	NULL
that	NULL
you	NULL
brought	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
purposely	NULL
to	NULL
force	NULL
social	NULL
equality	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
say	NULL
you	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
teach	NULL
darkies	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
believe	NULL
all	NULL
their	NULL
talk	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
talked	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
longer	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
fluttered	NULL
furtively	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
limply	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
ruin	NULL
ahead	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
girl	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
prize	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
all-Southern	NULL
art	NULL
exhibit	NULL
!	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
leaped	NULL
to	NULL
action	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
colored	NULL
woman	NULL
was	NULL
doubtless	NULL
some	NULL
poor	NULL
deserving	NULL
creature	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
call	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
immediately	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
offer	NULL
of	NULL
abundant	NULL
help	NULL
induce	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
withdraw	NULL
quietly	NULL
.	NULL

Entering	NULL
her	NULL
motor	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
drove	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
address	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
proceeded	NULL
on	NULL
foot	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
street	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
prominent	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
block	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
almost	NULL
pretentious	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
glanced	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
memorandum	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
mistaken	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
domestic	NULL
;	NULL
probably	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
was	NULL
Stillings	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
that	NULL
name	NULL
before	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
where	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
again	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
memorandum	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
rang	NULL
the	NULL
bell	NULL
,	NULL
asking	NULL
the	NULL
trim	NULL
black	NULL
maid	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Is	NULL
there	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
named	NULL
Caroline	NULL
Wynn	NULL
living	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
house	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
smiled	NULL
and	NULL
hesitated	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
ma'am	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
finally	NULL
replied	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Wo	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
shown	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
parlor	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
most	NULL
interesting	NULL
,	NULL
furnished	NULL
in	NULL
unimpeachable	NULL
taste	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
good	NULL
pictures	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
was	NULL
examining	NULL
one	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
swish	NULL
of	NULL
silken	NULL
skirts	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
lady	NULL
with	NULL
gold	NULL
brown	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
straight	NULL
hair	NULL
stood	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
pleasant	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

Where	NULL
had	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
before	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
remember	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
--	NULL
Caroline	NULL
Wynn	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
can	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
groped	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
proper	NULL
cue	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
brown	NULL
lady	NULL
merely	NULL
offered	NULL
a	NULL
chair	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
silently	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
's	NULL
perplexity	NULL
increased	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
planning	NULL
to	NULL
descend	NULL
graciously	NULL
but	NULL
authoritatively	NULL
upon	NULL
some	NULL
shrinking	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
woman	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
assume	NULL
equality	NULL
but	NULL
actually	NULL
looked	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
a	NULL
rapid	NULL
survey	NULL
,	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
silk	NULL
stocking	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
lace	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
tailor-made	NULL
gown	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
head	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
full	NULL
black	NULL
eyes	NULL
that	NULL
waited	NULL
in	NULL
calmly	NULL
polite	NULL
expectancy	NULL
.	NULL

Something	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

came	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL

very	NULL

Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
sat	NULL
calmly	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
visitor	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
felt	NULL
irritated	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Of	NULL
course	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
managed	NULL
to	NULL
continue	NULL

"	NULL
Indeed	NULL

I	NULL
understood	NULL

taken	NULL
the	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
was	NULL
aghast	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
had	NULL
rushed	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
woman	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
realized	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
depths	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
matter	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
irritation	NULL
increased	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL

Cresswell	NULL
felt	NULL
herself	NULL
getting	NULL
angry	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
did	NULL
you	NULL
send	NULL
your	NULL

you	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
lie	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
incensed	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

she	NULL
almost	NULL
snapped	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
arose	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
white	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

is	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
stopped	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
colored	NULL
woman	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
quietly	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
entered	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
ready	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
walked	NULL
slowly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
stepped	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
saw	NULL
light	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
steps	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL

"	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
turned	NULL
in	NULL
amazement	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
evidently	NULL
a	NULL
reporter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
was	NULL
admitting	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
news	NULL
would	NULL
reach	NULL
the	NULL
papers	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
blazoned	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
.	NULL

Slowly	NULL
she	NULL
caught	NULL
her	NULL
motor	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
wearily	NULL
back	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL
cushions	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Where	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
Madame	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
asked	NULL
the	NULL
chauffeur	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
care	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
returned	NULL
Madame	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
the	NULL
chauffeur	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
walked	NULL
slowly	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
her	NULL
carefully	NULL
laid	NULL
plans	NULL
seemed	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
thwarted	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
castles	NULL
were	NULL
leaning	NULL
toward	NULL
ruin	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
lost	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
feared	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
suspect	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
Negro	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
quarrel	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
But	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
very	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
papers	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
explain	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
see	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
appreciate	NULL
her	NULL
efforts	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
rushed	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
dressing-room	NULL
and	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
maid	NULL
.	NULL

Contrary	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
Puritan	NULL
notions	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
frankly	NULL
sought	NULL
to	NULL
beautify	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
anniversary	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
wedding-dress	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
although	NULL
it	NULL
hung	NULL
loosely	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
draped	NULL
the	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL
beautifully	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
enter	NULL
and	NULL
come	NULL
up-stairs	NULL
.	NULL

Quickly	NULL
finishing	NULL
her	NULL
toilet	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
hurried	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
arrange	NULL
the	NULL
flowers	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
alone	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
telephone	NULL
rang	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
ring	NULL
up-stairs	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
usually	NULL
answered	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
disliked	NULL
to	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
raised	NULL
the	NULL
receiver	NULL
and	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
realized	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
broken	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
conversation	NULL

"	NULL

Good-bye	NULL

She	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
guiltily	NULL
,	NULL
replaced	NULL
the	NULL
receiver	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
meant	NULL

but	NULL
now	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
desperate	NULL
longing	NULL

?	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL

and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
fear	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
dinner	NULL
she	NULL
tried	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
powers	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
favorite	NULL
dishes	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
mixed	NULL
his	NULL
salad	NULL
and	NULL
selected	NULL
his	NULL
wine	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
talked	NULL
interestingly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
sympathetically	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
attention	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
were	NULL
more	NULL
brilliant	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
touched	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
rouge	NULL

Her	NULL
eyes	NULL
flashed	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
glanced	NULL
furtively	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
short	NULL
hair	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
act	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
she	NULL
strove	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
content	NULL
and	NULL
laughing	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
coming	NULL
round	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
placed	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

Standing	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
tableau	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
looked	NULL
strange	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
afraid	NULL
of	NULL
herself	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
do	NULL
something	NULL
foolish	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
win	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL

fanaticism	NULL
back	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL
raging	NULL
restlessly	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

asked	NULL

She	NULL
shuddered	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
smooth	NULL
lie	NULL
and	NULL
clasped	NULL
him	NULL
closer	NULL

putting	NULL
her	NULL
cheek	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

she	NULL
pleaded	NULL

He	NULL
disengaged	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
impatiently	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rose	NULL
,	NULL
glancing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
clock	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
nine	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
desperation	NULL
came	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Harry	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
again	NULL

he	NULL
slipped	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
coat	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
banged	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stood	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
closed	NULL
door	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

Something	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
snap	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rack	NULL
and	NULL
taking	NULL
his	NULL
long	NULL
heavy	NULL
overcoat	NULL
slipped	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
nearly	NULL
touched	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
seized	NULL
a	NULL
soft	NULL
broad-brimmed	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
umbrella	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
somehow	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
save	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
and	NULL
herself	NULL
from	NULL
evil	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
hurried	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Willard	NULL
Hotel	NULL
and	NULL
watched	NULL
,	NULL
walking	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
opposite	NULL
sidewalk	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
woman	NULL
brushed	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Hell	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
thought	NULL
you	NULL
was	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
Is	NULL
this	NULL

"	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
herself	NULL
involuntarily	NULL
and	NULL
smiled	NULL
wanly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
look	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
coat	NULL
and	NULL
short	NULL
hair	NULL

The	NULL
woman	NULL
peered	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
doubtingly	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
noticed	NULL

a	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL

once	NULL
pretty	NULL

a	NULL
little	NULL
over-dressed	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL

asked	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
it	NULL
flashed	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
arm	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
she	NULL
stopped	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Where	NULL

Nell	NULL

The	NULL
woman	NULL
frowned	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
winced	NULL

But	NULL
where	NULL

it	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL

"	NULL

And	NULL
Mary	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
walked	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
world	NULL

Up	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
drowsy	NULL
city	NULL
rose	NULL
pale	NULL
gray	NULL
forms	NULL
;	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
flushed	NULL

and	NULL
brilliant	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
silken	NULL
rags	NULL
.	NULL

Up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
they	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
fro	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
and	NULL
gliding	NULL
like	NULL
sheeted	NULL
ghosts	NULL

dodging	NULL

now	NULL
accosting	NULL
them	NULL
familiarly	NULL

What	NULL

Mary	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
companions	NULL
ascending	NULL
the	NULL
steps	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
quiet	NULL
mansion	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stood	NULL
uncertainly	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
opening	NULL
and	NULL
closing	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
a	NULL
policeman	NULL
came	NULL
by	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL
,	NULL
move	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
brusquely	NULL
ordered	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
vacillation	NULL
promptly	NULL
vanished	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
resolutely	NULL
mounted	NULL
the	NULL
steps	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
out	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
ring	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
flew	NULL
silently	NULL
open	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
man-servant	NULL
stood	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
some	NULL
friends	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
speaking	NULL
coarsely	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
will	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
introduced	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
hesitated	NULL
and	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Thrusting	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
pocket	NULL
it	NULL
closed	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
card-case	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
presented	NULL
a	NULL
card	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
worked	NULL
a	NULL
rapid	NULL
transformation	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
servant	NULL
's	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
escape	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL
in	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
invited	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
stop	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
outstretched	NULL
arm	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cloakman	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
glided	NULL
quickly	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
toward	NULL
a	NULL
vision	NULL
of	NULL
handsome	NULL
women	NULL
and	NULL
strains	NULL
of	NULL
music	NULL
.	NULL

Harry	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL
opposite	NULL
and	NULL
bending	NULL
over	NULL
an	NULL
impudent	NULL
blue-and-blonde	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
slipped	NULL
straight	NULL
across	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
leaned	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hat	NULL
fell	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
let	NULL
it	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Harry	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
swayed	NULL
gently	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
fro	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
bowed	NULL
and	NULL
whirled	NULL
about	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
voices	NULL
grew	NULL
fainter	NULL
and	NULL
fainter	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
receded	NULL
suddenly	NULL
far	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
extended	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
languidly	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
so	NULL
utterly	NULL
tired	NULL
,	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
eyelids	NULL
drop	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
asleep	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
awoke	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
start	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
physically	NULL
exhausted	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
clear	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL
go	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
meet	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
breakfast	NULL
and	NULL
talk	NULL
frankly	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
let	NULL
bygones	NULL
be	NULL
bygones	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
explain	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
followed	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
betray	NULL
him	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
point	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
career	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
if	NULL
only	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL

she	NULL
would	NULL
show	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
failed	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
herself	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
his	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
confidence	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
promise	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL

After	NULL
his	NULL
first	NULL
start	NULL
of	NULL
surprise	NULL
at	NULL
seeing	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
uttered	NULL
nothing	NULL
immediately	NULL
save	NULL
the	NULL
commonplaces	NULL
of	NULL
greeting	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
mentioned	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
bits	NULL
of	NULL
news	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
commented	NULL
while	NULL
dawdling	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
egg	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
servant	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
paused	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
considering	NULL
whether	NULL
to	NULL
open	NULL
by	NULL
appeal	NULL
or	NULL
explanation	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
smooth	NULL
tones	NULL
startled	NULL
her	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Of	NULL

it	NULL

She	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
utterly	NULL
aghast	NULL
--	NULL
voiceless	NULL
and	NULL
numb	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
continued	NULL

He	NULL
rose	NULL
.	NULL

Bowing	NULL
courteously	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
,	NULL
coldly	NULL
and	NULL
calmly	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL

All	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
she	NULL
hated	NULL
him	NULL

hated	NULL

this	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL

wide-eyed	NULL

said	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
voice	NULL
hoarse	NULL

ZORA	NULL
'S	NULL
WAY	NULL
Zora	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
world	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
keener	NULL
vision	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
blind	NULL
from	NULL
very	NULL
seeing	NULL
,	NULL
closes	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
a	NULL
space	NULL
and	NULL
looks	NULL
again	NULL
with	NULL
wider	NULL
clearer	NULL
vision	NULL
.	NULL

Out	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
nebulous	NULL
cloudland	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
step	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
land	NULL
where	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
floated	NULL
in	NULL
strange	NULL
confusion	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
where	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
stood	NULL
steadfast	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
love	NULL
was	NULL
shaken	NULL
all	NULL
things	NULL
moved	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
and	NULL
mighty	NULL
world	NULL
that	NULL
stood	NULL
behind	NULL
that	NULL
old	NULL
and	NULL
shaken	NULL
dream	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
new	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
women	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
childhood	NULL
had	NULL
hitherto	NULL
walked	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
like	NULL
shadows	NULL
;	NULL
today	NULL
they	NULL
lived	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
flesh	NULL
and	NULL
blood	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
hundreds	NULL
and	NULL
thousands	NULL
of	NULL
black	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
women	NULL
:	NULL
crushed	NULL
,	NULL
half-spirited	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
blind	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
how	NULL
high	NULL
and	NULL
clear	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
Sarah	NULL
Smith	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
thirty	NULL
years	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
carried	NULL
before	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
simply	NULL
shone	NULL
in	NULL
darkness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
lighted	NULL
answering	NULL
beacons	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
dull	NULL
souls	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
thoughts	NULL
and	NULL
vague	NULL
stirrings	NULL
of	NULL
unrest	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
black	NULL
folk	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
talked	NULL
long	NULL
about	NULL
their	NULL
firesides	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
Zora	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
sit	NULL
and	NULL
listen	NULL
,	NULL
often	NULL
speaking	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
countryside	NULL
she	NULL
flitted	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
gradually	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
folk	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
silent	NULL
deference	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
subtle	NULL
difference	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
title	NULL
of	NULL
white	NULL
folk	NULL
,	NULL
calling	NULL
her	NULL
"	NULL
Miss	NULL
"	NULL
Zora	NULL
.	NULL

Today	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
Zora	NULL
sensed	NULL
the	NULL
vast	NULL
unorganized	NULL
power	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
mass	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
was	NULL
leaping	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
scheming	NULL
and	NULL
testing	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
voices	NULL
arrested	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
desolate	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
manor	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
tiny	NULL
cabin	NULL
,	NULL
new-boarded	NULL
and	NULL
bare	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
blazing	NULL
bonfire	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
white	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
tossing	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
flames	NULL
different	NULL
household	NULL
articles	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
feather	NULL
bed	NULL

a	NULL
bedstead	NULL

two	NULL

A	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
boyish	NULL
fellow	NULL
,	NULL
golden-faced	NULL
and	NULL
curly	NULL

stood	NULL
with	NULL
clenched	NULL
fists	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
with	NULL
tear-stained	NULL
eyes	NULL
clung	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
white	NULL
man	NULL
raised	NULL
a	NULL
cradle	NULL
to	NULL
dash	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
flames	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
cried	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
yellow	NULL
man	NULL
raised	NULL
his	NULL

threateningly	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Zora	NULL

savagely	NULL

With	NULL
an	NULL
oath	NULL
the	NULL

dashed	NULL
the	NULL
cradle	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
red	NULL
flame	NULL
spurted	NULL
aloft	NULL

The	NULL
crimson	NULL
fire	NULL
flashed	NULL
in	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
overseer	NULL

They	NULL
proceeded	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
plantation	NULL
road	NULL

but	NULL
Zora	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
pushed	NULL
them	NULL
slowly	NULL
on	NULL

and	NULL
turned	NULL
aside	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
anger	NULL

itself	NULL
out	NULL

the	NULL

she	NULL
knew	NULL

could	NULL
fight	NULL
it	NULL
down	NULL

come	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL

cool	NULL

in	NULL
calm	NULL
and	NULL
deadly	NULL

to	NULL
lead	NULL
these	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL

The	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL

not	NULL
sorrow	NULL
for	NULL

her	NULL
fled	NULL

and	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL

helplessness	NULL
sent	NULL
the	NULL

streaming	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
longed	NULL
for	NULL

the	NULL
last	NULL

was	NULL

to	NULL
be	NULL

Far	NULL
off	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL

She	NULL
hesitated	NULL

looking	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL

black	NULL
whip	NULL
writhe	NULL

curl	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
shoulders	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
plough-boy	NULL

The	NULL
boy	NULL
crouched	NULL
and	NULL
snarled	NULL

again	NULL
the	NULL
whip	NULL
hissed	NULL

cracked	NULL

remembered	NULL

She	NULL
swung	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
road	NULL
trembling	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
woe	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Cruelty	NULL

poverty	NULL

had	NULL
looked	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
hurt	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
held	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
pinched	NULL
and	NULL
quivering	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
mists	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
shut	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
shadows	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
roaring	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
ears	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
silence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
again	NULL
she	NULL
dimly	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
sauntering	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
hardly	NULL
noticed	NULL
their	NULL
white	NULL
faces	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
voice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
raised	NULL
timidly	NULL
,	NULL
greeted	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Howdy	NULL

Zora	NULL

Zora	NULL
looked	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
Emma	NULL

and	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
smiling	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
a	NULL
half-grown	NULL
white	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Emma	NULL

Bertie	NULL

child	NULL

and	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

the	NULL

Zora	NULL
saw	NULL
for	NULL

woman	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL

the	NULL
white	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
the	NULL
horror	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
was	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
swept	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
couple	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
gust	NULL
,	NULL
gripping	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
's	NULL
arm	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
paled	NULL
and	NULL
almost	NULL
whimpered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

was	NULL
just	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
an	NULL
errand	NULL

she	NULL
cried	NULL
.	NULL

Looking	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL

Zora	NULL
discerned	NULL
its	NULL
innocence	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fright	NULL
shining	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
's	NULL
eyes	NULL

Her	NULL
own	NULL
eyes	NULL
softened	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
grip	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
caress	NULL

her	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
hard	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
laughed	NULL
awkwardly	NULL
and	NULL
strolled	NULL
away	NULL

Zora	NULL
looked	NULL
back	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
paramount	NULL
mission	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
formed	NULL
itself	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
protect	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL

Out	NULL

she	NULL

All	NULL

now	NULL

first	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
innocent	NULL
girlhood	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
daughter	NULL

shame	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
rescued	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
devil	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
duty	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL
offer	NULL

up	NULL
unto	NULL
God	NULL
in	NULL
mighty	NULL
atonement	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
how	NULL
?	NULL

Here	NULL
now	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
protection	NULL

Already	NULL
lustful	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
wait	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
ignorant	NULL
to	NULL
protect	NULL
herself	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL

the	NULL
money	NULL

it	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
stopped	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
thrilled	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
recollection	NULL
of	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Vanderpool	NULL
's	NULL

She	NULL
dismissed	NULL
the	NULL

with	NULL
a	NULL
kiss	NULL

stood	NULL
still	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL

But	NULL
perhaps	NULL
Zora	NULL

the	NULL

She	NULL
reached	NULL
up	NULL

took	NULL
down	NULL

Zora	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

There	NULL
lay	NULL
a	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

while	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL

stared	NULL
into	NULL

John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
frowned	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
puzzled	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
moralist	NULL

but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
his	NULL
code	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
honest	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
most	NULL
matters	NULL
of	NULL
commerce	NULL
between	NULL
men	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
punctilious	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
degree	NULL
almost	NULL
annoying	NULL
to	NULL
Taylor	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
code	NULL
of	NULL
honor	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
cover	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
no	NULL
incongruity	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
omission	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
uninitiated	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
easily	NULL
picture	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
the	NULL
mental	NULL
attitude	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
former	NULL
slaveholder	NULL
toward	NULL
property	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Negro	NULL

Such	NULL
property	NULL
belonged	NULL

right	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
master	NULL

if	NULL
the	NULL
master	NULL
needed	NULL
it	NULL

since	NULL
ridiculous	NULL

the	NULL
property	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
perfectly	NULL

No	NULL

neither	NULL

he	NULL
indulgently	NULL

Zora	NULL
wrote	NULL

When	NULL
Zora	NULL
left	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
's	NULL
about	NULL
noon	NULL
that	NULL
Sunday	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
her	NULL

just	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
swiftly	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
roads	NULL
,	NULL
calling	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

Would	NULL
Uncle	NULL
Isaac	NULL

Would	NULL
the	NULL

Would	NULL
Rob	NULL

tenant	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL

For	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
idle	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
.	NULL

Crops	NULL
were	NULL
laid	NULL
by	NULL
and	NULL
planting	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
begun	NULL

This	NULL
too	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
big	NULL
church	NULL
meetings	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
population	NULL

man	NULL

woman	NULL

child	NULL

were	NULL
gathered	NULL
in	NULL
great	NULL
groups	NULL

all	NULL
day	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
gathering	NULL

streaming	NULL
in	NULL
snake-like	NULL
lines	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
roads	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
well-brushed	NULL
,	NULL
brilliant	NULL
attire	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
fantastic	NULL

half	NULL
crude	NULL

Down	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
Toomsville-Montgomery	NULL
highway	NULL
dipped	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
stream	NULL
that	NULL
fed	NULL
the	NULL
Cresswell	NULL

squatted	NULL
a	NULL
square	NULL
barn	NULL
that	NULL
slept	NULL
through	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
weeks	NULL
in	NULL
dull	NULL
indifference	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
First	NULL
Sunday	NULL
it	NULL
woke	NULL
to	NULL
sudden	NULL
mighty	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
voices	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
children	NULL
mingled	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
snorting	NULL
of	NULL
animals	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
cracking	NULL
of	NULL
whips	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
drone	NULL
and	NULL
sing-song	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
preacher	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
sharp	NULL
wilder	NULL
climaxes	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
answering	NULL
"	NULL
amens	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
screams	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
worshippers	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
shrine	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Baptists	NULL
--	NULL
shrine	NULL
and	NULL
oracle	NULL
,	NULL
centre	NULL
and	NULL
source	NULL
of	NULL
inspiration	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
hither	NULL
Zora	NULL
hurried	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
preacher	NULL
was	NULL
Jones	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
big	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
fat	NULL
,	NULL
black	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
greasy	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
little	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
unctuous	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
three	NULL
manners	NULL
:	NULL
his	NULL
white	NULL
folks	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
soft	NULL
,	NULL
humble	NULL
,	NULL
wheedling	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
black	NULL
folks	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
voluble	NULL
,	NULL
important	NULL
,	NULL
condescending	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
above	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
pulpit	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
loud	NULL
,	NULL
wild	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
strong	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
don	NULL
this	NULL
latter	NULL
cloak	NULL
when	NULL
Zora	NULL
approached	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
request	NULL
briefly	NULL
to	NULL
address	NULL
the	NULL
congregation	NULL
.	NULL

Remembering	NULL
some	NULL
former	NULL
snubs	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
manner	NULL
was	NULL
lordly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
does	NULL
n't	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
returned	NULL
reflectively	NULL
,	NULL
wiping	NULL
his	NULL
brows	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
as	NULL
how	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
rightly	NULL
spare	NULL
you	NULL
any	NULL

the	NULL
brethren	NULL

a-gettin	NULL
'	NULL
mighty	NULL
onpatient	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
pulled	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
cuffs	NULL
,	NULL
regarding	NULL
her	NULL
doubtfully	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
speak	NULL
after	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
through	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
suggested	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
objected	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
regular	NULL
collection	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
other	NULL
collections	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
baptism	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
meeting	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
trustees	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
short	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
eyed	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Does	NULL
you	NULL
want	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
collection	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
questioned	NULL
suspiciously	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
imagine	NULL
few	NULL
other	NULL
reasons	NULL
for	NULL
talking	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
too	NULL
inflexible	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
people	NULL
knew	NULL
Zora	NULL
and	NULL
liked	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
no	NULL
collection	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
only	NULL
want	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
voluntary	NULL
work	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
part	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
relieved	NULL
,	NULL
frowned	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
audience	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
bright	NULL
gold	NULL
watch	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
whole	NULL
crowd	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
there	NULL
yet	NULL
--	NULL
perhaps	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
kin	NULL
say	NULL
just	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
sermont	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
finally	NULL
yielded	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
long	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
long	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
'	NULL
se	NULL
just	NULL
a-dying	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

So	NULL
Zora	NULL
spoke	NULL
simply	NULL
but	NULL
clearly	NULL
:	NULL
of	NULL
neglect	NULL
and	NULL
suffering	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sins	NULL
of	NULL
others	NULL
that	NULL
bowed	NULL
young	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
's	NULL
future	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
and	NULL
read	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
's	NULL
newer	NULL
ways	NULL
of	NULL
helping	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
women	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
cooperation	NULL
and	NULL
refuges	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
efforts	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
praised	NULL
their	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
adopting	NULL
children	NULL
into	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
homes	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
finally	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
them	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
buying	NULL
for	NULL
new	NULL
tenants	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
helping	NULL
hands	NULL
she	NULL
needed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
preacher	NULL
fidgeted	NULL
and	NULL
coughed	NULL
but	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
actually	NULL
interrupt	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
listening	NULL
breathless	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
straightforward	NULL
talk	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
seldom	NULL
heard	NULL
and	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
hungering	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Zora	NULL
forgot	NULL
time	NULL
and	NULL
occasion	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
moments	NULL
flew	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
crowd	NULL
increased	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
wonderful	NULL
spell	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
dark	NULL
and	NULL
upturned	NULL
faces	NULL
pulsed	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
blood	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
wild	NULL
yearning	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
them	NULL
beating	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
ears	NULL
and	NULL
blinding	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
people	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
almost	NULL
sobbed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
own	NULL
people	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
asking	NULL
you	NULL

I	NULL

pleading	NULL
with	NULL
you	NULL

blood	NULL

"	NULL

And	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
swaying	NULL
sobbing	NULL
hundreds	NULL
burst	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
"	NULL
Amen	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
minister	NULL
's	NULL
dusky	NULL
face	NULL
grew	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
sombre	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
angry	NULL
sweat	NULL
started	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
brow	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
felt	NULL
himself	NULL
hoaxed	NULL
and	NULL
cheated	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
his	NULL
revenge	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
hundred	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
women	NULL
rose	NULL
and	NULL
pledged	NULL
themselves	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
Zora	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
with	NULL
overflowing	NULL
heart	NULL
to	NULL
thank	NULL
the	NULL
preacher	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
platform	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
yard	NULL
whispering	NULL
darkly	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
deacons	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
realized	NULL
her	NULL
mistake	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
promised	NULL
to	NULL
retrieve	NULL
it	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
planning	NULL
and	NULL
journeying	NULL
and	NULL
talking	NULL
.	NULL

Saturday	NULL
dawned	NULL
cool	NULL
and	NULL
clear	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
dinner	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
cooking	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
yard	NULL
:	NULL
sweet	NULL
potatoes	NULL
,	NULL
hoe-cake	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
buttermilk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
hog	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
barbecued	NULL
.	NULL

Everything	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
by	NULL
eight	NULL
o'clock	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

Emma	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
other	NULL
girl	NULL
helpers	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
tip-toe	NULL
of	NULL
expectancy	NULL
.	NULL

Nine	NULL
o'clock	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Ten	NULL
o'clock	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
eleven	NULL
.	NULL

High	NULL
noon	NULL
found	NULL
Zora	NULL
peering	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
highway	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
shading	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
soul	NULL
in	NULL
sight	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
:	NULL
what	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
happened	NULL
?	NULL

Her	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
slow	NULL
,	NULL
tardy	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
thus	NULL
forget	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
disappoint	NULL
her	NULL
without	NULL
some	NULL
great	NULL
cause	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sent	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
home	NULL
at	NULL
dusk	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
seated	NULL
herself	NULL
miserably	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
oak	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
one	NULL
half-grown	NULL
boy	NULL
hurried	NULL
by	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

Preacher	NULL
Jones	NULL
has	NULL

He	NULL
says	NULL
that	NULL

that	NULL
you	NULL
do	NULL

the	NULL
deacons	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
in	NULL
consternation	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
just	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL

what	NULL

they	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
hurried	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
leaned	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
back	NULL
wearily	NULL
,	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
laced	NULL
black	NULL
branches	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
star-light	NULL
flickered	NULL
through	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
coldly	NULL
still	NULL
and	NULL
immovable	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
watched	NULL
them	NULL
from	NULL
those	NULL
gnarled	NULL
roots	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
murmured	NULL
bitterly	NULL
the	NULL
world-old	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
despair	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
What	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
every	NULL
breeze	NULL
and	NULL
branch	NULL
was	NULL
instinct	NULL
with	NULL
sympathy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
murmuring	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
What	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
wondered	NULL
vaguely	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
wondered	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
yonder	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
earth	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
heaved	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
formless	NULL
mound	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
arms	NULL
of	NULL
Elspeth	NULL
rising	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
sod	NULL
--	NULL
gigantic	NULL
,	NULL
mighty	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
stole	NULL
toward	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
stealthy	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
claw-like	NULL
talons	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
clutched	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
skirts	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
froze	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
move	NULL
.	NULL

Down	NULL
,	NULL
down	NULL
she	NULL
slipped	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
slime	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
about	NULL
was	NULL
horror	NULL
--	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
chilly	NULL
waters	NULL
stung	NULL
her	NULL
knees	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
grip	NULL
she	NULL
seized	NULL
the	NULL
oak	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
hand	NULL
of	NULL
Elspeth	NULL
twisted	NULL
and	NULL
tore	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

Faint	NULL
,	NULL
afar	NULL
,	NULL
nearer	NULL
and	NULL
nearer	NULL
and	NULL
ever	NULL
mightier	NULL
,	NULL
rose	NULL
a	NULL
song	NULL
of	NULL
mystic	NULL
melody	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
heard	NULL
its	NULL
human	NULL
voice	NULL
and	NULL
sought	NULL
to	NULL
cry	NULL
aloud	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
strove	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
gripping	NULL
,	NULL
twisting	NULL
pain	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
awful	NULL
hand	NULL
--	NULL
until	NULL
the	NULL
shriek	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
awoke	NULL

She	NULL
lay	NULL
panting	NULL
and	NULL
sweating	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
bent	NULL
and	NULL
broken	NULL
roots	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
oak	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hand	NULL
of	NULL
Elspeth	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
song	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
rose	NULL
trembling	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
singing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Big	NULL
Meeting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
far	NULL
away	NULL

She	NULL

forgotten	NULL
this	NULL
religious	NULL
revival	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
hurried	NULL
preparation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
preacher	NULL
had	NULL
used	NULL
her	NULL
absence	NULL
and	NULL
apparent	NULL
indifference	NULL
against	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hand	NULL
of	NULL
Elspeth	NULL
was	NULL
reaching	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
grave	NULL
to	NULL
pull	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
dreaming	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

Drawing	NULL
her	NULL
shawl	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
hurried	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
highway	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
meeting	NULL
had	NULL
overflowed	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
and	NULL
spread	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
tops	NULL
of	NULL
young	NULL
trees	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
bent	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
interlaced	NULL
to	NULL
form	NULL
a	NULL
covering	NULL
and	NULL
benches	NULL
twined	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
trunks	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
and	NULL
wide	NULL
cathedral	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
green	NULL
and	NULL
silver	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
star-light	NULL
,	NULL
lay	NULL
packed	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
living	NULL
mass	NULL
of	NULL
black	NULL
folk	NULL
.	NULL

Flaming	NULL
pine	NULL
torches	NULL
burned	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
devotees	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
rhythm	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
stamping	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
shout	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
voices	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
wild	NULL
music	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
singing	NULL
shook	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

Four	NULL
hundred	NULL
people	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
their	NULL
knees	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
huge	NULL
black	NULL
preacher	NULL
,	NULL
uncoated	NULL
,	NULL
red-eyed	NULL
,	NULL
frenzied	NULL
,	NULL
stretched	NULL
his	NULL
long	NULL
arms	NULL
to	NULL
heaven	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
throng	NULL
from	NULL
afar	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hesitated	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
little	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
strange	NULL
faith	NULL
of	NULL
theirs	NULL
--	NULL
had	NULL
little	NULL
belief	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
mummery	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
herself	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
brought	NULL
up	NULL
almost	NULL
without	NULL
religion	NULL
save	NULL
some	NULL
few	NULL
mystic	NULL
remnants	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
half-forgotten	NULL
heathen	NULL
cult	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
little	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
of	NULL
religious	NULL
observance	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
moved	NULL
her	NULL
greatly	NULL
,	NULL
save	NULL
once	NULL
yonder	NULL
in	NULL
Washington	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
God	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
searching	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
seared	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
He	NULL
had	NULL
simply	NULL
pointed	NULL
the	NULL
Way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
was	NULL
human	NULL
.	NULL

Humanity	NULL
was	NULL
near	NULL
and	NULL
real	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
loved	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
talked	NULL
again	NULL
of	NULL
mere	NULL
men	NULL
would	NULL
these	NULL
devotees	NULL
listen	NULL
?	NULL

Already	NULL
the	NULL
minister	NULL
had	NULL
spied	NULL
her	NULL
tall	NULL
form	NULL
and	NULL
feared	NULL
her	NULL
power	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
set	NULL
his	NULL
powerful	NULL
voice	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
frenzy	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
hearers	NULL
to	NULL
crush	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

cried	NULL
the	NULL

Zora	NULL
stepped	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
circle	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
hush	NULL
fell	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
throng	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
preacher	NULL
paused	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
started	NULL
boldly	NULL
forward	NULL
with	NULL
upraised	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
thing	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
sharp	NULL
cry	NULL
arose	NULL
far	NULL
off	NULL
down	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
great	NULL
footsteps	NULL
coming	NULL
,	NULL
coming	NULL
as	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
swelled	NULL
a	NULL
rhythmical	NULL
chanting	NULL
,	NULL
wilder	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
primitive	NULL
than	NULL
song	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
it	NULL
swung	NULL
into	NULL
sight	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
led	NULL
the	NULL
band	NULL
--	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
massive	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
tufted	NULL
gray	NULL
hair	NULL
and	NULL
wrinkled	NULL
leathery	NULL
skin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
circle	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Zora	NULL
started	NULL
:	NULL
once	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
that	NULL
old	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
singing	NULL
stopped	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
straight	NULL
on	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
reached	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
side	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
whirled	NULL
and	NULL
spoke	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
words	NULL
leaped	NULL
and	NULL
flew	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
lashed	NULL
the	NULL
throng	NULL
with	NULL
bitter	NULL
fury	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
what	NULL
Zora	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
great	NULL
differences	NULL
:	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
their	NULL
religious	NULL
language	NULL
and	NULL
spoke	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
absolute	NULL
confidence	NULL
and	NULL
authority	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
secondly	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
each	NULL
one	NULL
there	NULL
personally	NULL
and	NULL
intimately	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
no	NULL
inchoate	NULL
throng	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
individually	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
listened	NULL
awestruck	NULL
and	NULL
fearsome	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
God	NULL

in	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
bent	NULL
forward	NULL
and	NULL
pointed	NULL
his	NULL
long	NULL

.	NULL

"	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL

drowned	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL

he	NULL
whirled	NULL
full	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
preacher	NULL
,	NULL
stamping	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
and	NULL
waving	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
anger	NULL
choked	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
fat	NULL
preacher	NULL
cowered	NULL
gray	NULL
and	NULL
trembling	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
gaunt	NULL
fanatic	NULL
towered	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

There	NULL
leapt	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL
a	NULL
denunciation	NULL
so	NULL
livid	NULL
,	NULL
specific	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
impassioned	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
preacher	NULL
squatted	NULL
and	NULL
bowed	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
finally	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
moaned	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
gaunt	NULL
speaker	NULL
turned	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
talked	NULL
of	NULL
little	NULL
children	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
pictured	NULL
their	NULL
sin	NULL
and	NULL
neglect	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
God	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
cried	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
wept	NULL
and	NULL
wailed	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
not	NULL

The	NULL
hour	NULL
was	NULL
halfway	NULL
between	NULL
midnight	NULL
and	NULL
dawn	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
leapt	NULL
frenziedly	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
feet	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Follow	NULL
me	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
shouted	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
singing	NULL
and	NULL
chanting	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
throng	NULL
poured	NULL
out	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
highway	NULL
,	NULL
waving	NULL
their	NULL
torches	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
knew	NULL
his	NULL
intention	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
half-dozen	NULL
of	NULL
younger	NULL
onlookers	NULL
she	NULL
unhitched	NULL
teams	NULL
and	NULL
rode	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
,	NULL
calling	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
cabins	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
sunrise	NULL
,	NULL
tools	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
axes	NULL
and	NULL
saws	NULL
and	NULL
hammers	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
noise	NULL
of	NULL
prayer	NULL
and	NULL
singing	NULL
filled	NULL
the	NULL
Sabbath	NULL
dawn	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
news	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
revival	NULL
spread	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
women	NULL
came	NULL
pouring	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
the	NULL
uproar	NULL
stopped	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
ringing	NULL
of	NULL
axes	NULL
and	NULL
grating	NULL
of	NULL
saws	NULL
and	NULL
tugging	NULL
of	NULL
mules	NULL
was	NULL
heard	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
forest	NULL
trembled	NULL
as	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
mighty	NULL
magic	NULL
,	NULL
swaying	NULL
and	NULL
falling	NULL
with	NULL
crash	NULL
on	NULL
crash	NULL
.	NULL

Huge	NULL
bonfires	NULL
blazed	NULL
and	NULL
crackled	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
a	NULL
wide	NULL
black	NULL
scar	NULL
appeared	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
thick	NULL
south	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
widened	NULL
and	NULL
widened	NULL
to	NULL
full	NULL
twenty	NULL
acres	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
rose	NULL
higher	NULL
and	NULL
higher	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
blazed	NULL
at	NULL
high	NULL
noon	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
workers	NULL
dropped	NULL
their	NULL
tools	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
aroma	NULL
of	NULL
coffee	NULL
and	NULL
roasting	NULL
meat	NULL
rose	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dim	NULL
cool	NULL
shade	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
ravenous	NULL
appetites	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
half-famished	NULL
throng	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
food	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
in	NULL
utter	NULL
weariness	NULL
stretched	NULL
themselves	NULL
and	NULL
slept	NULL
:	NULL
lying	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
like	NULL
huge	NULL
bronze	NULL
earth-spirits	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
against	NULL
trees	NULL
,	NULL
curled	NULL
in	NULL
dense	NULL
bushes	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
Zora	NULL
sat	NULL
above	NULL
them	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
high	NULL
rich-scented	NULL
pile	NULL
of	NULL
logs	NULL

Her	NULL
senses	NULL
slept	NULL
save	NULL
her	NULL
sleepless	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

Amid	NULL
a	NULL
silence	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
grove	NULL
that	NULL
still	NULL
stood	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
cabin	NULL
of	NULL
Elspeth	NULL
tremble	NULL

sigh	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
disappear	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
flew	NULL
some	NULL
spirit	NULL
of	NULL
evil	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lagoon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
Bles	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
standing	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
very	NULL
natural	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
closing	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
fell	NULL
asleep	NULL
.	NULL

_	NULL
Thirty-four	NULL
_	NULL
THE	NULL
RETURN	NULL
OF	NULL
ALWYN	NULL
Bles	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Harry	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
in	NULL
surprise	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
since	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
ball	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
startled	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
change	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
abundant	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
pale	NULL
and	NULL
drawn	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
little	NULL
wrinkles	NULL
below	NULL
her	NULL
sunken	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
those	NULL
eyes	NULL
lurked	NULL
the	NULL
tired	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bewildered	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
disappointed	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lofty	NULL
waiting-room	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Washington	NULL
station	NULL
where	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
a	NULL
friend	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
turned	NULL
and	NULL
recognized	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
genuine	NULL
pleasure	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
seemed	NULL
somehow	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
things	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
--	NULL
little	NULL
and	NULL
unimportant	NULL
perhaps	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
counted	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
firm	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
shook	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
cordially	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
minding	NULL
the	NULL
staring	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
bag	NULL
and	NULL
carried	NULL
it	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
observers	NULL
breathe	NULL
easier	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
servile	NULL
duty	NULL
.	NULL

Someway	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
just	NULL
how	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
telling	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
crisis	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
realized	NULL
;	NULL
not	NULL
everything	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
deal	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
from	NULL
another	NULL
world	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
outsider	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
one	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
understood	NULL
.	NULL

Both	NULL
from	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
recounted	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
he	NULL
gathered	NULL
the	NULL
substance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
bewildered	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
white	NULL
people	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
troubles	NULL
;	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
reflected	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
not	NULL
?	NULL

They	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
human	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
suppose	NULL
you	NULL
hear	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
ventured	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
pause	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
,	NULL
yes	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
directly	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
Zora	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Bles	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Zora	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
.	NULL

Did	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
here	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
has	NULL
gone	NULL
back	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
opened	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
crowd	NULL
surged	NULL
through	NULL
,	NULL
sweeping	NULL
them	NULL
apart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
next	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

Alwyn	NULL
turned	NULL
slowly	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
forgot	NULL
the	NULL
friend	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
forgot	NULL
everything	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
rose	NULL
shadowy	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pale	NULL
concourse	NULL
,	NULL
swaying	NULL
in	NULL
ghostly	NULL
breezes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
purple	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
flowers	NULL
mingled	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
silver	NULL
radiance	NULL
of	NULL
tendrils	NULL
that	NULL
trembled	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
hurrying	NULL
throng	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
threads	NULL
of	NULL
mists	NULL
along	NULL
low	NULL
hills	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
its	NULL
midst	NULL
rose	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
,	NULL
slim	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
quivering	NULL
form	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
here	NULL
--	NULL
here	NULL
in	NULL
Washington	NULL
!	NULL

Why	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
known	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
doing	NULL
?	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL
has	NULL
gone	NULL
back	NULL
now	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Sun	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Swamp	NULL
,	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Burden	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
he	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
on	NULL
thinking	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
failed	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
apparent	NULL
success	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL
sudden	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
overwhelming	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
faced	NULL
the	NULL
crisis	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
had	NULL
trembled	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
chosen	NULL
the	NULL
Right	NULL
--	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
Right	NULL
was	NULL
ineffective	NULL
,	NULL
impotent	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
ludicrous	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
shorn	NULL
,	NULL
powerless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
moral	NULL
revolt	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
world	NULL
had	NULL
suddenly	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
vision	NULL
of	NULL
Carrie	NULL
Wynn	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
clerk	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
insignificant	NULL
cog	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
grinding	NULL
wheel	NULL
of	NULL
humdrum	NULL
drudgery	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
chance	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
and	NULL
thereby	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Zora	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
South	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
shuddered	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
sees	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
black	NULL
pool	NULL
whither	NULL
his	NULL
path	NULL
leads	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
face	NULL
the	NULL
proscription	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
insult	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
lawless	NULL
hate	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
South	NULL
again	NULL
--	NULL
never	NULL
!	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
home	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
wrote	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
reply	NULL
that	NULL
came	NULL
after	NULL
some	NULL
delay	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
curt	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
answered	NULL
few	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
questions	NULL
,	NULL
argued	NULL
with	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
doubts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
mention	NULL
of	NULL
Zora	NULL
.	NULL

Yes	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
need	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
manager	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
farm	NULL
and	NULL
settlement	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
sure	NULL
whether	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
salary	NULL
was	NULL
meagre	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
hard	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
wished	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
decide	NULL
immediately	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
weeks	NULL
later	NULL
found	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
facing	NULL
Southward	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Jim	NULL
Crow	NULL
car	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
decided	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
South	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
decided	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
sat	NULL
helpless	NULL
and	NULL
inactive	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
grip	NULL
of	NULL
great	NULL
and	NULL
shadowed	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
incomprehensible	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
so	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
vision	NULL
Zora	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
real	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
felt	NULL
strangely	NULL
disappointed	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
no	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
greeting	NULL
on	NULL
recognition	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
other	NULL
ways	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
creature	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
frankly	NULL
and	NULL
greeted	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
gladness	NULL
shining	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
looking	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
gladness	NULL
and	NULL
saying	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
was	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
knees	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dirt	NULL
with	NULL
outstretched	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
somehow	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
corresponding	NULL
mental	NULL
attitude	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
physical	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
was	NULL
marvellous	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
well-rounded	NULL
and	NULL
poised	NULL
,	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
straight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
quick	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
went	NULL
mental	NULL
change	NULL
:	NULL
a	NULL
self-mastery	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
veiling	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
self	NULL
even	NULL
in	NULL
intimate	NULL
talk	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
subtle	NULL
air	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
looking	NULL
from	NULL
great	NULL
and	NULL
unreachable	NULL
heights	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
dawn	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
known	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
noted	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
and	NULL
realized	NULL
the	NULL
transformation	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pang	NULL
--	NULL
something	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
innocence	NULL
and	NULL
wonder	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
place	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
up	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
incomprehensible	NULL
and	NULL
occult	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
easily	NULL
questioned	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
no	NULL
hints	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
no	NULL
information	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
once	NULL
he	NULL
hazarded	NULL
some	NULL
pointed	NULL
questions	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
abruptly	NULL
,	NULL
observing	NULL
acidly	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
If	NULL
I	NULL
were	NULL
you	NULL
I	NULL
'd	NULL
think	NULL
less	NULL
of	NULL
Zora	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Gradually	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
spiritual	NULL
perplexity	NULL
,	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
Mary	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
staying	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
at	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
Oaks	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
coming	NULL
South	NULL
was	NULL
supposed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
solely	NULL
for	NULL
reasons	NULL
of	NULL
health	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
appearance	NULL
made	NULL
this	NULL
excuse	NULL
plausible	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
lonely	NULL
and	NULL
restless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
naturally	NULL
drawn	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
intercourse	NULL
with	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
formal	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
grew	NULL
.	NULL

Down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cleared	NULL
space	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
a	NULL
log	NULL
cabin	NULL
;	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
low	NULL
,	NULL
spacious	NULL
,	NULL
overhung	NULL
with	NULL
oak	NULL
and	NULL
pine	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
centre	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
settlement-work	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
she	NULL
lived	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
half-dozen	NULL
orphan	NULL
girls	NULL
and	NULL
children	NULL
too	NULL
young	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
boarding	NULL
department	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
easily	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
habit	NULL
of	NULL
walking	NULL
by	NULL
here	NULL
each	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
coming	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
avenue	NULL
of	NULL
oaks	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
and	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
little	NULL
of	NULL
Zora	NULL
personally	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
girls	NULL
and	NULL
learned	NULL
much	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
plans	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rooms	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cottage	NULL
were	NULL
clean	NULL
and	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
supplied	NULL
with	NULL
books	NULL
and	NULL
pictures	NULL
,	NULL
simple	NULL
toys	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
phonograph	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
yard	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
wide	NULL
green	NULL
and	NULL
golden	NULL
play-ground	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
the	NULL
music	NULL
of	NULL
children	NULL
's	NULL
glad	NULL
crooning	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
singing	NULL
of	NULL
girls	NULL
went	NULL
echoing	NULL
and	NULL
trembling	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
played	NULL
and	NULL
sewed	NULL
and	NULL
washed	NULL
and	NULL
worked	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
Cresswells	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Maxwells	NULL
and	NULL
others	NULL
came	NULL
loads	NULL
of	NULL
clothes	NULL
for	NULL
washing	NULL
and	NULL
mending	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Tolliver	NULL
girls	NULL
had	NULL
simple	NULL
dresses	NULL
made	NULL
,	NULL
embroidery	NULL
was	NULL
ordered	NULL
from	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
gardens	NULL
and	NULL
cotton	NULL
fields	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
would	NULL
saunter	NULL
down	NULL
of	NULL
mornings	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
girls	NULL
and	NULL
play	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
;	NULL
sometimes	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
sit	NULL
hidden	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
forest	NULL
,	NULL
listening	NULL
and	NULL
glimpsing	NULL
and	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
whirled	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
danced	NULL
red	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
today	NULL
she	NULL
rose	NULL
wearily	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
near	NULL
noon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
started	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
swing	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
dining-room	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
charge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
students	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
noonday	NULL
meal	NULL
.	NULL

Alwyn	NULL
wanted	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
's	NULL
judgment	NULL
and	NULL
advice	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
growing	NULL
doubtful	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
estimate	NULL
of	NULL
women	NULL
.	NULL

Evidently	NULL
something	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
standards	NULL
was	NULL
wrong	NULL
;	NULL
consequently	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
opportunities	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
with	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
hoping	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
bring	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
of	NULL
Zora	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
accord	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
cares	NULL
and	NULL
troubles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
too	NULL
glad	NULL
of	NULL
willing	NULL
and	NULL
sympathetic	NULL
ears	NULL
into	NULL
which	NULL
to	NULL
pour	NULL
her	NULL
thoughts	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
soon	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
on	NULL
these	NULL
conversations	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
uneasiness	NULL
.	NULL

Black	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
women	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
talk	NULL
together	NULL
casually	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
South	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
far	NULL
the	NULL
North	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
notions	NULL
in	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
's	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

Today	NULL
both	NULL
met	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
almost	NULL
eagerly	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
news	NULL
which	NULL
only	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
fully	NULL
appreciate	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Have	NULL
you	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Vanderpools	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
--	NULL
except	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
appointed	NULL
and	NULL
confirmed	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
arrived	NULL
in	NULL
France	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
died	NULL
of	NULL
apoplexy	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
added	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
wrong	NULL
and	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
hope	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
not	NULL
glad	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
leapt	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
a	NULL
hypothetical	NULL
question	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
curious	NULL
situation	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
characteristic	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
brood	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
restlessly	NULL
to	NULL
seek	NULL
relief	NULL
in	NULL
consulting	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
person	NULL
near	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
her	NULL
story	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
open	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
again	NULL
today	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
mind	NULL
full	NULL
,	NULL
spoke	NULL
first	NULL
and	NULL
rapidly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
know	NULL
more	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
endure	NULL
this	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
beneath	NULL
her	NULL
apparent	NULL
frankness	NULL
was	NULL
impenetrable	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
carefully	NULL
avoided	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
deftly	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
observed	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
still	NULL
systematically	NULL
snubbed	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
broached	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
of	NULL
Zora	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
others	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
seemed	NULL
too	NULL
delicate	NULL
and	NULL
sacred	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
always	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
awful	NULL
dread	NULL
lest	NULL
sometime	NULL
,	NULL
somewhere	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
and	NULL
fatal	NULL
word	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
dropped	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
breath	NULL
of	NULL
evil	NULL
gossip	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
shatter	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
hated	NULL
to	NULL
obtrude	NULL
his	NULL
troubles	NULL
on	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
seemed	NULL
so	NULL
torn	NULL
in	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
today	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
speak	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
time	NULL
pressed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
hurriedly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
there	NULL
's	NULL
a	NULL
matter	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
personal	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
dinner-bell	NULL
rang	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
stopped	NULL
,	NULL
vexed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Come	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
this	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
away	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Then	NULL
she	NULL
paused	NULL
abruptly	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
strange	NULL
startling	NULL
thought	NULL
flashed	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
brain	NULL
.	NULL

Alwyn	NULL
noticed	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thanked	NULL
her	NULL
cordially	NULL
and	NULL
hurried	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
dining-hall	NULL
,	NULL
meeting	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
on	NULL
horseback	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
gate	NULL
.	NULL

Mary	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
walked	NULL
slowly	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
flushing	NULL
and	NULL
paling	NULL
by	NULL
turns	NULL
.	NULL

Could	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
Negro	NULL
had	NULL
dared	NULL
to	NULL
misunderstand	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
had	NULL
presumed	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
reviewed	NULL
her	NULL
conduct	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
indiscreet	NULL
in	NULL
thus	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
confidant	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
trouble	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
student	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
confidential	NULL
servant	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
remembered	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
's	NULL
warning	NULL
of	NULL
years	NULL
before	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
North	NULL
since	NULL
and	NULL
acquired	NULL
Northern	NULL
notions	NULL
of	NULL
freedom	NULL
and	NULL
equality	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
bit	NULL
her	NULL
lip	NULL
cruelly	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
mused	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
blame	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
unwittingly	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
intimacy	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
Negro	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
on	NULL
every	NULL
white	NULL
woman	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
goddess	NULL
and	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
fawn	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
encouragement	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
here	NULL
to	NULL
confide	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
her	NULL
troubles	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
must	NULL
suspect	NULL
.	NULL

Harry	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
,	NULL
apparently	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
nothing	NULL
home	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
quarrel	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
neighbors	NULL
behaved	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
her	NULL
excuse	NULL
of	NULL
ill-health	NULL
were	NULL
sufficient	NULL
to	NULL
account	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
return	NULL
South	NULL
to	NULL
escape	NULL
the	NULL
rigors	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Northern	NULL
winter	NULL
.	NULL

Alwyn	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
really	NULL
knew	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
blindness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
right	NULL
it	NULL
quietly	NULL
and	NULL
quickly	NULL
with	NULL
hard	NULL
ruthless	NULL
plainness	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
blushed	NULL
again	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
shame	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
excuse	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
worse	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
or	NULL
an	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
sin	NULL
that	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
simply	NULL
ignorant	NULL
presumption	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
correct	NULL
him	NULL
firmly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
gently	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
a	NULL
crazy	NULL
muddle	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
!	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Harry	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tale	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
flitting	NULL
ghosts	NULL
that	NULL
awful	NULL
night	NULL
in	NULL
Washington	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Miss	NULL
Wynn	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
jilted	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
and	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
bad	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
a	NULL
world	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
how	NULL
far	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
black	NULL
boy	NULL
wrong	NULL
?	NULL

Just	NULL
then	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
rode	NULL
up	NULL
behind	NULL
and	NULL
greeted	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
started	NULL
almost	NULL
guiltily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
awkwardness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
position	NULL
reddened	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
neck	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Colonel	NULL
dismounted	NULL
,	NULL
despite	NULL
her	NULL
protest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
chatted	NULL
along	NULL
indifferently	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
crops	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
brother	NULL
's	NULL
new	NULL
baby	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
proposed	NULL
mill	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mary	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
abruptly	NULL
struck	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
note	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
you	NULL
talk	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
nigger	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
continued	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
you	NULL
're	NULL
Northern	NULL
born	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
teacher	NULL
in	NULL

school	NULL

feel	NULL
differently	NULL
from	NULL
us	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
ways	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
mark	NULL
what	NULL
I	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
nigger	NULL
will	NULL
presume	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
pretext	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
keep	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
are	NULL
a	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
now	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
She	NULL
smiled	NULL
bitterly	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
noticed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
are	NULL
a	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
caught	NULL
Harry	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
deviltry	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
started	NULL
,	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
got	NULL
miffed	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
'll	NULL
all	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

You	NULL
're	NULL
a	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
hold	NULL
yourself	NULL
too	NULL
high	NULL
to	NULL
'	NULL
Mister	NULL
'	NULL
a	NULL
nigger	NULL
or	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
dream	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
equality	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
pleasantly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
sharp	NULL
insistence	NULL
that	NULL
struck	NULL
a	NULL
note	NULL
of	NULL
fear	NULL
in	NULL
Mary	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
writing	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
no	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
note	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
unwise	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
and	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
lunched	NULL
rather	NULL
silently	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
must	NULL
get	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
finally	NULL
announced	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
The	NULL
mill	NULL
directors	NULL
meet	NULL
today	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Maxwell	NULL
calls	NULL
by	NULL
about	NULL
that	NULL
lumber	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
away	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
scarcely	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
highway	NULL
and	NULL
ridden	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
or	NULL
so	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
spied	NULL
Bles	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
hurrying	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
Oaks	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
frowned	NULL
and	NULL
rode	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
reining	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
horse	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
stopped	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
and	NULL
watched	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
here	NULL
that	NULL
Zora	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
stopped	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
saw	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
watching	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
planning	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
cut	NULL
timber	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
land	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
legal	NULL
right	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
hers	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
claim	NULL
half	NULL
,	NULL
treating	NULL
her	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
tenant	NULL
.	NULL

Seeing	NULL
him	NULL
watching	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
she	NULL
paused	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shadow	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
,	NULL
fearing	NULL
trouble	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
continued	NULL
conversations	NULL
of	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
were	NULL
indiscreet	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
hoped	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
attracted	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL
else	NULL
's	NULL
attention	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
she	NULL
feared	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
was	NULL
suspicious	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
sank	NULL
.	NULL

Alwyn	NULL
went	NULL
straight	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
disappeared	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
oak	NULL
avenue	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
waited	NULL
but	NULL
Zora	NULL
waited	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
.	NULL

Alwyn	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
warned	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL
reach	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
's	NULL
mansion	NULL
before	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
did	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
him	NULL
seeing	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
meant	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
detour	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
to	NULL
approach	NULL
the	NULL
Oaks	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
west	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
silently	NULL
gathered	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
skirts	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
quickly	NULL
and	NULL
carefully	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
lithe	NULL
and	NULL
vigorous	NULL
,	NULL
living	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
air	NULL
and	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
walking	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
hearing	NULL
she	NULL
threw	NULL
away	NULL
her	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
bending	NULL
forward	NULL
ran	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
ran	NULL
easily	NULL
and	NULL
swiftly	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
grew	NULL
dizzy	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
still	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
in	NULL
solemn	NULL
grandeur	NULL
marching	NULL
past	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
solemn	NULL
mocking	NULL
grandeur	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
loosened	NULL
her	NULL
dress	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
neck	NULL
and	NULL
flew	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sped	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
oaks	NULL
,	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
terraces	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
slowing	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
unsteady	NULL
walk	NULL
,	NULL
staggered	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
wonder	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
being	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
and	NULL
sorted	NULL
the	NULL
linen	NULL
and	NULL
piled	NULL
the	NULL
baskets	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
girls	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
entered	NULL
a	NULL
side	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Colonel	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
sounded	NULL
impatiently	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
hall	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mary	NULL
!	NULL

Mary	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

A	NULL
pause	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
an	NULL
answer	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
father	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
started	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
stairway	NULL
and	NULL
Zora	NULL
hurried	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
narrow	NULL
back	NULL
stairs	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
overturning	NULL
a	NULL
servant	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'm	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
explained	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
landing	NULL
just	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
's	NULL
head	NULL
rising	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
staircase	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
bound	NULL
she	NULL
almost	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
room	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
.	NULL

Bles	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
had	NULL
hurried	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
dinner	NULL
duties	NULL
and	NULL
hastened	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Oaks	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
questions	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
doubts	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
uncertainty	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
were	NULL
clamoring	NULL
for	NULL
utterance	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
much	NULL
had	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
ever	NULL
known	NULL
of	NULL
Zora	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
was	NULL
Zora	NULL
now	NULL
?	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
talked	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
watched	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
think	NULL
?	NULL

Thus	NULL
he	NULL
formulated	NULL
his	NULL
questions	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
timid	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fearful	NULL
in	NULL
putting	NULL
them	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
,	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
panic-stricken	NULL
.	NULL

Probably	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
beat	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
bush	NULL
seeking	NULL
further	NULL
encouragement	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
slightest	NULL
indication	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
crush	NULL
him	NULL
ruthlessly	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
point	NULL
the	NULL
path	NULL
of	NULL
duty	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
some	NULL
good	NULL
girl	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
Zora	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

Somehow	NULL
Zora	NULL
seemed	NULL
too	NULL
unusual	NULL
and	NULL
strange	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
too	NULL
inhuman	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Mary	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
judged	NULL
humanity	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
glanced	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
seat	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
upper	NULL
verandah	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
porch	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
coming	NULL
.	NULL

Where	NULL
should	NULL
she	NULL
receive	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
porch	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
Mr.	NULL
Maxwell	NULL
ride	NULL
up	NULL
?	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
parlor	NULL
and	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
servants	NULL
astounded	NULL
and	NULL
talking	NULL
?	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
the	NULL
servants	NULL
would	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
some	NULL
work	NULL
or	NULL
fetching	NULL
something	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
greeted	NULL
him	NULL
briefly	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL

Mrs.	NULL

rushed	NULL
out	NULL

answered	NULL

hesitated	NULL

Then	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL

flash	NULL

she	NULL
realized	NULL
what	NULL
her	NULL

her	NULL
heart	NULL
paused	NULL

Cresswell	NULL
strode	NULL
up	NULL

then	NULL

He	NULL
deliberately	NULL
placed	NULL
his	NULL

in	NULL
his	NULL

threw	NULL
open	NULL

Mary	NULL

stood	NULL
frozen	NULL

The	NULL

the	NULL

burst	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL

something	NULL
worse	NULL
than	NULL

She	NULL
listened	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
crack	NULL

She	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
bird	NULL
singing	NULL
far	NULL
down	NULL

she	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL

Mary	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL

giving	NULL
way	NULL
within	NULL

She	NULL
swayed	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL

emerge	NULL
calmly	NULL
from	NULL

carrying	NULL
a	NULL

Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL

Zora	NULL
instinctively	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
and	NULL
fastened	NULL
her	NULL
dress	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL

scowled	NULL

easily	NULL
won	NULL
over	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
departed	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
.	NULL

Colton	NULL
was	NULL
suspicious	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sentiment	NULL
of	NULL
joining	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Negroes	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
arouse	NULL
the	NULL
bitter	NULL
resentment	NULL
he	NULL
expected	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
even	NULL
came	NULL
whispers	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
ears	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
sold	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
landlords	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL
truth	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
report	NULL
to	NULL
scare	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
to	NULL
both	NULL
parties	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
uncomfortable	NULL
spectre	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
both	NULL
sides	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
ghost	NULL
.	NULL

Particularly	NULL
was	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
stirred	NULL
to	NULL
action	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
realized	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
Bles	NULL
and	NULL
Zora	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dealing	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
younger	NULL
class	NULL
of	NULL
educated	NULL
black	NULL
folk	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
learning	NULL
to	NULL
fight	NULL
with	NULL
new	NULL
weapons	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
dissolute	NULL
and	NULL
weak	NULL
as	NULL
their	NULL
parents	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
shrewder	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
aspiring	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
crushed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
crushed	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
this	NULL
end	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
recourse	NULL
to	NULL
two	NULL
sources	NULL
of	NULL
help	NULL
--	NULL
Johnson	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
whites	NULL
in	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

Johnson	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
repeatedly	NULL
called	NULL
"	NULL
a	NULL
faithful	NULL
nigger	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
constitutionally	NULL
timid	NULL
creatures	NULL
into	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
servility	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fathers	NULL
had	NULL
sunk	NULL
so	NULL
deep	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
second-nature	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
archangel	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
Cresswells	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
masters	NULL

stood	NULL
for	NULL
God	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
served	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
dog-like	NULL
faith	NULL
,	NULL
asking	NULL
no	NULL
reward	NULL

and	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
gave	NULL
in	NULL
reverence	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL

he	NULL
took	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
contempt	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
fellows	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
niggers	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
applied	NULL
the	NULL
epithet	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
contempt	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
himself	NULL
could	NULL
express	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
the	NULL
Negroes	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
"	NULL
white	NULL

"	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
despised	NULL

feared	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
him	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
pregnant	NULL
directions	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
rode	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
Taylor	NULL
again	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fears	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
labor	NULL
movement	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
include	NULL
whites	NULL

Taylor	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
any	NULL
great	NULL
danger	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
conceded	NULL

"	NULL

'll	NULL

shook	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL

he	NULL
insisted	NULL

Taylor	NULL
looked	NULL
puzzled	NULL

"	NULL

Taylor	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
follow	NULL
this	NULL
reasoning	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
aristocracy	NULL

alone	NULL

secretly	NULL
despised	NULL

If	NULL

Taylor	NULL
was	NULL
willing	NULL

anxious	NULL
to	NULL
open	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL

him	NULL

South	NULL

both	NULL

to	NULL

he	NULL
simply	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL

The	NULL
weak	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
ignorant	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
races	NULL
he	NULL
despised	NULL

had	NULL
no	NULL

them	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL

he	NULL
persisted	NULL

Colonel	NULL

replied	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

he	NULL
's	NULL

"	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
stalked	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
sensed	NULL
fully	NULL
the	NULL
situation	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
anticipate	NULL
any	NULL
immediate	NULL
understanding	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
laboring	NULL
whites	NULL

but	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
eventually	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
inevitable	NULL
.	NULL

Meantime	NULL
the	NULL
Negro	NULL
must	NULL
strengthen	NULL
himself	NULL
and	NULL
bring	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
alliance	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
independent	NULL
economic	NULL
strength	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
development	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
plans	NULL
she	NULL
needed	NULL
Bles	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
's	NULL
constant	NULL
cooperation	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
business	NULL
manager	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
doing	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
wanted	NULL
to	NULL
point	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
larger	NULL
field	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
uncertain	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
attitude	NULL
toward	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
act	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
flash	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
imminent	NULL
tragedy	NULL
at	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
Oaks	NULL
had	NULL
cleared	NULL
the	NULL

with	NULL
all	NULL

The	NULL
very	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
Zora	NULL
chose	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
Bles	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
new	NULL
home	NULL

grounds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
frankly	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

They	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL

examined	NULL
the	NULL
proposed	NULL
farm	NULL
sites	NULL

and	NULL
viewed	NULL
the	NULL
living-room	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
central	NULL
house	NULL
and	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
living-room	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
out	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
porch	NULL
,	NULL
beyond	NULL
which	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
porch	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
building	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
ceiled	NULL
in	NULL
dark	NULL
yellow	NULL
pine	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
figured	NULL
denim	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL

A	NULL
straight	NULL
desk	NULL
of	NULL
rough	NULL
hewn	NULL
wood	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
white-curtained	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
couch	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
large	NULL
easy-chairs	NULL
faced	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
narrow	NULL
fireplace	NULL
of	NULL
uneven	NULL
stone	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
thick	NULL
green	NULL
rag-carpet	NULL
covered	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
pictures	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
walls	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
Madonna	NULL

a	NULL
scene	NULL
of	NULL
mad	NULL
careering	NULL
horses	NULL

and	NULL
some	NULL
sad	NULL
baby	NULL
faces	NULL

The	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
unity	NULL
;	NULL
things	NULL
fitted	NULL
together	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
belonged	NULL
together	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
restful	NULL
and	NULL
beautiful	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
cheerful	NULL
pine	NULL
blaze	NULL
before	NULL
which	NULL
Miss	NULL
Smith	NULL
was	NULL
sitting	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL
square-paned	NULL
window	NULL
that	NULL
let	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
crimson	NULL
rays	NULL
of	NULL
gathering	NULL

All	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
stopping	NULL
only	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
fireplace	NULL
,	NULL
ran	NULL
low	NULL
shelves	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
yellow	NULL
pine	NULL
,	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
books	NULL
and	NULL

He	NULL
scanned	NULL
curiously	NULL

"	NULL
This	NULL

my	NULL
university	NULL

"	NULL
Zora	NULL
explained	NULL
,	NULL
smiling	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
interested	NULL
survey	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
wandered	NULL
down	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
lagoon	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL
,	NULL
Bles	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL

"	NULL
since	NULL
we	NULL

can	NULL
we	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
spoke	NULL
simply	NULL
and	NULL
frankly	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
apparent	NULL
effort	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
talked	NULL
on	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
and	NULL
vision	NULL
.	NULL

Somehow	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
mental	NULL
attitude	NULL
toward	NULL
Zora	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
been	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
guidance	NULL
,	NULL
guardianship	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
instruction	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
judging	NULL
and	NULL
weighing	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
on	NULL
high	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
thoughts	NULL
of	NULL
uplift	NULL
and	NULL
development	NULL
.	NULL

Always	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
holding	NULL
her	NULL
dark	NULL
little	NULL
hands	NULL
to	NULL
lead	NULL
her	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
always	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
in	NULL
senseless	NULL
anger	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
half	NULL
forgotten	NULL
and	NULL
deserted	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
vision	NULL
of	NULL
elder	NULL
brotherhood	NULL
had	NULL
still	NULL
remained	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
this	NULL
attitude	NULL
was	NULL
being	NULL
revolutionized	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
proposing	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
plan	NULL
of	NULL
wide	NULL
scope	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
bold	NULL
regeneration	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
plan	NULL
carefully	NULL
studied	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
long	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
and	NULL
read	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
co-worker	NULL
--	NULL
nay	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
follower	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
ignorant	NULL
of	NULL
much	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
hesitated	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
utter	NULL
unworthiness	NULL
overwhelmed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
and	NULL
judge	NULL
this	NULL
unselfish	NULL
woman	NULL
?	NULL

Who	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
to	NULL
falter	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
called	NULL
?	NULL

A	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
smallness	NULL
and	NULL
narrowness	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
priggish	NULL
blindness	NULL
,	NULL
rose	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
mockery	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
thing	NULL
alone	NULL
held	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
:	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
unwilling	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
simply	NULL
human	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
learner	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
follower	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
would	NULL
he	NULL
as	NULL
such	NULL
ever	NULL
command	NULL
the	NULL
love	NULL
and	NULL
respect	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
new	NULL
and	NULL
inexplicable	NULL
woman	NULL
?	NULL

Would	NULL
not	NULL
comradeship	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
basis	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
friendship	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
insisted	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
death	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
and	NULL
thoughts	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
?	NULL

Thus	NULL
he	NULL
hesitated	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
lay	NULL
clear	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
her	NULL
direst	NULL
need	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
deserted	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
destruction	NULL
and	NULL
expected	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
a	NULL
superhuman	NULL
miracle	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
and	NULL
seated	NULL
herself	NULL
above	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
working	NULL
;	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
work	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
asked	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
help	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
killed	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
and	NULL
new-born	NULL
dream	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
well	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
punishment	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
the	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
readjustment	NULL
was	NULL
hard	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
gradually	NULL
,	NULL
inwardly	NULL
revolting	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
always	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
longing	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
this	NULL
woman	NULL
and	NULL

THE	NULL

Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
started	NULL
all	NULL

grimly	NULL
to	NULL
overthrow	NULL

somewhere	NULL
down	NULL
beneath	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL

pity	NULL

were	NULL
stirring	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL

useless	NULL
struggle	NULL

raise	NULL

wonder	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL

unthinkable	NULL

even	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
squared	NULL

cheated	NULL
Zora	NULL
deliberately	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL

He	NULL
placed	NULL
every	NULL

Here	NULL
Johnson	NULL

the	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
among	NULL

hear	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL
meeting	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

Zora	NULL

Aunt	NULL
Rachel	NULL
came	NULL
early	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
cheery	NULL
voice	NULL

which	NULL
faded	NULL
so	NULL
quickly	NULL
to	NULL
lines	NULL

sorrow	NULL

then	NULL
twinkled	NULL

Zora	NULL

she	NULL
gave	NULL

Tylor	NULL

nearly	NULL

I	NULL

the	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL

In	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
the	NULL
storehouse	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tenants	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
twenty	NULL
acres	NULL
of	NULL

,	NULL
attended	NULL
to	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
voluntary	NULL
labor	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
tenants	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
soon	NULL
bearing	NULL
a	NULL
magnificent	NULL
crop	NULL
.	NULL

Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
inspected	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
crops	NULL
daily	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
proprietary	NULL
air	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
natural	NULL
had	NULL
these	NULL

been	NULL
simply	NULL
tenants	NULL

and	NULL
as	NULL
such	NULL
he	NULL
persisted	NULL
in	NULL
regarding	NULL
them	NULL

The	NULL
cotton	NULL
now	NULL
growing	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
uniformly	NULL
fine	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
acre	NULL
of	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
unusual	NULL
height	NULL

thickness	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
At	NULL
least	NULL
a	NULL
bale	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
acre	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
estimated	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Colonel	NULL
mentally	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
two-thirds	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
crop	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
decided	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
evict	NULL
Zora	NULL
immediately	NULL
;	NULL
since	NULL
sufficient	NULL
land	NULL
was	NULL
cleared	NULL
already	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
purposes	NULL

moreover	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
with	NULL
consternation	NULL
a	NULL
herd	NULL
of	NULL
cattle	NULL
grazing	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
field	NULL
on	NULL
some	NULL
early	NULL
green	NULL
stuff	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
drove	NULL
of	NULL
hogs	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
an	NULL
example	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
tenants	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Black	NULL
Belt	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
fatal	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
must	NULL
wait	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
pick	NULL
the	NULL
cotton	NULL
--	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
fighting	NULL
the	NULL
battle	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
color	NULL

caste	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
children	NULL
sang	NULL
merrily	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
brown-white	NULL
field	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wide	NULL
baskets	NULL

poised	NULL
aloft	NULL

foamed	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
erect	NULL

swaying	NULL
bodies	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
carriers	NULL

The	NULL
crop	NULL
throughout	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
was	NULL
short	NULL
that	NULL
year	NULL

for	NULL

had	NULL
ruled	NULL
low	NULL
last	NULL

in	NULL

the	NULL
policy	NULL

Combine	NULL

This	NULL
year	NULL
they	NULL
started	NULL
high	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Would	NULL
they	NULL
fall	NULL

Many	NULL
thought	NULL
so	NULL

hastened	NULL
to	NULL
sell	NULL

Alwyn	NULL
gathered	NULL

Within	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
was	NULL
called	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
filed	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
courtroom	NULL

Cresswell	NULL

saw	NULL
only	NULL
this	NULL
black	NULL
woman	NULL
--	NULL
no	NULL

or	NULL

of	NULL
one	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
represent	NULL

The	NULL

soon	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
lazy	NULL
,	NULL
tobacco-chewing	NULL
throng	NULL
of	NULL
white	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
blacks	NULL
whispered	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
corner	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dirty	NULL
stove	NULL
was	NULL
glowing	NULL
with	NULL
pine-wood	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Judge	NULL
sat	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
desk	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Where	NULL

returned	NULL
Zora	NULL

rising	NULL

There	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
silence	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
court	NULL

Her	NULL
voice	NULL
was	NULL
low	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
leaned	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL

The	NULL
Judge	NULL
felt	NULL
impelled	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
over-gruff	NULL

Cresswell	NULL
's	NULL

smiled	NULL
and	NULL
leaned	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
easier	NULL
than	NULL
he	NULL
supposed	NULL

Evidently	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
believed	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL

proceeded	NULL

stated	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
how	NULL

her	NULL

served	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

quickly	NULL

arose	NULL

Taylor	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL

at	NULL
Cresswell	NULL

some	NULL
inkling	NULL

Taylor	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL

never	NULL

his	NULL

utterly	NULL

leaning	NULL
forward	NULL

rapped	NULL

anger	NULL

against	NULL
John	NULL

Wind	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
estrangement	NULL
flew	NULL
over	NULL

The	NULL

saw	NULL
a	NULL

the	NULL

paid	NULL

The	NULL
sheriff	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL

believed	NULL

the	NULL

The	NULL
atmosphere	NULL

the	NULL
town	NULL

began	NULL

change	NULL

Whatever	NULL

arisen	NULL
now	NULL
quickly	NULL
disappeared	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
white	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

she	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
fragile	NULL

she	NULL
also	NULL
looked	NULL

her	NULL

But	NULL
Mrs.	NULL

found	NULL
her	NULL

began	NULL

trying	NULL

Her	NULL
humiliation	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
episode	NULL
at	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
Oaks	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
complete	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
her	NULL
whole	NULL
life	NULL
punishment	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
persistent	NULL
misunderstanding	NULL

Zora	NULL

her	NULL

a	NULL
new	NULL

glorified	NULL
light	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
vigorous	NULL

refused	NULL

this	NULL
again	NULL

Zora	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
outgrown	NULL
the	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL

Alwyn	NULL

No	NULL

she	NULL

sure	NULL
that	NULL

the	NULL
ideal	NULL

She	NULL
compared	NULL
herself	NULL

Helen	NULL
Cresswell	NULL

Helen	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
contented	NULL

From	NULL

Zora	NULL

Bles	NULL

Emma	NULL
's	NULL

Emma	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
unemotional	NULL

did	NULL
much	NULL

Zora	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL

four	NULL

beds	NULL

a	NULL

an	NULL
office	NULL

The	NULL

white	NULL
physician	NULL
in	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
fresh	NULL
from	NULL
school	NULL
in	NULL
Atlanta	NULL

became	NULL
interested	NULL

advice	NULL

suggestions	NULL
.	NULL

Meantime	NULL
John	NULL
Taylor	NULL
's	NULL
troubles	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
increase	NULL
.	NULL

Under	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
political	NULL
regime	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
an	NULL
easy	NULL
matter	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
serious	NULL
damage-suits	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
accidents	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mill	NULL
.	NULL

Much	NULL
child	NULL
labor	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
lack	NULL
of	NULL
protective	NULL
devices	NULL
made	NULL
accidents	NULL
painfully	NULL
frequent	NULL
.	NULL

Taylor	NULL
insisted	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
chief	NULL
cause	NULL
was	NULL
carelessness	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
mill	NULL
hands	NULL
alleged	NULL
criminal	NULL
neglect	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
part	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
labor	NULL
officials	NULL
took	NULL
charge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
court	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
break	NULL
occurred	NULL
between	NULL
Colonel	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
son-in-law	NULL
,	NULL
Taylor	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
several	NULL
damage-suits	NULL
were	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
cost	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
considerable	NULL
sum	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
determined	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
bad	NULL
feelings	NULL
go	NULL
too	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
particularly	NULL
distressing	NULL
accident	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
girl	NULL
took	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
showed	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
usual	NULL
interest	NULL
and	NULL
offered	NULL
to	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
new	NULL
young	NULL
physician	NULL
recommended	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
infirmary	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
near	NULL
place	NULL
that	NULL
offered	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
's	NULL
recovery	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Take	NULL
her	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Taylor	NULL
promptly	NULL
directed	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
was	NULL
troubled	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
suspicious	NULL
temper	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
whites	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
very	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
Taylor	NULL
sent	NULL
out	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
case	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
hurt	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
before	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
recovering	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
.	NULL

Under	NULL
the	NULL
care	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
hospital	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
gentle	NULL
nurse	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
improved	NULL
rapidly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL
weeks	NULL
were	NULL
outdoors	NULL
,	NULL
playing	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
black	NULL
children	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
creeping	NULL
into	NULL
classrooms	NULL
and	NULL
listening	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
grateful	NULL
mothers	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
twice	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
;	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
with	NULL
suspicious	NULL
aloofness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
gradually	NULL
melting	NULL
under	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
tact	NULL
until	NULL
they	NULL
sat	NULL
and	NULL
talked	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
told	NULL
their	NULL
troubles	NULL
and	NULL
struggles	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
realized	NULL
how	NULL
human	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
how	NULL
like	NULL
their	NULL
problems	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
hers	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
children	NULL
grew	NULL
to	NULL
love	NULL
this	NULL
busy	NULL
,	NULL
thoughtful	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Zora	NULL
's	NULL
fears	NULL
were	NULL
quieted	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
catastrophe	NULL
came	NULL
suddenly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sheriff	NULL
rode	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
scowling	NULL
and	NULL
hunting	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
poor	NULL
black	NULL
runaway	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
white	NULL
children	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Negro	NULL
school	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
were	NULL
mill-hands	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
black	NULL
with	NULL
anger	NULL
;	NULL
turning	NULL
he	NULL
galloped	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
hours	NULL
later	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
physician	NULL
arrived	NULL
hastily	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cab	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
and	NULL
children	NULL
to	NULL
town	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
tone	NULL
to	NULL
Zora	NULL
and	NULL
drove	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
frowning	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
came	NULL
quickly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
for	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
barn	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
hurried	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Bles	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
quietly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
reported	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
Toomsville	NULL

will	NULL
burn	NULL

.	NULL
"	NULL

Bles	NULL
stood	NULL
motionless	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
've	NULL
been	NULL
fearing	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sheriff	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
stirring	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
worst	NULL
elements	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
lately	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
mills	NULL
pay	NULL
off	NULL
tonight	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
quietly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
we	NULL
must	NULL
prepare	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
aglow	NULL
with	NULL
admiration	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
wonder-woman	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
softly	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
moment	NULL
they	NULL
regarded	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
love	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
rising	NULL
in	NULL
hers	NULL
something	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
bound	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
quickly	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
must	NULL
hurry	NULL
,	NULL
Bles	NULL
;	NULL
lives	NULL
are	NULL
at	NULL
stake	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

And	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
thundered	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
barn	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
mare	NULL
.	NULL

Along	NULL
the	NULL
pike	NULL
he	NULL
flew	NULL
and	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
plantation	NULL
roads	NULL
.	NULL

Across	NULL
broad	NULL
fields	NULL
and	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
Barton	NULL
pike	NULL
and	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
every	NULL
cabin	NULL
he	NULL
whispered	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
grey	NULL
faces	NULL
and	NULL
whispering	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
horse	NULL
was	NULL
reeking	NULL
with	NULL
sweat	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
staggered	NULL
again	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
school-yard	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
already	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
gathering	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
frightened	NULL
,	NULL
anxious	NULL
,	NULL
desperate	NULL
faces	NULL
.	NULL

Women	NULL
with	NULL
bundles	NULL
and	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
men	NULL
with	NULL
guns	NULL
,	NULL
tottering	NULL
old	NULL
folks	NULL
,	NULL
wide-eyed	NULL
boys	NULL
and	NULL
girls	NULL
.	NULL

Up	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
land	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
crying	NULL
and	NULL
moaning	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
setting	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
women	NULL
and	NULL
children	NULL
hurried	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
building	NULL
,	NULL
closing	NULL
the	NULL
doors	NULL
and	NULL
windows	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
moment	NULL
Alwyn	NULL
stood	NULL
without	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
peaceful	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
whistle	NULL
of	NULL
birds	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sobbing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
breeze	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shadowing	NULL
oaks	NULL

The	NULL
sky	NULL
was	NULL
flashing	NULL
to	NULL
dull	NULL

purplish	NULL
blue	NULL

and	NULL
over	NULL
all	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
twilight	NULL
hush	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
God	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
threw	NULL
back	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
clenched	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
soul	NULL
groaned	NULL
within	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL

operatore	NULL
in	NULL
yonder	NULL

had	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
flash	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL

"	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL

,	NULL
to	NULL
red	NULL

.	NULL

It	NULL
mattered	NULL
not	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
provocation	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
desperate	NULL
cause	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
door	NULL
suddenly	NULL
opened	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wheeled	NULL
around	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Zora	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
whispered	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Bles	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
softly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
silently	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
people	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
floor	NULL
to	NULL
roof	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
school-house	NULL
was	NULL
lighted	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
save	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
window	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
slipped	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
watch-fire	NULL
after	NULL
watch-fire	NULL
flickered	NULL
and	NULL
flamed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
burned	NULL
vividly	NULL
,	NULL
sending	NULL
up	NULL
sparks	NULL
and	NULL
black	NULL
smoke	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
ringed	NULL
with	NULL
flaming	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
lay	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
,	NULL
black	NULL
swamp	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
.	NULL

Owls	NULL
hooted	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
forest	NULL
.	NULL

Afar	NULL
the	NULL
shriek	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Montgomery	NULL
train	NULL
was	NULL
heard	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
mingling	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
wail	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
wakeful	NULL
babe	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
redoubled	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
men	NULL
became	NULL
restless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Johnson	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
edge	NULL
away	NULL
toward	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
hall	NULL
.	NULL

Alwyn	NULL
was	NULL
watching	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL
noise	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
eastern	NULL
breeze	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
,	NULL
rumbling	NULL
murmur	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
died	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rose	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
a	NULL
distant	NULL
gun-shot	NULL
woke	NULL
the	NULL
echoes	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL
're	NULL
coming	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
cried	NULL
.	NULL

Standing	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
front	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
.	NULL

Slowly	NULL
,	NULL
intermittently	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
murmuring	NULL
swelled	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
grew	NULL
distinguishable	NULL
as	NULL
yelling	NULL
,	NULL
cursing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
singing	NULL
,	NULL
intermingled	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
crash	NULL
of	NULL
pistol-shots	NULL
.	NULL

Far	NULL
away	NULL
a	NULL
flame	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
burning	NULL
cabin	NULL
,	NULL
arose	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
wilder	NULL
,	NULL
louder	NULL
yell	NULL
greeted	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Now	NULL
the	NULL
tramp	NULL
of	NULL
footsteps	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
heard	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
clearer	NULL
and	NULL
thicker	NULL
the	NULL
grating	NULL
and	NULL
booming	NULL
of	NULL
voices	NULL
,	NULL
until	NULL
suddenly	NULL
,	NULL
far	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
pike	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
moving	NULL
mass	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
glitter	NULL
and	NULL
shout	NULL
,	NULL
swept	NULL
into	NULL
view	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
came	NULL
headlong	NULL
,	NULL
guided	NULL
by	NULL
pine-torches	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
threw	NULL
their	NULL
white	NULL
and	NULL
haggard	NULL
faces	NULL
into	NULL
wild	NULL
distortion	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
as	NULL
bonfire	NULL
after	NULL
bonfire	NULL
met	NULL
their	NULL
gaze	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
moved	NULL
slowly	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
sent	NULL
a	NULL
volley	NULL
of	NULL
bullets	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
fires	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
bullet	NULL
flew	NULL
high	NULL
and	NULL
sang	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
lighted	NULL
window	NULL
.	NULL

Without	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
Uncle	NULL
Isaac	NULL
sank	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
and	NULL
lay	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

Silence	NULL
and	NULL
renewed	NULL
murmuring	NULL
ensued	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
high	NULL
voices	NULL
in	NULL
dispute	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
mass	NULL
divided	NULL
into	NULL
two	NULL
wings	NULL
and	NULL
slowly	NULL
encircled	NULL
the	NULL
fence	NULL
of	NULL
fire	NULL
;	NULL
starting	NULL
noisily	NULL
and	NULL
confidently	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
going	NULL
more	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
quietly	NULL
,	NULL
warily	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
flame	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL

Stealthy	NULL

approaching	NULL

a	NULL

behind	NULL

Whirling	NULL

fled	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
struck	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL

Then	NULL
in	NULL
quick	NULL

flew	NULL

three	NULL
men	NULL
threw	NULL
up	NULL
their	NULL

tumbled	NULL
limply	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dust	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL

rushed	NULL
pellmell	NULL
toward	NULL
town	NULL

At	NULL
early	NULL
dawn	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
relaxed	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
strain	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

Alwyn	NULL
briefly	NULL
counselled	NULL
them	NULL

But	NULL
Rob	NULL
tossed	NULL
his	NULL

belligerently	NULL

In	NULL
town	NULL

rumor	NULL
spread	NULL
like	NULL

A	NULL
body	NULL

And	NULL
before	NULL
nine	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
fully	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL

members	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

now	NULL
sworn	NULL
in	NULL
as	NULL
deputies	NULL

rode	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
search	NULL
the	NULL

They	NULL
tramped	NULL
insolently	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
school	NULL
grounds	NULL

but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
shred	NULL

until	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
Rob	NULL
's	NULL

found	NULL
his	NULL

They	NULL
tied	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
marched	NULL
him	NULL
toward	NULL
town	NULL

But	NULL
before	NULL

arrived	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
before	NULL

Johnson	NULL
feeling	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL

in	NULL
informing	NULL
the	NULL

had	NULL
crawled	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL

into	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
peered	NULL
out	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
cavalcade	NULL
approached	NULL

and	NULL
not	NULL
knowing	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL

he	NULL
recognized	NULL
Colton	NULL

the	NULL
sheriff	NULL

and	NULL
signalled	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
cautiously	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
appealed	NULL
and	NULL
explained	NULL
in	NULL
vain	NULL

the	NULL

was	NULL
damning	NULL

The	NULL
voices	NULL

be	NULL

behind	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL

The	NULL
sheriff	NULL
turned	NULL

disappeared	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rear	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
cloud	NULL

a	NULL

a	NULL

the	NULL

A	NULL

Colonel	NULL

As	NULL

his	NULL

pointed	NULL

a	NULL
paper	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL

up	NULL
curiously	NULL

Mrs.	NULL
Gresswell	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
open-mouthed	NULL
astonishment	NULL

Twice	NULL
she	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL

there	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
things	NULL

at	NULL

Zora	NULL
was	NULL
dreaming	NULL
again	NULL

Somehow	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
dream-life	NULL

with	NULL
its	NULL
glorious	NULL
phantasies	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
silently	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
richer	NULL
and	NULL
sweeter	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
tangible	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
today	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
shut	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
den	NULL
.	NULL

Searching	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
trunk	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
drew	NULL
forth	NULL
that	NULL
filmy	NULL
cloud	NULL
of	NULL
white	NULL
--	NULL
silk-bordered	NULL
and	NULL
half	NULL
finished	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
gown	NULL

Why	NULL
were	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
wet	NULL
today	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
anniversary	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
she	NULL
still	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
supreme	NULL
moment	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
mob	NULL

She	NULL
half	NULL
slipped	NULL

half	NULL
wound	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
cloud	NULL

standing	NULL

opened	NULL

Zora	NULL
walked	NULL
silently	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
Bles	NULL
and	NULL
Emma	NULL
coming	NULL
from	NULL
Aunt	NULL
Rachel	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
helping	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
with	NULL
smiling	NULL
eyes	NULL

and	NULL
her	NULL
innocent	NULL
blue	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
fastened	NULL
on	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
looked	NULL
long	NULL

searchingly	NULL

"	NULL
Please	NULL
run	NULL

tell	NULL
them	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

I	NULL

"	NULL

And	NULL
Mrs.	NULL
Cresswell	NULL
hurried	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

Zora	NULL
turned	NULL
back	NULL
steadily	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
locked	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
should	NULL
n't	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
?	NULL

Why	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
before	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
blindness	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL

wanted	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
ah	NULL
,	NULL
God	NULL
!	NULL

was	NULL
not	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL

why	NULL

she	NULL

her	NULL
when	NULL

Why	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL

bound	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
asked	NULL

because	NULL
she	NULL

wanted	NULL
all	NULL

not	NULL

not	NULL
one	NULL

And	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
oh	NULL
,	NULL
God	NULL
!	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
dreamed	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL

all	NULL

since	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL

death	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL

anything	NULL

It	NULL

there	NULL

she	NULL
rose	NULL

walked	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
slowly	NULL

fast	NULL

faster	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
trembling	NULL
hands	NULL
she	NULL
drew	NULL
the	NULL
Silver	NULL
Fleece	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
head	NULL
swam	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
blood	NULL
flashed	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
calling	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
Elspeth	NULL
seemed	NULL

hover	NULL

her	NULL

claiming	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL

dragging	NULL
her	NULL
down	NULL

down	NULL
...	NULL

She	NULL
rushed	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
swamp	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lagoon	NULL
lay	NULL
there	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
presently	NULL
,	NULL
gleaming	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL

cold	NULL

still	NULL

and	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
swam	NULL
an	NULL

She	NULL
held	NULL
her	NULL
burning	NULL
head	NULL

everything	NULL

It	NULL

But	NULL
could	NULL

Must	NULL

Did	NULL
God	NULL

All	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
straight	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
whole	NULL
body	NULL
grew	NULL
tense	NULL

She	NULL
heard	NULL
no	NULL

but	NULL
knew	NULL

was	NULL
there	NULL

braced	NULL
herself	NULL

She	NULL
must	NULL

She	NULL

She	NULL

Her	NULL
heart	NULL
bounded	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
Washington	NULL
girl	NULL

She	NULL
answered	NULL
dully	NULL

groping	NULL
for	NULL

was	NULL
tired	NULL

he	NULL
answered	NULL

sinking	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL

Then	NULL
at	NULL

illumination	NULL
dawned	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
blindness	NULL

She	NULL
stood	NULL
very	NULL
still	NULL
and	NULL
lifted	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL

The	NULL

There	NULL
