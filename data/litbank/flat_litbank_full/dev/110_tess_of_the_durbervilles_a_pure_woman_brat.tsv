A	NULL

Durbeyfield	NULL

the	NULL

her	NULL

her	NULL
glance	NULL
drooped	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

Perceiving	NULL
that	NULL

tapped	NULL
her	NULL
neighbour	NULL

her	NULL

talked	NULL
as	NULL

Tess	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
vessel	NULL
of	NULL
emotion	NULL
untinctured	NULL
by	NULL
experience	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dialect	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
tongue	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
extent	NULL
,	NULL
despite	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
school	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
characteristic	NULL
intonation	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
dialect	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
district	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
voicing	NULL
approximately	NULL
rendered	NULL

the	NULL
syllable	NULL

as	NULL
rich	NULL
an	NULL
utterance	NULL

any	NULL

The	NULL
pouted-up	NULL

red	NULL
mouth	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
this	NULL

was	NULL
native	NULL
had	NULL
hardly	NULL

yet	NULL
settled	NULL
into	NULL
its	NULL

shape	NULL

her	NULL

a	NULL
way	NULL

Phases	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
childhood	NULL
lurked	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
aspect	NULL
still	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
along	NULL
to-day	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
bouncing	NULL
handsome	NULL
womanliness	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
could	NULL
sometimes	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
twelfth	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL

or	NULL
her	NULL
ninth	NULL
sparkling	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL

even	NULL
her	NULL
fifth	NULL
would	NULL
flit	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
curves	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
few	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
fewer	NULL
considered	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
small	NULL
minority	NULL
,	NULL
mainly	NULL
strangers	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
look	NULL
long	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
casually	NULL
passing	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
grow	NULL
momentarily	NULL
fascinated	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
freshness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wonder	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
ever	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
:	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
almost	NULL
everybody	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
and	NULL
picturesque	NULL
country	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
was	NULL
seen	NULL
or	NULL
heard	NULL
further	NULL
of	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
triumphal	NULL
chariot	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
conduct	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ostleress	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
club	NULL
having	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
allotted	NULL
space	NULL
,	NULL
dancing	NULL
began	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
danced	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
with	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
close	NULL
of	NULL
labour	NULL
drew	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
masculine	NULL
inhabitants	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
,	NULL
together	NULL
with	NULL
other	NULL
idlers	NULL
and	NULL
pedestrians	NULL
,	NULL
gathered	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
appeared	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
negotiate	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
partner	NULL
.	NULL

Among	NULL
these	NULL
on-lookers	NULL
were	NULL
three	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
superior	NULL
class	NULL
,	NULL
carrying	NULL
small	NULL
knapsacks	NULL
strapped	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stout	NULL
sticks	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
general	NULL
likeness	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL

and	NULL
their	NULL
consecutive	NULL
ages	NULL

would	NULL
almost	NULL

suggested	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
in	NULL

they	NULL
were	NULL

brothers	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL

the	NULL
white	NULL

high	NULL
waistcoat	NULL

and	NULL

the	NULL

was	NULL
the	NULL
normal	NULL
undergraduate	NULL

the	NULL
appearance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
and	NULL
youngest	NULL
would	NULL
hardly	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
sufficient	NULL
to	NULL
characterize	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
uncribbed	NULL
,	NULL
uncabined	NULL
aspect	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
attire	NULL
,	NULL
implying	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
hardly	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
found	NULL
the	NULL
entrance	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
professional	NULL
groove	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
desultory	NULL
tentative	NULL
student	NULL
of	NULL
something	NULL
and	NULL
everything	NULL
might	NULL
only	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
predicted	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
three	NULL
brethren	NULL
told	NULL
casual	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
spending	NULL
their	NULL
Whitsun	NULL
holidays	NULL

being	NULL
south-westerly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL

Shaston	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
north-east	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
leant	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
highway	NULL

and	NULL
inquired	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
meaning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dance	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
white-frocked	NULL
maids	NULL

The	NULL

were	NULL
plainly	NULL
not	NULL
intending	NULL
to	NULL
linger	NULL
more	NULL

the	NULL
spectacle	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL

The	NULL

the	NULL

whatever	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL

has	NULL
not	NULL

handed	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL

as	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
who	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
the	NULL
luxury	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL

partner	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
such	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
example	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
hastened	NULL

enter	NULL

gate	NULL

no	NULL

was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

now	NULL
dropped	NULL
in	NULL
quickly	NULL

the	NULL
couples	NULL

leavened	NULL

rustic	NULL
youth	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
marked	NULL
extent	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
the	NULL
plainest	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
club	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
compelled	NULL
to	NULL
foot	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
masculine	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
figure	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
church	NULL
clock	NULL
struck	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
suddenly	NULL
the	NULL
student	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
leave	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
forgetting	NULL
himself	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
join	NULL
his	NULL
companions	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
fell	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dance	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
lighted	NULL
on	NULL
Tess	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
own	NULL
large	NULL
orbs	NULL
wore	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
faintest	NULL
aspect	NULL
of	NULL
reproach	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
chosen	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
sorry	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
backwardness	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
observed	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
pasture	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
long	NULL
delay	NULL
he	NULL
started	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
flying-run	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
westward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
soon	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
hollow	NULL
and	NULL
mounted	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
rise	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
overtaken	NULL
his	NULL
brothers	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
paused	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
breath	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
figures	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
enclosure	NULL
whirling	NULL
about	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
whirled	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
quite	NULL
forgotten	NULL
him	NULL
already	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
white	NULL
shape	NULL
stood	NULL
apart	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
hedge	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
her	NULL
position	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
pretty	NULL
maiden	NULL
with	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
danced	NULL
.	NULL

Trifling	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
yet	NULL
instinctively	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
hurt	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
oversight	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wished	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
wished	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
inquired	NULL
her	NULL
name	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
modest	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
expressive	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
so	NULL
soft	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
thin	NULL
white	NULL
gown	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
acted	NULL
stupidly	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
helped	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
bending	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
rapid	NULL
walk	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
dismissed	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

III	NULL
As	NULL
for	NULL
Tess	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
easily	NULL
dislodge	NULL
the	NULL
incident	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
consideration	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
spirit	NULL
to	NULL
dance	NULL
again	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
partners	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
ah	NULL
!	NULL

they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
so	NULL
nicely	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
strange	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
rays	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
had	NULL
absorbed	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
stranger	NULL

figure	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL

she	NULL
shook	NULL
off	NULL
her	NULL
temporary	NULL
sadness	NULL
and	NULL
answered	NULL

would-be	NULL

the	NULL
affirmative	NULL

She	NULL
remained	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
comrades	NULL
till	NULL
dusk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
participated	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
zest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dancing	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
heart-whole	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
enjoyed	NULL
treading	NULL
a	NULL
measure	NULL
purely	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
sake	NULL
;	NULL
little	NULL
divining	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
soft	NULL
torments	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
bitter	NULL
sweets	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
pleasing	NULL
pains	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
those	NULL
girls	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
wooed	NULL
and	NULL
won	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
was	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
kind	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
struggles	NULL
and	NULL
wrangles	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lads	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
jig	NULL
were	NULL
an	NULL
amusement	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
became	NULL
fierce	NULL
she	NULL
rebuked	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
stayed	NULL
even	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
incident	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
odd	NULL
appearance	NULL
and	NULL
manner	NULL
returned	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
her	NULL
anxious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wondering	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
she	NULL
dropped	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
dancers	NULL
and	NULL
bent	NULL
her	NULL
steps	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
parental	NULL
cottage	NULL
lay	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
yet	NULL
many	NULL
score	NULL
yards	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
other	NULL
rhythmic	NULL
sounds	NULL
than	NULL
those	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
quitted	NULL
became	NULL
audible	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
sounds	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
well	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
regular	NULL
series	NULL
of	NULL
thumpings	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
interior	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
occasioned	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
violent	NULL
rocking	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cradle	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
stone	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
movement	NULL
a	NULL
feminine	NULL
voice	NULL
kept	NULL
time	NULL
by	NULL
singing	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
vigorous	NULL
gallopade	NULL

the	NULL
favourite	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
tell	NULL
'	NULL
you	NULL
where	NULL

'	NULL

The	NULL
cradle-rocking	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
song	NULL
would	NULL
cease	NULL
simultaneously	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
exclamation	NULL
at	NULL
highest	NULL
vocal	NULL
pitch	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
melody	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
God	NULL

After	NULL
this	NULL
invocation	NULL
the	NULL
rocking	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
singing	NULL
would	NULL
recommence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
Spotted	NULL

"	NULL
proceed	NULL
as	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
matters	NULL
stood	NULL
when	NULL
Tess	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
paused	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
mat	NULL
within	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
surveying	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
interior	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
melody	NULL
,	NULL
struck	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
senses	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
unspeakable	NULL
dreariness	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
holiday	NULL

field	NULL
--	NULL

white	NULL
gowns	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL
yellow	NULL
melancholy	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
one-candled	NULL

,	NULL
what	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL

Besides	NULL
the	NULL
jar	NULL
of	NULL
contrast	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
chill	NULL
self-reproach	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL

not	NULL

sooner	NULL

help	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
in	NULL

instead	NULL

out-of-doors	NULL

There	NULL
stood	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
children	NULL

as	NULL
Tess	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL

hanging	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
Monday	NULL
washing-tub	NULL

as	NULL
always	NULL

lingered	NULL
on	NULL

the	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL

Out	NULL

had	NULL
come	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
--	NULL
Tess	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
dreadful	NULL
sting	NULL
of	NULL

the	NULL
very	NULL
white	NULL
frock	NULL
upon	NULL

Trantridge	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL

a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

His	NULL
sister	NULL
became	NULL
abruptly	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lapsed	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
pondering	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

Abraham	NULL
talked	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
pleasure	NULL
of	NULL
utterance	NULL
than	NULL
for	NULL
audition	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
sister	NULL
's	NULL
abstraction	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
account	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
leant	NULL
back	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
hives	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
upturned	NULL
face	NULL
made	NULL
observations	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stars	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
cold	NULL
pulses	NULL
were	NULL
beating	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL
hollows	NULL
above	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
serene	NULL
dissociation	NULL
from	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
wisps	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
how	NULL
far	NULL
away	NULL
those	NULL
twinklers	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whether	NULL
God	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
ever	NULL
and	NULL
anon	NULL
his	NULL
childish	NULL
prattle	NULL
recurred	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
impressed	NULL
his	NULL
imagination	NULL
even	NULL
more	NULL
deeply	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
wonders	NULL
of	NULL
creation	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Tess	NULL
were	NULL
made	NULL
rich	NULL
by	NULL
marrying	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
she	NULL
have	NULL
money	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
a	NULL
spyglass	NULL
so	NULL
large	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
draw	NULL
the	NULL
stars	NULL
as	NULL
near	NULL

her	NULL
as	NULL
Nettlecombe-Tout	NULL

The	NULL
renewed	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
impregnated	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
family	NULL

filled	NULL
Tess	NULL
with	NULL
impatience	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

she	NULL
exclaimed	NULL

"	NULL

Left	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
reflections	NULL
Abraham	NULL
soon	NULL
grew	NULL
drowsy	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
skilful	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
management	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
horse	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
take	NULL
upon	NULL
herself	NULL
the	NULL
entire	NULL
conduct	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
load	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
and	NULL
allow	NULL
Abraham	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
nest	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hives	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
manner	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
fall	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
taking	NULL
the	NULL
reins	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
jogged	NULL
on	NULL
as	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

Prince	NULL
required	NULL
but	NULL
slight	NULL
attention	NULL
,	NULL
lacking	NULL
energy	NULL
for	NULL
superfluous	NULL
movements	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
sort	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
a	NULL
companion	NULL
to	NULL
distract	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
Tess	NULL
fell	NULL
more	NULL
deeply	NULL
into	NULL
reverie	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
leaning	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
hives	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
mute	NULL
procession	NULL
past	NULL
her	NULL
shoulders	NULL
of	NULL
trees	NULL
and	NULL
hedges	NULL
became	NULL
attached	NULL
to	NULL
fantastic	NULL
scenes	NULL
outside	NULL
reality	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
occasional	NULL
heave	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
became	NULL
the	NULL
sigh	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
immense	NULL
sad	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
conterminous	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
universe	NULL
in	NULL
space	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
history	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
examining	NULL
the	NULL
mesh	NULL
of	NULL
events	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
vanity	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
pride	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
gentlemanly	NULL
suitor	NULL
awaiting	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
fancy	NULL
;	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
grimacing	NULL
personage	NULL
,	NULL
laughing	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
poverty	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
shrouded	NULL
knightly	NULL
ancestry	NULL
.	NULL

Everything	NULL
grew	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
extravagant	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
time	NULL
passed	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
sudden	NULL
jerk	NULL
shook	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
seat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Tess	NULL
awoke	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
sleep	NULL
into	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
way	NULL
further	NULL
on	NULL
than	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
consciousness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
waggon	NULL
had	NULL
stopped	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
hollow	NULL
groan	NULL
,	NULL
unlike	NULL
anything	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
heard	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
,	NULL
followed	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
shout	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
Hoi	NULL
there	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
lantern	NULL
hanging	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
waggon	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
another	NULL
was	NULL
shining	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
--	NULL
much	NULL
brighter	NULL
than	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

Something	NULL
terrible	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
harness	NULL
was	NULL
entangled	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
object	NULL
which	NULL
blocked	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
consternation	NULL
Tess	NULL
jumped	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
discovered	NULL
the	NULL
dreadful	NULL
truth	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
groan	NULL
had	NULL
proceeded	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
poor	NULL
horse	NULL
Prince	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
morning	NULL
mail-cart	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
two	NULL
noiseless	NULL
wheels	NULL
,	NULL
speeding	NULL
along	NULL
these	NULL
lanes	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
arrow	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
always	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
driven	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
slow	NULL
and	NULL
unlighted	NULL
equipage	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pointed	NULL
shaft	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cart	NULL
had	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
breast	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
unhappy	NULL
Prince	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
sword	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
wound	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
's	NULL
blood	NULL
was	NULL
spouting	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
stream	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
falling	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
hiss	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
her	NULL
despair	NULL
Tess	NULL
sprang	NULL
forward	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
hole	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
result	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
became	NULL
splashed	NULL
from	NULL
face	NULL
to	NULL
skirt	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
crimson	NULL
drops	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
helplessly	NULL
looking	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Prince	NULL
also	NULL
stood	NULL
firm	NULL
and	NULL
motionless	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
;	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
suddenly	NULL
sank	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
heap	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
the	NULL
mail-cart	NULL
man	NULL
had	NULL
joined	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
dragging	NULL
and	NULL
unharnessing	NULL
the	NULL
hot	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
Prince	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
that	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
immediately	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
mail-cart	NULL
man	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
animal	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
uninjured	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
wrong	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL

the	NULL
mail-bags	NULL

the	NULL
best	NULL
thing	NULL
for	NULL
you	NULL

He	NULL
mounted	NULL
and	NULL
sped	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
;	NULL
while	NULL
Tess	NULL
stood	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
turned	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
birds	NULL
shook	NULL
themselves	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hedges	NULL
,	NULL
arose	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
twittered	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
showed	NULL
all	NULL
its	NULL
white	NULL
features	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Tess	NULL
showed	NULL
hers	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
whiter	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
huge	NULL
pool	NULL
of	NULL
blood	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
assuming	NULL
the	NULL

when	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
rose	NULL

reflected	NULL
from	NULL
it	NULL

Prince	NULL
lay	NULL
alongside	NULL

stark	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
half	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
hole	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
chest	NULL
looking	NULL
scarcely	NULL
large	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
let	NULL
out	NULL
all	NULL

the	NULL

When	NULL

realized	NULL
all	NULL

the	NULL
furrows	NULL
of	NULL
fifty	NULL

were	NULL
extemporized	NULL
on	NULL

murmured	NULL
Abraham	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
tears	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
silence	NULL
they	NULL
waited	NULL
through	NULL
an	NULL
interval	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
endless	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
length	NULL
a	NULL
sound	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
approaching	NULL
object	NULL
,	NULL
proved	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
driver	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mail-car	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
as	NULL
good	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
word	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
farmer	NULL
's	NULL
man	NULL
from	NULL
near	NULL
Stourcastle	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
leading	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
cob	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
harnessed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
waggon	NULL
of	NULL
beehives	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
Prince	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
load	NULL
taken	NULL
on	NULL
towards	NULL
Casterbridge	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
evening	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
day	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
empty	NULL
waggon	NULL
reach	NULL
again	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
accident	NULL
.	NULL

Prince	NULL
had	NULL
lain	NULL
there	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ditch	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
blood-pool	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
visible	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
scratched	NULL
and	NULL
scraped	NULL
over	NULL
by	NULL
passing	NULL
vehicles	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
of	NULL
Prince	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
hoisted	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
waggon	NULL
he	NULL

he	NULL
retraced	NULL
the	NULL
eight	NULL

nine	NULL
miles	NULL
to	NULL
Marlott	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
back	NULL
earlier	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
to	NULL
break	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
relief	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
tongue	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
faces	NULL

already	NULL
knew	NULL

loss	NULL

though	NULL
this	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
lessen	NULL

Parson	NULL

out	NULL

in	NULL

this	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
necessity	NULL

recommencing	NULL

a	NULL

that	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
too	NULL

identify	NULL
him	NULL

the	NULL

that	NULL
would	NULL

_	NULL

looked	NULL

sounded	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL

d'Urberville	NULL
accordingly	NULL
was	NULL
annexed	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
name	NULL

himself	NULL

heirs	NULL
eternally	NULL

Yet	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
an	NULL

man	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
constructing	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL

duly	NULL
reasonable	NULL

Of	NULL
this	NULL
work	NULL

imagination	NULL
poor	NULL
Tess	NULL

her	NULL

were	NULL
naturally	NULL
in	NULL
ignorance	NULL

to	NULL
their	NULL
discomfiture	NULL

the	NULL

possibility	NULL

who	NULL
supposed	NULL

the	NULL
gift	NULL

by	NULL

Tess	NULL
still	NULL
stood	NULL
hesitating	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
bather	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
his	NULL
plunge	NULL
,	NULL
hardly	NULL
knowing	NULL
whether	NULL
to	NULL
retreat	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
persevere	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
figure	NULL
came	NULL
forth	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
dark	NULL
triangular	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tent	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL

smoking	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
almost	NULL
swarthy	NULL
complexion	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
full	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
badly	NULL
moulded	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
red	NULL
and	NULL
smooth	NULL
,	NULL
above	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
well-groomed	NULL
black	NULL
moustache	NULL
with	NULL
curled	NULL
points	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
his	NULL
age	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
three	NULL
-	NULL
or	NULL
four-and-twenty	NULL

Despite	NULL
the	NULL
touches	NULL
of	NULL
barbarism	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
contours	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
singular	NULL
force	NULL

the	NULL

he	NULL

coming	NULL
forward	NULL

This	NULL
embodiment	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
namesake	NULL
differed	NULL
even	NULL
more	NULL
from	NULL
what	NULL
Tess	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL

the	NULL
house	NULL

On	NULL

sings	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
clear-voiced	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL

at	NULL

knows	NULL
the	NULL
correct	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL

,	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
preserving	NULL
silence	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
equally	NULL
convinced	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
is	NULL
mistaken	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
remained	NULL
upstairs	NULL
packing	NULL
till	NULL
breakfast-time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
came	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
ordinary	NULL
week-day	NULL
clothes	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
Sunday	NULL

being	NULL
carefully	NULL
folded	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL

Her	NULL

expostulated	NULL

her	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
too	NULL
delighted	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
tractability	NULL

First	NULL
she	NULL
fetched	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
basin	NULL

washed	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
hair	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
thoroughness	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
dried	NULL

brushed	NULL
it	NULL
looked	NULL
twice	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL

She	NULL
tied	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
broader	NULL
pink	NULL
ribbon	NULL
than	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL

that	NULL
Tess	NULL
had	NULL
worn	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

fulness	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL

supplementing	NULL
her	NULL

imparted	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
developing	NULL
figure	NULL
an	NULL
amplitude	NULL
which	NULL
belied	NULL
her	NULL
age	NULL

and	NULL
might	NULL
cause	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
estimated	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

Her	NULL

the	NULL

her	NULL

Mrs	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
the	NULL

Tess	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
standing	NULL
still	NULL

undecided	NULL

beside	NULL
this	NULL
turn-out	NULL

whose	NULL
owner	NULL
was	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

Her	NULL
seeming	NULL
indecision	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
indecision	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
misgiving	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
preferred	NULL
the	NULL
humble	NULL
cart	NULL

The	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
dismounted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
urge	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
ascend	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
relatives	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
regarded	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
group	NULL

Something	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
quicken	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
determination	NULL
;	NULL
possibly	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
killed	NULL
Prince	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
suddenly	NULL
stepped	NULL
up	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
mounted	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
immediately	NULL
whipped	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
horse	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
slow	NULL
cart	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
box	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
disappeared	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
shoulder	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL
.	NULL

Directly	NULL
Tess	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
sight	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
interest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

at	NULL
an	NULL

filled	NULL
with	NULL
tears	NULL

The	NULL

"	NULL

and	NULL
,	NULL
lowering	NULL
the	NULL
corners	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
lips	NULL

burst	NULL
out	NULL
crying	NULL

The	NULL

was	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL
next	NULL

till	NULL
the	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL

in	NULL
Joan	NULL

by	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
passively	NULL
trusting	NULL

However	NULL

in	NULL

that	NULL
night	NULL
she	NULL
sighed	NULL

her	NULL
husband	NULL

VIII	NULL
Having	NULL
mounted	NULL

Alec	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
drove	NULL
rapidly	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL

chatting	NULL

they	NULL
went	NULL

an	NULL

stretched	NULL
around	NULL

she	NULL
knew	NULL
nothing	NULL
except	NULL
from	NULL

Trantridge	NULL

Thus	NULL
they	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL

which	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

was	NULL

Down	NULL

down	NULL

they	NULL
sped	NULL

Tess	NULL

the	NULL

Tess	NULL
could	NULL

one	NULL

she	NULL

admitted	NULL

fact	NULL

you	NULL

The	NULL

Thus	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL

her	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
mistaken	NULL

Mrs	NULL

not	NULL
the	NULL

love	NULL

In	NULL

the	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL

Tess	NULL
inclined	NULL

her	NULL

position	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL

the	NULL

now	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL

she	NULL

curious	NULL

As	NULL

sat	NULL
herself	NULL

up	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
remained	NULL
fruitlessly	NULL

wondering	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL

grown	NULL
out	NULL

caught	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
musical	NULL
mother	NULL
numerous	NULL
airs	NULL
that	NULL
suited	NULL
those	NULL
songsters	NULL
admirably	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
far	NULL
more	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
time	NULL
than	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
practised	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
whistling	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
cages	NULL
each	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

Unrestrained	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
presence	NULL
she	NULL
threw	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
bars	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
piped	NULL
away	NULL
in	NULL
easeful	NULL
grace	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
attentive	NULL
listeners	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
slept	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
four-post	NULL
bedstead	NULL
hung	NULL
with	NULL
heavy	NULL
damask	NULL
curtains	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
bullfinches	NULL
occupied	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
apartment	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
flitted	NULL
about	NULL
freely	NULL
at	NULL
certain	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
little	NULL
white	NULL
spots	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
furniture	NULL
and	NULL
upholstery	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
while	NULL
Tess	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
cages	NULL
were	NULL
ranged	NULL
,	NULL
giving	NULL
her	NULL
lesson	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
rustling	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
old	NULL
lady	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
present	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turning	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
toes	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
boots	NULL
were	NULL
visible	NULL
below	NULL
the	NULL
fringe	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
curtains	NULL
.	NULL

Thereupon	NULL
her	NULL
whistling	NULL
became	NULL
so	NULL
disjointed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
listener	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
such	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
discovered	NULL
her	NULL
suspicion	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
presence	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
searched	NULL
the	NULL
curtains	NULL
every	NULL
morning	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
never	NULL
found	NULL
anybody	NULL
within	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Alec	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
had	NULL
evidently	NULL
thought	NULL
better	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
freak	NULL
to	NULL
terrify	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
ambush	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
kind	NULL
.	NULL

X	NULL
Every	NULL
village	NULL
has	NULL
its	NULL
idiosyncrasy	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
constitution	NULL
,	NULL
often	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
code	NULL
of	NULL
morality	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
levity	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
younger	NULL
women	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
about	NULL
Trantridge	NULL
was	NULL
marked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
symptomatic	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
choice	NULL
spirit	NULL
who	NULL
ruled	NULL
The	NULL
Slopes	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
vicinity	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
place	NULL
had	NULL
also	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
abiding	NULL
defect	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
drank	NULL
hard	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
staple	NULL
conversation	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
farms	NULL
around	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
uselessness	NULL
of	NULL
saving	NULL
money	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
smock-frocked	NULL
arithmeticians	NULL
,	NULL
leaning	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
ploughs	NULL
or	NULL
hoes	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
enter	NULL
into	NULL
calculations	NULL
of	NULL
great	NULL
nicety	NULL
to	NULL
prove	NULL
that	NULL
parish	NULL
relief	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fuller	NULL
provision	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
old	NULL
age	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
result	NULL
from	NULL
savings	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
wages	NULL
during	NULL
a	NULL
whole	NULL
lifetime	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
chief	NULL
pleasure	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
philosophers	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
going	NULL
every	NULL
Saturday	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
work	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
Chaseborough	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
decayed	NULL
market-town	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
miles	NULL
distant	NULL

and	NULL
,	NULL
returning	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
hours	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
Sunday	NULL
in	NULL
sleeping	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
dyspeptic	NULL
effects	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
curious	NULL
compounds	NULL
sold	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
Tess	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
join	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
weekly	NULL
pilgrimages	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
under	NULL
pressure	NULL
from	NULL
matrons	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
herself	NULL
--	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
field-man	NULL
's	NULL

being	NULL
as	NULL
high	NULL
at	NULL
twenty-one	NULL
as	NULL
at	NULL

,	NULL
marriage	NULL
was	NULL
early	NULL
here	NULL
--	NULL
Tess	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
consented	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
first	NULL
experience	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
journey	NULL
afforded	NULL
her	NULL
more	NULL
enjoyment	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
hilariousness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
being	NULL
quite	NULL
contagious	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
monotonous	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
poultry-farm	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Being	NULL
graceful	NULL
and	NULL
interesting	NULL
,	NULL
standing	NULL
moreover	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
momentary	NULL
threshold	NULL
of	NULL
womanhood	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
appearance	NULL
drew	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
some	NULL
sly	NULL
regards	NULL
from	NULL
loungers	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
of	NULL
Chaseborough	NULL
;	NULL
hence	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
sometimes	NULL
her	NULL
journey	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
independently	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
always	NULL
searched	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
fellows	NULL
at	NULL
nightfall	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
protection	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
companionship	NULL
homeward	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
on	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
when	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
Saturday	NULL
in	NULL
September	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
fair	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
market	NULL
coincided	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
pilgrims	NULL
from	NULL
Trantridge	NULL
sought	NULL
double	NULL
delights	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
inns	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
account	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
's	NULL
occupations	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
late	NULL
in	NULL
setting	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
comrades	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
long	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
September	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
sunset	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
yellow	NULL
lights	NULL
struggle	NULL
with	NULL
blue	NULL
shades	NULL
in	NULL
hairlike	NULL
lines	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
itself	NULL
forms	NULL
a	NULL
prospect	NULL
without	NULL
aid	NULL
from	NULL
more	NULL
solid	NULL
objects	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
innumerable	NULL
winged	NULL
insects	NULL
that	NULL
dance	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Through	NULL
this	NULL
low-lit	NULL
mistiness	NULL
Tess	NULL
walked	NULL
leisurely	NULL
along	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
discover	NULL
the	NULL
coincidence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
market	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
fair	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
time	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
close	NULL
upon	NULL
dusk	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
limited	NULL
marketing	NULL
was	NULL
soon	NULL
completed	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
about	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Trantridge	NULL
cottagers	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
informed	NULL
that	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
to	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
private	NULL
little	NULL
jig	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hay-trusser	NULL
and	NULL
peat-dealer	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
transactions	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
farm	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
out-of-the-way	NULL
nook	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
townlet	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
her	NULL
course	NULL
thither	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
Mr	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
standing	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
street	NULL
corner	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
--	NULL
my	NULL
Beauty	NULL
?	NULL

You	NULL
here	NULL
so	NULL
late	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
simply	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
company	NULL
homeward	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL
see	NULL
you	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
shoulder	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
lane	NULL
.	NULL

Approaching	NULL
the	NULL
hay-trussers	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
fiddled	NULL
notes	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
reel	NULL
proceeding	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
building	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rear	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
dancing	NULL
was	NULL
audible	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
exceptional	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
for	NULL
these	NULL
parts	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
rule	NULL
the	NULL
stamping	NULL
drowned	NULL
the	NULL
music	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
front	NULL
door	NULL
being	NULL
open	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
straight	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
shades	NULL
of	NULL
night	NULL
would	NULL
allow	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
nobody	NULL
appearing	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
knock	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
traversed	NULL
the	NULL
dwelling	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
path	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
outhouse	NULL
whence	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
had	NULL
attracted	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
windowless	NULL
erection	NULL
used	NULL
for	NULL
storage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
door	NULL
there	NULL
floated	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
obscurity	NULL
a	NULL
mist	NULL
of	NULL
yellow	NULL
radiance	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
Tess	NULL
thought	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
illuminated	NULL
smoke	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
on	NULL
drawing	NULL
nearer	NULL
she	NULL
perceived	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
cloud	NULL
of	NULL
dust	NULL
,	NULL
lit	NULL
by	NULL
candles	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
outhouse	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
beams	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
haze	NULL
carried	NULL
forward	NULL
the	NULL
outline	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
doorway	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
wide	NULL
night	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
close	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
in	NULL
she	NULL
beheld	NULL
indistinct	NULL
forms	NULL
racing	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
figure	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dance	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
footfalls	NULL
arising	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
being	NULL
overshoe	NULL
in	NULL
"	NULL
scroff	NULL

--	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
powdery	NULL
residuum	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
storage	NULL
of	NULL
peat	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
products	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
stirring	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
turbulent	NULL
feet	NULL
created	NULL
the	NULL
nebulosity	NULL
that	NULL
involved	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
.	NULL

Through	NULL
this	NULL
floating	NULL
,	NULL
fusty	NULL
_	NULL
debris	NULL
_	NULL
of	NULL
peat	NULL
and	NULL
hay	NULL
,	NULL
mixed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
perspirations	NULL
and	NULL
warmth	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dancers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
forming	NULL
together	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
vegeto-human	NULL
pollen	NULL

the	NULL
muted	NULL
fiddles	NULL
feebly	NULL
pushed	NULL
their	NULL
notes	NULL

in	NULL
marked	NULL
contrast	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
spirit	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
measure	NULL
was	NULL
trodden	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
coughed	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
danced	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
laughed	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
coughed	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
the	NULL
rushing	NULL
couples	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
barely	NULL
be	NULL
discerned	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
lights	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
indistinctness	NULL
shaping	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
satyrs	NULL

Lotis	NULL
attempting	NULL
to	NULL
elude	NULL
Priapus	NULL

and	NULL
always	NULL
failing	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
intervals	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
would	NULL
approach	NULL
the	NULL
doorway	NULL
for	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
haze	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
veiling	NULL
their	NULL
features	NULL

the	NULL

resolved	NULL
themselves	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
homely	NULL
personalities	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL

neighbours	NULL
.	NULL

Could	NULL
Trantridge	NULL
in	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
short	NULL
hours	NULL
have	NULL
metamorphosed	NULL
itself	NULL
thus	NULL
madly	NULL
!	NULL

Some	NULL
Sileni	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

sat	NULL
on	NULL
benches	NULL

hay-trusses	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL

waited	NULL

drew	NULL
to	NULL

it	NULL

varied	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL

the	NULL
wrong	NULL
side	NULL

the	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL

the	NULL
bow	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
matter	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
panting	NULL
shapes	NULL
spun	NULL
onwards	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
vary	NULL
their	NULL
partners	NULL
if	NULL
their	NULL
inclination	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
stick	NULL
to	NULL
previous	NULL
ones	NULL

Changing	NULL

simply	NULL
meant	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
satisfactory	NULL
choice	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL

been	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL

the	NULL
pair	NULL

and	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
every	NULL
couple	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
suitably	NULL
matched	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
ecstasy	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
dream	NULL
began	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
emotion	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
universe	NULL

intrusion	NULL

you	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
dull	NULL
thump	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
:	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL

and	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL

The	NULL
next	NULL

,	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
check	NULL
its	NULL
progress	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
toppling	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
obstacle	NULL

An	NULL
inner	NULL
cloud	NULL
of	NULL

rose	NULL
around	NULL
the	NULL
prostrate	NULL
figures	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL

the	NULL

in	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL

burst	NULL
in	NULL
female	NULL

from	NULL
the	NULL

united	NULL
with	NULL

within	NULL
the	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL

and	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
red	NULL
coal	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cigar	NULL
:	NULL
Alec	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
there	NULL
alone	NULL

He	NULL
beckoned	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

she	NULL
reluctantly	NULL
retreated	NULL
towards	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
tired	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
long	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
walk	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
confided	NULL
her	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL

been	NULL
waiting	NULL
ever	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL

have	NULL
their	NULL
company	NULL
home	NULL

because	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL
was	NULL
strange	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
it	NULL
seems	NULL
they	NULL

never	NULL

"	NULL
Certainly	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL

I	NULL

Tess	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
flattered	NULL

had	NULL
never	NULL
quite	NULL
got	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL

preferred	NULL

So	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
that	NULL

much	NULL
obliged	NULL

him	NULL

would	NULL
not	NULL
trouble	NULL
him	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
put	NULL
himself	NULL
forward	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
had	NULL
perceived	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
his	NULL
presence	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
pause	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
consideration	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
was	NULL
flying	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
re-lit	NULL
a	NULL
cigar	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
Trantridge	NULL
people	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
collect	NULL
themselves	NULL
from	NULL
amid	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
from	NULL
other	NULL
farms	NULL

prepared	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
body	NULL

Their	NULL
bundles	NULL

were	NULL
gathered	NULL
up	NULL

half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
clock-chime	NULL
sounded	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
past	NULL
eleven	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
straggling	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
which	NULL
led	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL
towards	NULL
their	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
three-mile	NULL

road	NULL

made	NULL
whiter	NULL
to-night	NULL

the	NULL

followed	NULL
the	NULL

all	NULL

them	NULL

the	NULL
moon	NULL

they	NULL

Tess	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL

had	NULL
undergone	NULL
such	NULL

the	NULL

spoilt	NULL
the	NULL
pleasure	NULL

was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
moonlight	NULL

.	NULL

Yet	NULL
she	NULL
stuck	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
party	NULL

for	NULL
reasons	NULL
above	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL

progressed	NULL

now	NULL

through	NULL

finding	NULL
a	NULL

closed	NULL
up	NULL

This	NULL

pedestrian	NULL
was	NULL

Hastily	NULL
lowering	NULL

the	NULL

found	NULL

By	NULL

laughter	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL

flinging	NULL
herself	NULL

her	NULL

the	NULL

The	NULL
rather	NULL
too	NULL
inclusive	NULL
speech	NULL
brought	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
torrent	NULL
of	NULL
vituperation	NULL
from	NULL
other	NULL

fair	NULL
Tess	NULL

Several	NULL

also	NULL
chimed	NULL

with	NULL
an	NULL
animus	NULL
which	NULL
none	NULL

as	NULL
to	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL
rollicking	NULL
evening	NULL
they	NULL

passed	NULL

Thereupon	NULL
,	NULL
finding	NULL
Tess	NULL
unfairly	NULL
browbeaten	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
husbands	NULL

lovers	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
peace	NULL
by	NULL
defending	NULL

but	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
attempt	NULL
was	NULL
directly	NULL
to	NULL
increase	NULL
the	NULL
war	NULL

Tess	NULL
was	NULL
indignant	NULL
and	NULL
ashamed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
minded	NULL
the	NULL
loneliness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
lateness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
one	NULL
object	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
crew	NULL

soon	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
well	NULL
enough	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

among	NULL
them	NULL
would	NULL
repent	NULL

passion	NULL
next	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
now	NULL
inside	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
edging	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
rush	NULL
off	NULL
alone	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
horseman	NULL
emerged	NULL
almost	NULL
silently	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hedge	NULL
that	NULL
screened	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL

and	NULL
Alec	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
explanation	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
readily	NULL
forthcoming	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
require	NULL
any	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
heard	NULL
their	NULL
voices	NULL
while	NULL
yet	NULL
some	NULL
way	NULL
off	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
ridden	NULL
creepingly	NULL
forward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
learnt	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
satisfy	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
apart	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
,	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
bent	NULL
over	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

up	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
whispered	NULL

'll	NULL

shot	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
almost	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
faint	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
vivid	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
crisis	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
almost	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
refused	NULL
such	NULL
proffered	NULL
aid	NULL

company	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
refused	NULL
them	NULL
several	NULL
times	NULL
before	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL
loneliness	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
itself	NULL
have	NULL
forced	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
otherwise	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
coming	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
invitation	NULL
did	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
particular	NULL
juncture	NULL
when	NULL
fear	NULL

indignation	NULL
at	NULL
these	NULL
adversaries	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
transformed	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
spring	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
triumph	NULL
over	NULL
them	NULL

she	NULL
abandoned	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
impulse	NULL

climbed	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL

put	NULL
her	NULL
toe	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
instep	NULL

and	NULL
scrambled	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL

behind	NULL
him	NULL

The	NULL

were	NULL
speeding	NULL
away	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL

gray	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

became	NULL
aware	NULL

what	NULL

The	NULL
Queen	NULL

forgot	NULL
the	NULL

stood	NULL

all	NULL

his	NULL

her	NULL

whatever	NULL

adhered	NULL

it	NULL

persistently	NULL
beautified	NULL
it	NULL

till	NULL
the	NULL

seemed	NULL
an	NULL

The	NULL

for	NULL
some	NULL

without	NULL

Tess	NULL

him	NULL
still	NULL

in	NULL
other	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
perceived	NULL
that	NULL

sometimes	NULL

felt	NULL

though	NULL
her	NULL

precarious	NULL
enough	NULL

her	NULL
tight	NULL

him	NULL

She	NULL
begged	NULL
him	NULL

Alec	NULL
accordingly	NULL
did	NULL

said	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL
object	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
confession	NULL

knew	NULL
that	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
horse	NULL
ambled	NULL
along	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
considerable	NULL
distance	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL
luminous	NULL
fog	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
hung	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hollows	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
became	NULL
general	NULL
and	NULL
enveloped	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
the	NULL
moonlight	NULL
in	NULL
suspension	NULL
,	NULL
rendering	NULL
it	NULL
more	NULL
pervasive	NULL
than	NULL
in	NULL
clear	NULL
air	NULL

Whether	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
account	NULL

or	NULL
from	NULL
absent-mindedness	NULL

from	NULL

she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
perceive	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL

Trantridge	NULL
branched	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
conductor	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
Trantridge	NULL
track	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
inexpressibly	NULL
weary	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
at	NULL
five	NULL
o'clock	NULL
every	NULL
morning	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
week	NULL

had	NULL
been	NULL
on	NULL

the	NULL

on	NULL
this	NULL
evening	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL

walked	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
miles	NULL
to	NULL
Chaseborough	NULL

waited	NULL
three	NULL
hours	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
neighbours	NULL
without	NULL

her	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
then	NULL
walked	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
home	NULL

and	NULL
had	NULL
undergone	NULL
the	NULL
excitement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
quarrel	NULL

till	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
slow	NULL
progress	NULL

was	NULL
now	NULL
nearly	NULL
one	NULL
o'clock	NULL
.	NULL

Only	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL

was	NULL
she	NULL
overcome	NULL
by	NULL
actual	NULL
drowsiness	NULL

In	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
oblivion	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
sank	NULL
gently	NULL
against	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

D'Urberville	NULL
stopped	NULL
the	NULL
horse	NULL
,	NULL
withdrew	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
stirrups	NULL
,	NULL
turned	NULL
sideways	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
saddle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
enclosed	NULL
her	NULL
waist	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
to	NULL
support	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
immediately	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
defensive	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
sudden	NULL
impulses	NULL
of	NULL
reprisal	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
liable	NULL
she	NULL
gave	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
push	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
his	NULL
ticklish	NULL
position	NULL
he	NULL
nearly	NULL
lost	NULL
his	NULL
balance	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
just	NULL
avoided	NULL
rolling	NULL
over	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
horse	NULL

though	NULL
a	NULL

being	NULL
fortunately	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL

A	NULL
clamber	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL

brought	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

recognized	NULL

D'Urberville	NULL
thereupon	NULL
turned	NULL
back	NULL

by	NULL
this	NULL

the	NULL

gone	NULL
down	NULL

partly	NULL
on	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL

The	NULL
obscurity	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
so	NULL
great	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
absolutely	NULL
nothing	NULL

a	NULL

at	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL

which	NULL
represented	NULL

had	NULL
left	NULL

Everything	NULL

D'Urberville	NULL
stooped	NULL

heard	NULL
a	NULL

He	NULL
knelt	NULL

bent	NULL
lower	NULL

till	NULL
her	NULL
breath	NULL
warmed	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL

and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
his	NULL
cheek	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
contact	NULL

hers	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
sleeping	NULL
soundly	NULL

and	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
eyelashes	NULL
there	NULL
lingered	NULL
tears	NULL

Darkness	NULL
and	NULL
silence	NULL
ruled	NULL
everywhere	NULL
around	NULL

Above	NULL
them	NULL
rose	NULL
the	NULL
primeval	NULL
yews	NULL

oaks	NULL

The	NULL
Chase	NULL

in	NULL

about	NULL
them	NULL
stole	NULL
the	NULL
hopping	NULL
rabbits	NULL

hares	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
some	NULL

where	NULL

Tess	NULL

a	NULL
man	NULL

who	NULL
held	NULL
up	NULL

She	NULL
obeyed	NULL
the	NULL
signal	NULL

wait	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
unspeculative	NULL

and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL

man	NULL

stopped	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL

You	NULL

how	NULL

for	NULL

She	NULL
listlessly	NULL
placed	NULL
her	NULL
basket	NULL

bundle	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
dog-cart	NULL

and	NULL
stepped	NULL
up	NULL

and	NULL
they	NULL
sat	NULL
side	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL

him	NULL
now	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
cause	NULL

D'Urberville	NULL
mechanically	NULL
lit	NULL
a	NULL
cigar	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
journey	NULL
was	NULL
continued	NULL
with	NULL

He	NULL

her	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL

they	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL

she	NULL
sat	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL

replying	NULL

After	NULL

curiosity	NULL

reputation	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL
reaching	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
tea-things	NULL
from	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL
hear	NULL

Upon	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
warmth	NULL

invited	NULL

spirits	NULL
also	NULL

as	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
wore	NULL
on	NULL

she	NULL
caught	NULL
the	NULL
infection	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
excitement	NULL

and	NULL
grew	NULL
almost	NULL
gay	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
marble	NULL
hardness	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL

she	NULL
moved	NULL
with	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
bounding	NULL
step	NULL

and	NULL
flushed	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
young	NULL
beauty	NULL

At	NULL
moments	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
thought	NULL

she	NULL
would	NULL
reply	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
inquiries	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

her	NULL
experiences	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL

been	NULL
slightly	NULL

who	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
turned	NULL
them	NULL
again	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
service	NULL
proceeded	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
observing	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
whispered	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
their	NULL
whispers	NULL
were	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
grew	NULL
sick	NULL
at	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bedroom	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
shared	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
formed	NULL
her	NULL
retreat	NULL
more	NULL
continually	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
few	NULL
square	NULL
yards	NULL
of	NULL
thatch	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
watched	NULL
winds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
snows	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rains	NULL
,	NULL
gorgeous	NULL
sunsets	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
successive	NULL
moons	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
full	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
close	NULL
kept	NULL
she	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
almost	NULL
everybody	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
only	NULL
exercise	NULL
that	NULL
Tess	NULL
took	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
was	NULL
after	NULL
dark	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
woods	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
least	NULL
solitary	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
hit	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
hair	NULL
's	NULL
-	NULL
breadth	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
evening	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
are	NULL
so	NULL
evenly	NULL
balanced	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
constraint	NULL
of	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
suspense	NULL
of	NULL
night	NULL
neutralize	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
absolute	NULL
mental	NULL
liberty	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
plight	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
alive	NULL
becomes	NULL
attenuated	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
least	NULL
possible	NULL
dimensions	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
fear	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shadows	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
sole	NULL
idea	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
shun	NULL
mankind	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
that	NULL
cold	NULL
accretion	NULL
called	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
terrible	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mass	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
so	NULL
unformidable	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
pitiable	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
units	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
these	NULL
lonely	NULL
hills	NULL
and	NULL
dales	NULL
her	NULL
quiescent	NULL
glide	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
element	NULL
she	NULL
moved	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
flexuous	NULL
and	NULL
stealthy	NULL
figure	NULL
became	NULL
an	NULL
integral	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
times	NULL
her	NULL
whimsical	NULL
fancy	NULL
would	NULL
intensify	NULL
natural	NULL
processes	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
story	NULL
.	NULL

Rather	NULL
they	NULL
became	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
psychological	NULL
phenomenon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
seemed	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
midnight	NULL
airs	NULL
and	NULL
gusts	NULL
,	NULL
moaning	NULL
amongst	NULL
the	NULL
tightly-wrapped	NULL
buds	NULL
and	NULL
bark	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
twigs	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
formulae	NULL
of	NULL
bitter	NULL
reproach	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
wet	NULL
day	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
expression	NULL
of	NULL
irremediable	NULL
grief	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
weakness	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
vague	NULL
ethical	NULL
being	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
class	NULL
definitely	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
God	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
childhood	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
comprehend	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
encompassment	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
characterization	NULL
,	NULL
based	NULL
on	NULL
shreds	NULL
of	NULL
convention	NULL
,	NULL
peopled	NULL
by	NULL
phantoms	NULL
and	NULL
voices	NULL
antipathetic	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sorry	NULL
and	NULL
mistaken	NULL
creation	NULL
of	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
fancy	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
cloud	NULL
of	NULL
moral	NULL
hobgoblins	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
terrified	NULL
without	NULL
reason	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
they	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
harmony	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
actual	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
she	NULL
.	NULL

Walking	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
sleeping	NULL
birds	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hedges	NULL
,	NULL
watching	NULL
the	NULL
skipping	NULL
rabbits	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
moonlit	NULL
warren	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
standing	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL
pheasant-laden	NULL
bough	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
herself	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
figure	NULL
of	NULL
Guilt	NULL
intruding	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
haunts	NULL
of	NULL
Innocence	NULL

But	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
distinction	NULL
where	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
difference	NULL
.	NULL

Feeling	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
antagonism	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
in	NULL
accord	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
to	NULL
break	NULL
an	NULL
accepted	NULL
social	NULL
law	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
law	NULL
known	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
environment	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
fancied	NULL
herself	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
anomaly	NULL
.	NULL

XIV	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
hazy	NULL
sunrise	NULL
in	NULL
August	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
denser	NULL
nocturnal	NULL
vapours	NULL
,	NULL
attacked	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
warm	NULL
beams	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
dividing	NULL
and	NULL
shrinking	NULL
into	NULL
isolated	NULL
fleeces	NULL
within	NULL
hollows	NULL
and	NULL
coverts	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
waited	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
dried	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mist	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
sentient	NULL
,	NULL
personal	NULL
look	NULL
,	NULL
demanding	NULL
the	NULL
masculine	NULL
pronoun	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL
adequate	NULL
expression	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
present	NULL
aspect	NULL
,	NULL
coupled	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
lack	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
human	NULL
forms	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
,	NULL
explained	NULL
the	NULL
old-time	NULL
heliolatries	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
could	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
saner	NULL
religion	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
prevailed	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
luminary	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
golden-haired	NULL
,	NULL
beaming	NULL
,	NULL
mild-eyed	NULL
,	NULL
God-like	NULL
creature	NULL
,	NULL
gazing	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
vigour	NULL
and	NULL
intentness	NULL
of	NULL
youth	NULL
upon	NULL
an	NULL
earth	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
brimming	NULL
with	NULL
interest	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
broke	NULL
though	NULL
chinks	NULL
of	NULL
cottage	NULL
shutters	NULL
,	NULL
throwing	NULL
stripes	NULL
like	NULL
red-hot	NULL
pokers	NULL
upon	NULL
cupboards	NULL
,	NULL
chests	NULL
of	NULL
drawers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
furniture	NULL
within	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
awakening	NULL
harvesters	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
already	NULL
astir	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
ruddy	NULL
things	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
the	NULL
brightest	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
broad	NULL
arms	NULL
of	NULL
painted	NULL
wood	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
rose	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
margin	NULL
of	NULL
yellow	NULL
cornfield	NULL
hard	NULL
by	NULL
Marlott	NULL
village	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
others	NULL
below	NULL
,	NULL
formed	NULL
the	NULL
revolving	NULL
Maltese	NULL
cross	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
reaping-machine	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
previous	NULL
evening	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
ready	NULL
for	NULL
operations	NULL
this	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
paint	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
smeared	NULL
,	NULL
intensified	NULL
in	NULL
hue	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sunlight	NULL
,	NULL
imparted	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
dipped	NULL
in	NULL
liquid	NULL
fire	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
field	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
been	NULL
"	NULL
opened	NULL
"	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
lane	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
feet	NULL
wide	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
hand-cut	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
wheat	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
circumference	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
passage	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
horses	NULL
and	NULL
machine	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
groups	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
lads	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
of	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
just	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
shadows	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
eastern	NULL
hedge-top	NULL
struck	NULL
the	NULL
west	NULL
hedge	NULL
midway	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
heads	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
groups	NULL
were	NULL
enjoying	NULL
sunrise	NULL
while	NULL
their	NULL
feet	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
dawn	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
disappeared	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
stone	NULL
posts	NULL
which	NULL
flanked	NULL
the	NULL
nearest	NULL
field-gate	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
there	NULL
arose	NULL
from	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
ticking	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
love-making	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
grasshopper	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
machine	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
moving	NULL
concatenation	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
horses	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
aforesaid	NULL
long	NULL
rickety	NULL
machine	NULL
was	NULL
visible	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
driver	NULL
sitting	NULL
upon	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hauling	NULL
horses	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
attendant	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
seat	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
implement	NULL
.	NULL

Along	NULL
one	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
wain	NULL
went	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
arms	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mechanical	NULL
reaper	NULL
revolving	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
passed	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL
quite	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
sight	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
equable	NULL
pace	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
glistening	NULL
brass	NULL
star	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
forehead	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fore	NULL
horse	NULL
first	NULL
catching	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
rose	NULL
into	NULL
view	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
stubble	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
bright	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
machine	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
narrow	NULL
lane	NULL
of	NULL
stubble	NULL
encompassing	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
grew	NULL
wider	NULL
with	NULL
each	NULL
circuit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
standing	NULL
corn	NULL
was	NULL
reduced	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
smaller	NULL
area	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
wore	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Rabbits	NULL
,	NULL
hares	NULL
,	NULL
snakes	NULL
,	NULL
rats	NULL
,	NULL
mice	NULL
,	NULL
retreated	NULL
inwards	NULL
as	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
fastness	NULL
,	NULL
unaware	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ephemeral	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
refuge	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
doom	NULL
that	NULL
awaited	NULL
them	NULL
later	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
covert	NULL
shrinking	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
horrible	NULL
narrowness	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
huddled	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
friends	NULL
and	NULL
foes	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
few	NULL
yards	NULL
of	NULL
upright	NULL
wheat	NULL
fell	NULL
also	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
teeth	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
unerring	NULL
reaper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
put	NULL
to	NULL
death	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sticks	NULL
and	NULL
stones	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
harvesters	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
reaping-machine	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
fallen	NULL
corn	NULL
behind	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
little	NULL
heaps	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
heap	NULL
being	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
quantity	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
sheaf	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
upon	NULL
these	NULL
the	NULL
active	NULL
binders	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rear	NULL
laid	NULL
their	NULL
hands	NULL
--	NULL
mainly	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
print	NULL
shirts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
trousers	NULL
supported	NULL
round	NULL
their	NULL
waists	NULL
by	NULL
leather	NULL
straps	NULL
,	NULL
rendering	NULL
useless	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
buttons	NULL
behind	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
twinkled	NULL
and	NULL
bristled	NULL
with	NULL
sunbeams	NULL
at	NULL
every	NULL
movement	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
wearer	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
eyes	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
sex	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
interesting	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
company	NULL
of	NULL
binders	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
reason	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
charm	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
acquired	NULL
by	NULL
woman	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
becomes	NULL
part	NULL
and	NULL
parcel	NULL
of	NULL
outdoor	NULL
nature	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
merely	NULL
an	NULL
object	NULL
set	NULL
down	NULL
therein	NULL
as	NULL
at	NULL
ordinary	NULL
times	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
field-man	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
personality	NULL
afield	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
field-woman	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
portion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
somehow	NULL
lost	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
margin	NULL
,	NULL
imbibed	NULL
the	NULL
essence	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
surrounding	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
assimilated	NULL
herself	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
women	NULL
--	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
mostly	NULL
young	NULL
--	NULL
wore	NULL
drawn	NULL
cotton	NULL
bonnets	NULL
with	NULL
great	NULL
flapping	NULL
curtains	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gloves	NULL
to	NULL
prevent	NULL
their	NULL
hands	NULL
being	NULL
wounded	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
stubble	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
wearing	NULL
a	NULL
pale	NULL
pink	NULL
jacket	NULL
,	NULL
another	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cream-coloured	NULL
tight-sleeved	NULL
gown	NULL
,	NULL
another	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
petticoat	NULL
as	NULL
red	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
arms	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
reaping-machine	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
older	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
brown-rough	NULL
"	NULL
wropper	NULL
"	NULL
or	NULL
over-all	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
old-established	NULL
and	NULL
most	NULL
appropriate	NULL
dress	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
field-woman	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
ones	NULL
were	NULL
abandoning	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
morning	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
returns	NULL
involuntarily	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pink	NULL
cotton	NULL
jacket	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
flexuous	NULL
and	NULL
finely-drawn	NULL
figure	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
her	NULL
bonnet	NULL
is	NULL
pulled	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
brow	NULL
that	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
is	NULL
disclosed	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
binds	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
her	NULL
complexion	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
guessed	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
stray	NULL
twine	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
of	NULL
dark	NULL
brown	NULL
hair	NULL
which	NULL
extends	NULL
below	NULL
the	NULL
curtain	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
bonnet	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
one	NULL
reason	NULL
why	NULL
she	NULL
seduces	NULL
casual	NULL
attention	NULL
is	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
courts	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
women	NULL
often	NULL
gaze	NULL
around	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
binding	NULL
proceeds	NULL
with	NULL
clock-like	NULL
monotony	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
sheaf	NULL
last	NULL
finished	NULL
she	NULL
draws	NULL
a	NULL
handful	NULL
of	NULL
ears	NULL
,	NULL
patting	NULL
their	NULL
tips	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
left	NULL
palm	NULL
to	NULL
bring	NULL
them	NULL
even	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL

holding	NULL
the	NULL

She	NULL
brings	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL

and	NULL
kneels	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

beating	NULL
back	NULL

now	NULL

A	NULL
bit	NULL

her	NULL

visible	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
buff	NULL

the	NULL

her	NULL

as	NULL
the	NULL

wears	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL
feminine	NULL
smoothness	NULL
becomes	NULL
scarified	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
stubble	NULL

At	NULL

she	NULL
stands	NULL
up	NULL

to	NULL
retie	NULL
her	NULL

Then	NULL

see	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
a	NULL

with	NULL

it	NULL

After	NULL
a	NULL

a	NULL

the	NULL

nothing	NULL

being	NULL
so	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL

Tess	NULL

the	NULL

They	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
breakfast	NULL

came	NULL
again	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
proceeded	NULL
as	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
of	NULL
eleven	NULL
drew	NULL
near	NULL
a	NULL
person	NULL
watching	NULL
her	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL
every	NULL
now	NULL

then	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
glance	NULL
flitted	NULL
wistfully	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
brow	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
pause	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
sheafing	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
verge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
the	NULL
heads	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
children	NULL

of	NULL
ages	NULL
ranging	NULL
from	NULL
six	NULL
to	NULL
fourteen	NULL
,	NULL
rose	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
stubbly	NULL
convexity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
Tess	NULL
flushed	NULL
slightly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
still	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
pause	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
eldest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
comers	NULL

a	NULL
girl	NULL
who	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
triangular	NULL
shawl	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
corner	NULL
draggling	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stubble	NULL
,	NULL
carried	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
what	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
sight	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
doll	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
proved	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
an	NULL
infant	NULL
in	NULL
long	NULL
clothes	NULL
.	NULL

Another	NULL
brought	NULL
some	NULL
lunch	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
harvesters	NULL
ceased	NULL
working	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
their	NULL
provisions	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
against	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shocks	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
they	NULL
fell	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
plying	NULL
a	NULL
stone	NULL
jar	NULL
freely	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
passing	NULL
round	NULL
a	NULL
cup	NULL

Tess	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
to	NULL
suspend	NULL
her	NULL
labours	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
shock	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
turned	NULL
somewhat	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
companions	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
deposited	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
rabbit-skin	NULL
cap	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
red	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
tucked	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
belt	NULL
,	NULL
held	NULL
the	NULL
cup	NULL
of	NULL
ale	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL

the	NULL

for	NULL
her	NULL

drink	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
accept	NULL
his	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
lunch	NULL
was	NULL
spread	NULL
she	NULL
called	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
big	NULL
girl	NULL

her	NULL

took	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL

her	NULL

who	NULL
,	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL

relieved	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
burden	NULL

went	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
shock	NULL

joined	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
children	NULL
playing	NULL
there	NULL

Tess	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
curiously	NULL
stealthy	NULL
yet	NULL
courageous	NULL
movement	NULL

and	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
still	NULL
rising	NULL
colour	NULL
,	NULL
unfastened	NULL
her	NULL
frock	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
suckling	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
men	NULL
who	NULL
sat	NULL
nearest	NULL
considerately	NULL
turned	NULL
their	NULL
faces	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL

some	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
beginning	NULL

smoke	NULL

one	NULL

with	NULL
absent-minded	NULL
fondness	NULL

regretfully	NULL
stroking	NULL
the	NULL
jar	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
no	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

When	NULL

taken	NULL
it	NULL

Most	NULL

their	NULL
pipes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
horses	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
unharnessed	NULL
and	NULL
fed	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
again	NULL
attached	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
scarlet	NULL
machine	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
quickly	NULL
eaten	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
meal	NULL
,	NULL
beckoned	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
eldest	NULL
sister	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
take	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
,	NULL
fastened	NULL
her	NULL
dress	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
buff	NULL
gloves	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stooped	NULL
anew	NULL
to	NULL
draw	NULL
a	NULL
bond	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
completed	NULL
sheaf	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
tying	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
and	NULL
evening	NULL
the	NULL
proceedings	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
were	NULL
continued	NULL
,	NULL
Tess	NULL
staying	NULL
on	NULL
till	NULL
dusk	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
of	NULL
harvesters	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
all	NULL
rode	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
largest	NULL
wagons	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
company	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
broad	NULL
tarnished	NULL
moon	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
eastwards	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
face	NULL
resembling	NULL
the	NULL
outworn	NULL
gold-leaf	NULL
halo	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
worm-eaten	NULL
Tuscan	NULL
saint	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
's	NULL
female	NULL
companions	NULL
sang	NULL
songs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
showed	NULL
themselves	NULL
very	NULL
sympathetic	NULL
and	NULL
glad	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
reappearance	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
doors	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
refrain	NULL
from	NULL
mischievously	NULL
throwing	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
verses	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ballad	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
maid	NULL
who	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
merry	NULL
green	NULL
wood	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
a	NULL
changed	NULL
state	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
counterpoises	NULL
and	NULL
compensations	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
event	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
social	NULL
warning	NULL
had	NULL
also	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
interesting	NULL
personage	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
to	NULL
many	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
friendliness	NULL
won	NULL
her	NULL
still	NULL
farther	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
lively	NULL
spirits	NULL
were	NULL
contagious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
became	NULL
almost	NULL
gay	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
moral	NULL
sorrows	NULL
were	NULL
passing	NULL
away	NULL
a	NULL
fresh	NULL
one	NULL
arose	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
natural	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
which	NULL
knew	NULL
no	NULL
social	NULL
law	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
reached	NULL
home	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
grief	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
suddenly	NULL
taken	NULL
ill	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
such	NULL
collapse	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
probable	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
tender	NULL
and	NULL
puny	NULL
was	NULL
its	NULL
frame	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
event	NULL
came	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
shock	NULL
nevertheless	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
baby	NULL
's	NULL
offence	NULL
against	NULL
society	NULL
in	NULL
coming	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
forgotten	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
girl-mother	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
soul	NULL
's	NULL
desire	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
continue	NULL
that	NULL
offence	NULL
by	NULL
preserving	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
soon	NULL
grew	NULL
clear	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
of	NULL
emancipation	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
little	NULL
prisoner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
flesh	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
arrive	NULL
earlier	NULL
than	NULL
her	NULL
worst	NULL
misgiving	NULL
had	NULL
conjectured	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
discovered	NULL
this	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
plunged	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
misery	NULL
which	NULL
transcended	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
's	NULL
simple	NULL
loss	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
baby	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
baptized	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
had	NULL
drifted	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
frame	NULL
of	NULL
mind	NULL
which	NULL
accepted	NULL
passively	NULL
the	NULL
consideration	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
burn	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
burn	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Like	NULL
all	NULL
village	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
grounded	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Holy	NULL
Scriptures	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
dutifully	NULL
studied	NULL
the	NULL
histories	NULL
of	NULL
Aholah	NULL
and	NULL
Aholibah	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
inferences	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
drawn	NULL
therefrom	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
question	NULL
arose	NULL
with	NULL
regard	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
different	NULL
colour	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
darling	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
die	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
salvation	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
bedtime	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
rushed	NULL
downstairs	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
send	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
parson	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
moment	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
one	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
antique	NULL
nobility	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL
was	NULL
highest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
sensitiveness	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
smudge	NULL
which	NULL
Tess	NULL
had	NULL
set	NULL
upon	NULL
that	NULL
nobility	NULL
most	NULL
pronounced	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
returned	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
weekly	NULL
booze	NULL
at	NULL
Rolliver	NULL
's	NULL
Inn	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
parson	NULL
should	NULL
come	NULL
inside	NULL
his	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
declared	NULL
,	NULL
prying	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
affairs	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
shame	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
more	NULL
necessary	NULL
than	NULL
ever	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
locked	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL
key	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
pocket	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
household	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
distressed	NULL
beyond	NULL
measure	NULL
,	NULL
Tess	NULL
retired	NULL
also	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
continually	NULL
waking	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
lay	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
worse	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
obviously	NULL
dying	NULL
--	NULL
quietly	NULL
and	NULL
painlessly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
none	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
surely	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
her	NULL
misery	NULL
she	NULL
rocked	NULL
herself	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
clock	NULL
struck	NULL
the	NULL
solemn	NULL
hour	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
hour	NULL
when	NULL
fancy	NULL
stalks	NULL
outside	NULL
reason	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
malignant	NULL
possibilities	NULL
stand	NULL
rock-firm	NULL
as	NULL
facts	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
consigned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
nethermost	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
hell	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
its	NULL
double	NULL
doom	NULL
for	NULL
lack	NULL
of	NULL
baptism	NULL
and	NULL
lack	NULL
of	NULL
legitimacy	NULL
;	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
arch-fiend	NULL
tossing	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
three-pronged	NULL
fork	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
they	NULL
used	NULL
for	NULL
heating	NULL
the	NULL
oven	NULL
on	NULL
baking	NULL
days	NULL
;	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
picture	NULL
she	NULL
added	NULL
many	NULL
other	NULL
quaint	NULL
and	NULL
curious	NULL
details	NULL
of	NULL
torment	NULL
sometimes	NULL
taught	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
Christian	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lurid	NULL
presentment	NULL
so	NULL
powerfully	NULL
affected	NULL
her	NULL
imagination	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sleeping	NULL
house	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
nightgown	NULL
became	NULL
damp	NULL
with	NULL
perspiration	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
bedstead	NULL
shook	NULL
with	NULL
each	NULL
throb	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
infant	NULL
's	NULL
breathing	NULL
grew	NULL
more	NULL
difficult	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
mental	NULL
tension	NULL
increased	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
useless	NULL
to	NULL
devour	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
thing	NULL
with	NULL
kisses	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
stay	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
walked	NULL
feverishly	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
O	NULL
merciful	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
have	NULL
pity	NULL
;	NULL
have	NULL
pity	NULL
upon	NULL
my	NULL
poor	NULL
baby	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
cried	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Heap	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
anger	NULL
as	NULL
you	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
upon	NULL
me	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
welcome	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
pity	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
leant	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
chest	NULL
of	NULL
drawers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
murmured	NULL
incoherent	NULL
supplications	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
suddenly	NULL
started	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ah	NULL
!	NULL

perhaps	NULL
baby	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
saved	NULL
!	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
it	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
spoke	NULL
so	NULL
brightly	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
shone	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
gloom	NULL
surrounding	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
lit	NULL
a	NULL
candle	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
third	NULL
bed	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
awoke	NULL
her	NULL
young	NULL
sisters	NULL
and	NULL
brothers	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
occupied	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Pulling	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
washing-stand	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
behind	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
poured	NULL
some	NULL
water	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
jug	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
them	NULL
kneel	NULL
around	NULL
,	NULL
putting	NULL
their	NULL
hands	NULL
together	NULL
with	NULL
fingers	NULL
exactly	NULL
vertical	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
,	NULL
scarcely	NULL
awake	NULL
,	NULL
awe-stricken	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
manner	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
eyes	NULL
growing	NULL
larger	NULL
and	NULL
larger	NULL
,	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
bed	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
's	NULL
child	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
immature	NULL
as	NULL
scarce	NULL
to	NULL
seem	NULL
a	NULL
sufficient	NULL
personality	NULL
to	NULL
endow	NULL
its	NULL
producer	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
maternal	NULL
title	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
then	NULL
stood	NULL
erect	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
infant	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
arm	NULL
beside	NULL
the	NULL
basin	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
sister	NULL
held	NULL
the	NULL
Prayer-Book	NULL
open	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
clerk	NULL
at	NULL
church	NULL
held	NULL
it	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
parson	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
set	NULL
about	NULL
baptizing	NULL
her	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
figure	NULL
looked	NULL
singularly	NULL
tall	NULL
and	NULL
imposing	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
long	NULL
white	NULL
nightgown	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
thick	NULL
cable	NULL
of	NULL
twisted	NULL
dark	NULL
hair	NULL
hanging	NULL
straight	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
waist	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
kindly	NULL
dimness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
weak	NULL
candle	NULL
abstracted	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
form	NULL
and	NULL
features	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
blemishes	NULL
which	NULL
sunlight	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
revealed	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
stubble	NULL
scratches	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
wrists	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
weariness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
--	NULL
her	NULL
high	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
having	NULL
a	NULL
transfiguring	NULL
effect	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
her	NULL
undoing	NULL
,	NULL
showing	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
of	NULL
immaculate	NULL
beauty	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
dignity	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
regal	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
little	NULL
ones	NULL
kneeling	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
sleepy	NULL
eyes	NULL
blinking	NULL
and	NULL
red	NULL
,	NULL
awaited	NULL
her	NULL
preparations	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
suspended	NULL
wonder	NULL
which	NULL
their	NULL
physical	NULL
heaviness	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
hour	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
allow	NULL
to	NULL
become	NULL
active	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
most	NULL
impressed	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
said	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Be	NULL
you	NULL
really	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
christen	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
Tess	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
girl-mother	NULL
replied	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
grave	NULL
affirmative	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
's	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
name	NULL
suggested	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
phrase	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
book	NULL
of	NULL
Genesis	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
proceeded	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
baptismal	NULL
service	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
she	NULL
pronounced	NULL
it	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
SORROW	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
baptize	NULL
thee	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Father	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Son	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Holy	NULL
Ghost	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
sprinkled	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Say	NULL
'	NULL
Amen	NULL
,	NULL
'	NULL
children	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
tiny	NULL
voices	NULL
piped	NULL
in	NULL
obedient	NULL
response	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Amen	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

Tess	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
We	NULL
receive	NULL
this	NULL
child	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
forth	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
do	NULL
sign	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Cross	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Here	NULL
she	NULL
dipped	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
basin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fervently	NULL
drew	NULL
an	NULL
immense	NULL
cross	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
forefinger	NULL
,	NULL
continuing	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
customary	NULL
sentences	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
manfully	NULL
fighting	NULL
against	NULL
sin	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
devil	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
faithful	NULL
soldier	NULL
and	NULL
servant	NULL
unto	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
's	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
duly	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Lord	NULL
's	NULL
Prayer	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
lisping	NULL
it	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
thin	NULL
gnat-like	NULL
wail	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
conclusion	NULL
,	NULL
raising	NULL
their	NULL
voices	NULL
to	NULL
clerk	NULL
's	NULL
pitch	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
again	NULL
piped	NULL
into	NULL
silence	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Amen	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

Then	NULL
their	NULL
sister	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
much	NULL
augmented	NULL
confidence	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
efficacy	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sacrament	NULL
,	NULL
poured	NULL
forth	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
the	NULL
thanksgiving	NULL
that	NULL
follows	NULL
,	NULL
uttering	NULL
it	NULL
boldly	NULL
and	NULL
triumphantly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
stopt-diapason	NULL
note	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
voice	NULL
acquired	NULL
when	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
speech	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
will	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
forgotten	NULL
by	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
knew	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
ecstasy	NULL
of	NULL
faith	NULL
almost	NULL
apotheosized	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
set	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL

the	NULL

her	NULL

The	NULL

more	NULL
reverence	NULL

no	NULL

had	NULL
a	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
look	NULL

to	NULL
them	NULL
now	NULL

but	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL

awful	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL

nothing	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

limited	NULL
brilliancy	NULL
--	NULL
luckily	NULL
perhaps	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL

considering	NULL
his	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
blue	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
that	NULL
fragile	NULL
soldier	NULL

servant	NULL
breathed	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL

when	NULL
the	NULL

awoke	NULL
they	NULL
cried	NULL
bitterly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
begged	NULL
Sissy	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
another	NULL

The	NULL
calmness	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
possessed	NULL
Tess	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL

remained	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
daylight	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL

she	NULL
felt	NULL
her	NULL
terrors	NULL
about	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL

have	NULL
been	NULL
somewhat	NULL
exaggerated	NULL
;	NULL
whether	NULL
well	NULL

not	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
uneasiness	NULL
now	NULL

reasoning	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
Providence	NULL

not	NULL
ratify	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
act	NULL
of	NULL
approximation	NULL
she	NULL

for	NULL

lost	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
irregularity	NULL
--	NULL
either	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL

her	NULL

So	NULL
passed	NULL
away	NULL
Sorrow	NULL
the	NULL
Undesired	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL

that	NULL
bastard	NULL

Nature	NULL

to	NULL
whom	NULL
eternal	NULL

Tess	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
mused	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
christening	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL

wondered	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
doctrinally	NULL
sufficient	NULL
to	NULL
secure	NULL
a	NULL
Christian	NULL
burial	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
.	NULL

Nobody	NULL
could	NULL
tell	NULL
this	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
parson	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
parish	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
new-comer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
house	NULL
after	NULL
dusk	NULL

and	NULL
stood	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
summon	NULL
courage	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
in	NULL

The	NULL
enterprise	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
abandoned	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
by	NULL
accident	NULL
met	NULL
him	NULL
coming	NULL
homeward	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
gloom	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
mind	NULL
speaking	NULL
freely	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
should	NULL
like	NULL

ask	NULL
you	NULL
something	NULL

sir	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
expressed	NULL
his	NULL
willingness	NULL
to	NULL
listen	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
told	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
's	NULL
illness	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
extemporized	NULL
ordinance	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
added	NULL
earnestly	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
can	NULL
you	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL

will	NULL
it	NULL

Having	NULL
the	NULL

Yet	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
quickly	NULL

The	NULL

felt	NULL

Hearing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL

asked	NULL
Tess	NULL

How	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
reconciled	NULL

Somewhat	NULL

said	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
case	NULL
also	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL

So	NULL
the	NULL
baby	NULL
was	NULL
carried	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL

box	NULL

under	NULL
an	NULL
ancient	NULL
woman	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL
churchyard	NULL

night	NULL

buried	NULL

at	NULL
the	NULL
cost	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL

a	NULL
pint	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL

In	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
untoward	NULL

however	NULL
,	NULL
Tess	NULL
bravely	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
cross	NULL

a	NULL

she	NULL
stuck	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL
grave	NULL
one	NULL
evening	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL

Tess	NULL

At	NULL

muse	NULL
when	NULL

philosophically	NULL

She	NULL
became	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
creature	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
aspect	NULL
was	NULL
fair	NULL

her	NULL
soul	NULL
that	NULL

a	NULL
woman	NULL
whom	NULL
the	NULL
turbulent	NULL
experiences	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
year	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
had	NULL
quite	NULL
failed	NULL
to	NULL
demoralize	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
's	NULL
opinion	NULL
those	NULL
experiences	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
simply	NULL
a	NULL
liberal	NULL
education	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
held	NULL
so	NULL
aloof	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
trouble	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
generally	NULL
known	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
forgotten	NULL
in	NULL
Marlott	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
became	NULL
evident	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
really	NULL
comfortable	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL

At	NULL
least	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
comfortable	NULL
there	NULL
till	NULL
long	NULL
years	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
obliterated	NULL
her	NULL
keen	NULL
consciousness	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
even	NULL
now	NULL
Tess	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL
pulse	NULL
of	NULL
hopeful	NULL
life	NULL
still	NULL
warm	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
happy	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
nook	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
memories	NULL

To	NULL
escape	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
appertained	NULL
thereto	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
annihilate	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
once	NULL
lost	NULL
always	NULL
lost	NULL
really	NULL
true	NULL
of	NULL
chastity	NULL
?	NULL

she	NULL
would	NULL
ask	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
might	NULL
prove	NULL
it	NULL
false	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
veil	NULL
bygones	NULL

The	NULL
recuperative	NULL
power	NULL
which	NULL
pervaded	NULL
organic	NULL
nature	NULL
was	NULL
surely	NULL
not	NULL
denied	NULL
to	NULL
maidenhood	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
waited	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
without	NULL
finding	NULL
opportunity	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
departure	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
particularly	NULL
fine	NULL
spring	NULL
came	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
stir	NULL
of	NULL
germination	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
audible	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
buds	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
moved	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
moved	NULL
the	NULL
wild	NULL
animals	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
passionate	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL

one	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
early	NULL

a	NULL

her	NULL

a	NULL
former	NULL
friend	NULL

her	NULL
mother	NULL

to	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
addressed	NULL

long	NULL
before	NULL

a	NULL
person	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
seen	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
skilful	NULL
milkmaid	NULL
was	NULL
required	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
dairy-house	NULL
many	NULL
miles	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
southward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
dairyman	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
months	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
off	NULL
as	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
wished	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
probably	NULL
far	NULL
enough	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
radius	NULL
of	NULL
movement	NULL
and	NULL
repute	NULL

been	NULL
so	NULL
small	NULL

On	NULL
one	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
resolved	NULL

there	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
dairymaid	NULL

and	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL

Her	NULL
mother	NULL
knew	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL

on	NULL
this	NULL
point	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
no	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL

that	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL

the	NULL

Yet	NULL
such	NULL

human	NULL
inconsistency	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL

The	NULL
dairy	NULL
called	NULL
Talbothays	NULL

for	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
bound	NULL

stood	NULL
not	NULL

the	NULL

of	NULL
her	NULL

their	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
think	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
that	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL

like	NULL
Babylon	NULL

fallen	NULL

that	NULL
the	NULL
individual	NULL
innocence	NULL

could	NULL
lapse	NULL
as	NULL
silently	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
any	NULL

might	NULL
come	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
being	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL

some	NULL
spirit	NULL
within	NULL
her	NULL
rose	NULL
automatically	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL

It	NULL

unexpected	NULL

surging	NULL
up	NULL
anew	NULL
after	NULL
its	NULL

in	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
curve	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL
looked	NULL
back	NULL
regretfully	NULL
at	NULL
Marlott	NULL

her	NULL
father	NULL

house	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
kindred	NULL
dwelling	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
continue	NULL
their	NULL
daily	NULL
lives	NULL
as	NULL
heretofore	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
great	NULL
diminution	NULL
of	NULL
pleasure	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
consciousness	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
far	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
deprived	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
would	NULL
engage	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
games	NULL
as	NULL
merrily	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
gap	NULL
left	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
departure	NULL

This	NULL
leaving	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

had	NULL
decided	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL

were	NULL
she	NULL
to	NULL
remain	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
gain	NULL
less	NULL
good	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
precepts	NULL
than	NULL
harm	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
example	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
through	NULL
Stourcastle	NULL
without	NULL
pausing	NULL
and	NULL
onward	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
junction	NULL
of	NULL
highways	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
await	NULL
a	NULL
carrier	NULL
's	NULL

that	NULL
ran	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
south-west	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
railways	NULL
which	NULL
engirdled	NULL
this	NULL
interior	NULL
tract	NULL
of	NULL
country	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
yet	NULL
struck	NULL
across	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
waiting	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
along	NULL
a	NULL
farmer	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
spring	NULL
cart	NULL
,	NULL
driving	NULL
approximately	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
pursue	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
stranger	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
she	NULL
accepted	NULL
his	NULL
offer	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
seat	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
ignoring	NULL
that	NULL
its	NULL
motive	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
tribute	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
countenance	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
Weatherbury	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
accompanying	NULL
him	NULL
thither	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
walk	NULL
the	NULL
remainder	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
travelling	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
van	NULL

way	NULL

Casterbridge	NULL

Tess	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
stop	NULL
at	NULL
Weatherbury	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
this	NULL
long	NULL
drive	NULL
,	NULL
further	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
nondescript	NULL
meal	NULL
at	NULL
noon	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
cottage	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
farmer	NULL
recommended	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Thence	NULL
she	NULL
started	NULL
on	NULL
foot	NULL
,	NULL
basket	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL

to	NULL
reach	NULL
the	NULL

never	NULL
before	NULL

this	NULL

the	NULL
country	NULL

and	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL

Not	NULL

The	NULL

her	NULL

she	NULL
bounded	NULL

She	NULL
heard	NULL

and	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
bird	NULL
's	NULL

Her	NULL

had	NULL
latterly	NULL
changed	NULL

states	NULL

continually	NULL
fluctuating	NULL

the	NULL

One	NULL

she	NULL

Tess	NULL

Being	NULL
even	NULL
now	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
twenty	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
mentally	NULL
and	NULL
sentimentally	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
finished	NULL
growing	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
that	NULL
any	NULL
event	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
left	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
an	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
capable	NULL
of	NULL
transmutation	NULL

And	NULL
thus	NULL
her	NULL
spirits	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
thankfulness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
hopes	NULL
,	NULL
rose	NULL
higher	NULL
and	NULL
higher	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
tried	NULL
several	NULL
ballads	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
found	NULL
them	NULL
inadequate	NULL
;	NULL
till	NULL
,	NULL
recollecting	NULL
the	NULL
psalter	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
wandered	NULL
over	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Sunday	NULL
morning	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
eaten	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tree	NULL
of	NULL
knowledge	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
chanted	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
O	NULL
ye	NULL
Sun	NULL

Moon	NULL

O	NULL
ye	NULL

ye	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
suddenly	NULL
stopped	NULL
and	NULL
murmured	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
But	NULL
perhaps	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
quite	NULL

"	NULL

And	NULL
probably	NULL
the	NULL
half-unconscious	NULL
rhapsody	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Fetishistic	NULL
utterance	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
Monotheistic	NULL

women	NULL
whose	NULL
chief	NULL

more	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
systematized	NULL

at	NULL
later	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
Tess	NULL
found	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
approximate	NULL
expression	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
feelings	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
_	NULL
Benedicite	NULL
_	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
lisped	NULL
from	NULL
infancy	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
high	NULL
contentment	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
initial	NULL
performance	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
started	NULL
towards	NULL
a	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
independent	NULL
living	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
temperament	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
really	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
uprightly	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
did	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
resembled	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
being	NULL
content	NULL
with	NULL
immediate	NULL
and	NULL
small	NULL
achievements	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
having	NULL
no	NULL
mind	NULL
for	NULL
laborious	NULL
effort	NULL
towards	NULL
such	NULL
petty	NULL
social	NULL
advancement	NULL
as	NULL
could	NULL
alone	NULL
be	NULL
effected	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
family	NULL
so	NULL
heavily	NULL
handicapped	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
once	NULL
powerful	NULL
d'Urbervilles	NULL
were	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
energy	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
unexpended	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
natural	NULL
energy	NULL
of	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
rekindled	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
experience	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
overwhelmed	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
be	NULL
told	NULL

women	NULL
do	NULL
as	NULL

rule	NULL
live	NULL
through	NULL
such	NULL
humiliations	NULL

and	NULL
regain	NULL
their	NULL
spirits	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
look	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
interested	NULL
eye	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
there	NULL
's	NULL
life	NULL
there	NULL
's	NULL
hope	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
conviction	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
entirely	NULL
unknown	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
betrayed	NULL
"	NULL
as	NULL
some	NULL
amiable	NULL
theorists	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL

believe	NULL

Tess	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
good	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
zest	NULL
for	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
descended	NULL
the	NULL
Egdon	NULL
slopes	NULL
lower	NULL
and	NULL
lower	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
dairy	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
pilgrimage	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
marked	NULL
difference	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
final	NULL
particular	NULL
,	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
rival	NULL
vales	NULL
now	NULL
showed	NULL
itself	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
secret	NULL
of	NULL
Blackmoor	NULL
was	NULL
best	NULL
discovered	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
heights	NULL
around	NULL
;	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
aright	NULL
the	NULL
valley	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
descend	NULL
into	NULL
its	NULL
midst	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Tess	NULL
had	NULL
accomplished	NULL
this	NULL
feat	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
standing	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
carpeted	NULL
level	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
stretched	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
east	NULL
and	NULL
west	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
could	NULL
reach	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
river	NULL
had	NULL
stolen	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
higher	NULL
tracts	NULL
and	NULL
brought	NULL
in	NULL
particles	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
vale	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
horizontal	NULL
land	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
exhausted	NULL
,	NULL
aged	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
attenuated	NULL
,	NULL
lay	NULL
serpentining	NULL
along	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
former	NULL
spoils	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
quite	NULL
sure	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
direction	NULL
,	NULL
Tess	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
hemmed	NULL
expanse	NULL
of	NULL
verdant	NULL
flatness	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
fly	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
billiard-table	NULL
of	NULL
indefinite	NULL
length	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
consequence	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
surroundings	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
fly	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sole	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
presence	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
placid	NULL
valley	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
to	NULL
excite	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
solitary	NULL
heron	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
descending	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
not	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
path	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
with	NULL
neck	NULL
erect	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Suddenly	NULL
there	NULL
arose	NULL
from	NULL
all	NULL
parts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lowland	NULL
a	NULL
prolonged	NULL
and	NULL
repeated	NULL
call	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Waow	NULL

waow	NULL
!	NULL

waow	NULL

"	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
furthest	NULL
east	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
furthest	NULL
west	NULL
the	NULL
cries	NULL
spread	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
by	NULL
contagion	NULL
,	NULL
accompanied	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
cases	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
barking	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
dog	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
expression	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
valley	NULL
's	NULL
consciousness	NULL
that	NULL
beautiful	NULL
Tess	NULL
had	NULL
arrived	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
ordinary	NULL
announcement	NULL
of	NULL
milking-time	NULL
--	NULL
half-past	NULL
four	NULL
o'clock	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
dairymen	NULL
set	NULL
about	NULL
getting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cows	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
red	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
herd	NULL
nearest	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
phlegmatically	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
call	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
trooped	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
steading	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
background	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
great	NULL
bags	NULL
of	NULL
milk	NULL
swinging	NULL
under	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
followed	NULL
slowly	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
rear	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
barton	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
gate	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
entered	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Long	NULL
thatched	NULL
sheds	NULL
stretched	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
enclosure	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
slopes	NULL
encrusted	NULL
with	NULL
vivid	NULL
green	NULL
moss	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
eaves	NULL
supported	NULL
by	NULL
wooden	NULL
posts	NULL
rubbed	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
glossy	NULL
smoothness	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
flanks	NULL
of	NULL
infinite	NULL
cows	NULL
and	NULL
calves	NULL
of	NULL
bygone	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
passed	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
oblivion	NULL
almost	NULL
inconceivable	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
profundity	NULL
.	NULL

Between	NULL
the	NULL
post	NULL
were	NULL
ranged	NULL
the	NULL
milchers	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
exhibiting	NULL
herself	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
moment	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
whimsical	NULL
eye	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rear	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
circle	NULL
on	NULL
two	NULL

down	NULL
the	NULL
centre	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL

moved	NULL
pendulum-wise	NULL
;	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL

lowering	NULL
itself	NULL
behind	NULL
this	NULL
patient	NULL
row	NULL
,	NULL
threw	NULL
their	NULL
shadows	NULL
accurately	NULL
inwards	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL

Thus	NULL
it	NULL
threw	NULL
shadows	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL

homely	NULL
figures	NULL
every	NULL
evening	NULL
with	NULL

They	NULL

Those	NULL
that	NULL

The	NULL

though	NULL
William	NULL
runned	NULL
his	NULL

had	NULL
n't	NULL
MUCH	NULL
drink	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
(	NULL
considering	NULL
't	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

he	NULL

'd	NULL
never	NULL
reach	NULL
the	NULL

over	NULL
in	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
himself	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
last	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
pulled	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
fiddle	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
runned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
struck	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
jig	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bull	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
backing	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bull	NULL
softened	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
hard	NULL
at	NULL
William	NULL
Dewy	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
fiddled	NULL
on	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
;	NULL
till	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
stole	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
bull	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
no	NULL
sooner	NULL
did	NULL
William	NULL
stop	NULL
his	NULL
playing	NULL
and	NULL
turn	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
over	NULL
hedge	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
bull	NULL
would	NULL
stop	NULL
his	NULL
smiling	NULL
and	NULL
lower	NULL
his	NULL
horns	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
seat	NULL
of	NULL
William	NULL
's	NULL
breeches	NULL
.	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
William	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
about	NULL
and	NULL
play	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
willy-nilly	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
't	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
three	NULL
o'clock	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
'	NULL
a	NULL
knowed	NULL
that	NULL
nobody	NULL

come	NULL

way	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
so	NULL
leery	NULL
and	NULL
tired	NULL
that	NULL
'	NULL
a	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
scraped	NULL
till	NULL
about	NULL
four	NULL
o'clock	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
verily	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
over	NULL
soon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
'	NULL

Well	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
called	NULL
to	NULL
mind	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
'd	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
Christmas	NULL

then	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
to	NULL
play	NULL
a	NULL
trick	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
bull	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
broke	NULL
into	NULL

down	NULL

William	NULL
turned	NULL

clinked	NULL
off	NULL

jumped	NULL
safe	NULL
over	NULL

William	NULL
used	NULL

The	NULL
remark	NULL

singular	NULL
for	NULL

was	NULL
murmured	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL

as	NULL
nobody	NULL
understood	NULL
the	NULL

no	NULL

that	NULL

the	NULL

Tess	NULL
's	NULL
attention	NULL

thus	NULL
attracted	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL

the	NULL

persistently	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

he	NULL
remained	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL

long	NULL
enough	NULL

milked	NULL

uttering	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL

"	NULL

Tess	NULL
could	NULL
then	NULL
see	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
full	NULL
length	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wore	NULL
the	NULL
ordinary	NULL
white	NULL
pinner	NULL
and	NULL
leather	NULL
leggings	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
dairy-farmer	NULL
when	NULL
milking	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
boots	NULL
were	NULL
clogged	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
mulch	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
yard	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
local	NULL
livery	NULL
.	NULL

Beneath	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
something	NULL
educated	NULL
,	NULL
reserved	NULL
,	NULL
subtle	NULL
,	NULL
sad	NULL
,	NULL
differing	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
details	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
aspect	NULL
were	NULL
temporarily	NULL
thrust	NULL
aside	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
discovery	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
vicissitudes	NULL
had	NULL
Tess	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
since	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
remember	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
met	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
flashed	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
pedestrian	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
joined	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
club-dance	NULL
at	NULL
Marlott	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
passing	NULL
stranger	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
not	NULL
whence	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
danced	NULL
with	NULL
others	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
slightingly	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
gone	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
flood	NULL
of	NULL
memories	NULL
brought	NULL
back	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
revival	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
incident	NULL
anterior	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
troubles	NULL
produced	NULL
a	NULL
momentary	NULL
dismay	NULL
lest	NULL
,	NULL
recognizing	NULL
her	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
means	NULL
discover	NULL
her	NULL
story	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
passed	NULL
away	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
no	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
remembrance	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
by	NULL
degrees	NULL
that	NULL
since	NULL
their	NULL
first	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
encounter	NULL
his	NULL
mobile	NULL
face	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
more	NULL
thoughtful	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
acquired	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
shapely	NULL
moustache	NULL
and	NULL
beard	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
palest	NULL
straw	NULL
colour	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
began	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
cheeks	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
deepening	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
warm	NULL
brown	NULL
farther	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
root	NULL
.	NULL

Under	NULL
his	NULL
linen	NULL
milking-pinner	NULL
he	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
velveteen	NULL
jacket	NULL
,	NULL
cord	NULL
breeches	NULL
and	NULL
gaiters	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
starched	NULL
white	NULL
shirt	NULL
.	NULL

Without	NULL
the	NULL
milking-gear	NULL
nobody	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
guessed	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
might	NULL
with	NULL
equal	NULL
probability	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
an	NULL
eccentric	NULL
landowner	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
gentlemanly	NULL
ploughman	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
novice	NULL
at	NULL
dairy	NULL
work	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
realized	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
milking	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
cow	NULL
.	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
milkmaids	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
newcomer	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
How	NULL
pretty	NULL
she	NULL
is	NULL

with	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
real	NULL
generosity	NULL
and	NULL
admiration	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
auditors	NULL
would	NULL
qualify	NULL
the	NULL
assertion	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
strictly	NULL
speaking	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL

prettiness	NULL
being	NULL
an	NULL
inexact	NULL
definition	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
struck	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
in	NULL
Tess	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
milking	NULL
was	NULL
finished	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
they	NULL
straggled	NULL
indoors	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Crick	NULL

the	NULL
dairyman	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
--	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
respectable	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
milking	NULL
herself	NULL

and	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
hot	NULL
stuff	NULL
gown	NULL
in	NULL
warm	NULL
weather	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL

wore	NULL
prints	NULL
--	NULL
was	NULL
giving	NULL
an	NULL
eye	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

Only	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
maids	NULL

Tess	NULL

slept	NULL
in	NULL

besides	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
helpers	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
homes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
nothing	NULL
at	NULL
supper-time	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
superior	NULL
milker	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
commented	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL

and	NULL
asked	NULL
no	NULL
questions	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL

the	NULL
remainder	NULL

the	NULL
evening	NULL
being	NULL
occupied	NULL
in	NULL
arranging	NULL
her	NULL

in	NULL

bed-chamber	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL

some	NULL
thirty	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL

were	NULL

young	NULL
women	NULL

and	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
rather	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
bedtime	NULL
Tess	NULL
was	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
tired	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fell	NULL
asleep	NULL
immediately	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL

who	NULL
occupied	NULL
an	NULL
adjoining	NULL
bed	NULL

was	NULL
more	NULL

it	NULL

his	NULL
retreat	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
Clare	NULL
had	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
space	NULL

and	NULL
could	NULL
often	NULL
be	NULL
heard	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
dairy-folk	NULL
pacing	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
household	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL

rest	NULL

A	NULL
portion	NULL
was	NULL
divided	NULL
off	NULL
at	NULL

a	NULL
curtain	NULL

behind	NULL

was	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL

the	NULL
outer	NULL
part	NULL
being	NULL
furnished	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
homely	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
lived	NULL
up	NULL
above	NULL
entirely	NULL
,	NULL
reading	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
deal	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
strumming	NULL
upon	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
harp	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
bought	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
sale	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
when	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
bitter	NULL
humour	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
his	NULL
living	NULL
by	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
some	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
soon	NULL
preferred	NULL
to	NULL
read	NULL
human	NULL

by	NULL
taking	NULL
his	NULL
meals	NULL
downstairs	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
dairyman	NULL

his	NULL
wife	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
maids	NULL
and	NULL
men	NULL

who	NULL
all	NULL
together	NULL
formed	NULL

The	NULL

he	NULL
to	NULL

the	NULL

did	NULL
he	NULL
like	NULL

share	NULL

Much	NULL
to	NULL

with	NULL

the	NULL

Unexpectedly	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL

life	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL

apart	NULL

Considering	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
wonderfully	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
chronic	NULL
melancholy	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
taking	NULL

the	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL
read	NULL

inclined	NULL
him	NULL

without	NULL
any	NULL

cramming	NULL

since	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
farming	NULL
handbooks	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
deemed	NULL
it	NULL
desirable	NULL
to	NULL
master	NULL
occupied	NULL
him	NULL

little	NULL
time	NULL

He	NULL
grew	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
old	NULL
associations	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
something	NULL
new	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
and	NULL
humanity	NULL
.	NULL

Secondarily	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
made	NULL
close	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
with	NULL
phenomena	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
before	NULL
known	NULL

darkly	NULL

the	NULL

Between	NULL
Clare	NULL

Clare	NULL

hardly	NULL
noticed	NULL
that	NULL

She	NULL
talked	NULL
so	NULL

the	NULL

talked	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL

that	NULL
the	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL
strike	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
possessing	NULL
a	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL
ever	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

One	NULL
day	NULL

hearing	NULL

lapsed	NULL
into	NULL
listlessness	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
music-sheet	NULL
rolled	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hearth	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
of	NULL
logs	NULL

with	NULL
its	NULL
one	NULL
flame	NULL
pirouetting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dying	NULL
dance	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
breakfast-cooking	NULL

boiling	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
jig	NULL

his	NULL
inward	NULL
tune	NULL

also	NULL
at	NULL

dangling	NULL
down	NULL

also	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
half-empty	NULL

The	NULL
conversation	NULL
at	NULL

mixed	NULL
in	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
phantasmal	NULL

he	NULL
thought	NULL

seated	NULL

was	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
circumstance	NULL
was	NULL

lead	NULL
him	NULL

select	NULL

In	NULL

the	NULL

were	NULL
milked	NULL

they	NULL
presented	NULL
themselves	NULL

without	NULL

But	NULL
certain	NULL
cows	NULL
will	NULL
show	NULL
a	NULL
fondness	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
particular	NULL
pair	NULL
of	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
sometimes	NULL
carrying	NULL
this	NULL
predilection	NULL

refuse	NULL

favourite	NULL

the	NULL

of	NULL
a	NULL

unceremoniously	NULL
kicked	NULL
over	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Dairyman	NULL

insist	NULL
on	NULL
breaking	NULL
down	NULL
these	NULL
partialities	NULL
and	NULL
aversions	NULL
by	NULL

since	NULL
otherwise	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
event	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
milkman	NULL
or	NULL
maid	NULL
going	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
dairy	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
placed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
difficulty	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
maids	NULL
'	NULL
private	NULL
aims	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
reverse	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dairyman	NULL
's	NULL
rule	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
daily	NULL
selection	NULL
by	NULL
each	NULL
damsel	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
eight	NULL
or	NULL
ten	NULL
cows	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL

rendering	NULL
the	NULL
operation	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
willing	NULL
udders	NULL
surprisingly	NULL
easy	NULL
and	NULL
effortless	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
her	NULL
compeers	NULL
,	NULL
soon	NULL
discovered	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cows	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
preference	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
style	NULL
of	NULL
manipulation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
fingers	NULL
having	NULL
become	NULL
delicate	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
domiciliary	NULL
imprisonments	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
subjected	NULL
herself	NULL
at	NULL
intervals	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
the	NULL
milchers	NULL
'	NULL
views	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
respect	NULL
.	NULL

Out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
ninety-five	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
eight	NULL
in	NULL
particular	NULL

Dumpling	NULL

Young	NULL
Pretty	NULL

Tidy	NULL

and	NULL
Loud	NULL
--	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
teats	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
hard	NULL
as	NULL
carrots	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
readiness	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
work	NULL
on	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fingers	NULL
.	NULL

Knowing	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
dairyman	NULL
's	NULL
wish	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
endeavoured	NULL
conscientiously	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
the	NULL
animals	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
excepting	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
hard	NULL
yielders	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
manage	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
soon	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
curious	NULL
correspondence	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
ostensibly	NULL
chance	NULL
position	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cows	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
wishes	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
order	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
of	NULL
accident	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dairyman	NULL
's	NULL
pupil	NULL
had	NULL
lent	NULL
a	NULL
hand	NULL
in	NULL
getting	NULL
the	NULL
cows	NULL
together	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
fifth	NULL
or	NULL
sixth	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
rested	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
cow	NULL
,	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
sly	NULL
inquiry	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mr	NULL
Clare	NULL
,	NULL
you	NULL
have	NULL
ranged	NULL
the	NULL
cows	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
blushing	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
making	NULL
the	NULL
accusation	NULL
,	NULL
symptoms	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
gently	NULL
lifted	NULL
her	NULL
upper	NULL
lip	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
the	NULL
tips	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
teeth	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
lip	NULL
remaining	NULL
severely	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
makes	NULL
no	NULL
difference	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
will	NULL
always	NULL
be	NULL
here	NULL
to	NULL
milk	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
you	NULL
think	NULL
so	NULL
?	NULL

I	NULL
HOPE	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
!	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
KNOW	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
herself	NULL
afterwards	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
unaware	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
grave	NULL
reasons	NULL
for	NULL
liking	NULL
this	NULL
seclusion	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
mistaken	NULL
her	NULL
meaning	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
so	NULL
earnestly	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
his	NULL
presence	NULL
were	NULL
somehow	NULL
a	NULL
factor	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
wish	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
misgiving	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
dusk	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
milking	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
alone	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
continue	NULL
her	NULL
regrets	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
disclosed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
her	NULL
discovery	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
considerateness	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
typical	NULL
summer	NULL
evening	NULL
in	NULL
June	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
being	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
delicate	NULL
equilibrium	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
transmissive	NULL
that	NULL
inanimate	NULL
objects	NULL
seemed	NULL
endowed	NULL
with	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
senses	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
five	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
distinction	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
near	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
auditor	NULL
felt	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
everything	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
horizon	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
soundlessness	NULL
impressed	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
positive	NULL
entity	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
mere	NULL
negation	NULL
of	NULL
noise	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
broken	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
strumming	NULL
of	NULL
strings	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
those	NULL
notes	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
attic	NULL
above	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

Dim	NULL
,	NULL
flattened	NULL
,	NULL
constrained	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
confinement	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
appealed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
wandered	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
still	NULL
air	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
stark	NULL
quality	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
nudity	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
speak	NULL
absolutely	NULL
,	NULL
both	NULL
instrument	NULL
and	NULL
execution	NULL
were	NULL
poor	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
relative	NULL
is	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
listened	NULL
Tess	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
fascinated	NULL
bird	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
.	NULL

Far	NULL
from	NULL
leaving	NULL
she	NULL
drew	NULL
up	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
performer	NULL
,	NULL
keeping	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
hedge	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
guess	NULL
her	NULL
presence	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
outskirt	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Tess	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
left	NULL
uncultivated	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
damp	NULL
and	NULL
rank	NULL
with	NULL
juicy	NULL
grass	NULL
which	NULL
sent	NULL
up	NULL
mists	NULL
of	NULL
pollen	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
tall	NULL
blooming	NULL
weeds	NULL
emitting	NULL
offensive	NULL
smells	NULL
--	NULL
weeds	NULL
whose	NULL
red	NULL
and	NULL
yellow	NULL
and	NULL
purple	NULL
hues	NULL
formed	NULL
a	NULL
polychrome	NULL
as	NULL
dazzling	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
cultivated	NULL
flowers	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
stealthily	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
cat	NULL
through	NULL
this	NULL
profusion	NULL
of	NULL
growth	NULL
,	NULL
gathering	NULL
cuckoo-spittle	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
skirts	NULL
,	NULL
cracking	NULL
snails	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
underfoot	NULL
,	NULL
staining	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
thistle-milk	NULL
and	NULL
slug-slime	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rubbing	NULL
off	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
naked	NULL
arms	NULL
sticky	NULL
blights	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
snow-white	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
apple-tree	NULL
trunks	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
madder	NULL
stains	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
skin	NULL
;	NULL
thus	NULL
she	NULL
drew	NULL
quite	NULL
near	NULL
to	NULL
Clare	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
unobserved	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
neither	NULL
time	NULL
nor	NULL
space	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
exaltation	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
described	NULL
as	NULL
being	NULL
producible	NULL
at	NULL
will	NULL
by	NULL
gazing	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
star	NULL
came	NULL
now	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
determination	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
undulated	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
thin	NULL
notes	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
second-hand	NULL
harp	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
harmonies	NULL
passed	NULL
like	NULL
breezes	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
bringing	NULL
tears	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
floating	NULL
pollen	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
notes	NULL
made	NULL
visible	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
dampness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
the	NULL
weeping	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
's	NULL
sensibility	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
near	NULL
nightfall	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
rank-smelling	NULL
weed-flowers	NULL
glowed	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
close	NULL
for	NULL
intentness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
waves	NULL
of	NULL
colour	NULL
mixed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
waves	NULL
of	NULL
sound	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
light	NULL
which	NULL
still	NULL
shone	NULL
was	NULL
derived	NULL
mainly	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
hole	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
western	NULL
bank	NULL
of	NULL
cloud	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
day	NULL
left	NULL
behind	NULL
by	NULL
accident	NULL
,	NULL
dusk	NULL
having	NULL
closed	NULL
in	NULL
elsewhere	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
concluded	NULL
his	NULL
plaintive	NULL
melody	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
simple	NULL
performance	NULL
,	NULL
demanding	NULL
no	NULL
great	NULL
skill	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
waited	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
another	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
begun	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
tired	NULL
of	NULL
playing	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
desultorily	NULL
come	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
fence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
rambling	NULL
up	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
on	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
moved	NULL
away	NULL
furtively	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
hardly	NULL
moving	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Angel	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
light	NULL
summer	NULL
gown	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
low	NULL
tones	NULL
reaching	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
some	NULL
distance	NULL
off	NULL

After	NULL
hearing	NULL
this	NULL
caricature	NULL
of	NULL
Clare	NULL
's	NULL
opinion	NULL
poor	NULL
Tess	NULL
was	NULL
glad	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
said	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
weak	NULL
moment	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
family	NULL
--	NULL
even	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
unusually	NULL
old	NULL
almost	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
circle	NULL
and	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

Besides	NULL
,	NULL
another	NULL
diary-girl	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
good	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
respect	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
held	NULL
her	NULL
tongue	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
vault	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
Knight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Conqueror	NULL
whose	NULL
name	NULL
she	NULL
bore	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
insight	NULL
afforded	NULL
into	NULL
Clare	NULL
's	NULL
character	NULL
suggested	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
largely	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
supposed	NULL
untraditional	NULL
newness	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
won	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL

XX	NULL
The	NULL
season	NULL
developed	NULL
and	NULL
matured	NULL
.	NULL

Another	NULL
year	NULL
's	NULL
instalment	NULL
of	NULL
flowers	NULL
,	NULL
leaves	NULL
,	NULL
nightingales	NULL
,	NULL
thrushes	NULL
,	NULL
finches	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
such	NULL
ephemeral	NULL
creatures	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL
their	NULL
positions	NULL
where	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
ago	NULL
others	NULL
had	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
place	NULL
when	NULL
these	NULL
were	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
germs	NULL
and	NULL
inorganic	NULL
particles	NULL
.	NULL

Rays	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
sunrise	NULL
drew	NULL
forth	NULL
the	NULL
buds	NULL
and	NULL
stretched	NULL
them	NULL
into	NULL
long	NULL
stalks	NULL
,	NULL
lifted	NULL
up	NULL
sap	NULL
in	NULL
noiseless	NULL
streams	NULL
,	NULL
opened	NULL
petals	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sucked	NULL
out	NULL
scents	NULL
in	NULL
invisible	NULL
jets	NULL
and	NULL
breathings	NULL
.	NULL

Dairyman	NULL
Crick	NULL
's	NULL
household	NULL
of	NULL
maids	NULL
and	NULL
men	NULL
lived	NULL
on	NULL
comfortably	NULL
,	NULL
placidly	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
merrily	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
position	NULL
was	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
happiest	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
positions	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
social	NULL
scale	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
line	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
neediness	NULL
ends	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
below	NULL
the	NULL
line	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
convenances	NULL
_	NULL
begin	NULL
to	NULL
cramp	NULL
natural	NULL
feelings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
stress	NULL
of	NULL
threadbare	NULL
modishness	NULL
makes	NULL
too	NULL
little	NULL
of	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
leafy	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
arborescence	NULL
seems	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
aimed	NULL
at	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
doors	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
and	NULL
Clare	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
studied	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
ever	NULL
balanced	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
passion	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
apparently	NULL
keeping	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
converging	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
an	NULL
irresistible	NULL
law	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
surely	NULL
as	NULL
two	NULL
streams	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
vale	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
recent	NULL
life	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
happy	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
possibly	NULL
never	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
happy	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
physically	NULL
and	NULL
mentally	NULL
suited	NULL
among	NULL
these	NULL
new	NULL
surroundings	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sapling	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
rooted	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
poisonous	NULL
stratum	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
sowing	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
transplanted	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
deeper	NULL
soil	NULL
.	NULL

Moreover	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Clare	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
debatable	NULL
land	NULL
between	NULL
predilection	NULL
and	NULL
love	NULL
;	NULL
where	NULL
no	NULL
profundities	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
reached	NULL
;	NULL
no	NULL
reflections	NULL
have	NULL
set	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
awkwardly	NULL
inquiring	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Whither	NULL
does	NULL
this	NULL
new	NULL
current	NULL
tend	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
me	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
does	NULL
it	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
my	NULL
future	NULL
?	NULL

How	NULL
does	NULL
it	NULL
stand	NULL
towards	NULL
my	NULL
past	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Tess	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
merest	NULL
stray	NULL
phenomenon	NULL
to	NULL
Angel	NULL
Clare	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
rosy	NULL
,	NULL
warming	NULL
apparition	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
just	NULL
acquired	NULL
the	NULL
attribute	NULL
of	NULL
persistence	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
consciousness	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
allowed	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
deeming	NULL
his	NULL
preoccupation	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
philosopher	NULL
's	NULL
regard	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
novel	NULL
,	NULL
fresh	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
interesting	NULL
specimen	NULL
of	NULL
womankind	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
met	NULL
continually	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
met	NULL
daily	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
strange	NULL
and	NULL
solemn	NULL
interval	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
twilight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
violet	NULL
or	NULL
pink	NULL
dawn	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
rise	NULL
early	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
very	NULL
early	NULL
,	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

Milking	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
betimes	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
milking	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
skimming	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
began	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
past	NULL
three	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
usually	NULL
fell	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
wake	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
being	NULL
aroused	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
alarm-clock	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
Tess	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
latest	NULL
arrival	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
soon	NULL
discovered	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
depended	NULL
upon	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
alarm	NULL
as	NULL
others	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
task	NULL
was	NULL
thrust	NULL
most	NULL
frequently	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
sooner	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
struck	NULL
and	NULL
whizzed	NULL
,	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
room	NULL
and	NULL
ran	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dairyman	NULL
's	NULL
door	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
ladder	NULL
to	NULL
Angel	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
calling	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
loud	NULL
whisper	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
woke	NULL
her	NULL
fellow-milkmaids	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
Tess	NULL
was	NULL
dressed	NULL
Clare	NULL
was	NULL
downstairs	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
humid	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
remaining	NULL
maids	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
dairyman	NULL
usually	NULL
gave	NULL
themselves	NULL
another	NULL
turn	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
pillow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
appear	NULL
till	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
later	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
gray	NULL
half-tones	NULL
of	NULL
daybreak	NULL
are	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
half-tones	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
close	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
degree	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
shade	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
twilight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
light	NULL
seems	NULL
active	NULL
,	NULL
darkness	NULL
passive	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
twilight	NULL
of	NULL
evening	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
active	NULL
and	NULL
crescent	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
drowsy	NULL
reverse	NULL
.	NULL

Being	NULL
so	NULL
often	NULL
--	NULL
possibly	NULL
not	NULL
always	NULL
by	NULL
chance	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
two	NULL
persons	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
dairy-house	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
themselves	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
persons	NULL
up	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
these	NULL
early	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
residence	NULL
here	NULL
Tess	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
skim	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
doors	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
after	NULL
rising	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
generally	NULL
awaiting	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
spectral	NULL
,	NULL
half-compounded	NULL
,	NULL
aqueous	NULL
light	NULL
which	NULL
pervaded	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
mead	NULL
impressed	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
isolation	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
Adam	NULL
and	NULL
Eve	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
this	NULL
dim	NULL
inceptive	NULL
stage	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
Tess	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
Clare	NULL
to	NULL
exhibit	NULL
a	NULL
dignified	NULL
largeness	NULL
both	NULL
of	NULL
disposition	NULL
and	NULL
physique	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
almost	NULL
regnant	NULL
power	NULL
,	NULL
possibly	NULL
because	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
preternatural	NULL
time	NULL
hardly	NULL
any	NULL
woman	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
endowed	NULL
in	NULL
person	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
walking	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
air	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
boundaries	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
horizon	NULL
;	NULL
very	NULL
few	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
England	NULL
.	NULL

Fair	NULL
women	NULL
are	NULL
usually	NULL
asleep	NULL
at	NULL
mid-summer	NULL
dawns	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
close	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
were	NULL
nowhere	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
mixed	NULL
,	NULL
singular	NULL
,	NULL
luminous	NULL
gloom	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
along	NULL
together	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
cows	NULL
lay	NULL
often	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Resurrection	NULL
hour	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
little	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
Magdalen	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

Whilst	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
landscape	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
neutral	NULL
shade	NULL
his	NULL
companion	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
focus	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
rising	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
mist	NULL
stratum	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
phosphorescence	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
ghostly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
merely	NULL
a	NULL
soul	NULL
at	NULL
large	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
reality	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
appearing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
caught	NULL
the	NULL
cold	NULL
gleam	NULL
of	NULL
day	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
north-east	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
wore	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
aspect	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
impressed	NULL
him	NULL
most	NULL
deeply	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
the	NULL
milkmaid	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
visionary	NULL
essence	NULL
of	NULL
woman	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
whole	NULL
sex	NULL
condensed	NULL
into	NULL
one	NULL
typical	NULL
form	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
Artemis	NULL
,	NULL
Demeter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
fanciful	NULL
names	NULL
half	NULL
teasingly	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
like	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
understand	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Call	NULL
me	NULL
Tess	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
say	NULL
askance	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
grow	NULL
lighter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
features	NULL
would	NULL
become	NULL
simply	NULL
feminine	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
changed	NULL
from	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
divinity	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
confer	NULL
bliss	NULL
to	NULL
those	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
being	NULL
who	NULL
craved	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
these	NULL
non-human	NULL
hours	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
get	NULL
quite	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
waterfowl	NULL
.	NULL

Herons	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
bold	NULL
noise	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
opening	NULL
doors	NULL
and	NULL
shutters	NULL
,	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
boughs	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
plantation	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
frequented	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mead	NULL
;	NULL
or	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
already	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
,	NULL
hardily	NULL
maintained	NULL
their	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
walked	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
watching	NULL
them	NULL
by	NULL
moving	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
round	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
slow	NULL
,	NULL
horizontal	NULL
,	NULL
passionless	NULL
wheel	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
turn	NULL
of	NULL
puppets	NULL
by	NULL
clockwork	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
could	NULL
then	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
faint	NULL
summer	NULL
fogs	NULL
in	NULL
layers	NULL
,	NULL
woolly	NULL
,	NULL
level	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
apparently	NULL
no	NULL
thicker	NULL
than	NULL
counterpanes	NULL
,	NULL
spread	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
meadows	NULL
in	NULL
detached	NULL
remnants	NULL
of	NULL
small	NULL
extent	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
moisture	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
were	NULL
marks	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
cows	NULL
had	NULL
lain	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
--	NULL
dark-green	NULL
islands	NULL
of	NULL
dry	NULL
herbage	NULL
the	NULL
size	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
carcasses	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
general	NULL
sea	NULL
of	NULL
dew	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
each	NULL
island	NULL
proceeded	NULL
a	NULL
serpentine	NULL
trail	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
cow	NULL
had	NULL
rambled	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
feed	NULL
after	NULL
getting	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
trail	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
snoring	NULL
puff	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
nostrils	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
recognized	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
an	NULL
intenser	NULL
little	NULL
fog	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
prevailing	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
they	NULL
drove	NULL
the	NULL
animals	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
barton	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
milk	NULL
them	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
might	NULL
require	NULL
.	NULL

Or	NULL
perhaps	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
fog	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
general	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
meadows	NULL
lay	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
sea	NULL
,	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
scattered	NULL
trees	NULL
rose	NULL
like	NULL
dangerous	NULL
rocks	NULL

Birds	NULL
would	NULL
soar	NULL
through	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL

hang	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
wing	NULL

alight	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
wet	NULL
rails	NULL
subdividing	NULL
the	NULL

it	NULL
touched	NULL
the	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL

The	NULL
evening	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
ugly	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
inflamed	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL

Only	NULL
a	NULL
solitary	NULL
cracked-voice	NULL

greeted	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
bushes	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sad	NULL
,	NULL
machine-made	NULL
tone	NULL

resembling	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
past	NULL
friend	NULL
whose	NULL
friendship	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
outworn	NULL

In	NULL
these	NULL
long	NULL
June	NULL
days	NULL
the	NULL
milkmaids	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
at	NULL
sunset	NULL

sooner	NULL

the	NULL
morning	NULL
work	NULL
before	NULL
milking	NULL
being	NULL
so	NULL
early	NULL
and	NULL
heavy	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
full	NULL
pails	NULL

Tess	NULL
usually	NULL
accompanied	NULL
her	NULL
fellows	NULL
upstairs	NULL
.	NULL

To-night	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
common	NULL
chamber	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
dozed	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
girls	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
them	NULL
undressing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
orange	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vanished	NULL
sun	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
flushed	NULL
their	NULL
forms	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
colour	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
dozed	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
reawakened	NULL
by	NULL
their	NULL
voices	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
quietly	NULL
turned	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
towards	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
three	NULL
chamber-companions	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
bed	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
group	NULL

in	NULL
their	NULL
nightgowns	NULL

their	NULL

the	NULL

around	NULL
them	NULL

All	NULL
were	NULL
watching	NULL
somebody	NULL

the	NULL

with	NULL
deep	NULL

their	NULL
three	NULL

Somebody	NULL

Tears	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
Retty	NULL
Priddle	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
pretty	NULL
red-haired	NULL
youngest	NULL

the	NULL
last	NULL
bud	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Paridelles	NULL

so	NULL
important	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
county	NULL

They	NULL
watched	NULL
silently	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
longer	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
three	NULL
faces	NULL
still	NULL
close	NULL
together	NULL
as	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
triple	NULL
hues	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
hair	NULL
mingling	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
unconscious	NULL
Mr	NULL
Clare	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
indoors	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
shades	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
deepen	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
crept	NULL
into	NULL
their	NULL
beds	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
they	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
ascend	NULL
the	NULL
ladder	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

Marian	NULL
was	NULL
soon	NULL
snoring	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Izz	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
drop	NULL
into	NULL
forgetfulness	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Retty	NULL
Priddle	NULL
cried	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
deeper-passioned	NULL
Tess	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
sleeping	NULL
even	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
conversation	NULL
was	NULL
another	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bitter	NULL
pills	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
swallow	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Scarce	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
jealousy	NULL
arose	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
breast	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
that	NULL
matter	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
the	NULL
preference	NULL
.	NULL

Being	NULL
more	NULL
finely	NULL
formed	NULL

better	NULL
educated	NULL

,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
youngest	NULL
except	NULL
Retty	NULL

more	NULL
woman	NULL
than	NULL
either	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
perceived	NULL
that	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL

Angel	NULL
Clare	NULL
's	NULL
heart	NULL
against	NULL
these	NULL
her	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
grave	NULL
question	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
ought	NULL
she	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
?	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
,	NULL
hardly	NULL
a	NULL
ghost	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
for	NULL
either	NULL

them	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
serious	NULL
sense	NULL
;	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
inspiring	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
passing	NULL
fancy	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
enjoying	NULL
the	NULL
pleasure	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
attentions	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
stayed	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
unequal	NULL
attachments	NULL
had	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
marriage	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
from	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Crick	NULL
that	NULL
Mr	NULL
Clare	NULL
had	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
asked	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
laughing	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
marrying	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
lady	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
while	NULL
ten	NULL
thousand	NULL
acres	NULL
of	NULL
Colonial	NULL
pasture	NULL
to	NULL
feed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cattle	NULL
to	NULL
rear	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
corn	NULL
to	NULL
reap	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
farm-woman	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
sensible	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
wife	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
whether	NULL
Mr	NULL
Clare	NULL
had	NULL
spoken	NULL
seriously	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
should	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
conscientiously	NULL
allow	NULL
any	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
her	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
religiously	NULL
determined	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
never	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
tempted	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
draw	NULL
off	NULL
Mr	NULL
Clare	NULL
's	NULL
attention	NULL
from	NULL
other	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
brief	NULL
happiness	NULL
of	NULL
sunning	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
remained	NULL
at	NULL
Talbothays	NULL

They	NULL
came	NULL
downstairs	NULL
yawning	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
skimming	NULL

milking	NULL
were	NULL
proceeded	NULL
with	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL

and	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
indoors	NULL
to	NULL
breakfast	NULL

Dairyman	NULL
Crick	NULL
was	NULL
discovered	NULL
stamping	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
received	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
customer	NULL
had	NULL
complained	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
butter	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
twang	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
begad	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
'	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL
dairyman	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
held	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
left	NULL
hand	NULL
a	NULL
wooden	NULL
slice	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
lump	NULL
of	NULL
butter	NULL
was	NULL
stuck	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL

Several	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
gathered	NULL
round	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Mr	NULL
Clare	NULL
tasted	NULL
,	NULL
Tess	NULL
tasted	NULL
,	NULL
also	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
indoor	NULL
milkmaids	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL

two	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
milking-men	NULL

and	NULL
last	NULL

all	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Crick	NULL

who	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
waiting	NULL
breakfast-table	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
certainly	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
twang	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dairyman	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
thrown	NULL
himself	NULL
into	NULL
abstraction	NULL
to	NULL
better	NULL
realize	NULL
the	NULL
taste	NULL

so	NULL
divine	NULL
the	NULL
particular	NULL
species	NULL
of	NULL
noxious	NULL
weed	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
appertained	NULL

suddenly	NULL
exclaimed	NULL

"	NULL

thought	NULL

Then	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL

hands	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL

into	NULL

in	NULL
years	NULL
gone	NULL
by	NULL

spoilt	NULL
the	NULL
butter	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL
dairyman	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
recognized	NULL
the	NULL

and	NULL
thought	NULL

they	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
together	NULL

The	NULL

crept	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
unawares	NULL

over	NULL

grass	NULL

fed	NULL

dressing	NULL
themselves	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL

afternoon	NULL

night	NULL
heavy	NULL

hissed	NULL
down	NULL

meads	NULL

washed	NULL
some	NULL

this	NULL
morning	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
shone	NULL
out	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL

for	NULL
the	NULL
deluge	NULL

the	NULL
air	NULL

leading	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL

ran	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL

its	NULL
length	NULL

and	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL

spot	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL

flood	NULL

On	NULL
his	NULL
walk	NULL
he	NULL
observed	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
distance	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
occupied	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
difficulties	NULL
of	NULL
passage	NULL
as	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
notice	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
spot	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
quite	NULL
check	NULL
their	NULL
progress	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
hastened	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
dim	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
help	NULL
them	NULL
--	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
particular	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rosy-cheeked	NULL
,	NULL
bright-eyed	NULL
quartet	NULL
looked	NULL
so	NULL
charming	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
light	NULL
summer	NULL
attire	NULL
,	NULL
clinging	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
roadside	NULL
bank	NULL
like	NULL
pigeons	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
roof-slope	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
stopped	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
to	NULL
regard	NULL
them	NULL
before	NULL
coming	NULL
close	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
gauzy	NULL
skirts	NULL
had	NULL
brushed	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
innumerable	NULL
flies	NULL
and	NULL
butterflies	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
escape	NULL
,	NULL
remained	NULL
caged	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
transparent	NULL
tissue	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
aviary	NULL
.	NULL

Angel	NULL
's	NULL
eye	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
Tess	NULL

the	NULL
hindmost	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL

being	NULL
full	NULL

laughter	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
dilemma	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
meeting	NULL
his	NULL
glance	NULL
radiantly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
beneath	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
rise	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
long	NULL
boots	NULL

and	NULL
stood	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
entrapped	NULL
flies	NULL
and	NULL
butterflies	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
Marian	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL

including	NULL
the	NULL

Marian	NULL

lowered	NULL
herself	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL

shoulder	NULL
as	NULL
directed	NULL

Angel	NULL
strode	NULL
off	NULL

her	NULL

Angel	NULL
Clare	NULL

to	NULL

three-quarters	NULL

She	NULL
quietly	NULL

lowered	NULL

into	NULL

Angel	NULL
methodically	NULL
marched	NULL
off	NULL

the	NULL

Retty	NULL
's	NULL

while	NULL

was	NULL
seizing	NULL

an	NULL

the	NULL

Marian	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
sack	NULL

a	NULL
dead	NULL

ridden	NULL
sensibly	NULL

Retty	NULL

a	NULL

hysterics	NULL

However	NULL

he	NULL
got	NULL
through	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
disquieted	NULL
creature	NULL

deposited	NULL
her	NULL

the	NULL

It	NULL

That	NULL

what	NULL

Clare	NULL
stood	NULL

inclinced	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
towards	NULL
hers	NULL

"	NULL
O	NULL

he	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girl	NULL
's	NULL
cheeks	NULL
burned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
breeze	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
look	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
emotion	NULL

It	NULL
reminded	NULL
Angel	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
somewhat	NULL
unfairly	NULL
taking	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
accidental	NULL
position	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL

No	NULL

words	NULL

had	NULL
crossed	NULL
their	NULL
lips	NULL
as	NULL

,	NULL
and	NULL
suspension	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
point	NULL
was	NULL
desirable	NULL

However	NULL

he	NULL
walked	NULL
slowly	NULL

to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
remainder	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL

at	NULL

they	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bend	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
progress	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
full	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
three	NULL

The	NULL
dry	NULL
land	NULL
was	NULL
reached	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
set	NULL
her	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
friends	NULL
were	NULL
looking	NULL
with	NULL
round	NULL
thoughtful	NULL
eyes	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL

been	NULL
talking	NULL

He	NULL
hastily	NULL
bade	NULL
them	NULL
farewell	NULL

splashed	NULL
back	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
stretch	NULL

road	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
four	NULL
moved	NULL
on	NULL
together	NULL
as	NULL

Marian	NULL
broke	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL

looked	NULL
joylessly	NULL
at	NULL
Tess	NULL

out	NULL

vanished	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL

all	NULL

from	NULL

There	NULL

The	NULL

palpitate	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL

it	NULL

there	NULL

the	NULL

themselves	NULL

Thus	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL
spring	NULL

early	NULL

while	NULL
butter-making	NULL

still	NULL
more	NULL
butter-keeping	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL
despair	NULL

They	NULL
milked	NULL
entirely	NULL

During	NULL

On	NULL
one	NULL

these	NULL
afternoons	NULL
four	NULL

five	NULL
unmilked	NULL

chanced	NULL

stand	NULL

rose	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
stool	NULL
under	NULL
a	NULL

cow	NULL

Angel	NULL
Clare	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
observing	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL

asked	NULL
her	NULL
if	NULL

take	NULL
the	NULL
aforesaid	NULL

She	NULL
silently	NULL
assented	NULL

with	NULL
her	NULL
stool	NULL
at	NULL
arm	NULL
's	NULL
length	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
pail	NULL
against	NULL
her	NULL
knee	NULL

went	NULL
round	NULL
to	NULL
where	NULL

stood	NULL

Soon	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
Old	NULL
Pretty	NULL
's	NULL
milk	NULL
fizzing	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
pail	NULL
came	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
hedge	NULL

and	NULL
then	NULL
Angel	NULL
felt	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
finish	NULL
off	NULL
a	NULL
hard-yielding	NULL
milcher	NULL
who	NULL

strayed	NULL
there	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL

some	NULL

the	NULL
women	NULL

when	NULL
milking	NULL

dug	NULL
their	NULL
foreheads	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL

gazed	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL

But	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
--	NULL

the	NULL

rested	NULL
their	NULL

sideways	NULL

This	NULL

her	NULL

pressing	NULL
the	NULL

her	NULL

fixed	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

one	NULL
lost	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
milking	NULL
Old	NULL

thus	NULL

the	NULL
sun	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL

it	NULL
shone	NULL

her	NULL

and	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL

rendering	NULL
it	NULL
keen	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL

cut	NULL

the	NULL

She	NULL

her	NULL
round	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL

The	NULL

if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
obeying	NULL
a	NULL
reflex	NULL
stimulus	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
beating	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
very	NULL
lovable	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
ethereal	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
all	NULL
was	NULL
real	NULL
vitality	NULL
,	NULL
real	NULL
warmth	NULL
,	NULL
real	NULL
incarnation	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
culminated	NULL
.	NULL

Eyes	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
deep	NULL
and	NULL
speaking	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
cheeks	NULL
perhaps	NULL
as	NULL
fair	NULL
;	NULL
brows	NULL
as	NULL
arched	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
chin	NULL
and	NULL
throat	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
shapely	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
equal	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
a	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
fire	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
little	NULL
upward	NULL
lift	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
red	NULL
top	NULL
lip	NULL
was	NULL
distracting	NULL
,	NULL
infatuating	NULL
,	NULL
maddening	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
before	NULL
seen	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
lips	NULL
and	NULL
teeth	NULL
which	NULL
forced	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
persistent	NULL
iteration	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
Elizabethan	NULL
simile	NULL
of	NULL
roses	NULL
filled	NULL
with	NULL
snow	NULL
.	NULL

Perfect	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
lover	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
called	NULL
them	NULL
off-hand	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
no	NULL
--	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
perfect	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
imperfect	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
would-be	NULL
perfect	NULL
that	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
sweetness	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
which	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
humanity	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
had	NULL
studied	NULL
the	NULL
curves	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
lips	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
times	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
reproduce	NULL
them	NULL
mentally	NULL
with	NULL
ease	NULL
:	NULL
and	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
again	NULL
confronted	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
clothed	NULL
with	NULL
colour	NULL
and	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
sent	NULL
an	NULL
_	NULL
aura	NULL
_	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
flesh	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
breeze	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
nerves	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
well	NULL
nigh	NULL
produced	NULL
a	NULL
qualm	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
actually	NULL
produced	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
mysterious	NULL
physiological	NULL
process	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
prosaic	NULL
sneeze	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
then	NULL
became	NULL
conscious	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
observing	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
show	NULL
it	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
curious	NULL
dream-like	NULL
fixity	NULL
disappeared	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
close	NULL
eye	NULL
might	NULL
easily	NULL
have	NULL
discerned	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
rosiness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
deepened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
faded	NULL
till	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
tinge	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
left	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
influence	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
into	NULL
Clare	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
excitation	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
die	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

Resolutions	NULL
,	NULL
reticences	NULL
,	NULL
prudences	NULL
,	NULL
fears	NULL
,	NULL
fell	NULL
back	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
defeated	NULL
battalion	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
jumped	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
seat	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
his	NULL
pail	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
kicked	NULL
over	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
milcher	NULL
had	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
quickly	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
desire	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
kneeling	NULL
down	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
clasped	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
was	NULL
taken	NULL
completely	NULL
by	NULL
surprise	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
yielded	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
embrace	NULL
with	NULL
unreflecting	NULL
inevitableness	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
seen	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
her	NULL
lover	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
advanced	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
one	NULL

her	NULL
lips	NULL
parted	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
sank	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
momentary	NULL
joy	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
something	NULL
very	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
ecstatic	NULL
cry	NULL

had	NULL
been	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL

find	NULL
how	NULL
great	NULL

Many	NULL
besides	NULL

the	NULL
magnitude	NULL

not	NULL
as	NULL

it	NULL

The	NULL

only	NULL
came	NULL

for	NULL
Tess	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
particular	NULL
day	NULL

the	NULL
particular	NULL
year	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL

was	NULL
born	NULL

This	NULL
consciousness	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
intruded	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
single	NULL
opportunity	NULL
of	NULL
existence	NULL

vouchsafed	NULL

Tess	NULL

First	NULL

How	NULL
then	NULL
should	NULL
he	NULL
look	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
less	NULL
consequence	NULL

himself	NULL

as	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
trifle	NULL

grow	NULL

not	NULL
deal	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
seriousness	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
affection	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
awakened	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL

--	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL

her	NULL

To	NULL
encounter	NULL
her	NULL
daily	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
accustomed	NULL
manner	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
to	NULL
develop	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
.	NULL

Living	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
close	NULL
relations	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
meet	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
fall	NULL
into	NULL
endearment	NULL
;	NULL
flesh	NULL

blood	NULL
could	NULL

resist	NULL
it	NULL

arrived	NULL
at	NULL
no	NULL
conclusion	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL
issue	NULL

such	NULL
a	NULL
tendency	NULL

he	NULL
decided	NULL

hold	NULL
aloof	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
from	NULL
occupations	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
mutually	NULL
engaged	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
yet	NULL
the	NULL
harm	NULL
done	NULL
was	NULL
small	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
carry	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
resolution	NULL
never	NULL
to	NULL
approach	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
driven	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
every	NULL
heave	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
pulse	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
his	NULL
friends	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
sound	NULL
them	NULL
upon	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
five	NULL
months	NULL
his	NULL
term	NULL
here	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
ended	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
additional	NULL
months	NULL
spent	NULL
upon	NULL
other	NULL
farms	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
fully	NULL
equipped	NULL
in	NULL
agricultural	NULL
knowledge	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
position	NULL
to	NULL
start	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
account	NULL

Would	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
farmer	NULL
want	NULL
a	NULL
wife	NULL

and	NULL
should	NULL
a	NULL
farmer	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
wax-figure	NULL

or	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
understood	NULL
farming	NULL
?	NULL

Notwithstanding	NULL
the	NULL
pleasing	NULL
answer	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL

he	NULL
resolved	NULL

go	NULL
his	NULL
journey	NULL

One	NULL
morning	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
sat	NULL

Four	NULL

so	NULL
of	NULL
torturing	NULL

After	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL

unutterable	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
Angel	NULL
Clare	NULL
was	NULL
riding	NULL
along	NULL
a	NULL
narrow	NULL
lane	NULL
ten	NULL
miles	NULL
distant	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
breakfasters	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
Vicarage	NULL
at	NULL
Emminster	NULL
,	NULL
carrying	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
basket	NULL
which	NULL
contained	NULL
some	NULL
black-puddings	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
bottle	NULL
of	NULL
mead	NULL
,	NULL
sent	NULL
by	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Crick	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
kind	NULL
respects	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
parents	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
white	NULL
lane	NULL
stretched	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
staring	NULL
into	NULL
next	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
ought	NULL
he	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL

Dared	NULL
he	NULL
to	NULL
marry	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
would	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
and	NULL

brothers	NULL
say	NULL
?	NULL

What	NULL
would	NULL
he	NULL
himself	NULL
say	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
years	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
event	NULL
?	NULL

That	NULL
would	NULL
depend	NULL
upon	NULL
whether	NULL
the	NULL
germs	NULL
of	NULL
staunch	NULL
comradeship	NULL
underlay	NULL
the	NULL
temporary	NULL
emotion	NULL

whether	NULL
it	NULL

His	NULL

the	NULL
Tudor	NULL

the	NULL

came	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
into	NULL
view	NULL
beneath	NULL
him	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
rode	NULL
down	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
well-known	NULL
gate	NULL
.	NULL

Casting	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
before	NULL
entering	NULL
his	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
beheld	NULL
standing	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
vestry-door	NULL
a	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
girls	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
ages	NULL
between	NULL
twelve	NULL

sixteen	NULL
,	NULL
apparently	NULL
awaiting	NULL
the	NULL
arrival	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
other	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
became	NULL
visible	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
figure	NULL
somewhat	NULL
older	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
school-girls	NULL
,	NULL
wearing	NULL
a	NULL
broad-brimmed	NULL
hat	NULL
and	NULL
highly-starched	NULL
cambric	NULL
morning-gown	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
books	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
knew	NULL
her	NULL
well	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
observed	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
hoped	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
render	NULL
it	NULL
unnecessary	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
blameless	NULL
creature	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
overpowering	NULL
reluctance	NULL
to	NULL
greet	NULL
her	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
decide	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
seen	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
young	NULL
lady	NULL
was	NULL
Miss	NULL
Mercy	NULL
Chant	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
daughter	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL

parents	NULL

quiet	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
wed	NULL
some	NULL
day	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
great	NULL
at	NULL
Antinomianism	NULL

Bible-classes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
plainly	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
hold	NULL
a	NULL
class	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
's	NULL
mind	NULL
flew	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
impassioned	NULL

summer-steeped	NULL
heathens	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Var	NULL
Vale	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
rosy	NULL
faces	NULL
court-patched	NULL
with	NULL
cow-droppings	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
impassioned	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
impulse	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
trot	NULL
over	NULL
to	NULL
Emminster	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hence	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
apprise	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL

father	NULL

aiming	NULL

however	NULL

to	NULL
arrive	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
breakfast	NULL

before	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL

their	NULL
parish	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
late	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
meal	NULL

The	NULL
group	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
jumped	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
welcome	NULL
him	NULL

entered	NULL

mother	NULL
appeared	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cap	NULL

silver	NULL

and	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
looked	NULL
what	NULL

he	NULL
was	NULL

God-fearing	NULL

about	NULL
sixty-five	NULL

his	NULL

lined	NULL

Over	NULL

the	NULL

once	NULL

existence	NULL

admitted	NULL
no	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL

those	NULL

unwillingly	NULL

His	NULL
creed	NULL

was	NULL
such	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
almost	NULL
amounted	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
vice	NULL

amounted	NULL

either	NULL
by	NULL
inquiry	NULL
or	NULL
imagination	NULL
been	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
apprehend	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
Angel	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
unlucky	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
irritation	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
resulted	NULL
far	NULL
better	NULL
for	NULL
mankind	NULL
if	NULL
Greece	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
source	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
religion	NULL
of	NULL
modern	NULL
civilization	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
Palestine	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
grief	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
blank	NULL
description	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
realize	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
lurk	NULL
a	NULL
thousandth	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
less	NULL
a	NULL
half	NULL
truth	NULL
or	NULL
a	NULL
whole	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
proposition	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
simply	NULL
preached	NULL
austerely	NULL
at	NULL
Angel	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
after	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
kindness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
never	NULL
resented	NULL
anything	NULL
for	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
welcomed	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
to-day	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
candidly	NULL
sweet	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

Angel	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
felt	NULL
like	NULL
home	NULL
;	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
formerly	NULL
feel	NULL
himself	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
gathered	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
returned	NULL
hither	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
divergence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
since	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
last	NULL
shared	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Vicarage	NULL
life	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
even	NULL
more	NULL
distinctly	NULL
foreign	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
.	NULL

Its	NULL
transcendental	NULL
aspirations	NULL
--	NULL
still	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
based	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
geocentric	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
zenithal	NULL
paradise	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
nadiral	NULL
hell	NULL
--	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
foreign	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
dreams	NULL
of	NULL
people	NULL
on	NULL
another	NULL
planet	NULL
.	NULL

Latterly	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
only	NULL
Life	NULL
,	NULL
felt	NULL
only	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
passionate	NULL
pulse	NULL
of	NULL
existence	NULL
,	NULL
unwarped	NULL
,	NULL
uncontorted	NULL
,	NULL
untrammelled	NULL
by	NULL
those	NULL
creeds	NULL
which	NULL
futilely	NULL
attempt	NULL
to	NULL
check	NULL
what	NULL
wisdom	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
content	NULL
to	NULL
regulate	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
their	NULL
part	NULL
they	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
difference	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
growing	NULL
divergence	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
Angel	NULL
Clare	NULL
of	NULL
former	NULL
times	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
chiefly	NULL
a	NULL
difference	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
manner	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
noticed	NULL
just	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
particularly	NULL
his	NULL
brothers	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
to	NULL
behave	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
farmer	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
flung	NULL
his	NULL
legs	NULL
about	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
muscles	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
more	NULL
expressive	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
looked	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
information	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
tongue	NULL
spoke	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
scholar	NULL
had	NULL
nearly	NULL
disappeared	NULL
;	NULL
still	NULL
more	NULL
the	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
prig	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
culture	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
prude	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
coarse	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
contagion	NULL
of	NULL
domiciliary	NULL
fellowship	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
Talbothays	NULL
nymphs	NULL
and	NULL
swains	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
breakfast	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
two	NULL
brothers	NULL
,	NULL
non-evangelical	NULL
,	NULL
well-educated	NULL
,	NULL
hall-marked	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
correct	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
remotest	NULL
fibre	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
unimpeachable	NULL
models	NULL
as	NULL
are	NULL
turned	NULL
out	NULL
yearly	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
lathe	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
systematic	NULL
tuition	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
both	NULL
somewhat	NULL
short-sighted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
custom	NULL
to	NULL
wear	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
eyeglass	NULL
and	NULL
string	NULL
they	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
eyeglass	NULL
and	NULL
string	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
custom	NULL
to	NULL

a	NULL
double	NULL

they	NULL
wore	NULL
a	NULL
double	NULL
glass	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
custom	NULL
to	NULL
wear	NULL
spectacles	NULL
they	NULL
wore	NULL
spectacles	NULL
straightway	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
without	NULL
reference	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
particular	NULL
variety	NULL
of	NULL
defect	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
vision	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Wordsworth	NULL
was	NULL
enthroned	NULL
they	NULL
carried	NULL
pocket	NULL
copies	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
Shelley	NULL
was	NULL
belittled	NULL
they	NULL
allowed	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
dusty	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
shelves	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
Correggio	NULL
's	NULL
Holy	NULL
Families	NULL
were	NULL
admired	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
admired	NULL
Correggio	NULL
's	NULL
Holy	NULL
Families	NULL
;	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
decried	NULL
in	NULL
favour	NULL
of	NULL
Velasquez	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
sedulously	NULL
followed	NULL
suit	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
personal	NULL
objection	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
noticed	NULL
Angel	NULL
's	NULL
growing	NULL
social	NULL
ineptness	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
noticed	NULL
their	NULL
growing	NULL
mental	NULL
limitations	NULL
.	NULL

Felix	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
Church	NULL
;	NULL
Cuthbert	NULL
all	NULL
College	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
Diocesan	NULL
Synod	NULL
and	NULL
Visitations	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
mainsprings	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
;	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

Each	NULL
brother	NULL
candidly	NULL
recognized	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
unimportant	NULL
score	NULL
of	NULL
millions	NULL
of	NULL
outsiders	NULL
in	NULL
civilized	NULL
society	NULL
,	NULL
persons	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
neither	NULL
University	NULL
men	NULL
nor	NULL
churchmen	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
tolerated	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
reckoned	NULL
with	NULL
and	NULL
respected	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
both	NULL
dutiful	NULL
and	NULL
attentive	NULL
sons	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
regular	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
visits	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
parents	NULL
.	NULL

Felix	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
an	NULL
offshoot	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
far	NULL
more	NULL
recent	NULL
point	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
devolution	NULL
of	NULL
theology	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
self-sacrificing	NULL
and	NULL
disinterested	NULL
.	NULL

More	NULL
tolerant	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
contradictory	NULL
opinion	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
aspect	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
danger	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
holder	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
ready	NULL
than	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
to	NULL
pardon	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
teaching	NULL
.	NULL

Cuthbert	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
liberal-minded	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
greater	NULL
subtlety	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
hillside	NULL
Angel	NULL
's	NULL
former	NULL
feeling	NULL
revived	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
whatever	NULL
their	NULL
advantages	NULL
by	NULL
comparison	NULL
with	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
neither	NULL
saw	NULL
or	NULL
set	NULL
forth	NULL
life	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
really	NULL
was	NULL
lived	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
with	NULL
many	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
opportunities	NULL
of	NULL
observation	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
good	NULL
as	NULL
their	NULL
opportunities	NULL
of	NULL
expression	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
had	NULL
an	NULL
adequate	NULL
conception	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
complicated	NULL
forces	NULL
at	NULL
work	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
smooth	NULL
and	NULL
gentle	NULL
current	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
associates	NULL
floated	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL
local	NULL
truth	NULL
and	NULL
universal	NULL
truth	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
inner	NULL
world	NULL
said	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
clerical	NULL

academic	NULL
hearing	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
thing	NULL
from	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
outer	NULL
world	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

Felix	NULL

his	NULL

They	NULL
returned	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL
to	NULL
dinner	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
fixed	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL

their	NULL

's	NULL

Convenience	NULL

the	NULL

though	NULL
the	NULL

sufficiently	NULL

wish	NULL
that	NULL

The	NULL

Angel	NULL
in	NULL

who	NULL
was	NULL

neither	NULL

the	NULL

The	NULL

It	NULL

the	NULL
evening	NULL

after	NULL

that	NULL
Angel	NULL
found	NULL
opportunity	NULL
of	NULL
broaching	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
one	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
subjects	NULL
near	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
strung	NULL
himself	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
purpose	NULL
while	NULL
kneeling	NULL
behind	NULL
his	NULL
brothers	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
carpet	NULL
,	NULL
studying	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
nails	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
heels	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
walking	NULL
boots	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
service	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mr	NULL
Clare	NULL
and	NULL
himself	NULL
were	NULL
left	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
first	NULL
discussed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
elder	NULL
his	NULL
plans	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
attainment	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
as	NULL

on	NULL
an	NULL
extensive	NULL
scale	NULL
--	NULL
either	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
or	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Colonies	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
father	NULL
then	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
put	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
expense	NULL
of	NULL
sending	NULL
Angel	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
Cambridge	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
his	NULL
duty	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
sum	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
every	NULL
year	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
purchase	NULL
or	NULL
lease	NULL
of	NULL
land	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
some	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
himself	NULL
unduly	NULL
slighted	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
As	NULL

"	NULL
continued	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL

This	NULL
considerateness	NULL
on	NULL

Mr	NULL
Clare	NULL
's	NULL
part	NULL
led	NULL
Angel	NULL
onward	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

He	NULL
observed	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL

that	NULL

six-and-twenty	NULL

and	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL

Would	NULL

therefore	NULL

him	NULL

His	NULL

seemed	NULL
to	NULL

then	NULL
Angel	NULL
put	NULL

Angel	NULL
entered	NULL

and	NULL
went	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
silent	NULL
passages	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
quarters	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
listened	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

Sustained	NULL
snores	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
cart-house	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
lying	NULL
down	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
grunt	NULL
and	NULL
squeal	NULL
of	NULL
sweltering	NULL
pigs	NULL
arose	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

distance	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
large-leaved	NULL
rhubarb	NULL
and	NULL
cabbage	NULL
plants	NULL
slept	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
broad	NULL
limp	NULL
surfaces	NULL
hanging	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
like	NULL
half-closed	NULL

.	NULL

He	NULL
unbridled	NULL
and	NULL
fed	NULL
his	NULL
horse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
re-entered	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
the	NULL
clock	NULL
struck	NULL
three	NULL
.	NULL

Three	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
skimming-hour	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
stroke	NULL
,	NULL
Clare	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
creaking	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
floor-boards	NULL
above	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
the	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
descending	NULL
foot	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
moment	NULL
came	NULL
down	NULL
before	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
enter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hardly	NULL
realized	NULL
his	NULL
presence	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
yawning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
red	NULL
interior	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
snake	NULL
's	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
stretched	NULL
one	NULL
arm	NULL
so	NULL
high	NULL
above	NULL
her	NULL
coiled-up	NULL
cable	NULL
of	NULL
hair	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
its	NULL
satin	NULL
delicacy	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
sunburn	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
flushed	NULL
with	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
eyelids	NULL
hung	NULL
heavy	NULL
over	NULL
their	NULL
pupils	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
brim-fulness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
nature	NULL
breathed	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
when	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
soul	NULL
is	NULL
more	NULL
incarnate	NULL
than	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
time	NULL

the	NULL
most	NULL
spiritual	NULL

itself	NULL

sex	NULL
takes	NULL
the	NULL
outside	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
presentation	NULL

Then	NULL
those	NULL
eyes	NULL
flashed	NULL
brightly	NULL
through	NULL
their	NULL
filmy	NULL
heaviness	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
remainder	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
awake	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
an	NULL
oddly	NULL
compounded	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
gladness	NULL
,	NULL
shyness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
surprise	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
exclaimed	NULL
--	NULL

There	NULL

the	NULL

up	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL

encountered	NULL

his	NULL

Tess	NULL
's	NULL
excitable	NULL
heart	NULL
beat	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL

;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
they	NULL
stood	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
red-brick	NULL
floor	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
entry	NULL

the	NULL

slanting	NULL
in	NULL

her	NULL

into	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
her	NULL

Having	NULL
been	NULL
lying	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
clothes	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
warm	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
sunned	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
look	NULL

up	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL

her	NULL
eyes	NULL
soon	NULL
lifted	NULL

they	NULL
retreated	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

Deborah	NULL

Possibly	NULL
the	NULL
Talbothays	NULL
milk	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
skimmed	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL
wherein	NULL
familiar	NULL
objects	NULL
appeared	NULL
as	NULL
having	NULL
light	NULL
and	NULL
shade	NULL
and	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
particular	NULL
outline	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
held	NULL
the	NULL
skimmer	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
pump	NULL
to	NULL
cool	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
trembled	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
ardour	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
affection	NULL
being	NULL
so	NULL
palpable	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
flinch	NULL
under	NULL
it	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
plant	NULL
in	NULL
too	NULL
burning	NULL
a	NULL
sun	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
pressed	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
running	NULL
her	NULL
forefinger	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
leads	NULL
to	NULL
cut	NULL
off	NULL

he	NULL
resumed	NULL
gently	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
ask	NULL
you	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL

you	NULL

He	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
way	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
yielded	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
impulse	NULL

which	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
would	NULL
disapprove	NULL

She	NULL
turned	NULL
quite	NULL
careworn	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
bowed	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
inevitable	NULL
result	NULL

proximity	NULL

the	NULL
necessity	NULL
of	NULL
loving	NULL
him	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
calculated	NULL

this	NULL
sudden	NULL
corollary	NULL

which	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL

Clare	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
without	NULL
quite	NULL
meaning	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
so	NULL
soon	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
pain	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
bitterness	NULL
of	NULL
dissolution	NULL
she	NULL
murmured	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL

Yet	NULL
nobody	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
;	NULL
nobody	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
was	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
guessed	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
sad	NULL
countenances	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
chamber	NULL
companions	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
regarded	NULL
her	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
favourite	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
chosen	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
for	NULL
themselves	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
put	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
before	NULL
known	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
thread	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
distinctly	NULL
twisted	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
strands	NULL
,	NULL
positive	NULL
pleasure	NULL
and	NULL
positive	NULL
pain	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
cheese-making	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
were	NULL
again	NULL
left	NULL
alone	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dairyman	NULL
himself	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
lending	NULL
a	NULL
hand	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Mr	NULL
Crick	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
latterly	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
acquired	NULL
a	NULL
suspicion	NULL
of	NULL
mutual	NULL
interest	NULL
between	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
so	NULL
circumspectly	NULL
that	NULL
suspicion	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
faintest	NULL
.	NULL

Anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
dairyman	NULL
left	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
themselves	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
breaking	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
masses	NULL
of	NULL
curd	NULL
before	NULL
putting	NULL
them	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
vats	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
operation	NULL
resembled	NULL
the	NULL
act	NULL
of	NULL
crumbling	NULL
bread	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
scale	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
immaculate	NULL
whiteness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
curds	NULL
Tess	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
's	NULL
hands	NULL
showed	NULL
themselves	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pinkness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rose	NULL
.	NULL

Angel	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
filling	NULL
the	NULL
vats	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
handful	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
ceased	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
laid	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
flat	NULL
upon	NULL
hers	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
sleeves	NULL
were	NULL
rolled	NULL
far	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
elbow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
bending	NULL
lower	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
the	NULL
inside	NULL
vein	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
soft	NULL
arm	NULL
.	NULL

Although	NULL
the	NULL
early	NULL
September	NULL
weather	NULL
was	NULL
sultry	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
arm	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
dabbling	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
curds	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
cold	NULL
and	NULL
damp	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
mouth	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
new-gathered	NULL
mushroom	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
tasted	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
whey	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
sheaf	NULL
of	NULL
susceptibilities	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
pulse	NULL
was	NULL
accelerated	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
touch	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
blood	NULL
driven	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
finder-ends	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
cool	NULL
arms	NULL
flushed	NULL
hot	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Is	NULL
coyness	NULL
longer	NULL

she	NULL
lifted	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL

they	NULL
beamed	NULL
devotedly	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL

as	NULL
her	NULL
lip	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL

half-smile	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
a	NULL

break	NULL
down	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL

went	NULL
on	NULL

he	NULL
quickly	NULL
added	NULL

observing	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL
remark	NULL
had	NULL
cut	NULL
her	NULL

The	NULL

now	NULL
getting	NULL
beyond	NULL

her	NULL
lip	NULL
quivered	NULL

she	NULL

At	NULL

stop	NULL
in	NULL

was	NULL
in	NULL

thicket	NULL

the	NULL

Tess	NULL
flung	NULL
herself	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
rustling	NULL
undergrowth	NULL

spear-grass	NULL

as	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
bed	NULL

remained	NULL
crouching	NULL

palpitating	NULL
misery	NULL

by	NULL
momentary	NULL
shoots	NULL
of	NULL
joy	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
fears	NULL
about	NULL

altogether	NULL
suppress	NULL

In	NULL
reality	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
drifting	NULL
into	NULL
acquiescence	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL
voice	NULL
that	NULL
joined	NULL
with	NULL
nature	NULL
in	NULL
revolt	NULL
against	NULL
her	NULL
scrupulousness	NULL

inconsiderate	NULL

her	NULL

that	NULL

what	NULL

in	NULL
almost	NULL
a	NULL
terror	NULL

The	NULL
afternoon	NULL
advanced	NULL

and	NULL
still	NULL
she	NULL
remained	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
willows	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
rattle	NULL
of	NULL
taking	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
pails	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
forked	NULL
stands	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL

which	NULL
accompanied	NULL
the	NULL
getting	NULL
together	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cows	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
milking	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
agitation	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
dairyman	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
the	NULL
cause	NULL

would	NULL
good-naturedly	NULL
tease	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
harassment	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
borne	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
lover	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
guessed	NULL
her	NULL
overwrought	NULL
state	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
invented	NULL
some	NULL
excuse	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
non-appearance	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
no	NULL
inquiries	NULL
were	NULL
made	NULL
or	NULL
calls	NULL
given	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
half-past	NULL
six	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
settled	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
levels	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
aspect	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
forge	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
heavens	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
a	NULL
monstrous	NULL
pumpkin-like	NULL
moon	NULL
arose	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pollard	NULL
willows	NULL

tortured	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
natural	NULL
shape	NULL
by	NULL
incessant	NULL
choppings	NULL

became	NULL
spiny-haired	NULL
monsters	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
stood	NULL
up	NULL
against	NULL
it	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
upstairs	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
Wednesday	NULL

Thursday	NULL
came	NULL

intruded	NULL

The	NULL

The	NULL

a	NULL

If	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
"	NULL
No	NULL

he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL

it	NULL
had	NULL
evidently	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
intention	NULL

but	NULL
her	NULL
determined	NULL
negative	NULL
deterred	NULL
his	NULL
scrupulous	NULL
heart	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
condition	NULL
of	NULL
domiciliary	NULL
comradeship	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
disadvantage	NULL
by	NULL
its	NULL
enforced	NULL
intercourse	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
unfair	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
exercise	NULL
any	NULL
pressure	NULL
of	NULL
blandishment	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
honestly	NULL
employed	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
been	NULL
better	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
released	NULL
her	NULL
momentarily-imprisoned	NULL
waist	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
withheld	NULL
the	NULL
kiss	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
all	NULL
turned	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
release	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
her	NULL
strength	NULL
to	NULL
refuse	NULL
him	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
was	NULL
solely	NULL
the	NULL
tale	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
widow	NULL
told	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
dairyman	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
overcome	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Angel	NULL
said	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
perplexed	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Day	NULL
after	NULL
day	NULL
they	NULL
met	NULL
--	NULL
somewhat	NULL
less	NULL
constantly	NULL
than	NULL
before	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
went	NULL
by	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
September	NULL
drew	NULL
near	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
eye	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
ask	NULL
her	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
plan	NULL
of	NULL
procedure	NULL
was	NULL
different	NULL
now	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
negatives	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
coyness	NULL
and	NULL
youth	NULL
startled	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
novelty	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
proposal	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fitful	NULL
evasiveness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
manner	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
was	NULL
under	NULL
discussion	NULL
countenanced	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
he	NULL
played	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
coaxing	NULL
game	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
never	NULL
going	NULL
beyond	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
attempting	NULL
the	NULL
renewal	NULL
of	NULL
caresses	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
his	NULL
utmost	NULL
orally	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
Clare	NULL
persistently	NULL
wooed	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
undertones	NULL
like	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
purling	NULL
milk	NULL
--	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
cow	NULL
's	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
skimmings	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
butter-makings	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
cheese-makings	NULL
,	NULL
among	NULL
broody	NULL
poultry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
among	NULL
farrowing	NULL
pigs	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
no	NULL
milkmaid	NULL
was	NULL
ever	NULL
wooed	NULL
before	NULL
by	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
break	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

Neither	NULL
a	NULL
religious	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
moral	NULL
validity	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
previous	NULL
union	NULL
nor	NULL
a	NULL
conscientious	NULL
wish	NULL
for	NULL
candour	NULL
could	NULL
hold	NULL
out	NULL
against	NULL
it	NULL
much	NULL
longer	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
so	NULL
passionately	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
godlike	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
being	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
untrained	NULL
,	NULL
instinctively	NULL
refined	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
nature	NULL
cried	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
tutelary	NULL
guidance	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
thus	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
Tess	NULL
kept	NULL
repeating	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
were	NULL
vain	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
proof	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
weakness	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
utterance	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
calm	NULL
strength	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
trouble	NULL
to	NULL
formulate	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
voice	NULL
beginning	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
subject	NULL
stirred	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
terrifying	NULL
bliss	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
coveted	NULL
the	NULL
recantation	NULL
she	NULL
feared	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
manner	NULL
was	NULL
--	NULL
what	NULL
man	NULL
's	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
?	NULL

--	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
love	NULL
and	NULL
cherish	NULL
and	NULL
defend	NULL
her	NULL
under	NULL
any	NULL
conditions	NULL
,	NULL
changes	NULL
,	NULL
charges	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
revelations	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
gloom	NULL
lessened	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
basked	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
season	NULL
meanwhile	NULL
was	NULL
drawing	NULL
onward	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
equinox	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
fine	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
were	NULL
much	NULL
shorter	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dairy	NULL
had	NULL
again	NULL
worked	NULL
by	NULL
morning	NULL
candlelight	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
fresh	NULL
renewal	NULL
of	NULL
Clare	NULL
's	NULL
pleading	NULL
occurred	NULL
one	NULL
morning	NULL
between	NULL
three	NULL
and	NULL
four	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
run	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
bedgown	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
door	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
dress	NULL
and	NULL
call	NULL
the	NULL
others	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
ten	NULL
minutes	NULL
was	NULL
walking	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
candle	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
steps	NULL
from	NULL
above	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
shirt-sleeves	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
stairway	NULL

"	NULL

his	NULL

to	NULL
her	NULL

one	NULL

She	NULL
passed	NULL
downstairs	NULL
very	NULL
quickly	NULL

never	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
signs	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
exquisite	NULL
relief	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
impatient	NULL
exclamation	NULL

though	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
resolved	NULL
so	NULL
intrepidly	NULL
to	NULL

That	NULL

now	NULL
done	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
power	NULL
to	NULL
attempt	NULL
self-immolation	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
joined	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
milker	NULL
from	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cottages	NULL

and	NULL
no	NULL

that	NULL

them	NULL
so	NULL
deeply	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Tess	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL

would	NULL
decide	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
several	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dairyman	NULL
's	NULL
household	NULL
and	NULL
assistants	NULL
went	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
meads	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL

a	NULL
long	NULL
way	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
dairy	NULL

where	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cows	NULL
were	NULL
milked	NULL
without	NULL

driven	NULL
home	NULL

The	NULL
supply	NULL
was	NULL

the	NULL
animals	NULL
advanced	NULL
in	NULL
calf	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
supernumerary	NULL
milkers	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lush	NULL

The	NULL
work	NULL

leisurely	NULL

Mr	NULL
Clare	NULL
volunteered	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
none	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
business	NULL
,	NULL
asking	NULL
Tess	NULL
to	NULL
accompany	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
sunless	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
warm	NULL
and	NULL
muggy	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Tess	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
milking-hood	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
naked-armed	NULL
and	NULL
jacketless	NULL
;	NULL
certainly	NULL
not	NULL
dressed	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
drive	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
therefore	NULL
replied	NULL
by	NULL
glancing	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
scant	NULL
habiliments	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Clare	NULL
gently	NULL
urged	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
assented	NULL
by	NULL
relinquishing	NULL
her	NULL
pail	NULL
and	NULL
stool	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dairyman	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
mounted	NULL
the	NULL
spring-waggon	NULL
beside	NULL
Clare	NULL
.	NULL

XXX	NULL
In	NULL
the	NULL
diminishing	NULL
daylight	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
level	NULL
roadway	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
meads	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
stretched	NULL
away	NULL
into	NULL
gray	NULL
miles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
backed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
extreme	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
distance	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
swarthy	NULL
and	NULL
abrupt	NULL
slopes	NULL
of	NULL
Egdon	NULL
Heath	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
its	NULL
summit	NULL
stood	NULL
clumps	NULL
and	NULL
stretches	NULL
of	NULL
fir-trees	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
notched	NULL
tips	NULL
appeared	NULL
like	NULL
battlemented	NULL
towers	NULL
crowning	NULL
black-fronted	NULL
castles	NULL
of	NULL
enchantment	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
so	NULL
absorbed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
begin	NULL
talking	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
silence	NULL
being	NULL
broken	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
clucking	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
milk	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tall	NULL
cans	NULL
behind	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lane	NULL
they	NULL
followed	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
solitary	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
hazel	NULL
nuts	NULL
had	NULL
remained	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
boughs	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
slipped	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
shells	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
blackberries	NULL
hung	NULL
in	NULL
heavy	NULL
clusters	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
Angel	NULL
would	NULL
fling	NULL
the	NULL
lash	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
whip	NULL
round	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
,	NULL
pluck	NULL
it	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
give	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
companion	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dull	NULL
sky	NULL
soon	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
its	NULL
meaning	NULL
by	NULL
sending	NULL
down	NULL
herald-drops	NULL
of	NULL
rain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
stagnant	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
changed	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
fitful	NULL
breeze	NULL
which	NULL
played	NULL
about	NULL
their	NULL
faces	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
quick-silvery	NULL
glaze	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
rivers	NULL
and	NULL
pools	NULL
vanished	NULL
;	NULL
from	NULL
broad	NULL
mirrors	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
they	NULL
changed	NULL
to	NULL
lustreless	NULL
sheets	NULL
of	NULL
lead	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
surface	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
rasp	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
spectacle	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
affect	NULL
her	NULL
preoccupation	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
countenance	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
natural	NULL
carnation	NULL
slightly	NULL
embrowned	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
deepened	NULL
its	NULL
tinge	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
beating	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rain-drops	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
pressure	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cows	NULL
'	NULL
flanks	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
caused	NULL
to	NULL
tumble	NULL
down	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
fastenings	NULL
and	NULL
stray	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
curtain	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
calico	NULL
bonnet	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
made	NULL
clammy	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
moisture	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
it	NULL
hardly	NULL
was	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
seaweed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
ought	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL

I	NULL
suppose	NULL

she	NULL
murmured	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

Remote	NULL
Egdon	NULL
disappeared	NULL
by	NULL
degree	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
liquid	NULL
gauze	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
evening	NULL
grew	NULL
darker	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
roads	NULL
being	NULL
crossed	NULL
by	NULL
gates	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
safe	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
faster	NULL

at	NULL
a	NULL

pace	NULL

The	NULL
air	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
chill	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
imperceptibly	NULL
crept	NULL
closer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
wrapped	NULL
round	NULL
them	NULL
both	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
sail-cloth	NULL

which	NULL
was	NULL
sometimes	NULL
used	NULL

keep	NULL

off	NULL

Tess	NULL
held	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
slipping	NULL
off	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL

that	NULL

Now	NULL

that	NULL

I	NULL

you	NULL

she	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
distraction	NULL
of	NULL
tenderness	NULL

"	NULL
Will	NULL
this	NULL

She	NULL
clasped	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL

and	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL

Clare	NULL
learnt	NULL
what	NULL

Yes	NULL

never	NULL

they	NULL

J.	NULL
DURBEYFIELD	NULL
"	NULL
O	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
mother	NULL

"	NULL

murmured	NULL
Tess	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
recognizing	NULL
how	NULL
light	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
events	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
oppressive	NULL
upon	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
's	NULL
elastic	NULL
spirit	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
mother	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
see	NULL
life	NULL
as	NULL
Tess	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
haunting	NULL
episode	NULL
of	NULL
bygone	NULL
days	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
passing	NULL
accident	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
perhaps	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
followed	NULL
,	NULL
whatever	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
reasons	NULL
.	NULL

Silence	NULL
seemed	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
best	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
adored	NULL
one	NULL
's	NULL
happiness	NULL
:	NULL
silence	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
steadied	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
command	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
person	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
shadow	NULL
of	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
control	NULL
her	NULL
action	NULL
,	NULL
Tess	NULL
grew	NULL
calmer	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
responsibility	NULL
was	NULL
shifted	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
lighter	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
for	NULL
weeks	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
declining	NULL
autumn	NULL
which	NULL
followed	NULL
her	NULL
assent	NULL
,	NULL
beginning	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
month	NULL
of	NULL
October	NULL
,	NULL
formed	NULL
a	NULL
season	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
lived	NULL
in	NULL
spiritual	NULL
altitudes	NULL
more	NULL
nearly	NULL
approaching	NULL
ecstasy	NULL
than	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
period	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
hardly	NULL
a	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
earth	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
Clare	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
her	NULL
sublime	NULL
trustfulness	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
goodness	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
--	NULL
knew	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
guide	NULL
,	NULL
philosopher	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
friend	NULL
should	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
every	NULL
line	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
contour	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
person	NULL
the	NULL
perfection	NULL
of	NULL
masculine	NULL
beauty	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
the	NULL
soul	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
saint	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
intellect	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
seer	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wisdom	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
sustained	NULL
her	NULL
dignity	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
wearing	NULL
a	NULL
crown	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
compassion	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
lift	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
devotion	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
sometimes	NULL
catch	NULL
her	NULL
large	NULL
,	NULL
worshipful	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
bottom	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
depths	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
something	NULL
immortal	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
dismissed	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
--	NULL
trod	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
treads	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
coal	NULL
that	NULL
is	NULL
smouldering	NULL
and	NULL
dangerous	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
known	NULL
that	NULL
men	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
disinterested	NULL
,	NULL
chivalrous	NULL
,	NULL
protective	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
women	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
.	NULL

Angel	NULL
Clare	NULL
was	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
respect	NULL
;	NULL
absurdly	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
spiritual	NULL
than	NULL
animal	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
himself	NULL
well	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
singularly	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
grossness	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
not	NULL
cold-natured	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
bright	NULL
than	NULL
hot	NULL
--	NULL
less	NULL
Byronic	NULL
than	NULL
Shelleyan	NULL
;	NULL
could	NULL
love	NULL
desperately	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
love	NULL
more	NULL
especially	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
imaginative	NULL
and	NULL
ethereal	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fastidious	NULL
emotion	NULL
which	NULL
could	NULL
jealously	NULL
guard	NULL
the	NULL
loved	NULL
one	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
very	NULL
self	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
amazed	NULL
and	NULL
enraptured	NULL
Tess	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
slight	NULL
experiences	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
infelicitous	NULL
till	NULL
now	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
reaction	NULL
from	NULL
indignation	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
male	NULL
sex	NULL
she	NULL
swerved	NULL
to	NULL
excess	NULL
of	NULL
honour	NULL
for	NULL
Clare	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
unaffectedly	NULL
sought	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
's	NULL
company	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
honest	NULL
faith	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
disguise	NULL
her	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sum	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
instincts	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
matter	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
clearly	NULL
stated	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
elusive	NULL
quality	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
sex	NULL
which	NULL
attracts	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
distasteful	NULL
to	NULL
so	NULL
perfect	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
after	NULL
an	NULL
avowal	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
very	NULL
nature	NULL
carry	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
suspicion	NULL
of	NULL
art	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
country	NULL
custom	NULL
of	NULL
unreserved	NULL
comradeship	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
doors	NULL
during	NULL
betrothal	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
custom	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
strangeness	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
oddly	NULL
anticipative	NULL
to	NULL
Clare	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
how	NULL
normal	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
common	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
dairy-folk	NULL
,	NULL
regarded	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
this	NULL
October	NULL
month	NULL
of	NULL
wonderful	NULL
afternoons	NULL
they	NULL
roved	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
meads	NULL
by	NULL
creeping	NULL
paths	NULL
which	NULL
followed	NULL
the	NULL
brinks	NULL
of	NULL
trickling	NULL
tributary	NULL
brooks	NULL
,	NULL
hopping	NULL
across	NULL
by	NULL
little	NULL
wooden	NULL
bridges	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
never	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
purling	NULL
weir	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
buzz	NULL
accompanied	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
murmuring	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
beams	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
horizontal	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
mead	NULL
itself	NULL
,	NULL
formed	NULL
a	NULL
pollen	NULL
of	NULL
radiance	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
landscape	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
saw	NULL
tiny	NULL
blue	NULL
fogs	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shadows	NULL
of	NULL
trees	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL

things	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
remind	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
date	NULL

Or	NULL
he	NULL

ask	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
night	NULL

when	NULL
he	NULL
accompanied	NULL
her	NULL
on	NULL
some	NULL
mission	NULL
invented	NULL
by	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Crick	NULL
to	NULL
give	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
mostly	NULL
a	NULL
journey	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
farmhouse	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
slopes	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
vale	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
inquire	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
advanced	NULL
cows	NULL
were	NULL
getting	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
straw-barton	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
relegated	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
that	NULL
brought	NULL
great	NULL
changes	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
of	NULL
kine	NULL
.	NULL

Batches	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
animals	NULL
were	NULL
sent	NULL
away	NULL
daily	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
lying-in	NULL
hospital	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
lived	NULL
on	NULL
straw	NULL
till	NULL
their	NULL
calves	NULL
were	NULL
born	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
which	NULL
event	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
calf	NULL
could	NULL
walk	NULL
,	NULL
mother	NULL
and	NULL
offspring	NULL
were	NULL
driven	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dairy	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
interval	NULL
which	NULL
elapsed	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
calves	NULL
were	NULL
sold	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL

little	NULL

as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
calf	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
taken	NULL
away	NULL
the	NULL
milkmaids	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
.	NULL

Returning	NULL
from	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
dark	NULL
walks	NULL
they	NULL
reached	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
gravel-cliff	NULL
immediately	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
levels	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL

The	NULL
water	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
high	NULL
in	NULL

From	NULL

soon	NULL

now	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL

concern	NULL

What	NULL
should	NULL
he	NULL
do	NULL
about	NULL

would	NULL
make	NULL

Anglebury	NULL

congratulated	NULL

the	NULL
shilly-shallying	NULL
having	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
end	NULL

said	NULL
that	NULL
directly	NULL
she	NULL
set	NULL
eyes	NULL
on	NULL
Tess	NULL
she	NULL
divined	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL

the	NULL

of	NULL
somebody	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
common	NULL
outdoor	NULL
man	NULL

Tess	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
so	NULL
superior	NULL

across	NULL
the	NULL
barton	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
afternoon	NULL

her	NULL
arrival	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
family	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
sworn	NULL

In	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
fact	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Crick	NULL
did	NULL
remember	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
Tess	NULL
was	NULL
graceful	NULL
and	NULL
good-looking	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
approached	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
superiority	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
growth	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
imagination	NULL
aided	NULL
by	NULL
subsequent	NULL
knowledge	NULL

Tess	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
carried	NULL
along	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
wings	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
will	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
word	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
given	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
number	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
written	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
naturally	NULL
bright	NULL
intelligence	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
admit	NULL
the	NULL
fatalistic	NULL
convictions	NULL
common	NULL
to	NULL
field-folk	NULL
and	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
associate	NULL
more	NULL
extensively	NULL
with	NULL
natural	NULL
phenomena	NULL
than	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
fellow-creatures	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
accordingly	NULL
drifted	NULL
into	NULL
that	NULL
passive	NULL
responsiveness	NULL

all	NULL
things	NULL
her	NULL
lover	NULL
suggested	NULL
,	NULL
characteristic	NULL

frame	NULL

she	NULL
wrote	NULL
anew	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL

ostensibly	NULL
to	NULL
notify	NULL
the	NULL
wedding-day	NULL
;	NULL
really	NULL
to	NULL
again	NULL
implore	NULL
her	NULL
advice	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
chosen	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
perhaps	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
considered	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
post-nuptial	NULL
explanation	NULL

which	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
accepted	NULL

light	NULL
heart	NULL

rougher	NULL
man	NULL

not	NULL
be	NULL
received	NULL

the	NULL
same	NULL
feeling	NULL

him	NULL

this	NULL
communication	NULL

Durbeyfield	NULL

Despite	NULL
Angel	NULL

's	NULL

representation	NULL

the	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
step	NULL

as	NULL
became	NULL
apparent	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
later	NULL

He	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
dearly	NULL

though	NULL
perhaps	NULL
rather	NULL
ideally	NULL

fancifully	NULL
than	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
impassioned	NULL
thoroughness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
feeling	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL

had	NULL
entertained	NULL
no	NULL

when	NULL
doomed	NULL

had	NULL
thought	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
unintellectual	NULL

life	NULL

that	NULL
such	NULL
charms	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
beheld	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
idyllic	NULL
creature	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
found	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
scenes	NULL
.	NULL

Unsophistication	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
known	NULL
how	NULL
it	NULL
really	NULL
struck	NULL
one	NULL
until	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
seeing	NULL
his	NULL
future	NULL
track	NULL
clearly	NULL

and	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL

before	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
consider	NULL
himself	NULL
fairly	NULL
started	NULL

life	NULL

The	NULL
secret	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
tinge	NULL
of	NULL
recklessness	NULL
imparted	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
career	NULL

character	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
to	NULL
miss	NULL
his	NULL
true	NULL
destiny	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
prejudices	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
family	NULL

The	NULL
reason	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL

so	NULL
far	NULL

it	NULL

a	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL

what	NULL

Less	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

Questions	NULL
of	NULL
procedure	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
these	NULL
arose	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL

was	NULL
the	NULL
date	NULL

His	NULL

herself	NULL

Could	NULL
it	NULL

Their	NULL

nothing	NULL

them	NULL

why	NULL
not	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
why	NULL
?	NULL

One	NULL
Sunday	NULL
morning	NULL
Izz	NULL
Huett	NULL
returned	NULL
from	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
spoke	NULL
privately	NULL
to	NULL
Tess	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
called	NULL
home	NULL
this	NULL
morning	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
should	NULL
ha	NULL
'	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
asking	NULL
to-day	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
answered	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
quietly	NULL
at	NULL
Tess	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
meant	NULL

be	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
other	NULL
returned	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
affirmative	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
there	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
three	NULL

only	NULL
two	NULL
Sundays	NULL

Tess	NULL
felt	NULL
her	NULL
cheek	NULL
paling	NULL
;	NULL
Izz	NULL
was	NULL
right	NULL
;	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
there	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
three	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
forgotten	NULL

If	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
week	NULL
's	NULL
postponement	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
unlucky	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
remind	NULL
her	NULL
lover	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
backward	NULL
was	NULL
suddenly	NULL
fired	NULL
with	NULL
impatience	NULL
and	NULL
alarm	NULL
lest	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
lose	NULL
her	NULL
dear	NULL
prize	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
natural	NULL
incident	NULL
relieved	NULL
her	NULL
anxiety	NULL
.	NULL

Izz	NULL
mentioned	NULL
the	NULL
omission	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
banns	NULL
to	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Crick	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Crick	NULL
assumed	NULL
a	NULL
matron	NULL
's	NULL
privilege	NULL

speaking	NULL
to	NULL
Angel	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
not	NULL

'em	NULL

"	NULL
says	NULL
Clare	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
caught	NULL
Tess	NULL
alone	NULL
he	NULL
assured	NULL
her	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
let	NULL
them	NULL
tease	NULL
you	NULL
about	NULL

licence	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
quieter	NULL
for	NULL
us	NULL

I	NULL
have	NULL
decided	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
licence	NULL
without	NULL

you	NULL

So	NULL
if	NULL
you	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
church	NULL
on	NULL
Sunday	NULL
morning	NULL
you	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
it	NULL

dearest	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
proudly	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
things	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
train	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
immense	NULL
relief	NULL
to	NULL
Tess	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
well-nigh	NULL
feared	NULL
that	NULL
somebody	NULL
would	NULL
stand	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
forbid	NULL
the	NULL
banns	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
history	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
events	NULL
were	NULL
favouring	NULL
her	NULL
!	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
quite	NULL
feel	NULL
easy	NULL

"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
this	NULL
good	NULL
fortune	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
scourged	NULL
out	NULL

how	NULL

I	NULL
wish	NULL
I	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
common	NULL
banns	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

But	NULL
everything	NULL
went	NULL
smoothly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wondered	NULL
whether	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
married	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
present	NULL
best	NULL
white	NULL
frock	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
ought	NULL
to	NULL
buy	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
question	NULL
was	NULL
set	NULL
at	NULL
rest	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
forethought	NULL
,	NULL
disclosed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
arrival	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
large	NULL
packages	NULL
addressed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Inside	NULL
them	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
a	NULL
whole	NULL
stock	NULL
of	NULL
clothing	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
bonnet	NULL
to	NULL
shoes	NULL
,	NULL
including	NULL
a	NULL
perfect	NULL
morning	NULL
costume	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
would	NULL
well	NULL
suit	NULL
the	NULL
simple	NULL
wedding	NULL
they	NULL
planned	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
shortly	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
arrival	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
packages	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
upstairs	NULL
undoing	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
minute	NULL
later	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
flush	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
and	NULL
tears	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
thoughtful	NULL
you	NULL
've	NULL
been	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
murmured	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
cheek	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
shoulder	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Even	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
gloves	NULL

handkerchief	NULL

No	NULL

nothing	NULL

"	NULL

And	NULL
to	NULL
divert	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
thinking	NULL
too	NULL
highly	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
upstairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
see	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
all	NULL
fitted	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
sempstress	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
alterations	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
return	NULL
upstairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
gown	NULL
.	NULL

Alone	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
glass	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
silk	NULL
attire	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
ballad	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
mystic	NULL
robe	NULL
--	NULL
That	NULL
never	NULL
would	NULL
become	NULL
that	NULL
wife	NULL
That	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
done	NULL
amiss	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
had	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
sing	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
blithely	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
archly	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
foot	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
cradle	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
rocked	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tune	NULL
.	NULL

Suppose	NULL
this	NULL
robe	NULL
should	NULL
betray	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
changing	NULL
colour	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
robe	NULL
had	NULL
betrayed	NULL
Queen	NULL
Guinevere	NULL
.	NULL

Since	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
dairy	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
once	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lines	NULL
till	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

XXXIII	NULL
Angel	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
spend	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
wedding	NULL
,	NULL
somewhere	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
dairy	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
last	NULL
jaunt	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
company	NULL
while	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
yet	NULL
mere	NULL
lover	NULL
and	NULL
mistress	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
romantic	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
circumstances	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
repeated	NULL
;	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
other	NULL
and	NULL
greater	NULL
day	NULL
beaming	NULL
close	NULL
ahead	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
preceding	NULL
week	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
suggested	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
purchases	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
nearest	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
started	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
's	NULL
life	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
dairy	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
recluse	NULL
in	NULL
respect	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
class	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
months	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
gone	NULL
near	NULL
a	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
requiring	NULL
no	NULL
vehicle	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
kept	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
hiring	NULL
the	NULL
dairyman	NULL
's	NULL
cob	NULL
or	NULL
gig	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
rode	NULL
or	NULL
drove	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
gig	NULL
that	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
lives	NULL
they	NULL
shopped	NULL
as	NULL
partners	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
concern	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
Christmas	NULL
Eve	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
loads	NULL
a	NULL
holly	NULL
and	NULL
mistletoe	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
strangers	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
from	NULL
all	NULL
parts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
paid	NULL
the	NULL
penalty	NULL
of	NULL
walking	NULL
about	NULL
with	NULL
happiness	NULL
superadded	NULL
to	NULL
beauty	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
countenance	NULL
by	NULL
being	NULL
much	NULL
stared	NULL
at	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
moved	NULL
amid	NULL
them	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
they	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
inn	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Tess	NULL
waited	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
entry	NULL
while	NULL
Angel	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
horse	NULL
and	NULL
gig	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
general	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
was	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
guests	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
continually	NULL
going	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
opened	NULL
and	NULL
shut	NULL
each	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
parlour	NULL
fell	NULL
full	NULL
upon	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

Two	NULL
men	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
had	NULL
stared	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
surprise	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
fancied	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
Trantridge	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
that	NULL
village	NULL
lay	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
miles	NULL
off	NULL
that	NULL
Trantridge	NULL
folk	NULL
were	NULL
rarities	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
A	NULL
comely	NULL
maid	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
True	NULL
,	NULL
comely	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
unless	NULL
I	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
great	NULL
mistake	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
And	NULL
he	NULL
negatived	NULL
the	NULL
remainder	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
definition	NULL
forthwith	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
returned	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
stable-yard	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
confronting	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
threshold	NULL
,	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
shrinking	NULL
of	NULL
Tess	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
insult	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
stung	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
quick	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
considered	NULL
anything	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
he	NULL
struck	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
chin	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
full	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fist	NULL
,	NULL
sending	NULL
him	NULL
staggering	NULL
backwards	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
passage	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
man	NULL
recovered	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seemed	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Clare	NULL
,	NULL
stepping	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
himself	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
posture	NULL
of	NULL
defence	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
his	NULL
opponent	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
better	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
anew	NULL
at	NULL
Tess	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
passed	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
Clare	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
beg	NULL
pardon	NULL
,	NULL
sir	NULL
;	NULL
't	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
complete	NULL
mistake	NULL

I	NULL
thought	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
another	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
forty	NULL
miles	NULL
from	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Clare	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
then	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
too	NULL
hasty	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
moreover	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
blame	NULL
for	NULL
leaving	NULL
her	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
inn-passage	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
usually	NULL
did	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
cases	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
five	NULL
shillings	NULL
to	NULL
plaster	NULL
the	NULL
blow	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
they	NULL
parted	NULL
,	NULL
bidding	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
a	NULL
pacific	NULL
good	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
Clare	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
the	NULL
reins	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
ostler	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
couple	NULL
had	NULL
driven	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
men	NULL
went	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
direction	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
mistake	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Not	NULL
a	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
hurt	NULL
the	NULL
gentleman	NULL
's	NULL
feelings	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
I.	NULL
"	NULL
In	NULL
the	NULL
meantime	NULL
the	NULL
lovers	NULL
were	NULL
driving	NULL
onward	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Could	NULL
we	NULL
put	NULL
off	NULL
our	NULL
wedding	NULL
till	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
later	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Tess	NULL
asked	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dry	NULL
dull	NULL
voice	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
mean	NULL
if	NULL
we	NULL
wished	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
love	NULL

Calm	NULL
yourself	NULL
.	NULL

Do	NULL
you	NULL
mean	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
fellow	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
summon	NULL
me	NULL
for	NULL
assault	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
good-humouredly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
only	NULL
meant	NULL
--	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
put	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

What	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
very	NULL
clear	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
directed	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
dismiss	NULL
such	NULL
fancies	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
obediently	NULL
did	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
grave	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
grave	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
home	NULL
;	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
We	NULL
shall	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
long	NULL
distance	NULL
,	NULL
hundreds	NULL
of	NULL
miles	NULL
from	NULL
these	NULL
parts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
can	NULL
never	NULL
happen	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
ghost	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
reach	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
parted	NULL
tenderly	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
landing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Clare	NULL
ascended	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
attic	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
sat	NULL
up	NULL
getting	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
little	NULL
requisites	NULL
,	NULL
lest	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
remaining	NULL
days	NULL
should	NULL
not	NULL
afford	NULL
sufficient	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
noise	NULL
in	NULL
Angel	NULL
's	NULL
room	NULL
overhead	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
thumping	NULL
and	NULL
struggling	NULL
.	NULL

Everybody	NULL
else	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
was	NULL
asleep	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
anxiety	NULL
lest	NULL
Clare	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
ill	NULL
she	NULL
ran	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
knocked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
asked	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
,	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
dear	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
from	NULL
within	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
so	NULL
sorry	NULL
I	NULL
disturbed	NULL
you	NULL
!	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
reason	NULL
is	NULL
rather	NULL
an	NULL
amusing	NULL
one	NULL
:	NULL
I	NULL
fell	NULL
asleep	NULL
and	NULL
dreamt	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
fighting	NULL
that	NULL
fellow	NULL
again	NULL
who	NULL
insulted	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
noise	NULL
you	NULL
heard	NULL
was	NULL
my	NULL
pummelling	NULL
away	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
fists	NULL
at	NULL
my	NULL
portmanteau	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
I	NULL
pulled	NULL
out	NULL
to-day	NULL
for	NULL
packing	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
am	NULL
occasionally	NULL
liable	NULL
to	NULL
these	NULL
freaks	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
sleep	NULL
.	NULL

Go	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
and	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
drachm	NULL
required	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
the	NULL
scale	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
indecision	NULL
.	NULL

Declare	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
word	NULL
of	NULL
mouth	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
another	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
wrote	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
four	NULL
pages	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
note-sheet	NULL
a	NULL
succinct	NULL
narrative	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
events	NULL
of	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
an	NULL
envelope	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
directed	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
Clare	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
lest	NULL
the	NULL
flesh	NULL
should	NULL
again	NULL
be	NULL
weak	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
crept	NULL
upstairs	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
shoes	NULL
and	NULL
slipped	NULL
the	NULL
note	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
night	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
broken	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
well	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
listened	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
faint	NULL
noise	NULL
overhead	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
descended	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
descended	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
met	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Surely	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
warmly	NULL
as	NULL
ever	NULL
!	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
disturbed	NULL
and	NULL
worn	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
revelation	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
alone	NULL
.	NULL

Could	NULL
he	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

Unless	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
say	NULL
nothing	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
evident	NULL
that	NULL
whatever	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
frank	NULL
and	NULL
affectionate	NULL
as	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

Could	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
doubts	NULL
were	NULL
childish	NULL
?	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL
forgave	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
smiled	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
disquiet	NULL
as	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
foolish	NULL
nightmare	NULL
?	NULL

Had	NULL
he	NULL
really	NULL
received	NULL
her	NULL
note	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
glanced	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
forgave	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
received	NULL
it	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
enthusiastic	NULL
trust	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
surely	NULL
would	NULL
forgive	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
morning	NULL
and	NULL
night	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
New	NULL
Year	NULL
's	NULL
Eve	NULL
broke	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
wedding	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lovers	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
rise	NULL
at	NULL
milking-time	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
last	NULL
week	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
sojourn	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
dairy	NULL
been	NULL
accorded	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
of	NULL
guests	NULL
,	NULL
Tess	NULL
being	NULL
honoured	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
room	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
arrived	NULL
downstairs	NULL
at	NULL
breakfast-time	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
surprised	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
effects	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
produced	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
kitchen	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
glory	NULL
since	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
last	NULL
beheld	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
some	NULL
unnatural	NULL
hour	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
the	NULL
dairyman	NULL
had	NULL
caused	NULL
the	NULL
yawning	NULL
chimney-corner	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
whitened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
brick	NULL
hearth	NULL
reddened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
blazing	NULL
yellow	NULL
damask	NULL
blower	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
hung	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
arch	NULL
in	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
grimy	NULL
blue	NULL
cotton	NULL
one	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
sprig	NULL
pattern	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
formerly	NULL
done	NULL
duty	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
renovated	NULL
aspect	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
focus	NULL
indeed	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
full	NULL
winter	NULL
morning	NULL
threw	NULL
a	NULL
smiling	NULL
demeanour	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
apartment	NULL

the	NULL

Tess	NULL
's	NULL
friends	NULL
lived	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
off	NULL
that	NULL
none	NULL
could	NULL
conveniently	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
present	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
ceremony	NULL

even	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL

asked	NULL

as	NULL
a	NULL

nobody	NULL
was	NULL
invited	NULL
from	NULL
Marlott	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
for	NULL
Angel	NULL
's	NULL
family	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
and	NULL
duly	NULL
informed	NULL
them	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL

assured	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL

of	NULL
them	NULL
there	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL

His	NULL
brothers	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
replied	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL

seeming	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
indignant	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
while	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL

mother	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
a	NULL
rather	NULL
sad	NULL
letter	NULL

deploring	NULL
his	NULL
precipitancy	NULL
in	NULL
rushing	NULL

making	NULL
the	NULL

This	NULL

distressed	NULL
Clare	NULL
less	NULL

it	NULL

produce	NULL
Tess	NULL

fresh	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
dairy	NULL

as	NULL
a	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL

a	NULL
lady	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
to	NULL

temerarious	NULL

concealed	NULL
her	NULL

familiarized	NULL

worldly	NULL
ways	NULL

months	NULL

triumphantly	NULL

her	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
pretty	NULL
lover	NULL
's	NULL

if	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
lineage	NULL
had	NULL
more	NULL
value	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL
than	NULL
for	NULL
anybody	NULL
in	NULL

Her	NULL
perception	NULL
that	NULL

towards	NULL
her	NULL
still	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
no	NULL

communication	NULL
rendered	NULL
Tess	NULL
guiltily	NULL
doubtful	NULL
if	NULL

could	NULL
have	NULL
received	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
rose	NULL
from	NULL
breakfast	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hastened	NULL
upstairs	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
once	NULL
more	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
queer	NULL
gaunt	NULL
room	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
Clare	NULL
's	NULL
den	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
eyrie	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
climbing	NULL
the	NULL
ladder	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
apartment	NULL
,	NULL
regarding	NULL
and	NULL
pondering	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
stooped	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
threshold	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
doorway	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
pushed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
note	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
earlier	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
excitement	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
carpet	NULL
reached	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sill	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
carpet	NULL
she	NULL
discerned	NULL
the	NULL
faint	NULL
white	NULL
margin	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
envelope	NULL
containing	NULL
her	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
obviously	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL

,	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
having	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
haste	NULL
thrust	NULL
it	NULL
beneath	NULL
the	NULL
carpet	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
beneath	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
feeling	NULL
of	NULL
faintness	NULL
she	NULL
withdrew	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
--	NULL
sealed	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL

The	NULL
mountain	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
been	NULL
removed	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL

it	NULL
now	NULL

the	NULL
house	NULL

full	NULL

The	NULL

jumped	NULL
at	NULL

The	NULL

no	NULL

Those	NULL

Afternoon	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
for	NULL
departure	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
decided	NULL
to	NULL
fulfil	NULL
the	NULL
plan	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
lodgings	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
farmhouse	NULL
near	NULL
Wellbridge	NULL
Mill	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
reside	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
investigation	NULL
of	NULL
flour	NULL
processes	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
two	NULL
o'clock	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
but	NULL
to	NULL
start	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
servantry	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dairy	NULL
were	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
red-brick	NULL
entry	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
dairyman	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
following	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
three	NULL
chamber-mates	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
row	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
,	NULL
pensively	NULL
inclining	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
much	NULL
questioned	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
appear	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
parting	NULL
moment	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
stoical	NULL
and	NULL
staunch	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
why	NULL
the	NULL
delicate	NULL
Retty	NULL
looked	NULL
so	NULL
fragile	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Izz	NULL
so	NULL
tragically	NULL
sorrowful	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Marian	NULL
so	NULL
blank	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
forgot	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
dogging	NULL
shadow	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
in	NULL
contemplating	NULL
theirs	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
impulsively	NULL
whispered	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Will	NULL
you	NULL
kiss	NULL
'em	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
poor	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
and	NULL
last	NULL
time	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Clare	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
objection	NULL
to	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
farewell	NULL
formality	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
passed	NULL
them	NULL
he	NULL
kissed	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
succession	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
stood	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
"	NULL
Goodbye	NULL
"	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
Tess	NULL
femininely	NULL
glanced	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
discern	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
kiss	NULL
of	NULL
charity	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
triumph	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
glance	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
there	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
disappeared	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
how	NULL
moved	NULL
the	NULL
girls	NULL
all	NULL
were	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
kiss	NULL
had	NULL
obviously	NULL
done	NULL
harm	NULL
by	NULL
awakening	NULL
feelings	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
subdue	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
Clare	NULL
was	NULL
unconscious	NULL
.	NULL

Passing	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
wicket-gate	NULL
he	NULL
shook	NULL
hands	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
dairyman	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
expressed	NULL
his	NULL
last	NULL
thanks	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
attentions	NULL
;	NULL
after	NULL
which	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
silence	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
moved	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
interrupted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
crowing	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cock	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
white	NULL
one	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
rose	NULL
comb	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
and	NULL
settled	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
palings	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
yards	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
notes	NULL
thrilled	NULL
their	NULL
ears	NULL
through	NULL
,	NULL
dwindling	NULL
away	NULL
like	NULL
echoes	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
valley	NULL
of	NULL
rocks	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Crick	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
An	NULL
afternoon	NULL
crow	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

Two	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
standing	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
yard	NULL
gate	NULL
,	NULL
holding	NULL
it	NULL
open	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
's	NULL
bad	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
one	NULL
murmured	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
thinking	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
heard	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
group	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door-wicket	NULL

The	NULL
cock	NULL
crew	NULL
again	NULL
--	NULL
straight	NULL
towards	NULL
Clare	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL
dairyman	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL

off	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL
dairyman	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
irritation	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bird	NULL
and	NULL
driving	NULL
him	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
indoors	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Now	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL

that	NULL
just	NULL
to-day	NULL

I	NULL
've	NULL
not	NULL
heard	NULL

an	NULL
afternoon	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
afore	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
only	NULL
means	NULL

change	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
not	NULL
what	NULL
you	NULL
think	NULL
:	NULL
't	NULL
is	NULL
impossible	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

XXXIV	NULL
They	NULL
drove	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
level	NULL
road	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
valley	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
distance	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
miles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
reaching	NULL
Wellbridge	NULL
,	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
Elizabethan	NULL
bridge	NULL
which	NULL
gives	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
half	NULL
its	NULL
name	NULL
.	NULL

Immediately	NULL
behind	NULL
it	NULL
stood	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
wherein	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
engaged	NULL
lodgings	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
exterior	NULL
features	NULL
are	NULL
so	NULL
well	NULL
known	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
travellers	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
Froom	NULL
Valley	NULL
;	NULL
once	NULL
portion	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
manorial	NULL
residence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
property	NULL
and	NULL
seat	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
since	NULL
its	NULL
partial	NULL
demolition	NULL
a	NULL
farmhouse	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Welcome	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
your	NULL
ancestral	NULL
mansions	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
Clare	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
handed	NULL
her	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
regretted	NULL
the	NULL
pleasantry	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
near	NULL
a	NULL
satire	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
entering	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
only	NULL
engaged	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
rooms	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
farmer	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
proposed	NULL
presence	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
coming	NULL
days	NULL
to	NULL
pay	NULL
a	NULL
New	NULL
Year	NULL
's	NULL
visit	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
neighbouring	NULL
cottage	NULL
to	NULL
minister	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
few	NULL
wants	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
absoluteness	NULL
of	NULL
possession	NULL
pleased	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
realized	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
experience	NULL
under	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
exclusive	NULL
roof-tree	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
mouldy	NULL
old	NULL
habitation	NULL
somewhat	NULL
depressed	NULL
his	NULL
bride	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
they	NULL
ascended	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
to	NULL
wash	NULL
their	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
charwoman	NULL
showing	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
landing	NULL
Tess	NULL
stopped	NULL
and	NULL
started	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
's	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
he	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Those	NULL
horrid	NULL
women	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
answered	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
smile	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
How	NULL
they	NULL
frightened	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perceived	NULL
two	NULL
life-size	NULL
portraits	NULL
on	NULL
panels	NULL
built	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
masonry	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
all	NULL
visitors	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
mansion	NULL
are	NULL
aware	NULL
,	NULL
these	NULL
paintings	NULL
represent	NULL
women	NULL
of	NULL
middle	NULL
age	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
date	NULL
some	NULL
two	NULL
hundred	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
lineaments	NULL
once	NULL
seen	NULL
can	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
forgotten	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
long	NULL
pointed	NULL
features	NULL
,	NULL
narrow	NULL
eye	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
smirk	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
suggestive	NULL
of	NULL
merciless	NULL
treachery	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
bill-hook	NULL
nose	NULL
,	NULL
large	NULL
teeth	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
bold	NULL
eye	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

suggesting	NULL
arrogance	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
ferocity	NULL
,	NULL
haunt	NULL
the	NULL
beholder	NULL
afterwards	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
dreams	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Whose	NULL
portraits	NULL
are	NULL
those	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Clare	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
charwoman	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
told	NULL
by	NULL
old	NULL
folk	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
ladies	NULL

d'Urberville	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
ancient	NULL
lords	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
manor	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL
Owing	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
being	NULL
builded	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
unpleasantness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
addition	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
effect	NULL
upon	NULL
Tess	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
fine	NULL
features	NULL
were	NULL
unquestionably	NULL
traceable	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
exaggerated	NULL
forms	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
regretting	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
choose	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
bridal	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
adjoining	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
place	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
rather	NULL
hastily	NULL
prepared	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
washed	NULL
their	NULL
hands	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
basin	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
touched	NULL
hers	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Which	NULL
are	NULL
my	NULL
fingers	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
are	NULL
yours	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL

much	NULL
mixed	NULL

"	NULL
They	NULL

said	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
very	NULL
prettily	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
endeavoured	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
gayer	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
displeased	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
thoughtfulness	NULL
on	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
occasion	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
every	NULL
sensible	NULL
woman	NULL
would	NULL
show	NULL

but	NULL
Tess	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
thoughtful	NULL
to	NULL
excess	NULL

and	NULL
struggled	NULL
against	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sun	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
low	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
short	NULL
last	NULL
afternoon	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
shone	NULL
in	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
opening	NULL
and	NULL
formed	NULL
a	NULL
golden	NULL
staff	NULL
which	NULL
stretched	NULL
across	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
skirt	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
it	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
spot	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
paint-mark	NULL
set	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
ancient	NULL
parlour	NULL
to	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
here	NULL
they	NULL
shared	NULL
their	NULL
first	NULL

meal	NULL
alone	NULL

Such	NULL
was	NULL
their	NULL
childishness	NULL

his	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL

it	NULL

herself	NULL

wondered	NULL
a	NULL

undid	NULL

her	NULL
eyes	NULL
sparkled	NULL
for	NULL

Clare	NULL

said	NULL
he	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
into	NULL

nothing	NULL

for	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL

They	NULL
gleamed	NULL
somewhat	NULL
ironically	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yet	NULL
why	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL

a	NULL
question	NULL

vanity	NULL
throughout	NULL

if	NULL

whom	NULL

better	NULL

he	NULL

something	NULL

I	NULL

home	NULL

I	NULL

pressed	NULL
his	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
again	NULL

Their	NULL

were	NULL
still	NULL
joined	NULL

The	NULL
ashes	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL

were	NULL
lit	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
vertically	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL

Imagination	NULL

this	NULL

A	NULL

upon	NULL

She	NULL
bent	NULL

at	NULL

her	NULL

PHASE	NULL
THE	NULL
FOURTH	NULL
Phase	NULL
the	NULL
Fifth	NULL

The	NULL
Woman	NULL

Her	NULL
narrative	NULL
ended	NULL

even	NULL
its	NULL

Tess	NULL
's	NULL
voice	NULL
throughout	NULL
had	NULL
hardly	NULL
risen	NULL
higher	NULL
than	NULL
its	NULL
opening	NULL
tone	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
no	NULL
exculpatory	NULL
phrase	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
kind	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
wept	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
complexion	NULL
even	NULL
of	NULL
external	NULL
things	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
suffer	NULL
transmutation	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
announcement	NULL
progressed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fire	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
grate	NULL
looked	NULL
impish	NULL
--	NULL
demoniacally	NULL
funny	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
strait	NULL

The	NULL
fender	NULL
grinned	NULL
idly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
too	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
light	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
water-bottle	NULL
was	NULL
merely	NULL
engaged	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
chromatic	NULL
problem	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
material	NULL
objects	NULL
around	NULL
announced	NULL
their	NULL
irresponsibility	NULL
with	NULL
terrible	NULL
iteration	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
nothing	NULL
had	NULL
changed	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
moments	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
kissing	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
or	NULL
rather	NULL
,	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
substance	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
essence	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
had	NULL
changed	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
ceased	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
auricular	NULL
impressions	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
previous	NULL
endearments	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
hustle	NULL
away	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
brains	NULL
,	NULL
repeating	NULL
themselves	NULL
as	NULL
echoes	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
supremely	NULL
purblind	NULL
foolishness	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
performed	NULL
the	NULL
irrelevant	NULL
act	NULL
of	NULL
stirring	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
intelligence	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
even	NULL
yet	NULL
got	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
stirring	NULL
the	NULL
embers	NULL
he	NULL
rose	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
feet	NULL
;	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
force	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
disclosure	NULL
had	NULL
imparted	NULL
itself	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
face	NULL
had	NULL
withered	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
strenuousness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
concentration	NULL
he	NULL
treadled	NULL
fitfully	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
contrivance	NULL

think	NULL
closely	NULL
enough	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
meaning	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
vague	NULL
movement	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
spoke	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
inadequate	NULL
,	NULL
commonplace	NULL
voice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
many	NULL

tones	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL

she	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
yet	NULL

"	NULL
He	NULL
looked	NULL
vacantly	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

to	NULL
resume	NULL
with	NULL
dazed	NULL
senses	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL

These	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
were	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
perfunctory	NULL
babble	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
surface	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
depths	NULL
remained	NULL
paralyzed	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
bent	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
chair	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
followed	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL

and	NULL
stood	NULL
there	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
eyes	NULL
that	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
weep	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
she	NULL
slid	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
knees	NULL
beside	NULL
his	NULL
foot	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
position	NULL
she	NULL
crouched	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
heap	NULL

"	NULL

she	NULL
whispered	NULL

mouth	NULL

And	NULL

as	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
again	NULL

paused	NULL

then	NULL
suddenly	NULL
broke	NULL
into	NULL
horrible	NULL

who	NULL

"	NULL
Another	NULL

your	NULL

She	NULL
perceived	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
the	NULL
realization	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
apprehensive	NULL
foreboding	NULL
in	NULL
former	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
species	NULL

imposter	NULL

a	NULL
guilty	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
guise	NULL
of	NULL

Terror	NULL
was	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
white	NULL
face	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
cheek	NULL
was	NULL
flaccid	NULL

and	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
had	NULL
almost	NULL
the	NULL
aspect	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
round	NULL
little	NULL
hole	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
horrible	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
deadened	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
staggered	NULL

and	NULL
he	NULL
stepped	NULL
forward	NULL

thinking	NULL

down	NULL

The	NULL
image	NULL

her	NULL

take	NULL
pity	NULL
upon	NULL
herself	NULL

quietly	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL

in	NULL

her	NULL
she	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL

putting	NULL
out	NULL

candles	NULL

The	NULL
rain	NULL

over	NULL

the	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
soon	NULL
close	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
heels	NULL

without	NULL
purpose	NULL

His	NULL
form	NULL
beside	NULL
her	NULL
light	NULL

figure	NULL
looked	NULL
black	NULL

sinister	NULL

forbidding	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
as	NULL
sarcasm	NULL
the	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
jewels	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
momentarily	NULL
so	NULL
proud	NULL

Clare	NULL
turned	NULL
at	NULL
hearing	NULL
her	NULL
footsteps	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
recognition	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
presence	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
no	NULL
difference	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
five	NULL
yawning	NULL
arches	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
bridge	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
cow	NULL
and	NULL
horse	NULL
tracks	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
were	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
water	NULL

the	NULL
rain	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
charge	NULL
them	NULL

not	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
wash	NULL
them	NULL
away	NULL

Across	NULL
these	NULL

the	NULL
reflected	NULL

flitted	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL

the	NULL

open	NULL

she	NULL
kept	NULL
easily	NULL
in	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL

Away	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL

road	NULL
wound	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
meads	NULL

along	NULL

Clare	NULL
without	NULL

up	NULL

him	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL

however	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
listless	NULL
walk	NULL
brought	NULL
her	NULL
up	NULL
alongside	NULL
him	NULL

still	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL

The	NULL

it	NULL

The	NULL

taken	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
all	NULL
tendency	NULL

knew	NULL

He	NULL

her	NULL

Returning	NULL

he	NULL
passed	NULL
them	NULL
again	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
field	NULL
,	NULL
progressing	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
slowly	NULL
,	NULL

as	NULL
regardless	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cheerless	NULL
night	NULL
as	NULL
before	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
preoccupation	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
affairs	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
illness	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
house	NULL

that	NULL
he	NULL

not	NULL
bear	NULL
in	NULL
mind	NULL
the	NULL
curious	NULL
incident	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
recalled	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
while	NULL
after	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
interval	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cottager	NULL
's	NULL
going	NULL

coming	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL

how	NULL

nonsense	NULL

this	NULL
kind	NULL

rather	NULL
one	NULL

do	NULL
n't	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
understand	NULL
the	NULL
quality	NULL

the	NULL
mishap	NULL

It	NULL

Please	NULL

the	NULL

bed	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL

said	NULL
she	NULL
dutifully	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
rambled	NULL
round	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
road	NULL
which	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
well-known	NULL
ruins	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Cistercian	NULL
abbey	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
mill	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL
having	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
centuries	NULL
past	NULL
,	NULL
been	NULL
attached	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
monastic	NULL
establishment	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
mill	NULL
still	NULL
worked	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
food	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
perennial	NULL
necessity	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
abbey	NULL
had	NULL
perished	NULL
,	NULL
creeds	NULL
being	NULL
transient	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
continually	NULL
sees	NULL
the	NULL
ministration	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
temporary	NULL
outlasting	NULL
the	NULL
ministration	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
eternal	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
walk	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
circuitous	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
still	NULL
not	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
obeying	NULL
his	NULL
direction	NULL
she	NULL
only	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
reach	NULL
the	NULL
large	NULL
stone	NULL
bridge	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
main	NULL
river	NULL
and	NULL
follow	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
yards	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
everything	NULL
remained	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
being	NULL
still	NULL
burning	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
stay	NULL
downstairs	NULL
for	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
proceeded	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
chamber	NULL
,	NULL
whither	NULL
the	NULL
luggage	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
taken	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
she	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
blankly	NULL
around	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
undress	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
removing	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
bedstead	NULL
its	NULL
rays	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
tester	NULL
of	NULL
white	NULL
dimity	NULL
;	NULL
something	NULL
was	NULL
hanging	NULL
beneath	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
lifted	NULL
the	NULL
candle	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
what	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
bough	NULL
of	NULL
mistletoe	NULL
.	NULL

Angel	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
there	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
instant	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
explanation	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
mysterious	NULL
parcel	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
pack	NULL
and	NULL
bring	NULL
;	NULL
whose	NULL
contents	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
explain	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
would	NULL
soon	NULL
show	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
purpose	NULL
thereof	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
his	NULL
zest	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
gaiety	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
hung	NULL
it	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
foolish	NULL
and	NULL
inopportune	NULL
that	NULL
mistletoe	NULL
looked	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
fear	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
scarce	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
hope	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
relent	NULL
there	NULL
seemed	NULL
no	NULL
promise	NULL
whatever	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL
dully	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
sorrow	NULL
ceases	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
speculative	NULL
,	NULL
sleep	NULL
sees	NULL
her	NULL
opportunity	NULL
.	NULL

Among	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL
happier	NULL
moods	NULL
which	NULL
forbid	NULL
repose	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
mood	NULL
which	NULL
welcomed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
the	NULL
lonely	NULL
Tess	NULL
forgot	NULL
existence	NULL
,	NULL
surrounded	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
aromatic	NULL
stillness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chamber	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
possibly	NULL
,	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
bride-chamber	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
ancestry	NULL
.	NULL

Later	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
Clare	NULL
also	NULL
retraced	NULL
his	NULL
steps	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

Entering	NULL
softly	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
he	NULL
obtained	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
considered	NULL
his	NULL
course	NULL
he	NULL
spread	NULL
his	NULL
rugs	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
horse-hair	NULL
sofa	NULL
which	NULL
stood	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
roughly	NULL
shaped	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
sleeping-couch	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
lying	NULL
down	NULL
he	NULL
crept	NULL
shoeless	NULL
upstairs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
listened	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
apartment	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
measured	NULL
breathing	NULL
told	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sleeping	NULL
profoundly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Thank	NULL
God	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

murmured	NULL
Clare	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
pang	NULL
of	NULL
bitterness	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
thought	NULL
--	NULL
approximately	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
not	NULL
wholly	NULL
so	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
having	NULL
shifted	NULL
the	NULL
burden	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
reposing	NULL
without	NULL
care	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
to	NULL
descend	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
irresolute	NULL
,	NULL
faced	NULL
round	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
door	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
act	NULL
he	NULL
caught	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
dames	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
portrait	NULL
was	NULL
immediately	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
entrance	NULL
to	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
bedchamber	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
candlelight	NULL
the	NULL
painting	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
unpleasant	NULL
.	NULL

Sinister	NULL
design	NULL
lurked	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
features	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
concentrated	NULL
purpose	NULL
of	NULL
revenge	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
sex	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Caroline	NULL
bodice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
portrait	NULL
was	NULL
low	NULL
--	NULL
precisely	NULL
as	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
tucked	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
to	NULL
show	NULL
the	NULL
necklace	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
he	NULL
experienced	NULL
the	NULL
distressing	NULL
sensation	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
resemblance	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
check	NULL
was	NULL
sufficient	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
resumed	NULL
his	NULL
retreat	NULL
and	NULL
descended	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
air	NULL
remained	NULL
calm	NULL
and	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
small	NULL
compressed	NULL
mouth	NULL
indexing	NULL
his	NULL
powers	NULL
of	NULL
self-control	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
wearing	NULL
still	NULL
that	NULL
terrible	NULL
sterile	NULL
expression	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
spread	NULL
thereon	NULL
since	NULL
her	NULL
disclosure	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
passion	NULL
's	NULL
slave	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
who	NULL
found	NULL
no	NULL
advantage	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
enfranchisement	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
simply	NULL
regarding	NULL
the	NULL
harrowing	NULL
contingencies	NULL
of	NULL
human	NULL
experience	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
unexpectedness	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

Nothing	NULL
so	NULL
pure	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
sweet	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
virginal	NULL
as	NULL
Tess	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
possible	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
while	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
adored	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
ago	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
The	NULL
little	NULL
less	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
worlds	NULL
away	NULL
!	NULL

He	NULL
argued	NULL
erroneously	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
indexed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
honest	NULL
freshness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Tess	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
advocate	NULL
to	NULL
set	NULL
him	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

Could	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
continued	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
eyes	NULL
which	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
gazed	NULL
never	NULL
expressed	NULL
any	NULL
divergence	NULL
from	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
tongue	NULL
was	NULL
telling	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
yet	NULL
ever	NULL
seeing	NULL
another	NULL
world	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
ostensible	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
discordant	NULL
and	NULL
contrasting	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
reclined	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
couch	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
extinguished	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
night	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL
its	NULL
place	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
unconcerned	NULL
and	NULL
indifferent	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
swallowed	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
happiness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
digesting	NULL
it	NULL
listlessly	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
ready	NULL
to	NULL
swallow	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
happiness	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
thousand	NULL
other	NULL
people	NULL
with	NULL
as	NULL
little	NULL
disturbance	NULL
or	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
mien	NULL
.	NULL

XXXVI	NULL
Clare	NULL
arose	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
dawn	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
ashy	NULL
and	NULL
furtive	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
associated	NULL
with	NULL
crime	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fireplace	NULL
confronted	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
extinct	NULL
embers	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
spread	NULL
supper-table	NULL
,	NULL
whereon	NULL
stood	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
full	NULL
glasses	NULL
of	NULL
untasted	NULL
wine	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
flat	NULL
and	NULL
filmy	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
vacated	NULL
seat	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
articles	NULL
of	NULL
furniture	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
eternal	NULL
look	NULL
of	NULL
not	NULL
being	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
help	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
intolerable	NULL
inquiry	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
?	NULL

From	NULL
above	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
sound	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
knock	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
neighbouring	NULL
cottager	NULL
's	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
minister	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
wants	NULL
while	NULL
they	NULL
remained	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
third	NULL
person	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
extremely	NULL
awkward	NULL
just	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
already	NULL
dressed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
and	NULL
informed	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
manage	NULL
to	NULL
shift	NULL
for	NULL
themselves	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
milk-can	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
dame	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
away	NULL
he	NULL
searched	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
quarters	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
for	NULL
fuel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
speedily	NULL
lit	NULL
a	NULL
fire	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
eggs	NULL
,	NULL
butter	NULL
,	NULL
bread	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
so	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
larder	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Clare	NULL
soon	NULL
had	NULL
breakfast	NULL
laid	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
experiences	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
dairy	NULL
having	NULL
rendered	NULL
him	NULL
facile	NULL
in	NULL
domestic	NULL
preparations	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
smoke	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kindled	NULL
wood	NULL
rose	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
chimney	NULL
without	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
lotus-headed	NULL
column	NULL
;	NULL
local	NULL
people	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
passing	NULL
by	NULL
saw	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
newly-married	NULL
couple	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
envied	NULL
their	NULL
happiness	NULL
.	NULL

Angel	NULL
cast	NULL
a	NULL
final	NULL
glance	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
foot	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
,	NULL
called	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
conventional	NULL
voice	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Breakfast	NULL
is	NULL
ready	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
steps	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
air	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
space	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
mechanically	NULL
readjusting	NULL
the	NULL
breakfast	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
fully	NULL
attired	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
interval	NULL
since	NULL
his	NULL
calling	NULL
her	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
but	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
minutes	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
dressed	NULL
or	NULL
nearly	NULL
so	NULL
before	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
summon	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
twisted	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
round	NULL
mass	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
frocks	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
pale	NULL
blue	NULL
woollen	NULL
garment	NULL
with	NULL
neck-frillings	NULL
of	NULL
white	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
hands	NULL
and	NULL
face	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
possibly	NULL
been	NULL
sitting	NULL
dressed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
bedroom	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
fire	NULL

The	NULL
marked	NULL
civility	NULL
of	NULL
Clare	NULL
's	NULL
tone	NULL
in	NULL
calling	NULL
her	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
inspired	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
glimmer	NULL
of	NULL
hope	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
soon	NULL
died	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pair	NULL
were	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
ashes	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
former	NULL
fires	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
the	NULL
hot	NULL
sorrow	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
previous	NULL
night	NULL
had	NULL
succeeded	NULL
heaviness	NULL

it	NULL
seemed	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
nothing	NULL
could	NULL
kindle	NULL
either	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
fervour	NULL

sensation	NULL
any	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
gently	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
replied	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
like	NULL
undemonstrativeness	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
sharply-defined	NULL
face	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

paused	NULL
,	NULL
touching	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
fingers	NULL
lightly	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL

as	NULL
though	NULL

hardly	NULL

there	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
flesh	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
once	NULL
her	NULL
lover	NULL

Her	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
bright	NULL

her	NULL
pale	NULL
cheek	NULL
still	NULL
showed	NULL
its	NULL

roundness	NULL

though	NULL
half-dried	NULL
tears	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
glistening	NULL
traces	NULL

the	NULL
usually	NULL
ripe	NULL
red	NULL

was	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
pale	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
cheek	NULL

Throbbingly	NULL
alive	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
stress	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mental	NULL
grief	NULL
the	NULL
life	NULL
beat	NULL
so	NULL
brokenly	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
further	NULL
pull	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
cause	NULL
real	NULL
illness	NULL

dull	NULL
her	NULL

her	NULL

She	NULL
looked	NULL
absolutely	NULL
pure	NULL
.	NULL

Nature	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL
fantastic	NULL
trickery	NULL

had	NULL
set	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
seal	NULL
of	NULL
maidenhood	NULL
upon	NULL
Tess	NULL

looked	NULL
at	NULL

imploringly	NULL

again	NULL

Breakfast	NULL
over	NULL

he	NULL
rose	NULL

telling	NULL

the	NULL
hour	NULL

off	NULL

He	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL

again	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
course	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
coming	NULL
home	NULL
at	NULL
dusk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
occupying	NULL
himself	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
papers	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
feared	NULL

was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
woman	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
retired	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
herself	NULL
busy	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
for	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL

Clare	NULL

appeared	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL

She	NULL
raised	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
brightened	NULL
somewhat	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
may	NULL
think	NULL

she	NULL
murmured	NULL

in	NULL
piteous	NULL
raillery	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
hastily	NULL

with	NULL
tears	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
accents	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

She	NULL
broke	NULL
into	NULL
sobs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
almost	NULL
have	NULL
won	NULL
round	NULL
any	NULL
man	NULL
but	NULL
Angel	NULL
Clare	NULL
.	NULL

Within	NULL
the	NULL
remote	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
constitution	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
gentle	NULL
and	NULL
affectionate	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
lay	NULL
hidden	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
logical	NULL
deposit	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
vein	NULL
of	NULL
metal	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
soft	NULL
loam	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
turned	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
everything	NULL
that	NULL
attempted	NULL
to	NULL
traverse	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
blocked	NULL
his	NULL
acceptance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Church	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
blocked	NULL
his	NULL
acceptance	NULL
of	NULL
Tess	NULL
.	NULL

Moreover	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
affection	NULL
itself	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
fire	NULL
than	NULL
radiance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
regard	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
sex	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
believe	NULL
he	NULL
ceased	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
:	NULL
contrasting	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
with	NULL
many	NULL
impressionable	NULL
natures	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
remain	NULL
sensuously	NULL
infatuated	NULL
with	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
intellectually	NULL

He	NULL
waited	NULL
till	NULL
her	NULL
sobbing	NULL
ceased	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
half	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
in	NULL
England	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
ebullition	NULL
of	NULL
bitterness	NULL
against	NULL
womankind	NULL
in	NULL
general	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
n't	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
respectability	NULL

but	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
principle	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

He	NULL
spoke	NULL
such	NULL
things	NULL
as	NULL
these	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
kindred	NULL
sort	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
still	NULL
swayed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
antipathetic	NULL
wave	NULL
which	NULL
warps	NULL
direct	NULL
souls	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
persistence	NULL
when	NULL
once	NULL
their	NULL
vision	NULL
finds	NULL
itself	NULL
mocked	NULL
by	NULL
appearances	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
underneath	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
back	NULL
current	NULL
of	NULL
sympathy	NULL
through	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
conquered	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Tess	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
everything	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
deserts	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hardly	NULL
opened	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
firmness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
devotion	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
indeed	NULL
almost	NULL
pitiful	NULL
;	NULL
quick-tempered	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
naturally	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
nothing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
say	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
unseemly	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
sought	NULL
not	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
;	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
provoked	NULL
;	NULL
thought	NULL
no	NULL
evil	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
treatment	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
might	NULL
just	NULL
now	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
Apostolic	NULL
Charity	NULL
herself	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
self-seeking	NULL
modern	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
morning	NULL
were	NULL
passed	NULL
precisely	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
preceding	NULL
ones	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
passed	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
occasion	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
formerly	NULL
free	NULL
and	NULL
independent	NULL
Tess	NULL
--	NULL
venture	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
any	NULL
advances	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
occasion	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
starting	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
meal	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
flour-mill	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
"	NULL
Goodbye	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
replied	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
words	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
inclining	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
avail	NULL
himself	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
invitation	NULL
,	NULL
saying	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
hastily	NULL
aside	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
home	NULL
punctually	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Tess	NULL
shrank	NULL
into	NULL
herself	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
struck	NULL
.	NULL

Often	NULL
enough	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
reach	NULL
those	NULL
lips	NULL
against	NULL
her	NULL
consent	NULL
--	NULL
often	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
gaily	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
and	NULL
breath	NULL
tasted	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
butter	NULL
and	NULL
eggs	NULL
and	NULL
milk	NULL
and	NULL
honey	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
mainly	NULL
lived	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
drew	NULL
sustenance	NULL
from	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
follies	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
sort	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
care	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
observed	NULL
her	NULL
sudden	NULL
shrinking	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
gently	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
course	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
imperative	NULL
that	NULL
we	NULL
should	NULL
stay	NULL
together	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
the	NULL
scandal	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
resulted	NULL
from	NULL
our	NULL
immediate	NULL
parting	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
see	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
only	NULL
for	NULL
form	NULL
's	NULL
sake	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
Tess	NULL
absently	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
mill	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wished	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
responded	NULL
yet	NULL
more	NULL
kindly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
once	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
they	NULL
lived	NULL
through	NULL
this	NULL
despairing	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
truly	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
more	NULL
widely	NULL
apart	NULL
than	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
lovers	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
evident	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
living	NULL
with	NULL
paralyzed	NULL
activities	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
endeavour	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
plan	NULL
of	NULL
procedure	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
awe-stricken	NULL
to	NULL
discover	NULL
such	NULL
determination	NULL
under	NULL
such	NULL
apparent	NULL
flexibility	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
consistency	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
cruel	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
expected	NULL
forgiveness	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

More	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
going	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
him	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
absence	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
mill	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
feared	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
benefiting	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
hampering	NULL
and	NULL
humiliating	NULL
him	NULL
yet	NULL
more	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
should	NULL
become	NULL
known	NULL
.	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
Clare	NULL
was	NULL
meditating	NULL
,	NULL
verily	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
thought	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
unsuspended	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
becoming	NULL
ill	NULL
with	NULL
thinking	NULL
;	NULL
eaten	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
thinking	NULL
,	NULL
withered	NULL
by	NULL
thinking	NULL
;	NULL
scourged	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
former	NULL
pulsating	NULL
,	NULL
flexuous	NULL
domesticity	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
walked	NULL
about	NULL
saying	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
What	NULL

and	NULL
by	NULL
chance	NULL
she	NULL
overheard	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
caused	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
break	NULL
the	NULL
reserve	NULL
about	NULL
their	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL

the	NULL
sunk	NULL
corners	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mouth	NULL
betraying	NULL
how	NULL
purely	NULL
mechanical	NULL

centre	NULL

Sheer	NULL
experience	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
taught	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
circumstances	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
lead	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
saved	NULL
from	NULL
leading	NULL
any	NULL
life	NULL
whatever	NULL
.	NULL

Like	NULL
all	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
previsioned	NULL
by	NULL
suffering	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
M.	NULL
Sully-Prudhomme	NULL
,	NULL
hear	NULL
a	NULL
penal	NULL
sentence	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
fiat	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
You	NULL
shall	NULL
be	NULL
born	NULL

"	NULL
particularly	NULL
if	NULL
addressed	NULL
to	NULL
potential	NULL
issue	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
such	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
vulpine	NULL
slyness	NULL
of	NULL
Dame	NULL
Nature	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
Tess	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
hoodwinked	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
love	NULL
for	NULL
Clare	NULL
into	NULL
forgetting	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
result	NULL
in	NULL
vitalizations	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
inflict	NULL
upon	NULL
others	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
bewailed	NULL
as	NULL
misfortune	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
therefore	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
withstand	NULL
his	NULL
argument	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
self-combating	NULL
proclivity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
supersensitive	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
answer	NULL
thereto	NULL
arose	NULL
in	NULL
Clare	NULL
's	NULL
own	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
almost	NULL
feared	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
based	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
exceptional	NULL
physical	NULL
nature	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
used	NULL
it	NULL
promisingly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
added	NULL
besides	NULL

"	NULL
On	NULL
an	NULL
Australian	NULL
upland	NULL

Texan	NULL

care	NULL
about	NULL
my	NULL
misfortunes	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
reproach	NULL
me	NULL
or	NULL
you	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

Yet	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
majority	NULL
of	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
accepted	NULL
the	NULL
momentary	NULL
presentment	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
inevitable	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
she	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
right	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
intuitive	NULL
heart	NULL
of	NULL
woman	NULL
knoweth	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
bitterness	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
its	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
these	NULL
assumed	NULL
reproaches	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
addressed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
by	NULL
strangers	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
reached	NULL
his	NULL
ears	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
fastidious	NULL
brain	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
third	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
estrangement	NULL
.	NULL

Some	NULL
might	NULL
risk	NULL
the	NULL
odd	NULL
paradox	NULL
that	NULL
with	NULL
more	NULL
animalism	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
nobler	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

We	NULL
do	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
Clare	NULL
's	NULL
love	NULL
was	NULL
doubtless	NULL
ethereal	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
fault	NULL
,	NULL
imaginative	NULL
to	NULL
impracticability	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
these	NULL
natures	NULL
,	NULL
corporal	NULL
presence	NULL
is	NULL
something	NULL
less	NULL
appealing	NULL
than	NULL
corporal	NULL
absence	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL
creating	NULL
an	NULL
ideal	NULL
presence	NULL
that	NULL
conveniently	NULL
drops	NULL
the	NULL
defects	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
personality	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
plead	NULL
her	NULL
cause	NULL
so	NULL
forcibly	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
anticipated	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
figurative	NULL
phrase	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
:	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
another	NULL
woman	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
excited	NULL
his	NULL
desire	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

thought	NULL
over	NULL
what	NULL

she	NULL
remarked	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
moving	NULL
her	NULL
forefinger	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
tablecloth	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
other	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
bore	NULL
the	NULL
ring	NULL
that	NULL
mocked	NULL
them	NULL
both	NULL

supporting	NULL
her	NULL
forehead	NULL

It	NULL

what	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

Clare	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL
sure	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
inquired	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Quite	NULL

We	NULL
ought	NULL

part	NULL

and	NULL
we	NULL
may	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
get	NULL
it	NULL
past	NULL
and	NULL
done	NULL

You	NULL
once	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
apt	NULL
to	NULL
win	NULL
men	NULL
against	NULL
their	NULL
better	NULL
judgement	NULL

if	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
constantly	NULL

your	NULL

I	NULL
may	NULL
cause	NULL
you	NULL
to	NULL
change	NULL
your	NULL

opposition	NULL

your	NULL

wish	NULL

afterwards	NULL
your	NULL
repentance	NULL

my	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
you	NULL
would	NULL
like	NULL

he	NULL
asked	NULL

I	NULL

"	NULL
Then	NULL
it	NULL

"	NULL

Though	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
look	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
started	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
proposition	NULL

the	NULL
covenant	NULL

she	NULL

she	NULL

Tess	NULL
stole	NULL
a	NULL
glance	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
pale	NULL

,	NULL
as	NULL

she	NULL

Propensities	NULL

as	NULL

He	NULL

That	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
pack	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
upstairs	NULL
and	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
pack	NULL
also	NULL

Both	NULL
knew	NULL

XXXVII	NULL
Midnight	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
silently	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
announce	NULL
it	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
Valley	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Froom	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
long	NULL
after	NULL
one	NULL
o'clock	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
creak	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkened	NULL
farmhouse	NULL
once	NULL
the	NULL
mansion	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
d'Urbervilles	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
used	NULL
the	NULL
upper	NULL
chamber	NULL
,	NULL
heard	NULL
it	NULL
and	NULL
awoke	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
step	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
staircase	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
loosely	NULL
nailed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
bedroom	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
figure	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
crossed	NULL
the	NULL
stream	NULL
of	NULL
moonlight	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
curiously	NULL
careful	NULL
tread	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
shirt	NULL
and	NULL
trousers	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
flush	NULL
of	NULL
joy	NULL
died	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
perceived	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
fixed	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
unnatural	NULL
stare	NULL
on	NULL
vacancy	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
he	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
and	NULL
murmured	NULL
in	NULL
tones	NULL
of	NULL
indescribable	NULL
sadness	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Dead	NULL
!	NULL

dead	NULL

dead	NULL

Under	NULL
the	NULL
influence	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
strongly-disturbing	NULL
force	NULL
,	NULL
Clare	NULL
would	NULL
occasionally	NULL
walk	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
sleep	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
perform	NULL
strange	NULL
feats	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
return	NULL
from	NULL
market	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
their	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
re-enacted	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
bedroom	NULL
his	NULL
combat	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
insulted	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
continued	NULL
mental	NULL
distress	NULL
had	NULL
wrought	NULL
him	NULL
into	NULL
that	NULL
somnambulistic	NULL
state	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
loyal	NULL
confidence	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
lay	NULL
so	NULL
deep	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
awake	NULL
or	NULL
asleep	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
inspired	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
personal	NULL
fear	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
entered	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
pistol	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
scarcely	NULL
have	NULL
disturbed	NULL
her	NULL
trust	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
protectiveness	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
came	NULL
close	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
bent	NULL
over	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Dead	NULL
,	NULL
dead	NULL

he	NULL
murmured	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
fixedly	NULL
regarding	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
moments	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
gaze	NULL
of	NULL
unmeasurable	NULL
woe	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
bent	NULL
lower	NULL
,	NULL
enclosed	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rolled	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sheet	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
shroud	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
lifting	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
bed	NULL
with	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
respect	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
show	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
dead	NULL
body	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
carried	NULL
her	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
murmuring	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
endearment	NULL
,	NULL
withheld	NULL
so	NULL
severely	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
waking	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
inexpressibly	NULL
sweet	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
forlorn	NULL
and	NULL
hungry	NULL
heart	NULL

If	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL

would	NULL
not	NULL

put	NULL
an	NULL

found	NULL

Thus	NULL
she	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL

scarcely	NULL
venturing	NULL

breathe	NULL

wondering	NULL
what	NULL

going	NULL

her	NULL

suffered	NULL

paused	NULL

his	NULL

for	NULL
a	NULL

lean	NULL

?	NULL

Self-solicitude	NULL
was	NULL
near	NULL
extinction	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
knowledge	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
planned	NULL
to	NULL
depart	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
morrow	NULL
,	NULL
possibly	NULL
for	NULL
always	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
lay	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
precarious	NULL
position	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
rather	NULL
of	NULL
luxury	NULL
than	NULL
of	NULL
terror	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
fall	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
both	NULL
be	NULL
dashed	NULL
to	NULL
pieces	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
fit	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
desirable	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
fall	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
took	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
support	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
handrail	NULL
to	NULL
imprint	NULL
a	NULL
kiss	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
--	NULL
lips	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
day-time	NULL
scorned	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
clasped	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
renewed	NULL
firmness	NULL
of	NULL
hold	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
descended	NULL
the	NULL
staircase	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
creak	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
loose	NULL
stair	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
awaken	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
ground-floor	NULL
safely	NULL
.	NULL

Freeing	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
hands	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
grasp	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
slid	NULL
back	NULL
the	NULL
door-bar	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
slightly	NULL
striking	NULL
his	NULL
stockinged	NULL
toe	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
this	NULL
he	NULL
seemed	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
room	NULL
for	NULL
extension	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
lifted	NULL
her	NULL
against	NULL
his	NULL
shoulder	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
carry	NULL
her	NULL
with	NULL
ease	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
absence	NULL
of	NULL
clothes	NULL
taking	NULL
much	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
burden	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
he	NULL
bore	NULL
her	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
premises	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
yards	NULL
distant	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
ultimate	NULL
intention	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
any	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
yet	NULL
divined	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
conjecturing	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
third	NULL
person	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
easefully	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
delivered	NULL
her	NULL
whole	NULL
being	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
pleased	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
regarding	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
absolute	NULL
possession	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
dispose	NULL
of	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
choose	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
consoling	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
hovering	NULL
terror	NULL
of	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
's	NULL
separation	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
really	NULL
recognized	NULL
her	NULL
now	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
Tess	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
cast	NULL
her	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
recognition	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
arrogate	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
of	NULL
harming	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Ah	NULL
!	NULL

now	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dreaming	NULL
of	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
Sunday	NULL
morning	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
borne	NULL
her	NULL
along	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
water	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
dairymaids	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
nearly	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
that	NULL
were	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Tess	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
admit	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
cross	NULL
the	NULL
bridge	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
proceeding	NULL
several	NULL
paces	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
side	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
adjoining	NULL
mill	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
brink	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
.	NULL

Its	NULL
waters	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
creeping	NULL
down	NULL
these	NULL
miles	NULL
of	NULL
meadowland	NULL
,	NULL
frequently	NULL
divided	NULL
,	NULL
serpentining	NULL
in	NULL
purposeless	NULL
curves	NULL
,	NULL
looping	NULL
themselves	NULL
around	NULL
little	NULL
islands	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
returning	NULL
and	NULL
re-embodying	NULL
themselves	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
broad	NULL
main	NULL
stream	NULL
further	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Opposite	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
her	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
confluence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
was	NULL
proportionately	NULL
voluminous	NULL
and	NULL
deep	NULL
.	NULL

Across	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
narrow	NULL
foot-bridge	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL
autumn	NULL
flood	NULL
had	NULL
washed	NULL
the	NULL
handrail	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
bare	NULL
plank	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
lying	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
inches	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
speeding	NULL
current	NULL
,	NULL
formed	NULL
a	NULL
giddy	NULL
pathway	NULL
for	NULL
even	NULL
steady	NULL
heads	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
Tess	NULL
had	NULL
noticed	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
day-time	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
walking	NULL
across	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
feat	NULL
in	NULL
balancing	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
husband	NULL
had	NULL
possibly	NULL
observed	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
performance	NULL
;	NULL
anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
now	NULL
mounted	NULL
the	NULL
plank	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
sliding	NULL
one	NULL
foot	NULL
forward	NULL
,	NULL
advanced	NULL
along	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
he	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
drown	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL

Probably	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
spot	NULL
was	NULL
lonely	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
deep	NULL
and	NULL
wide	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
purpose	NULL
easy	NULL
of	NULL
accomplishment	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
might	NULL
drown	NULL
her	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
parting	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
to	NULL
lead	NULL
severed	NULL
lives	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
swift	NULL
stream	NULL
raced	NULL
and	NULL
gyrated	NULL
under	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
tossing	NULL
,	NULL
distorting	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
splitting	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL
's	NULL
reflected	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

Spots	NULL
of	NULL
froth	NULL
travelled	NULL
past	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
intercepted	NULL
weeds	NULL
waved	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
piles	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
both	NULL
fall	NULL
together	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
current	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
arms	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
tightly	NULL
clasped	NULL
together	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
saved	NULL
;	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
almost	NULL
painlessly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
reproach	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
marrying	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
last	NULL
half-hour	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
loving	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
lived	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
awoke	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
day-time	NULL
aversion	NULL
would	NULL
return	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
hour	NULL
would	NULL
remain	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
contemplated	NULL
only	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
transient	NULL
dream	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
impulse	NULL
stirred	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
she	NULL
dared	NULL
not	NULL
indulge	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
a	NULL
movement	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
precipitated	NULL
them	NULL
both	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
gulf	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
she	NULL
valued	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
life	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
proved	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
--	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
right	NULL
to	NULL
tamper	NULL
with	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
safety	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
plantation	NULL
which	NULL
formed	NULL
the	NULL
Abbey	NULL
grounds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
hold	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
onward	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
steps	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
ruined	NULL
choir	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Abbey-church	NULL
.	NULL

Against	NULL
the	NULL
north	NULL
wall	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
empty	NULL
stone	NULL
coffin	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
abbot	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
every	NULL
tourist	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
turn	NULL
for	NULL
grim	NULL
humour	NULL
was	NULL
accustomed	NULL
to	NULL
stretch	NULL
himself	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
this	NULL
Clare	NULL
carefully	NULL
laid	NULL
Tess	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
breathed	NULL
deeply	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
greatly	NULL
desired	NULL
end	NULL
were	NULL
attained	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
then	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
alongside	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
immediately	NULL
fell	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
deep	NULL
dead	NULL
slumber	NULL
of	NULL
exhaustion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
remained	NULL
motionless	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
log	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
spurt	NULL
of	NULL
mental	NULL
excitement	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
produced	NULL
the	NULL
effort	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
sat	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
coffin	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
dry	NULL
and	NULL
mild	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
cold	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
it	NULL
dangerous	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
remain	NULL
here	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
half-clothed	NULL
state	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
probability	NULL
stay	NULL
there	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
be	NULL
chilled	NULL
to	NULL
certain	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
deaths	NULL
after	NULL
sleep-walking	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
how	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
dare	NULL
to	NULL
awaken	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
doing	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
mortify	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
discover	NULL
his	NULL
folly	NULL
in	NULL
respect	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL

Tess	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
stepping	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
stone	NULL
confine	NULL
,	NULL
shook	NULL
him	NULL
slightly	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
was	NULL
unable	NULL
to	NULL
arouse	NULL
him	NULL
without	NULL
being	NULL
violent	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
indispensable	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
something	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
shiver	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sheet	NULL
being	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
protection	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
excitement	NULL
had	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
measure	NULL
kept	NULL
her	NULL
warm	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
'	NULL
adventure	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
that	NULL
beatific	NULL
interval	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
suddenly	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
persuasion	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
accordingly	NULL
she	NULL
whispered	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
ear	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
firmness	NULL
and	NULL
decision	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
summon	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Let	NULL
us	NULL
walk	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
darling	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
taking	NULL
him	NULL
suggestively	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
arm	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
her	NULL
relief	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
unresistingly	NULL
acquiesced	NULL
;	NULL
her	NULL
words	NULL
had	NULL
apparently	NULL
thrown	NULL
him	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
dream	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
thenceforward	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
phase	NULL
,	NULL
wherein	NULL
he	NULL
fancied	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
risen	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
spirit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
leading	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
Heaven	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
she	NULL
conducted	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
arm	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
stone	NULL
bridge	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
residence	NULL
,	NULL
crossing	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
stood	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
manor-house	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
's	NULL
feet	NULL
were	NULL
quite	NULL
bare	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
stones	NULL
hurt	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
chilled	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bone	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
Clare	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
woollen	NULL
stockings	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
feel	NULL
no	NULL
discomfort	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
difficulty	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
induced	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
lie	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
sofa	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
covered	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
warmly	NULL
,	NULL
lighting	NULL
a	NULL
temporary	NULL
fire	NULL
of	NULL
wood	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
dry	NULL
any	NULL
dampness	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
noise	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
attentions	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
might	NULL
awaken	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
secretly	NULL
wished	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
exhaustion	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
and	NULL
body	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
remained	NULL
undisturbed	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
met	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
Tess	NULL
divined	NULL
that	NULL
Angel	NULL
knew	NULL
little	NULL
or	NULL
nothing	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
far	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
concerned	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
's	NULL
excursion	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
regarded	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
aware	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
lain	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
truth	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
awakened	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
sleep	NULL
deep	NULL
as	NULL
annihilation	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
during	NULL
those	NULL
first	NULL
few	NULL
moments	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
brain	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
Samson	NULL
shaking	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
is	NULL
trying	NULL
its	NULL
strength	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
some	NULL
dim	NULL
notion	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
unusual	NULL
nocturnal	NULL
proceeding	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
realities	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
situation	NULL
soon	NULL
displaced	NULL
conjecture	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
subject	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
waited	NULL
in	NULL
expectancy	NULL
to	NULL
discern	NULL
some	NULL
mental	NULL
pointing	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
any	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
,	NULL
concluded	NULL
over-night	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
vanish	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
stood	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
basis	NULL
approximating	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
pure	NULL
reason	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
if	NULL
initiated	NULL
by	NULL
impulse	NULL
of	NULL
feeling	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
trusted	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thus	NULL
beheld	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pale	NULL
morning	NULL
light	NULL
the	NULL
resolve	NULL
to	NULL
separate	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
hot	NULL
and	NULL
indignant	NULL
instinct	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
denuded	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
passionateness	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
scorch	NULL
and	NULL
burn	NULL
;	NULL
standing	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
bones	NULL
;	NULL
nothing	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
skeleton	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
none	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
hesitated	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
breakfast	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
packing	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
remaining	NULL
articles	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
showed	NULL
his	NULL
weariness	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
's	NULL
effort	NULL
so	NULL
unmistakeably	NULL
that	NULL
Tess	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
revealing	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
reflection	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
anger	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
grieve	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
stultify	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
instinctively	NULL
manifested	NULL
a	NULL
fondness	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
common-sense	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
approve	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
inclination	NULL
had	NULL
compromised	NULL
his	NULL
dignity	NULL
when	NULL
reason	NULL
slept	NULL
,	NULL
again	NULL
deterred	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
like	NULL
laughing	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
when	NULL
sober	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
erratic	NULL
deeds	NULL
during	NULL
intoxication	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
just	NULL
crossed	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
a	NULL
faint	NULL
recollection	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
tender	NULL
vagary	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
disinclined	NULL
to	NULL
allude	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
take	NULL
amatory	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
opportunity	NULL
it	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
appealing	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
anew	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
ordered	NULL
by	NULL
letter	NULL
a	NULL
vehicle	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
nearest	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
after	NULL
breakfast	NULL
it	NULL
arrived	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
temporary	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
revelation	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
tenderness	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
incident	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
raised	NULL
dreams	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
possible	NULL
future	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
luggage	NULL
was	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
drove	NULL
them	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
miller	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
waiting-woman	NULL
expressing	NULL
some	NULL
surprise	NULL
at	NULL
their	NULL
precipitate	NULL
departure	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Clare	NULL
attributed	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
discovery	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
mill-work	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
modern	NULL
kind	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
investigate	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
statement	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
went	NULL
.	NULL

Beyond	NULL
this	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
leaving	NULL
to	NULL
suggest	NULL
a	NULL
fiasco	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
together	NULL
to	NULL
visit	NULL
friends	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
route	NULL
lay	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
dairy	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
started	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
solemn	NULL
joy	NULL
in	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
Clare	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
wind	NULL
up	NULL
his	NULL
business	NULL
with	NULL
Mr	NULL
Crick	NULL
,	NULL
Tess	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
avoid	NULL
paying	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Crick	NULL
a	NULL
call	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
unless	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
excite	NULL
suspicion	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
unhappy	NULL
state	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
call	NULL
as	NULL
unobtrusive	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
wicket	NULL
leading	NULL
down	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
road	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
dairy-house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
descended	NULL
the	NULL
track	NULL
on	NULL
foot	NULL
,	NULL
side	NULL
by	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
withy-bed	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
cut	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
stumps	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
Clare	NULL
had	NULL
followed	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
pressed	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
;	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
enclosure	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
fascinated	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
harp	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
far	NULL
away	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL
cow-stalls	NULL
the	NULL
mead	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
first	NULL
embrace	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
gold	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
summer	NULL
picture	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
gray	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
colours	NULL
mean	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
rich	NULL
soil	NULL
mud	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

Over	NULL
the	NULL
barton-gate	NULL
the	NULL
dairyman	NULL
saw	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
forward	NULL
,	NULL
throwing	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
jocularity	NULL
deemed	NULL
appropriate	NULL
in	NULL
Talbothays	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
vicinity	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
re-appearance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
newly-married	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Crick	NULL
emerged	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
several	NULL
others	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
old	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
Marian	NULL
and	NULL
Retty	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
seem	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
valiantly	NULL
bore	NULL
their	NULL
sly	NULL
attacks	NULL
and	NULL
friendly	NULL
humours	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
affected	NULL
her	NULL
far	NULL
otherwise	NULL
than	NULL
they	NULL
supposed	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
tacit	NULL
agreement	NULL
of	NULL
husband	NULL
and	NULL
wife	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
their	NULL
estrangement	NULL
a	NULL
secret	NULL
they	NULL
behaved	NULL
as	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
ordinary	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
rather	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
no	NULL
word	NULL
spoken	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
,	NULL
Tess	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
hear	NULL
in	NULL
detail	NULL
the	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
Marian	NULL
and	NULL
Retty	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
later	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
home	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Marian	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
for	NULL
employment	NULL
elsewhere	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
feared	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
no	NULL
good	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
dissipate	NULL
the	NULL
sadness	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
recital	NULL
Tess	NULL
went	NULL
and	NULL
bade	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
favourite	NULL
cows	NULL
goodbye	NULL
,	NULL
touching	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
Clare	NULL
stood	NULL
side	NULL
by	NULL
side	NULL
at	NULL
leaving	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
united	NULL
body	NULL
and	NULL
soul	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
something	NULL
peculiarly	NULL
sorry	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
aspect	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
who	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
seen	NULL
it	NULL
truly	NULL
;	NULL
two	NULL
limbs	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
something	NULL

in	NULL
their	NULL

some	NULL
awkwardness	NULL
in	NULL

They	NULL
re-entered	NULL
the	NULL

were	NULL
driven	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
roads	NULL
towards	NULL
Weatherbury	NULL

the	NULL

rested	NULL

At	NULL
a	NULL

when	NULL
Nuttlebury	NULL

where	NULL
there	NULL

cross-roads	NULL

Clare	NULL
stopped	NULL

directing	NULL
the	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
severity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
decree	NULL
seemed	NULL
deadly	NULL
to	NULL
Tess	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
his	NULL

clearly	NULL
enough	NULL

he	NULL

she	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Tess	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
artful	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
scene	NULL
,	NULL
fainted	NULL

wept	NULL
hysterically	NULL

in	NULL
that	NULL
lonely	NULL
lane	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
the	NULL
fury	NULL
of	NULL
fastidiousness	NULL
with	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
possessed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
withstood	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
her	NULL
mood	NULL
of	NULL
long-suffering	NULL
made	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
easy	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
best	NULL
advocate	NULL
.	NULL

Pride	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
entered	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
submission	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
perhaps	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
symptom	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
reckless	NULL
acquiescence	NULL
in	NULL
chance	NULL
too	NULL
apparent	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
family	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
many	NULL
effective	NULL
chords	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
stirred	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
appeal	NULL
were	NULL
left	NULL
untouched	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
remainder	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
discourse	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
practical	NULL
matters	NULL
only	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
now	NULL
handed	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
packet	NULL
containing	NULL
a	NULL
fairly	NULL
good	NULL
sum	NULL
of	NULL
money	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
obtained	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
bankers	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
purpose	NULL

The	NULL
brilliants	NULL

the	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL

to	NULL
be	NULL
Tess	NULL

(	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
understood	NULL
the	NULL
wording	NULL

he	NULL
advised	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
send	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
bank	NULL
for	NULL
safety	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
she	NULL
readily	NULL
agreed	NULL
.	NULL

These	NULL
things	NULL
arranged	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
with	NULL
Tess	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
carriage	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
handed	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
coachman	NULL
was	NULL
paid	NULL

told	NULL
where	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Taking	NULL
next	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
bag	NULL

umbrella	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
sole	NULL
articles	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL

him	NULL

--	NULL
he	NULL
bade	NULL
her	NULL
goodbye	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
parted	NULL
there	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fly	NULL
moved	NULL
creepingly	NULL
up	NULL
a	NULL
hill	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Clare	NULL
watched	NULL
it	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
unpremeditated	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
Tess	NULL
would	NULL
look	NULL
out	NULL

the	NULL
window	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL

he	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
anguish	NULL

his	NULL
heart	NULL

given	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL

no	NULL

He	NULL
hoped	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
remove	NULL
that	NULL

soon	NULL

He	NULL
proposed	NULL

Tess	NULL

It	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL

Then	NULL
Mrs	NULL

XXXIX	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
three	NULL
weeks	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
marriage	NULL
that	NULL
Clare	NULL
found	NULL
himself	NULL
descending	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL
which	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
well-known	NULL
parsonage	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
his	NULL
downward	NULL
course	NULL
the	NULL
tower	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
rose	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
sky	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
manner	NULL
of	NULL
inquiry	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
no	NULL
living	NULL
person	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
twilighted	NULL
town	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
notice	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
still	NULL
less	NULL
to	NULL
expect	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
arriving	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
ghost	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
footsteps	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
an	NULL
encumbrance	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
got	NULL
rid	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
picture	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
had	NULL
changed	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
known	NULL
it	NULL
but	NULL
speculatively	NULL
;	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
practical	NULL
man	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
yet	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
humanity	NULL
stood	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
pensive	NULL
sweetness	NULL
of	NULL
Italian	NULL
art	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
staring	NULL
and	NULL
ghastly	NULL
attitudes	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Wiertz	NULL
Museum	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
leer	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
study	NULL
by	NULL
Van	NULL
Beers	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
conduct	NULL
during	NULL
these	NULL
first	NULL
weeks	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
desultory	NULL
beyond	NULL
description	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
mechanically	NULL
attempting	NULL
to	NULL
pursue	NULL
his	NULL
agricultural	NULL
plans	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
nothing	NULL
unusual	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
manner	NULL
recommended	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
and	NULL
wise	NULL
men	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
ages	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
concluded	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL
few	NULL
of	NULL
those	NULL
great	NULL
and	NULL
wise	NULL
men	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
gone	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
outside	NULL
themselves	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
test	NULL
the	NULL
feasibility	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
counsel	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
This	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
chief	NULL
thing	NULL
:	NULL
be	NULL
not	NULL
perturbed	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
Pagan	NULL
moralist	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
Clare	NULL
's	NULL
own	NULL
opinion	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
perturbed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
not	NULL
your	NULL
heart	NULL
be	NULL
troubled	NULL
,	NULL
neither	NULL
let	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
afraid	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
Nazarene	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
chimed	NULL
in	NULL
cordially	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
was	NULL
troubled	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
confront	NULL
those	NULL
two	NULL
great	NULL
thinkers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
earnestly	NULL
appeal	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
as	NULL
fellow-man	NULL
to	NULL
fellow-men	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ask	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
him	NULL
their	NULL
method	NULL
!	NULL

His	NULL
mood	NULL
transmuted	NULL
itself	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
dogged	NULL
indifference	NULL
till	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
he	NULL
fancied	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
existence	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
passive	NULL
interest	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
outsider	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
embittered	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
desolation	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
brought	NULL
about	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
accident	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
Tess	NULL
came	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
exhausted	NULL
ancient	NULL
line	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
tribes	NULL
from	NULL
below	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
fondly	NULL
dreamed	NULL
,	NULL
why	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
stoically	NULL
abandoned	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
fidelity	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
principles	NULL
?	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
by	NULL
apostasy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
punishment	NULL
was	NULL
deserved	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
became	NULL
weary	NULL
and	NULL
anxious	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
anxiety	NULL
increased	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
wondered	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
treated	NULL
her	NULL
unfairly	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
ate	NULL
without	NULL
knowing	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
ate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
drank	NULL
without	NULL
tasting	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
hours	NULL
dropped	NULL
past	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
motive	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
act	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
series	NULL
of	NULL
bygone	NULL
days	NULL
presented	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
view	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
perceived	NULL
how	NULL
intimately	NULL
the	NULL
notion	NULL
of	NULL
having	NULL
Tess	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
dear	NULL
possession	NULL
was	NULL
mixed	NULL
up	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
schemes	NULL
and	NULL
words	NULL
and	NULL
ways	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
going	NULL
hither	NULL
and	NULL
thither	NULL
he	NULL
observed	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
outskirts	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
town	NULL
a	NULL
red-and-blue	NULL
placard	NULL
setting	NULL
forth	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
advantages	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Empire	NULL
of	NULL
Brazil	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
field	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
emigrating	NULL
agriculturist	NULL
.	NULL

Land	NULL
was	NULL
offered	NULL
there	NULL
on	NULL
exceptionally	NULL
advantageous	NULL
terms	NULL
.	NULL

Brazil	NULL
somewhat	NULL
attracted	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
idea	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
could	NULL
eventually	NULL
join	NULL
him	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
perhaps	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
country	NULL
of	NULL
contrasting	NULL
scenes	NULL
and	NULL
notions	NULL
and	NULL
habits	NULL
the	NULL
conventions	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
operative	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
life	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
seem	NULL
impracticable	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
brief	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
strongly	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
Brazil	NULL
,	NULL
especially	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
for	NULL
going	NULL
thither	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
this	NULL
view	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
returning	NULL
to	NULL
Emminster	NULL
to	NULL
disclose	NULL
his	NULL
plan	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
parents	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
explanation	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
make	NULL
of	NULL
arriving	NULL
without	NULL
Tess	NULL
,	NULL
short	NULL
of	NULL
revealing	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
actually	NULL
separated	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
he	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
moon	NULL
shone	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
one	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
hours	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
morning	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
carried	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
river	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
graveyard	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
monks	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
thinner	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
his	NULL
parents	NULL
no	NULL
warning	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
visit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
arrival	NULL
stirred	NULL
the	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Vicarage	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
dive	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
kingfisher	NULL
stirs	NULL
a	NULL
quiet	NULL
pool	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
father	NULL
and	NULL
mother	NULL
were	NULL
both	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
neither	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
brothers	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

Angel	NULL
entered	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
quietly	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL

even	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
his	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL

disturbed	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
velvet	NULL
touch	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
lips	NULL
passed	NULL
over	NULL
his	NULL
brow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
distinguish	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
the	NULL
warmth	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
breath	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
night	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
belittling	NULL
deprecations	NULL
was	NULL
thinking	NULL
how	NULL
great	NULL
and	NULL
good	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
over	NULL
them	NULL
both	NULL
there	NULL
hung	NULL
a	NULL
deeper	NULL
shade	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
shade	NULL
which	NULL
Angel	NULL
Clare	NULL
perceived	NULL
,	NULL
namely	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
shade	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
limitations	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
all	NULL
his	NULL
attempted	NULL
independence	NULL
of	NULL
judgement	NULL
this	NULL
advanced	NULL
and	NULL
well-meaning	NULL
young	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
sample	NULL
product	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
five-and-twenty	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
yet	NULL
the	NULL
slave	NULL
to	NULL
custom	NULL
and	NULL
conventionality	NULL
when	NULL
surprised	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
early	NULL
teachings	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
prophet	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
prophet	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
essentially	NULL
this	NULL
young	NULL
wife	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
deserving	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
praise	NULL
of	NULL
King	NULL
Lemuel	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
other	NULL
woman	NULL
endowed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
dislike	NULL
of	NULL
evil	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
moral	NULL
value	NULL
having	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
reckoned	NULL
not	NULL
by	NULL
achievement	NULL
but	NULL
by	NULL
tendency	NULL
.	NULL

Moreover	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
figure	NULL
near	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL
suffers	NULL
on	NULL
such	NULL
occasion	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
it	NULL
shows	NULL
up	NULL
its	NULL
sorriness	NULL
without	NULL
shade	NULL
;	NULL
while	NULL
vague	NULL
figures	NULL
afar	NULL
off	NULL
are	NULL
honoured	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
distance	NULL
makes	NULL
artistic	NULL
virtues	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
stains	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
considering	NULL
what	NULL
Tess	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
overlooked	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
forgot	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
defective	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
entire	NULL
.	NULL

XL	NULL
At	NULL
breakfast	NULL
Brazil	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
topic	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
all	NULL
endeavoured	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
hopeful	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
Clare	NULL
's	NULL
proposed	NULL
experiment	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
country	NULL
's	NULL
soil	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
the	NULL
discouraging	NULL
reports	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
farm-labourers	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
emigrated	NULL
thither	NULL
and	NULL
returned	NULL
home	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
twelve	NULL
months	NULL
.	NULL

After	NULL
breakfast	NULL
Clare	NULL
went	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
town	NULL
to	NULL
wind	NULL
up	NULL
such	NULL
trifling	NULL
matters	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
concerned	NULL
with	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
local	NULL
bank	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
he	NULL
possessed	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
back	NULL
he	NULL
encountered	NULL
Miss	NULL
Mercy	NULL
Chant	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
whose	NULL
walls	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
emanation	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
carrying	NULL
an	NULL
armful	NULL
of	NULL
Bibles	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
class	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
such	NULL
was	NULL
her	NULL
view	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
that	NULL
events	NULL
which	NULL
produced	NULL
heartache	NULL
in	NULL
others	NULL
wrought	NULL
beatific	NULL
smiles	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
an	NULL
enviable	NULL
result	NULL
,	NULL
although	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
opinion	NULL
of	NULL
Angel	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
obtained	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
curiously	NULL
unnatural	NULL
sacrifice	NULL
of	NULL
humanity	NULL
to	NULL
mysticism	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
learnt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
England	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
observed	NULL
what	NULL
an	NULL
excellent	NULL
and	NULL
promising	NULL
scheme	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
likely	NULL
scheme	NULL
enough	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
commercial	NULL
sense	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
replied	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
dear	NULL
Mercy	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
snaps	NULL
the	NULL
continuity	NULL
of	NULL
existence	NULL
.	NULL

Perhaps	NULL
a	NULL
cloister	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
preferable	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
A	NULL

O	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL

you	NULL

"	NULL

_	NULL
I	NULL

"	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
severely	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Clare	NULL
,	NULL
thrown	NULL
by	NULL
sheer	NULL
misery	NULL
into	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
demoniacal	NULL
moods	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
does	NULL
despite	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
true	NULL
principles	NULL
,	NULL
called	NULL
her	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
fiendishly	NULL
whispered	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
ear	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
heterodox	NULL
ideas	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
momentary	NULL
laughter	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
horror	NULL
which	NULL
appeared	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
fair	NULL
face	NULL
ceased	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
merged	NULL
in	NULL
pain	NULL
and	NULL
anxiety	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
welfare	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Dear	NULL
Mercy	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
you	NULL
must	NULL
forgive	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
going	NULL
crazy	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
the	NULL
interview	NULL
ended	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Clare	NULL
re-entered	NULL
the	NULL
Vicarage	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
the	NULL
local	NULL
banker	NULL
he	NULL
deposited	NULL
the	NULL
jewels	NULL
till	NULL
happier	NULL
days	NULL
should	NULL
arise	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
also	NULL
paid	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
bank	NULL
thirty	NULL
pounds	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
sent	NULL
to	NULL
Tess	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
months	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
require	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
parents	NULL
'	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
Blackmoor	NULL
Vale	NULL
to	NULL
inform	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
amount	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
sum	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL
placed	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
--	NULL
about	NULL
fifty	NULL
pounds	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
hoped	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
amply	NULL
sufficient	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
wants	NULL
just	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
,	NULL
particularly	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
emergency	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
directed	NULL
to	NULL
apply	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
deemed	NULL
it	NULL
best	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
his	NULL
parents	NULL
into	NULL
communication	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
informing	NULL
them	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
address	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
unaware	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
really	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
estrange	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
neither	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
nor	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
do	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
parsonage	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
complete	NULL
he	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
done	NULL
quickly	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
duty	NULL
before	NULL
leaving	NULL
this	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
England	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
necessary	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Wellbridge	NULL
farmhouse	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
spent	NULL
with	NULL
Tess	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
three	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
trifle	NULL
of	NULL
rent	NULL
having	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
paid	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
key	NULL
given	NULL
up	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
occupied	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
small	NULL
articles	NULL
fetched	NULL
away	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
behind	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
under	NULL
this	NULL
roof	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
deepest	NULL
shadow	NULL
ever	NULL
thrown	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
had	NULL
stretched	NULL
its	NULL
gloom	NULL
over	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
unlocked	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sitting-room	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
into	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
memory	NULL
which	NULL
returned	NULL
first	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
happy	NULL
arrival	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
similar	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
fresh	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
sharing	NULL
a	NULL
habitation	NULL
conjointly	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
meal	NULL
together	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
chatting	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
with	NULL
joined	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
farmer	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
visit	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Clare	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL
alone	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Inwardly	NULL
swollen	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
renewal	NULL
of	NULL
sentiment	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
quite	NULL
reckoned	NULL
with	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
upstairs	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
chamber	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
his	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
bed	NULL
was	NULL
smooth	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
hands	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
of	NULL
leaving	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
mistletoe	NULL
hung	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
tester	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
placed	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
been	NULL
there	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
weeks	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
turning	NULL
colour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
leaves	NULL
and	NULL
berries	NULL
were	NULL
wrinkled	NULL
.	NULL

Angel	NULL
took	NULL
it	NULL
down	NULL
and	NULL
crushed	NULL
it	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
grate	NULL
.	NULL

Standing	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
doubted	NULL
whether	NULL
his	NULL
course	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
conjecture	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
wise	NULL
,	NULL
much	NULL
less	NULL
a	NULL
generous	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
had	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
cruelly	NULL
blinded	NULL
?	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
incoherent	NULL
multitude	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
emotions	NULL
he	NULL
knelt	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bedside	NULL
wet-eyed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
O	NULL
Tess	NULL

If	NULL
you	NULL

only	NULL

me	NULL

have	NULL
forgiven	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
mourned	NULL
.	NULL

Hearing	NULL
a	NULL
footstep	NULL
below	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
rose	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
flight	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
standing	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
turning	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL

recognized	NULL

After	NULL
again	NULL
leaving	NULL
Marlott	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
and	NULL
summer	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
great	NULL
stress	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
physical	NULL

the	NULL

spent	NULL
in	NULL
rendering	NULL

,	NULL
equally	NULL
remote	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
native	NULL

from	NULL
Talbothays	NULL

She	NULL
preferred	NULL
this	NULL
to	NULL
living	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
allowance	NULL
.	NULL

Mentally	NULL
she	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
utter	NULL
stagnation	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
condition	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
mechanical	NULL
occupation	NULL
rather	NULL
fostered	NULL
than	NULL
checked	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
consciousness	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
other	NULL
dairy	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
other	NULL
season	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tender	NULL
lover	NULL
who	NULL

confronted	NULL
her	NULL
there	NULL
--	NULL
he	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
grasped	NULL
him	NULL

keep	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL

,	NULL
had	NULL
disappeared	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL

in	NULL

.	NULL

The	NULL
dairy-work	NULL
lasted	NULL
only	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
milk	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
lessen	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
met	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
regular	NULL
engagement	NULL
as	NULL
at	NULL
Talbothays	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
duty	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
supernumerary	NULL
only	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
harvest	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
beginning	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
simply	NULL
to	NULL
remove	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
pasture	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
stubble	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
plenty	NULL
of	NULL
further	NULL
occupation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
continued	NULL
till	NULL
harvest	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
the	NULL
five-and-twenty	NULL
pounds	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
remained	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
of	NULL
Clare	NULL
's	NULL
allowance	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
deducting	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fifty	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
contribution	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
parents	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
trouble	NULL
and	NULL
expense	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
spent	NULL
but	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
now	NULL
followed	NULL
an	NULL
unfortunate	NULL
interval	NULL
of	NULL
wet	NULL
weather	NULL
,	NULL
during	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
fall	NULL
back	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
sovereigns	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bear	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
them	NULL
go	NULL
.	NULL

Angel	NULL
had	NULL
put	NULL
them	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
obtained	NULL
them	NULL
bright	NULL
and	NULL
new	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
bank	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
touch	NULL
had	NULL
consecrated	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
souvenirs	NULL
of	NULL
himself	NULL
--	NULL
they	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
had	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
no	NULL
other	NULL
history	NULL
than	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
created	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
experiences	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
disperse	NULL
them	NULL
was	NULL
like	NULL
giving	NULL
away	NULL
relics	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
they	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
compelled	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
her	NULL
address	NULL
from	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
concealed	NULL
her	NULL
circumstances	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
her	NULL
money	NULL
had	NULL
almost	NULL
gone	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
reached	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Joan	NULL
stated	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
dreadful	NULL
difficulty	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
autumn	NULL
rains	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
thatch	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
required	NULL
entire	NULL
renewal	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
this	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
previous	NULL
thatching	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
paid	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

New	NULL
rafters	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
ceiling	NULL
upstairs	NULL
also	NULL
were	NULL
required	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
previous	NULL
bill	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
amount	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
sum	NULL
of	NULL
twenty	NULL
pounds	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
of	NULL
means	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
doubtless	NULL
returned	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
not	NULL
send	NULL
them	NULL
the	NULL
money	NULL
?	NULL

Tess	NULL
had	NULL
thirty	NULL
pounds	NULL
coming	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
almost	NULL
immediately	NULL
from	NULL
Angel	NULL
's	NULL
bankers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
case	NULL
being	NULL
so	NULL
deplorable	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
sum	NULL
was	NULL
received	NULL
she	NULL
sent	NULL
the	NULL
twenty	NULL
as	NULL
requested	NULL
.	NULL

Part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
remainder	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
expend	NULL
in	NULL
winter	NULL
clothing	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
nominal	NULL
sum	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
inclement	NULL
season	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
pound	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
remark	NULL
of	NULL
Angel	NULL
's	NULL
that	NULL
whenever	NULL
she	NULL
required	NULL
further	NULL
resources	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
apply	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
,	NULL
remained	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
considered	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
Tess	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
step	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
reluctant	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
same	NULL
delicacy	NULL
,	NULL
pride	NULL
,	NULL
false	NULL
shame	NULL
,	NULL
whatever	NULL
it	NULL
may	NULL
be	NULL
called	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
Clare	NULL
's	NULL
account	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
led	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
hide	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
parents	NULL
the	NULL
prolongation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
estrangement	NULL
,	NULL
hindered	NULL
her	NULL
owning	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
want	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
fair	NULL
allowance	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
probably	NULL
despised	NULL
her	NULL
already	NULL
;	NULL
how	NULL
much	NULL
more	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
despise	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mendicant	NULL
!	NULL

The	NULL
consequence	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL
effort	NULL
could	NULL
the	NULL
parson	NULL
's	NULL
daughter-in-law	NULL
bring	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
him	NULL
know	NULL
her	NULL
state	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
reluctance	NULL
to	NULL
communicate	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
parents	NULL
might	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
lessen	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
lapse	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
the	NULL

obtained	NULL

On	NULL
her	NULL
leaving	NULL
their	NULL
house	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
short	NULL
visit	NULL
subsequent	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
impression	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
ultimately	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
join	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
disturb	NULL
their	NULL
belief	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
awaiting	NULL
his	NULL
return	NULL
in	NULL
comfort	NULL
,	NULL
hoping	NULL
against	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
journey	NULL
to	NULL
Brazil	NULL
would	NULL
result	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
stay	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
fetch	NULL
her	NULL

or	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
write	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
join	NULL
him	NULL

in	NULL
any	NULL
case	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
soon	NULL
present	NULL
a	NULL
united	NULL
front	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
families	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
hope	NULL
she	NULL
still	NULL
fostered	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
parents	NULL
know	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
deserted	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
dependent	NULL

now	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
relieved	NULL

for	NULL
a	NULL
living	NULL

after	NULL
the	NULL
_	NULL
éclat	NULL
_	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
marriage	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
nullify	NULL
the	NULL
collapse	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
attempt	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
too	NULL
much	NULL
indeed	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
set	NULL
of	NULL
brilliants	NULL
returned	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
.	NULL

Where	NULL
Clare	NULL
had	NULL
deposited	NULL
them	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
mattered	NULL
little	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
true	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
only	NULL
use	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
sell	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
were	NULL
they	NULL
absolutely	NULL
hers	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
passing	NULL
mean	NULL
to	NULL
enrich	NULL
herself	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
legal	NULL
title	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
essentially	NULL
hers	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
.	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
days	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL
means	NULL
free	NULL
from	NULL
trial	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
lying	NULL
ill	NULL
of	NULL
fever	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
clay	NULL
lands	NULL
near	NULL
Curitiba	NULL
in	NULL
Brazil	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
drenched	NULL
with	NULL
thunder-storms	NULL
and	NULL
persecuted	NULL
by	NULL
other	NULL
hardships	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
common	NULL
with	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
farmers	NULL
and	NULL
farm-labourers	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
just	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
deluded	NULL
into	NULL
going	NULL
thither	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
promises	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Brazilian	NULL
Government	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
baseless	NULL
assumption	NULL
that	NULL
those	NULL
frames	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
ploughing	NULL
and	NULL
sowing	NULL
on	NULL
English	NULL
uplands	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
resisted	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
weathers	NULL
to	NULL
whose	NULL
moods	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
born	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
resist	NULL
equally	NULL
well	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
weathers	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
surprised	NULL
on	NULL
Brazilian	NULL
plains	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
return	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
it	NULL
happened	NULL
that	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
of	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
sovereigns	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
spent	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
unprovided	NULL
with	NULL
others	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
their	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
it	NULL
increasingly	NULL
difficult	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
employment	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
being	NULL
aware	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rarity	NULL
of	NULL
intelligence	NULL
,	NULL
energy	NULL
,	NULL
health	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
willingness	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
sphere	NULL
of	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
refrained	NULL
from	NULL
seeking	NULL
an	NULL
indoor	NULL
occupation	NULL
;	NULL
fearing	NULL
towns	NULL
,	NULL
large	NULL
houses	NULL
,	NULL
people	NULL
of	NULL
means	NULL
and	NULL
social	NULL
sophistication	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
manners	NULL
other	NULL
than	NULL
rural	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
that	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
gentility	NULL
Black	NULL
Care	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

Society	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
supposed	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
slight	NULL
experience	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
proof	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
instinct	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
circumstances	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
avoid	NULL
its	NULL
purlieus	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
small	NULL
dairies	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
west	NULL
,	NULL
beyond	NULL
Port-Bredy	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
served	NULL
as	NULL
supernumerary	NULL
milkmaid	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
and	NULL
summer	NULL
required	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
aid	NULL
.	NULL

Room	NULL
would	NULL
probably	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
made	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
Talbothays	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
only	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
sheer	NULL
compassion	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
comfortable	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
anti-climax	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
too	NULL
intolerable	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
return	NULL
might	NULL
bring	NULL
reproach	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
idolized	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
borne	NULL
their	NULL
pity	NULL

and	NULL
their	NULL
whispered	NULL
remarks	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
strange	NULL
situation	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
almost	NULL
have	NULL
faced	NULL
a	NULL
knowledge	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
circumstances	NULL
by	NULL
every	NULL
individual	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
her	NULL
story	NULL
had	NULL
remained	NULL
isolated	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mind	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
interchange	NULL
of	NULL
ideas	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
sensitiveness	NULL
wince	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
account	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
distinction	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
simply	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
upland	NULL
farm	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

a	NULL
wandering	NULL
letter	NULL
which	NULL

her	NULL

Marian	NULL

Marian	NULL
had	NULL
somehow	NULL

Tess	NULL

Tess	NULL

gone	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
upland	NULL

Among	NULL

difficulties	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL

position	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL

was	NULL
the	NULL
attention	NULL
she	NULL
excited	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
appearance	NULL

a	NULL

distinction	NULL

had	NULL
caught	NULL
from	NULL
Clare	NULL

being	NULL
superadded	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

.	NULL

Whilst	NULL

prepared	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
these	NULL

soon	NULL

was	NULL
compelled	NULL
to	NULL
don	NULL

of	NULL
a	NULL
fieldwoman	NULL
,	NULL
rude	NULL

were	NULL
addressed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL

but	NULL
nothing	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
cause	NULL
her	NULL
bodily	NULL
fear	NULL
till	NULL
a	NULL
particular	NULL
November	NULL
afternoon	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
preferred	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
west	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
River	NULL
Brit	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
upland	NULL
farm	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
bound	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
nearer	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
home	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
father	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
hover	NULL
about	NULL
that	NULL
region	NULL
unrecognized	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
notion	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
decide	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Vicarage	NULL
some	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
gave	NULL
her	NULL
pleasure	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
having	NULL
once	NULL
decided	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
the	NULL
higher	NULL
and	NULL
drier	NULL
levels	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
pressed	NULL
back	NULL
eastward	NULL
,	NULL
marching	NULL
afoot	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
of	NULL
Chalk-Newton	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lane	NULL
was	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
unvaried	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rapid	NULL
shortening	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
dusk	NULL
came	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
aware	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hill	NULL
down	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
stretched	NULL
its	NULL
serpentine	NULL
length	NULL
in	NULL
glimpses	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
footsteps	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
moments	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
overtaken	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
stepped	NULL
up	NULL
alongside	NULL
Tess	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Good	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
my	NULL
pretty	NULL
maid	NULL
"	NULL
:	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
civilly	NULL
replied	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
light	NULL
still	NULL
remaining	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
lit	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
landscape	NULL
was	NULL
nearly	NULL
dark	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
man	NULL
turned	NULL
and	NULL
stared	NULL
hard	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
,	NULL
surely	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL

"	NULL

She	NULL
recognized	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
well-to-do	NULL
boor	NULL
whom	NULL
Angel	NULL
had	NULL
knocked	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
inn	NULL
for	NULL
addressing	NULL
her	NULL
coarsely	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
spasm	NULL
of	NULL
anguish	NULL
shot	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
returned	NULL
him	NULL
no	NULL
answer	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Be	NULL

it	NULL

"	NULL

Still	NULL
no	NULL
answer	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
Tess	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
seemed	NULL
only	NULL
one	NULL
escape	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
hunted	NULL
soul	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
suddenly	NULL
took	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
heels	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
speed	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
looking	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
ran	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
gate	NULL
which	NULL
opened	NULL
directly	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
plantation	NULL
.	NULL

Into	NULL
this	NULL
she	NULL
plunged	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
pause	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
deep	NULL
enough	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
shade	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
safe	NULL
against	NULL
any	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
discovery	NULL
.	NULL

Under	NULL
foot	NULL
the	NULL
leaves	NULL
were	NULL
dry	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
foliage	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
holly	NULL
bushes	NULL
which	NULL
grew	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
deciduous	NULL
trees	NULL
was	NULL
dense	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
off	NULL
draughts	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
scraped	NULL
together	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
leaves	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
formed	NULL
them	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
heap	NULL
,	NULL
making	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
nest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
.	NULL

Into	NULL
this	NULL
Tess	NULL
crept	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
sleep	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
was	NULL
naturally	NULL
fitful	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
fancied	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
strange	NULL
noises	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
persuaded	NULL
herself	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
caused	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
breeze	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
vague	NULL
warm	NULL
clime	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
globe	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
here	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
cold	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
there	NULL
another	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
wretched	NULL
being	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
?	NULL

Tess	NULL
asked	NULL
herself	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
wasted	NULL
life	NULL
,	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
All	NULL
is	NULL
vanity	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
repeated	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
mechanically	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
reflected	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
most	NULL
inadequate	NULL
thought	NULL
for	NULL
modern	NULL
days	NULL
.	NULL

Solomon	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
two	NULL
thousand	NULL
years	NULL
ago	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
van	NULL
of	NULL
thinkers	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
much	NULL
further	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
all	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
vanity	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
mind	NULL
it	NULL
?	NULL

All	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
alas	NULL
,	NULL
worse	NULL
than	NULL
vanity	NULL
--	NULL
injustice	NULL
,	NULL
punishment	NULL
,	NULL
exaction	NULL
,	NULL
death	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wife	NULL
of	NULL
Angel	NULL
Clare	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
brow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
felt	NULL
its	NULL
curve	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
edges	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
eye-sockets	NULL
perceptible	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
soft	NULL
skin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thought	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
when	NULL
that	NULL
bone	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
bare	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
wish	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
whimsical	NULL
fancies	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
a	NULL
new	NULL
strange	NULL
sound	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
leaves	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
;	NULL
yet	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
scarcely	NULL
any	NULL
wind	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
palpitation	NULL
,	NULL
sometimes	NULL
a	NULL
flutter	NULL
;	NULL
sometimes	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
gasp	NULL
or	NULL
gurgle	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
certain	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
noises	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
wild	NULL
creatures	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
so	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
originating	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
boughs	NULL
overhead	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
followed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fall	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
heavy	NULL
body	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
she	NULL
been	NULL
ensconced	NULL
here	NULL
under	NULL
other	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
pleasant	NULL
conditions	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
become	NULL
alarmed	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
,	NULL
outside	NULL
humanity	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
no	NULL
fear	NULL
.	NULL

Day	NULL
at	NULL
length	NULL
broke	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
day	NULL
aloft	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
little	NULL
while	NULL
it	NULL
became	NULL
day	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wood	NULL
.	NULL

Directly	NULL
the	NULL
assuring	NULL
and	NULL
prosaic	NULL
light	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
's	NULL
active	NULL
hours	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
strong	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
crept	NULL
from	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
hillock	NULL
of	NULL
leaves	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
around	NULL
boldly	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
perceived	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
going	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
disturb	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
plantation	NULL
wherein	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
shelter	NULL
ran	NULL
down	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
spot	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
peak	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
ended	NULL
it	NULL
hitherward	NULL
,	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
hedge	NULL
being	NULL
arable	NULL
ground	NULL
.	NULL

Under	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
several	NULL
pheasants	NULL
lay	NULL
about	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
rich	NULL
plumage	NULL
dabbled	NULL
with	NULL
blood	NULL
;	NULL
some	NULL
were	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
feebly	NULL
twitching	NULL
a	NULL
wing	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
staring	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
pulsating	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
contorted	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
stretched	NULL
out	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
writhing	NULL
in	NULL
agony	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
the	NULL
fortunate	NULL
ones	NULL
whose	NULL
tortures	NULL
had	NULL
ended	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
inability	NULL
of	NULL
nature	NULL
to	NULL
bear	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
guessed	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
the	NULL
meaning	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
birds	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
driven	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
this	NULL
corner	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
before	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
shooting-party	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
while	NULL
those	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
dropped	NULL
dead	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
shot	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
had	NULL
died	NULL
before	NULL
nightfall	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
searched	NULL
for	NULL
and	NULL
carried	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
many	NULL
badly	NULL
wounded	NULL
birds	NULL
had	NULL
escaped	NULL
and	NULL
hidden	NULL
themselves	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
risen	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
thick	NULL
boughs	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
maintained	NULL
their	NULL
position	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
grew	NULL
weaker	NULL
with	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
blood	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
night-time	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
one	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
occasionally	NULL
caught	NULL
glimpses	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
girlhood	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
over	NULL
hedges	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
peeping	NULL
through	NULL
bushes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pointing	NULL
their	NULL
guns	NULL
,	NULL
strangely	NULL
accoutred	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
bloodthirsty	NULL
light	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
told	NULL
that	NULL

rough	NULL

brutal	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
seemed	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
ashamed	NULL
of	NULL
herself	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
gloom	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL

based	NULL

She	NULL
reached	NULL
Chalk-Newton	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
breakfasted	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
inn	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
several	NULL
young	NULL
men	NULL
were	NULL
troublesomely	NULL
complimentary	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
good	NULL
looks	NULL
.	NULL

Somehow	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
hopeful	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
also	NULL
might	NULL
say	NULL
these	NULL
same	NULL
things	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
even	NULL
yet	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
bound	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
care	NULL
of	NULL
herself	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
chance	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
keep	NULL
off	NULL
these	NULL
casual	NULL
lovers	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
this	NULL
end	NULL
Tess	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
risks	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
appearance	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
she	NULL
entered	NULL
a	NULL
thicket	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
basket	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
oldest	NULL
field-gowns	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
even	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
dairy	NULL
--	NULL
never	NULL
since	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
worked	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
stubble	NULL
at	NULL
Marlott	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
also	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
felicitous	NULL
thought	NULL
,	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
handkerchief	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
bundle	NULL
and	NULL
tied	NULL
it	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
bonnet	NULL
,	NULL
covering	NULL
her	NULL
chin	NULL
and	NULL
half	NULL
her	NULL
cheeks	NULL
and	NULL
temples	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
were	NULL
suffering	NULL
from	NULL
toothache	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
scissors	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
aid	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
pocket	NULL
looking-glass	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
mercilessly	NULL
nipped	NULL
her	NULL
eyebrows	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thus	NULL
insured	NULL
against	NULL
aggressive	NULL
admiration	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
uneven	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
a	NULL
mommet	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
maid	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
met	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
companion	NULL
.	NULL

Tears	NULL
came	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
for	NULL
very	NULL
pity	NULL
of	NULL
herself	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
But	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
care	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
O	NULL
no	NULL
--	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
care	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
'll	NULL
always	NULL
be	NULL
ugly	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
because	NULL
Angel	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
nobody	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
care	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
.	NULL

My	NULL
husband	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
is	NULL
gone	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
will	NULL
love	NULL
me	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
I	NULL
love	NULL
him	NULL
just	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hate	NULL
all	NULL
other	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
like	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
'em	NULL
think	NULL
scornfully	NULL
of	NULL
me	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

Thus	NULL
Tess	NULL
walks	NULL
on	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
figure	NULL
which	NULL
is	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
landscape	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
fieldwoman	NULL
pure	NULL
and	NULL
simple	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
winter	NULL
guise	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
gray	NULL
serge	NULL
cape	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
red	NULL
woollen	NULL
cravat	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
stuff	NULL
skirt	NULL
covered	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
whitey-brown	NULL
rough	NULL
wrapper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
buff-leather	NULL
gloves	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
thread	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
old	NULL
attire	NULL
has	NULL
become	NULL
faded	NULL
and	NULL
thin	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
stroke	NULL
of	NULL
raindrops	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
burn	NULL
of	NULL
sunbeams	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
stress	NULL
of	NULL
winds	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
young	NULL
passion	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
now	NULL
--	NULL
The	NULL
maiden	NULL
's	NULL
mouth	NULL
is	NULL
cold	NULL
. . .	NULL
Fold	NULL
over	NULL
simple	NULL
fold	NULL
Binding	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

Inside	NULL
this	NULL
exterior	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
roved	NULL
as	NULL
over	NULL
a	NULL
thing	NULL
scarcely	NULL
percipient	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
inorganic	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
record	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
pulsing	NULL
life	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
learnt	NULL
too	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
its	NULL
years	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dust	NULL
and	NULL
ashes	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cruelty	NULL
of	NULL
lust	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
fragility	NULL
of	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

Next	NULL
day	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
was	NULL
bad	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
trudged	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
honesty	NULL
,	NULL
directness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
impartiality	NULL
of	NULL
elemental	NULL
enmity	NULL
disconcerting	NULL
her	NULL
but	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
object	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
winter	NULL
's	NULL
occupation	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
winter	NULL
's	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
lose	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
experience	NULL
of	NULL
short	NULL
hirings	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
such	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
forward	NULL
from	NULL
farm	NULL
to	NULL
farm	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
whence	NULL
Marian	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
determined	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
last	NULL
shift	NULL
only	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
rumoured	NULL
stringencies	NULL
being	NULL
the	NULL
reverse	NULL
of	NULL
tempting	NULL
.	NULL

First	NULL
she	NULL
inquired	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
lighter	NULL
kinds	NULL
of	NULL
employment	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
acceptance	NULL
in	NULL
any	NULL
variety	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
grew	NULL
hopeless	NULL
,	NULL
applied	NULL
next	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
,	NULL
beginning	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
dairy	NULL
and	NULL
poultry	NULL
tendance	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
best	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
ended	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
heavy	NULL
and	NULL
course	NULL
pursuits	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
liked	NULL
least	NULL
--	NULL
work	NULL
on	NULL
arable	NULL
land	NULL
:	NULL
work	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
roughness	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
deliberately	NULL
voluteered	NULL
for	NULL
.	NULL

Towards	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
evening	NULL
she	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
irregular	NULL
chalk	NULL
table-land	NULL
or	NULL
plateau	NULL
,	NULL
bosomed	NULL
with	NULL
semi-globular	NULL
tumuli	NULL
--	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
Cybele	NULL
the	NULL
Many-breasted	NULL
were	NULL
supinely	NULL
extended	NULL
there	NULL
--	NULL
which	NULL
stretched	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
valley	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
birth	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
valley	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
love	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
was	NULL
dry	NULL
and	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
cart-roads	NULL
were	NULL
blown	NULL
white	NULL
and	NULL
dusty	NULL
within	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
hours	NULL
after	NULL
rain	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
were	NULL
few	NULL
trees	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
none	NULL
,	NULL
those	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
grown	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
hedges	NULL
being	NULL
mercilessly	NULL
plashed	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
quickset	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
tenant-farmers	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
natural	NULL
enemies	NULL
of	NULL
tree	NULL
,	NULL
bush	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
brake	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
distance	NULL
ahead	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
summits	NULL
of	NULL
Bulbarrow	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
Nettlecombe	NULL
Tout	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
seemed	NULL
friendly	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
and	NULL
unassuming	NULL
aspect	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
upland	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
as	NULL
approached	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
from	NULL
Blackmoor	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
childhood	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
as	NULL
lofty	NULL
bastions	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
.	NULL

Southerly	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
many	NULL
miles	NULL
'	NULL
distance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
hills	NULL
and	NULL
ridges	NULL
coastward	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
discern	NULL
a	NULL
surface	NULL
like	NULL
polished	NULL
steel	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
Channel	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
point	NULL
far	NULL
out	NULL
towards	NULL
France	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
depression	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
remains	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
village	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
fact	NULL
,	NULL
reached	NULL
Flintcomb-Ash	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
Marian	NULL
's	NULL
sojourn	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
help	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
hither	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
doomed	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
stubborn	NULL
soil	NULL
around	NULL
her	NULL
showed	NULL
plainly	NULL
enough	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
kind	NULL
of	NULL
labour	NULL
in	NULL
demand	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
roughest	NULL
kind	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
time	NULL
to	NULL
rest	NULL
from	NULL
searching	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
,	NULL
particularly	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
rain	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
entrance	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
cottage	NULL
whose	NULL
gable	NULL
jutted	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
before	NULL
applying	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
lodging	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
under	NULL
its	NULL
shelter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
watched	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
close	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Who	NULL
would	NULL
think	NULL
I	NULL
was	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Angel	NULL
Clare	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wall	NULL
felt	NULL
warm	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
and	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
immediately	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
gable	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
cottage	NULL
fireplace	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
heat	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
came	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
bricks	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
warmed	NULL
her	NULL
hands	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
also	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
cheek	NULL
--	NULL
red	NULL
and	NULL
moist	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
drizzle	NULL
--	NULL
against	NULL
their	NULL
comforting	NULL
surface	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wall	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
friend	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
so	NULL
little	NULL
wish	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
have	NULL
stayed	NULL
there	NULL
all	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
occupants	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
cottage	NULL
--	NULL
gathered	NULL
together	NULL
after	NULL
their	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
labour	NULL
--	NULL
talking	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
within	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rattle	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
supper-plates	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
audible	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
village-street	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
no	NULL
soul	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
solitude	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
broken	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
approach	NULL
of	NULL
one	NULL
feminine	NULL
figure	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
was	NULL
cold	NULL
,	NULL
wore	NULL
the	NULL
print	NULL
gown	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
tilt-bonnet	NULL
of	NULL
summer	NULL
time	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
instinctively	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
Marian	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
near	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
distinguishable	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
gloom	NULL
,	NULL
surely	NULL
enough	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
.	NULL

Marian	NULL
was	NULL
even	NULL
stouter	NULL
and	NULL
redder	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
than	NULL
formerly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
decidedly	NULL
shabbier	NULL
in	NULL
attire	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
previous	NULL
period	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
existence	NULL
Tess	NULL
would	NULL
hardly	NULL
have	NULL
cared	NULL
to	NULL
renew	NULL
the	NULL
acquaintance	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
conditions	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
loneliness	NULL
was	NULL
excessive	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
responded	NULL
readily	NULL
to	NULL
Marian	NULL
's	NULL
greeting	NULL
.	NULL

Marian	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
respectful	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
inquiries	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
seemed	NULL
much	NULL
moved	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
Tess	NULL
should	NULL
still	NULL
continue	NULL
in	NULL
no	NULL
better	NULL
condition	NULL
than	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
dimly	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

They	NULL
walked	NULL
on	NULL
together	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
farmhouse	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
sublime	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
dreariness	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
tree	NULL
within	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

at	NULL
this	NULL

nothing	NULL

fallow	NULL

everywhere	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
large	NULL
fields	NULL
divided	NULL
by	NULL
hedges	NULL
plashed	NULL
to	NULL
unrelieved	NULL
levels	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
waited	NULL
outside	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
farmhouse	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
group	NULL
of	NULL
workfolk	NULL
had	NULL
received	NULL
their	NULL
wages	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
Marian	NULL
introduced	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
farmer	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
appeared	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
represented	NULL
him	NULL
this	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
objection	NULL
to	NULL
hiring	NULL
Tess	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
agreeing	NULL
to	NULL
remain	NULL
till	NULL
Old	NULL
Lady-Day	NULL
.	NULL

Female	NULL
field-labour	NULL
was	NULL
seldom	NULL
offered	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
cheapness	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
profitable	NULL
for	NULL
tasks	NULL
which	NULL
women	NULL
could	NULL
perform	NULL
as	NULL
readily	NULL
as	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
signed	NULL
the	NULL
agreement	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
more	NULL
for	NULL
Tess	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
at	NULL
present	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
lodging	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
at	NULL
whose	NULL
gable-wall	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
warmed	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
poor	NULL
subsistence	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
ensured	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
afford	NULL
a	NULL
shelter	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
winter	NULL
at	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
night	NULL
she	NULL
wrote	NULL
to	NULL
inform	NULL
her	NULL
parents	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
new	NULL
address	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
should	NULL
arrive	NULL
at	NULL
Marlott	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
them	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sorriness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
situation	NULL
:	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
brought	NULL
reproach	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

XLIII	NULL
There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
exaggeration	NULL
in	NULL
Marian	NULL
's	NULL
definition	NULL
of	NULL
Flintcomb-Ash	NULL
farm	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
starve-acre	NULL
place	NULL

The	NULL
single	NULL
fat	NULL
thing	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
soil	NULL
was	NULL
Marian	NULL
herself	NULL

she	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL

Tess	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL

Patience	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
blending	NULL
of	NULL
moral	NULL
courage	NULL
with	NULL
physical	NULL
timidity	NULL

was	NULL
now	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
a	NULL
minor	NULL
feature	NULL
in	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Angel	NULL
Clare	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
sustained	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
swede-field	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
companion	NULL
were	NULL
set	NULL
hacking	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
stretch	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
hundred	NULL
odd	NULL
acres	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
patch	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
highest	NULL
ground	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
farm	NULL

rising	NULL
above	NULL
stony	NULL
lanchets	NULL

lynchets	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
outcrop	NULL
of	NULL
siliceous	NULL
veins	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
chalk	NULL
formation	NULL

composed	NULL
of	NULL
myriads	NULL
of	NULL
loose	NULL
white	NULL
flints	NULL
in	NULL
bulbous	NULL
,	NULL
cusped	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
phallic	NULL
shapes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
upper	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
turnip	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
eaten	NULL
off	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
live-stock	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
business	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
women	NULL
to	NULL
grub	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
or	NULL
earthy	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
root	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
hooked	NULL
fork	NULL
called	NULL
a	NULL
hacker	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
eaten	NULL
also	NULL
.	NULL

Every	NULL
leaf	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vegetable	NULL
having	NULL
already	NULL
been	NULL
consumed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
field	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
colour	NULL
a	NULL
desolate	NULL
drab	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
complexion	NULL
without	NULL
features	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
chin	NULL
to	NULL
brow	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
only	NULL
an	NULL
expanse	NULL
of	NULL
skin	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sky	NULL
wore	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
another	NULL
colour	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
likeness	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
vacuity	NULL
of	NULL
countenance	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
lineaments	NULL
gone	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
these	NULL
two	NULL
upper	NULL
and	NULL
nether	NULL
visages	NULL
confronted	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
all	NULL
day	NULL
long	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
face	NULL
looking	NULL
down	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
brown	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
brown	NULL
face	NULL
looking	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
anything	NULL
standing	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
girls	NULL
crawling	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
surface	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
former	NULL
like	NULL
flies	NULL
.	NULL

Nobody	NULL
came	NULL
near	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
movements	NULL
showed	NULL
a	NULL
mechanical	NULL
regularity	NULL
;	NULL
their	NULL
forms	NULL
standing	NULL
enshrouded	NULL
in	NULL
Hessian	NULL
"	NULL
wroppers	NULL
"	NULL
--	NULL
sleeved	NULL
brown	NULL
pinafores	NULL
,	NULL
tied	NULL
behind	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
their	NULL
gowns	NULL
from	NULL
blowing	NULL
about	NULL
--	NULL
scant	NULL
skirts	NULL
revealing	NULL
boots	NULL
that	NULL
reached	NULL
high	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
ankles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yellow	NULL
sheepskin	NULL
gloves	NULL
with	NULL
gauntlets	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pensive	NULL
character	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
curtained	NULL
hood	NULL
lent	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
bent	NULL
heads	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
reminded	NULL
the	NULL
observer	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
early	NULL
Italian	NULL
conception	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
Marys	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
worked	NULL
on	NULL
hour	NULL
after	NULL
hour	NULL
,	NULL
unconscious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
forlorn	NULL
aspect	NULL
they	NULL
bore	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
landscape	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
justice	NULL
or	NULL
injustice	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
lot	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
position	NULL
as	NULL
theirs	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
to	NULL
exist	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
the	NULL
rain	NULL
came	NULL
on	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Marian	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
need	NULL
not	NULL
work	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
work	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
paid	NULL
;	NULL
so	NULL
they	NULL
worked	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
high	NULL
a	NULL
situation	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
field	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
rain	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
occasion	NULL
to	NULL
fall	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
raced	NULL
along	NULL
horizontally	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
yelling	NULL
wind	NULL
,	NULL
sticking	NULL
into	NULL
them	NULL
like	NULL
glass	NULL
splinters	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
wet	NULL
through	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
known	NULL
till	NULL
now	NULL
what	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
meant	NULL
by	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
are	NULL
degrees	NULL
of	NULL
dampness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
little	NULL
is	NULL
called	NULL
being	NULL
wet	NULL
through	NULL
in	NULL
common	NULL
talk	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
working	NULL
slowly	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
field	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
feel	NULL
the	NULL
creep	NULL
of	NULL
rain-water	NULL
,	NULL
first	NULL
in	NULL
legs	NULL
and	NULL
shoulders	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
on	NULL
hips	NULL
and	NULL
head	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
at	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
front	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sides	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
on	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
leaden	NULL
light	NULL
diminishes	NULL
and	NULL
marks	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
is	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
demands	NULL
a	NULL
distinct	NULL
modicum	NULL
of	NULL
stoicism	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
of	NULL
valour	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
the	NULL
wetness	NULL
so	NULL
much	NULL
as	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
supposed	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
both	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
talking	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
lived	NULL
and	NULL
loved	NULL
together	NULL
at	NULL
Talbothays	NULL
Dairy	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
happy	NULL
green	NULL
tract	NULL
of	NULL
land	NULL
where	NULL
summer	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
liberal	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
gifts	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
substance	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
emotionally	NULL
to	NULL
these	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
would	NULL
fain	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
conversed	NULL
with	NULL
Marian	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
legally	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
actually	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
irresistible	NULL
fascination	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
betrayed	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
reciprocating	NULL
Marian	NULL
's	NULL
remarks	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
thus	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
damp	NULL
curtains	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
bonnets	NULL
flapped	NULL
smartly	NULL
into	NULL
their	NULL
faces	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
wrappers	NULL
clung	NULL
about	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
wearisomeness	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
lived	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
afternoon	NULL
in	NULL
memories	NULL
of	NULL
green	NULL
,	NULL
sunny	NULL
,	NULL
romantic	NULL
Talbothays	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
Tess	NULL
,	NULL
awake	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

So	NULL
the	NULL

forces	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
work	NULL

the	NULL
inherent	NULL

Marian	NULL
's	NULL

had	NULL
a	NULL
method	NULL
of	NULL
assisting	NULL
itself	NULL

taking	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL

as	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
wore	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL

corked	NULL
with	NULL
white	NULL

from	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
invited	NULL
Tess	NULL
to	NULL
drink	NULL

Tess	NULL

she	NULL
declined	NULL

then	NULL
Marian	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL

"	NULL

Tess	NULL
slaved	NULL
in	NULL

When	NULL
it	NULL

Still	NULL
Tess	NULL
hoped	NULL

had	NULL
a	NULL

sooner	NULL

the	NULL

shriek	NULL

Tess	NULL
remaining	NULL
severely	NULL
obtuse	NULL

They	NULL
often	NULL
looked	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
to	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL

Froom	NULL
was	NULL

,	NULL
fixing	NULL
their	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL

imagined	NULL
the	NULL

Tess	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL

the	NULL

There	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL

such	NULL
a	NULL

for	NULL

It	NULL
came	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
stealthy	NULL
and	NULL
measured	NULL
glides	NULL

like	NULL
the	NULL

One	NULL
morning	NULL
the	NULL

Every	NULL

grown	NULL
from	NULL

during	NULL

in	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
mournful	NULL
gray	NULL
of	NULL

this	NULL

came	NULL
a	NULL
spell	NULL
of	NULL
dry	NULL
frost	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
strange	NULL
birds	NULL
from	NULL
behind	NULL
the	NULL

began	NULL

arrive	NULL
silently	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL

and	NULL
retained	NULL
the	NULL
expression	NULL

.	NULL

These	NULL
nameless	NULL
birds	NULL
came	NULL
quite	NULL
near	NULL
to	NULL
Tess	NULL
and	NULL
Marian	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
which	NULL
humanity	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
brought	NULL
no	NULL
account	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
traveller	NULL
's	NULL
ambition	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
theirs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
dumb	NULL
impassivity	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
dismissed	NULL
experiences	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
value	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
immediate	NULL
incidents	NULL

this	NULL
homely	NULL
upland	NULL

hackers	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
uncover	NULL
something	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
that	NULL
these	NULL
visitants	NULL
relished	NULL
as	NULL
food	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
one	NULL
day	NULL
a	NULL
peculiar	NULL
quality	NULL
invaded	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
open	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
moisture	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
rain	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
of	NULL
frost	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
chilled	NULL
the	NULL
eyeballs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
twain	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
their	NULL
brows	NULL
ache	NULL
,	NULL
penetrated	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
skeletons	NULL
,	NULL
affecting	NULL
the	NULL
surface	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
body	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
its	NULL
core	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
meant	NULL
snow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
cottage	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
warm	NULL
gable	NULL
that	NULL
cheered	NULL
any	NULL
lonely	NULL
pedestrian	NULL
who	NULL
paused	NULL
beside	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
awoke	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
heard	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
thatch	NULL
noises	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
signify	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
roof	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
itself	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
gymnasium	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
winds	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
lit	NULL
her	NULL
lamp	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
had	NULL
blown	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
chink	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
casement	NULL
,	NULL
forming	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
cone	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
finest	NULL
powder	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
inside	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
also	NULL
come	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
chimney	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
lay	NULL
sole-deep	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
shoes	NULL
left	NULL
tracks	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
moved	NULL
about	NULL
.	NULL

Without	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
storm	NULL
drove	NULL
so	NULL
fast	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
create	NULL
a	NULL
snow-mist	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
kitchen	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
dark	NULL
out-of-doors	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
anything	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
swedes	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
finished	NULL
breakfast	NULL
beside	NULL
the	NULL
solitary	NULL
little	NULL
lamp	NULL
,	NULL
Marian	NULL
arrived	NULL
to	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
to	NULL
join	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
at	NULL
reed-drawing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
barn	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
changed	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
uniform	NULL
cloak	NULL
of	NULL
darkness	NULL
without	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
disordered	NULL
medley	NULL
of	NULL
grays	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
blew	NULL
out	NULL
the	NULL
lamp	NULL
,	NULL
wrapped	NULL
themselves	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
thickest	NULL
pinners	NULL
,	NULL
tied	NULL
their	NULL
woollen	NULL
cravats	NULL
round	NULL
their	NULL
necks	NULL
and	NULL
across	NULL
their	NULL
chests	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
started	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
barn	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
snow	NULL
had	NULL
followed	NULL
the	NULL
birds	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
polar	NULL
basin	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
pillar	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cloud	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
individual	NULL
flakes	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
blast	NULL
smelt	NULL
of	NULL
icebergs	NULL
,	NULL
arctic	NULL
seas	NULL
,	NULL
whales	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
white	NULL
bears	NULL
,	NULL
carrying	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
so	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
licked	NULL
the	NULL
land	NULL
but	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
deepen	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
trudged	NULL
onwards	NULL
with	NULL
slanted	NULL
bodies	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
flossy	NULL
fields	NULL
,	NULL
keeping	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shelter	NULL
of	NULL
hedges	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
acted	NULL
as	NULL
strainers	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
screens	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
air	NULL
,	NULL
afflicted	NULL
to	NULL
pallor	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
hoary	NULL
multitudes	NULL
that	NULL
infested	NULL
it	NULL

twisted	NULL
and	NULL
spun	NULL
them	NULL
eccentrically	NULL
,	NULL
suggesting	NULL
an	NULL
achromatic	NULL

In	NULL
addition	NULL
to	NULL
Tess	NULL
,	NULL
Marian	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Izz	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
two	NULL
women	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
neighbouring	NULL
village	NULL
;	NULL
two	NULL
Amazonian	NULL
sisters	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
Tess	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
start	NULL
remembered	NULL
as	NULL
Dark	NULL
Car	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Queen	NULL
of	NULL
Spades	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
junior	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Queen	NULL
of	NULL
Diamonds	NULL
--	NULL
those	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
tried	NULL
to	NULL
fight	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midnight	NULL
quarrel	NULL
at	NULL
Trantridge	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
showed	NULL
no	NULL
recognition	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
possibly	NULL
had	NULL
none	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
influence	NULL
of	NULL
liquor	NULL
on	NULL
that	NULL
occasion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
only	NULL
temporary	NULL
sojourners	NULL
there	NULL
as	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
did	NULL
all	NULL
kinds	NULL
of	NULL
men	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
by	NULL
preference	NULL
,	NULL
including	NULL
well-sinking	NULL
,	NULL
hedging	NULL
,	NULL
ditching	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
excavating	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
fatigue	NULL
.	NULL

Noted	NULL
reed-drawers	NULL
were	NULL
they	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
round	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
three	NULL
with	NULL
some	NULL
superciliousness	NULL
.	NULL

Putting	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
gloves	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
set	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
row	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
press	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
erection	NULL
formed	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
posts	NULL
connected	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
cross-beam	NULL
,	NULL
under	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
sheaves	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
drawn	NULL
from	NULL
were	NULL
laid	NULL
ears	NULL
outward	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
beam	NULL
being	NULL
pegged	NULL
down	NULL
by	NULL
pins	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
uprights	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lowered	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
sheaves	NULL
diminished	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
day	NULL
hardened	NULL
in	NULL
colour	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
coming	NULL
in	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
barndoors	NULL
upwards	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
downwards	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
girls	NULL
pulled	NULL
handful	NULL
after	NULL
handful	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
press	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
by	NULL
reason	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
strange	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
were	NULL
recounting	NULL
scandals	NULL
,	NULL
Marian	NULL
and	NULL
Izz	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
talk	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
times	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

Presently	NULL
they	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
muffled	NULL
tread	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
horse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
farmer	NULL
rode	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
barndoor	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
dismounted	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
Tess	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
remained	NULL
looking	NULL
musingly	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
turned	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
his	NULL
fixed	NULL
attitude	NULL
led	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
round	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
perceived	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
employer	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
native	NULL
of	NULL
Trantridge	NULL
from	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
flight	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
high-road	NULL
because	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
allusion	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
history	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
waited	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
carried	NULL
the	NULL
drawn	NULL
bundles	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
pile	NULL
outside	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL

concluded	NULL

between	NULL

He	NULL
looked	NULL
sullenly	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

went	NULL
away	NULL

a	NULL

arrived	NULL
the	NULL
professional	NULL
reed-drawers	NULL
tossed	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
half-pint	NULL

a	NULL

stood	NULL
the	NULL

Tess	NULL
urged	NULL
Izz	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
off	NULL

agreeing	NULL

as	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
better	NULL

make	NULL
equal	NULL

Izz	NULL
accepted	NULL

disappeared	NULL

her	NULL

Marian	NULL

every	NULL

at	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL

began	NULL

I	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL

this	NULL

Tess	NULL

at	NULL

narrowly	NULL
missed	NULL

off	NULL

Tess	NULL
's	NULL

faded	NULL
as	NULL
white	NULL

the	NULL
scene	NULL
without	NULL

its	NULL

straightened	NULL

Izz	NULL
refuse	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL

he	NULL
changed	NULL
his	NULL

He	NULL

They	NULL
pulled	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
silence	NULL

Tess	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL

burst	NULL
out	NULL

No	NULL

It	NULL

I	NULL

he	NULL

"	NULL

The	NULL
dim	NULL
light	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
barn	NULL
grew	NULL
dimmer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL

When	NULL
Tess	NULL
had	NULL
reached	NULL
home	NULL
that	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
entered	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
privacy	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
little	NULL
white-washed	NULL
chamber	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
impetuously	NULL
writing	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
Clare	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
falling	NULL
into	NULL
doubt	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
finish	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Afterwards	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
the	NULL
ring	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
ribbon	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
wore	NULL
it	NULL
next	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL

and	NULL
retained	NULL
it	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
finger	NULL
all	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
to	NULL
fortify	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
sensation	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL
the	NULL
wife	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
elusive	NULL
lover	NULL
of	NULL
hers	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
could	NULL
propose	NULL
that	NULL
Izz	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
abroad	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
shortly	NULL
after	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Knowing	NULL
that	NULL

how	NULL
could	NULL
she	NULL
write	NULL
entreaties	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
show	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
cared	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL
?	NULL

XLIV	NULL
By	NULL
the	NULL
disclosure	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
barn	NULL
her	NULL
thoughts	NULL
were	NULL
led	NULL
anew	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
once	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
--	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
distant	NULL
Emminster	NULL
Vicarage	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
parents	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
charged	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
a	NULL
letter	NULL
to	NULL
Clare	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
desired	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
write	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
direct	NULL
if	NULL
in	NULL
difficulty	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
that	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
having	NULL
morally	NULL
no	NULL
claim	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
had	NULL
always	NULL
led	NULL
Tess	NULL
to	NULL
suspend	NULL
her	NULL
impulse	NULL
to	NULL
send	NULL
these	NULL
notes	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Vicarage	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
parents	NULL
since	NULL
her	NULL
marriage	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
virtually	NULL
non-existent	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
self-effacement	NULL
in	NULL
both	NULL
directions	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
quite	NULL
in	NULL
consonance	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
independent	NULL
character	NULL
of	NULL
desiring	NULL
nothing	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
favour	NULL
or	NULL
pity	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
entitled	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
fair	NULL
consideration	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
deserts	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
set	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
stand	NULL
or	NULL
fall	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
qualities	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
waive	NULL
such	NULL
merely	NULL
technical	NULL
claims	NULL
upon	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
family	NULL
as	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
established	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
flimsy	NULL
fact	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
member	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
season	NULL
of	NULL
impulse	NULL
,	NULL
writing	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
church-book	NULL
beside	NULL
hers	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
stung	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
fever	NULL
by	NULL
Izz	NULL
's	NULL
tale	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
limit	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
powers	NULL
of	NULL
renunciation	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
had	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
not	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
distinctly	NULL
implied	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
know	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
locality	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
journeyed	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
sent	NULL
a	NULL
line	NULL
to	NULL
notify	NULL
his	NULL
address	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
he	NULL
really	NULL
indifferent	NULL
?	NULL

But	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
ill	NULL
?	NULL

Was	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
some	NULL
advance	NULL
?	NULL

Surely	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
summon	NULL
the	NULL
courage	NULL
of	NULL
solicitude	NULL
,	NULL
call	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Vicarage	NULL
for	NULL
intelligence	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
express	NULL
her	NULL
grief	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
silence	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Angel	NULL
's	NULL
father	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
good	NULL
man	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
heard	NULL
him	NULL
represented	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
able	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
heart-starved	NULL
situation	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
social	NULL
hardships	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
conceal	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
leave	NULL
the	NULL
farm	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
week-day	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
power	NULL
;	NULL
Sunday	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
possible	NULL
opportunity	NULL

railway	NULL
had	NULL
climbed	NULL
as	NULL

it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
being	NULL
fifteen	NULL
miles	NULL
each	NULL
way	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
allow	NULL
herself	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
day	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
undertaking	NULL
by	NULL
rising	NULL
early	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
fortnight	NULL
later	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
snow	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
followed	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
hard	NULL
black	NULL
frost	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
took	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
roads	NULL
to	NULL
try	NULL
the	NULL
experiment	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
four	NULL
o'clock	NULL
that	NULL
Sunday	NULL
morning	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
downstairs	NULL
and	NULL
stepped	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
starlight	NULL

The	NULL
weather	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
favourable	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
ringing	NULL
under	NULL
her	NULL
feet	NULL
like	NULL
an	NULL
anvil	NULL
.	NULL

Marian	NULL
and	NULL
Izz	NULL
were	NULL
much	NULL
interested	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
excursion	NULL
,	NULL
knowing	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
journey	NULL
concerned	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
lodgings	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cottage	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
further	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
and	NULL
assisted	NULL
Tess	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
departure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
argued	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
dress	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
very	NULL
prettiest	NULL
guise	NULL
to	NULL
captivate	NULL
the	NULL
hearts	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
parents-in-law	NULL

Mr	NULL
Clare	NULL

A	NULL
year	NULL

had	NULL
preserved	NULL

her	NULL

full	NULL

said	NULL
Izz	NULL

regarding	NULL

on	NULL
the	NULL
threshold	NULL
between	NULL

the	NULL

Izz	NULL
spoke	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL

of	NULL
herself	NULL

exercised	NULL
over	NULL

strength	NULL
quite	NULL

curiously	NULL
overpowering	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
worthy	NULL
feminine	NULL
feelings	NULL
of	NULL

rivalry	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
a	NULL
final	NULL
tug	NULL
and	NULL
touch	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
slight	NULL
brush	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
let	NULL
her	NULL
go	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
absorbed	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
pearly	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fore-dawn	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
footsteps	NULL
tap	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
hard	NULL
road	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
stepped	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
full	NULL
pace	NULL

Even	NULL
Izz	NULL
hoped	NULL

,	NULL
though	NULL
without	NULL
any	NULL
particular	NULL
respect	NULL

felt	NULL

when	NULL
momentarily	NULL
tempted	NULL
by	NULL
Clare	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Clare	NULL
had	NULL
married	NULL
Tess	NULL

and	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
year	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
absent	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
start	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
brisk	NULL
walk	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
on	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
errand	NULL
as	NULL
hers	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
dry	NULL
clear	NULL
wintry	NULL
morning	NULL

through	NULL
the	NULL
rarefied	NULL
air	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
chalky	NULL
hogs	NULL

was	NULL
not	NULL

and	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL

In	NULL

which	NULL
stretched	NULL

this	NULL
height	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
meshes	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
net	NULL
.	NULL

Here	NULL
the	NULL
landscape	NULL
was	NULL
whitey-brown	NULL
;	NULL
down	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
Froom	NULL
Valley	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
green	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
vale	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
sorrow	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
shape	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
love	NULL
it	NULL
as	NULL
formerly	NULL
.	NULL

Beauty	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
all	NULL
who	NULL
have	NULL
felt	NULL
,	NULL
lay	NULL
not	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
symbolized	NULL
.	NULL

Keeping	NULL
the	NULL
Vale	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
steered	NULL
steadily	NULL
westward	NULL
;	NULL
passing	NULL
above	NULL
the	NULL
Hintocks	NULL
,	NULL
crossing	NULL
at	NULL
right-angles	NULL
the	NULL
high-road	NULL
from	NULL
Sherton-Abbas	NULL
to	NULL
Casterbridge	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
skirting	NULL
Dogbury	NULL
Hill	NULL
and	NULL
High-Stoy	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
dell	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
called	NULL
"	NULL
The	NULL
Devil	NULL
's	NULL
Kitchen	NULL
"	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
following	NULL
the	NULL
elevated	NULL
way	NULL
she	NULL
reached	NULL
Cross-in-Hand	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
stone	NULL
pillar	NULL
stands	NULL
desolate	NULL
and	NULL
silent	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
mark	NULL
the	NULL
site	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
miracle	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
murder	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
both	NULL
.	NULL

Three	NULL
miles	NULL
further	NULL
she	NULL
cut	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
straight	NULL
and	NULL
deserted	NULL
Roman	NULL
road	NULL
called	NULL
Long-Ash	NULL
Lane	NULL
;	NULL
leaving	NULL
which	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
reached	NULL
it	NULL
she	NULL
dipped	NULL
down	NULL
a	NULL
hill	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
transverse	NULL
lane	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
town	NULL
or	NULL
village	NULL
of	NULL
Evershead	NULL
,	NULL
being	NULL
now	NULL
about	NULL
halfway	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
halt	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
breakfasted	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
heartily	NULL
enough	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
Sow-and-Acorn	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
she	NULL
avoided	NULL
inns	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
cottage	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
second	NULL
half	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
journey	NULL
was	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
more	NULL
gentle	NULL
country	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
Benvill	NULL
Lane	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
mileage	NULL
lessened	NULL
between	NULL
her	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
pilgrimage	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
did	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
confidence	NULL
decrease	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
enterprise	NULL
loom	NULL
out	NULL
more	NULL
formidably	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
purpose	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
staring	NULL
lines	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
landscape	NULL
so	NULL
faintly	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
sometimes	NULL
in	NULL
danger	NULL
of	NULL
losing	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
noon	NULL
she	NULL
paused	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
gate	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
basin	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Emminster	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
Vicarage	NULL
lay	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
square	NULL
tower	NULL
,	NULL
beneath	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
congregation	NULL
were	NULL
gathered	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
severe	NULL
look	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
wished	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
somehow	NULL
contrived	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
week-day	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
man	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
prejudiced	NULL
against	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
chosen	NULL
Sunday	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
realizing	NULL
the	NULL
necessities	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
case	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
incumbent	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
on	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
took	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
thick	NULL
boots	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
walked	NULL
thus	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
pretty	NULL
thin	NULL
ones	NULL
of	NULL
patent	NULL
leather	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
stuffing	NULL
the	NULL
former	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
hedge	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
gatepost	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
readily	NULL
find	NULL
them	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
descended	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
freshness	NULL
of	NULL
colour	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
derived	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
keen	NULL
air	NULL
thinning	NULL
away	NULL
in	NULL
spite	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
drew	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
parsonage	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
hoped	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
accident	NULL
that	NULL
might	NULL
favour	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
nothing	NULL
favoured	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
shrubs	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
Vicarage	NULL
lawn	NULL
rustled	NULL
uncomfortably	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
frosty	NULL
breeze	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
feel	NULL
by	NULL
any	NULL
stretch	NULL
of	NULL
imagination	NULL
,	NULL
dressed	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
highest	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
residence	NULL
of	NULL
near	NULL
relations	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
yet	NULL
nothing	NULL
essential	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
nature	NULL
or	NULL
emotion	NULL
,	NULL
divided	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
them	NULL
:	NULL
in	NULL
pains	NULL
,	NULL
pleasures	NULL
,	NULL
thoughts	NULL
,	NULL
birth	NULL
,	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after-death	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
nerved	NULL
herself	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
effort	NULL
,	NULL
entered	NULL
the	NULL
swing-gate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rang	NULL
the	NULL
door-bell	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
retreat	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
thing	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

Nobody	NULL
answered	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
ringing	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
effort	NULL
had	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
risen	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
rang	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
agitation	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
act	NULL
,	NULL
coupled	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
weariness	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
fifteen	NULL
miles	NULL
'	NULL
walk	NULL
,	NULL
led	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
support	NULL
herself	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
waited	NULL
by	NULL
resting	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
hip	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
elbow	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
porch	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wind	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
nipping	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
ivy-leaves	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
wizened	NULL
and	NULL
gray	NULL
,	NULL
each	NULL
tapping	NULL
incessantly	NULL
upon	NULL
its	NULL
neighbour	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
disquieting	NULL
stir	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
nerves	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
blood-stained	NULL
paper	NULL
,	NULL
caught	NULL
up	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
meat-buyer	NULL
's	NULL
dust-heap	NULL
,	NULL
beat	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
;	NULL
too	NULL
flimsy	NULL
to	NULL
rest	NULL
,	NULL
too	NULL
heavy	NULL
to	NULL
fly	NULL
away	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
straws	NULL
kept	NULL
it	NULL
company	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
second	NULL
peal	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
louder	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
nobody	NULL
came	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
porch	NULL
,	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
through	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
looked	NULL
dubiously	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
house-front	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
return	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
breath	NULL
of	NULL
relied	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
feeling	NULL
haunted	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
recognized	NULL
(	NULL
though	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
tell	NULL
)	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
orders	NULL
been	NULL
given	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
admit	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
went	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
all	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
determined	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
escape	NULL
present	NULL
trepidation	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
expense	NULL
of	NULL
future	NULL
distress	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
back	NULL
again	NULL
quite	NULL
past	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
.	NULL

Ah	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
explanation	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
at	NULL
church	NULL
,	NULL
every	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
remembered	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
always	NULL
insisted	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
household	NULL
,	NULL
servants	NULL
included	NULL
,	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
morning-service	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
consequence	NULL
,	NULL
eating	NULL
cold	NULL
food	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
therefore	NULL
,	NULL
only	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
service	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
make	NULL
herself	NULL
conspicuous	NULL
by	NULL
waiting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
started	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
past	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
churchyard-gate	NULL
the	NULL
people	NULL
began	NULL
pouring	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Tess	NULL
found	NULL
herself	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Emminster	NULL
congregation	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
only	NULL
a	NULL
congregation	NULL
of	NULL
small	NULL
country-townsfolk	NULL
walking	NULL
home	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
leisure	NULL
can	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
common	NULL
whom	NULL
it	NULL
perceives	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
stranger	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
quickened	NULL
her	NULL
pace	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ascended	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
a	NULL
retreat	NULL
between	NULL
its	NULL
hedges	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
Vicar	NULL
's	NULL
family	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
lunched	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
convenient	NULL
for	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
receive	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
soon	NULL
distanced	NULL
the	NULL
churchgoers	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
two	NULL
youngish	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
linked	NULL
arm-in-arm	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
beating	NULL
up	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
quick	NULL
step	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
they	NULL
drew	NULL
nearer	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL
their	NULL
voices	NULL
engaged	NULL
in	NULL
earnest	NULL
discourse	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
natural	NULL
quickness	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
situation	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
fail	NULL
to	NULL
recognize	NULL
in	NULL
those	NULL
noises	NULL
the	NULL
quality	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
husband	NULL
's	NULL
tones	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pedestrians	NULL
were	NULL
his	NULL
two	NULL
brothers	NULL
.	NULL

Forgetting	NULL
all	NULL
her	NULL
plans	NULL
,	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
one	NULL
dread	NULL
was	NULL
lest	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
overtake	NULL
her	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
disorganized	NULL
condition	NULL
,	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
prepared	NULL
to	NULL
confront	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
identify	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
instinctively	NULL
dreaded	NULL
their	NULL
scrutiny	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
more	NULL
briskly	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
briskly	NULL
walked	NULL
she	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
plainly	NULL
bent	NULL
upon	NULL
taking	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
quick	NULL
stroll	NULL
before	NULL
going	NULL
indoors	NULL
to	NULL
lunch	NULL
or	NULL
dinner	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
restore	NULL
warmth	NULL
to	NULL
limbs	NULL
chilled	NULL
with	NULL
sitting	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
service	NULL
.	NULL

Only	NULL
one	NULL
person	NULL
had	NULL
preceded	NULL
Tess	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
ladylike	NULL
young	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
somewhat	NULL
interesting	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
trifle	NULL
_	NULL
guindée	NULL
_	NULL
and	NULL
prudish	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
had	NULL
nearly	NULL
overtaken	NULL
her	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
speed	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
brothers-in-law	NULL
brought	NULL
them	NULL
so	NULL
nearly	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
back	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL
every	NULL
word	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
conversation	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
said	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
particularly	NULL
interested	NULL
her	NULL
till	NULL
,	NULL
observing	NULL
the	NULL
young	NULL
lady	NULL
still	NULL
further	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
remarked	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
There	NULL
is	NULL
Mercy	NULL
Chant	NULL
.	NULL

Let	NULL
us	NULL
overtake	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Tess	NULL
knew	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
destined	NULL
for	NULL
Angel	NULL
's	NULL
life-companion	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
parents	NULL

and	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
probably	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
married	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
intrusive	NULL
self	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
known	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
without	NULL
previous	NULL
information	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
waited	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
brothers	NULL
proceeded	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL

Tess	NULL
beat	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
hill	NULL
still	NULL
faster	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
outwalk	NULL
them	NULL
without	NULL
exciting	NULL
notice	NULL

At	NULL
last	NULL
they	NULL
outsped	NULL
her	NULL
altogether	NULL

and	NULL
passed	NULL
her	NULL
by	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
young	NULL
lady	NULL
still	NULL
further	NULL
ahead	NULL
heard	NULL
their	NULL
footsteps	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
greeting	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
shaking	NULL
of	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
three	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
soon	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
summit	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL

,	NULL
evidently	NULL
intending	NULL
this	NULL

the	NULL

their	NULL

slackened	NULL

turned	NULL
all	NULL

aside	NULL

the	NULL

Cuthbert	NULL

presently	NULL

retreated	NULL

Thereupon	NULL

walk	NULL

Tears	NULL

were	NULL
running	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL

She	NULL

all	NULL

all	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
impossible	NULL

Angel	NULL

almost	NULL

to	NULL
her	NULL

superfine	NULL

Innocently	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
slight	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
inflicted	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
somewhat	NULL
unfortunate	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL

encountered	NULL
the	NULL
sons	NULL

not	NULL
the	NULL
father	NULL

who	NULL
,	NULL
despite	NULL
his	NULL

less	NULL

the	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
again	NULL
thought	NULL

she	NULL
almost	NULL
pitied	NULL

she	NULL

still	NULL
sighing	NULL
in	NULL
pity	NULL

herself	NULL

"	NULL

Then	NULL
she	NULL
grieved	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
beloved	NULL
man	NULL
whose	NULL
conventional	NULL
standard	NULL
of	NULL
judgement	NULL
had	NULL
caused	NULL
her	NULL
all	NULL
these	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
without	NULL
knowing	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
misfortune	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
feminine	NULL
loss	NULL
of	NULL
courage	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
and	NULL
critical	NULL
moment	NULL
through	NULL
her	NULL
estimating	NULL
her	NULL
father-in-law	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
sons	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
present	NULL
condition	NULL
was	NULL
precisely	NULL
one	NULL
which	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
enlisted	NULL
the	NULL
sympathies	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
Mr	NULL
and	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Clare	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
hearts	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
bound	NULL
towards	NULL
extreme	NULL
cases	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
subtle	NULL
mental	NULL
troubles	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
less	NULL
desperate	NULL
among	NULL
mankind	NULL
failed	NULL
to	NULL
win	NULL
their	NULL
interest	NULL
or	NULL
regard	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
jumping	NULL
at	NULL
Publicans	NULL
and	NULL
Sinners	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
forget	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
said	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
worries	NULL
of	NULL
Scribes	NULL
and	NULL
Pharisees	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
defect	NULL

limitation	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
recommended	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
daughter-in-law	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
moment	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
fairly	NULL
choice	NULL
sort	NULL
of	NULL
lost	NULL
person	NULL
for	NULL
their	NULL
love	NULL

Thereupon	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
plod	NULL
back	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
not	NULL
altogether	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
hope	NULL

but	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
conviction	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
crisis	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
approaching	NULL
.	NULL

No	NULL
crisis	NULL
,	NULL
apparently	NULL

had	NULL
supervened	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nothing	NULL
left	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL

do	NULL

to	NULL
continue	NULL
upon	NULL
that	NULL
starve-acre	NULL
farm	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
again	NULL
summon	NULL
courage	NULL
to	NULL
face	NULL
the	NULL
Vicarage	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
,	NULL
indeed	NULL
,	NULL
take	NULL
sufficient	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
up	NULL
her	NULL
veil	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
return	NULL
journey	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
to	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
exhibit	NULL
a	NULL
face	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
Mercy	NULL
Chant	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
show	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sorry	NULL
shake	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
nothing	NULL

it	NULL
is	NULL
nothing	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL

Her	NULL
journey	NULL
back	NULL
was	NULL
rather	NULL
a	NULL
meander	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
march	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL

no	NULL

only	NULL
a	NULL
tendency	NULL

Along	NULL
the	NULL
tedious	NULL
length	NULL
of	NULL
Benvill	NULL
Lane	NULL
she	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
tired	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
leant	NULL
upon	NULL
gates	NULL
and	NULL
paused	NULL
by	NULL
milestones	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
enter	NULL
any	NULL
house	NULL
till	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
seventh	NULL
or	NULL
eighth	NULL
mile	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
descended	NULL
the	NULL
steep	NULL
long	NULL
hill	NULL
below	NULL
which	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL

townlet	NULL

where	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
breakfasted	NULL

The	NULL
cottage	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL

in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
again	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL

the	NULL

milk	NULL
from	NULL

Tess	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL

perceived	NULL
that	NULL

quite	NULL
deserted	NULL

"	NULL
Tess	NULL
soon	NULL
went	NULL
onward	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
footsteps	NULL
echoing	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
houses	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
it	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
place	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dead	NULL
.	NULL

Nearing	NULL
the	NULL
central	NULL
part	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
echoes	NULL
were	NULL
intruded	NULL
on	NULL
by	NULL
other	NULL
sounds	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
seeing	NULL
the	NULL
barn	NULL
not	NULL
far	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
guessed	NULL
these	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
the	NULL
utterances	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
preacher	NULL

His	NULL
voice	NULL
became	NULL
so	NULL
distinct	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
still	NULL
clear	NULL
air	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
soon	NULL
catch	NULL
his	NULL
sentences	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
closed	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
barn	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sermon	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
expected	NULL

was	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
extremest	NULL
antinomian	NULL
type	NULL

on	NULL
justification	NULL
by	NULL
faith	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
expounded	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
theology	NULL
of	NULL
St	NULL
Paul	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
fixed	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rhapsodist	NULL
was	NULL
delivered	NULL
with	NULL
animated	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
manner	NULL
entirely	NULL
declamatory	NULL

for	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
plainly	NULL
no	NULL
skill	NULL
as	NULL

dialectician	NULL
.	NULL

Although	NULL
Tess	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
heard	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
address	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
learnt	NULL
what	NULL
the	NULL
text	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
constant	NULL
iteration	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL

Tess	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
interested	NULL

as	NULL
she	NULL
stood	NULL
listening	NULL
behind	NULL

in	NULL
finding	NULL
that	NULL

a	NULL
vehement	NULL
form	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
view	NULL

Angel	NULL
's	NULL
father	NULL

and	NULL
her	NULL
interest	NULL
intensified	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
speaker	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
detail	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
spiritual	NULL
experiences	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
by	NULL
those	NULL
views	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL

been	NULL
the	NULL
greatest	NULL
of	NULL
sinners	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
scoffed	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
wantonly	NULL
associated	NULL

the	NULL

But	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
awakening	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
human	NULL
sense	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
brought	NULL
about	NULL
mainly	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
influence	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
certain	NULL
clergyman	NULL

whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
grossly	NULL
insulted	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
whose	NULL
parting	NULL
words	NULL
had	NULL
sunk	NULL
into	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
remained	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
grace	NULL
of	NULL
Heaven	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
worked	NULL
this	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
more	NULL
startling	NULL
to	NULL
Tess	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
doctrine	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
voice	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
impossible	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
precisely	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
Alec	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
face	NULL
fixed	NULL
in	NULL
painful	NULL
suspense	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
round	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
barn	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
passed	NULL
before	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
low	NULL
winter	NULL
sun	NULL
beamed	NULL
directly	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
double-doored	NULL
entrance	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
side	NULL

one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
doors	NULL

open	NULL

so	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
rays	NULL
stretched	NULL

over	NULL

to	NULL
the	NULL

and	NULL
his	NULL
audience	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
snugly	NULL
sheltered	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL

her	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

and	NULL
to	NULL
hinder	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
second	NULL

To	NULL
Tess	NULL

was	NULL

just	NULL
at	NULL

a	NULL
ghastly	NULL

of	NULL
these	NULL

out	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
mouth	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
too	NULL
familiar	NULL
intonation	NULL
,	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
four	NULL
years	NULL
earlier	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
ears	NULL
expressions	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
divergent	NULL
purpose	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
became	NULL
quite	NULL
sick	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
irony	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
contrast	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
a	NULL
reform	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
transfiguration	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
former	NULL
curves	NULL
of	NULL
sensuousness	NULL
were	NULL
now	NULL
modulated	NULL
to	NULL
lines	NULL
of	NULL
devotional	NULL
passion	NULL
.	NULL

to	NULL
express	NULL
supplication	NULL

the	NULL
glow	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
cheek	NULL
that	NULL
yesterday	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
translated	NULL
as	NULL
riotousness	NULL
was	NULL
evangelized	NULL
to-day	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
splendour	NULL
of	NULL
pious	NULL
rhetoric	NULL
;	NULL

had	NULL
become	NULL
fanaticism	NULL
;	NULL
Paganism	NULL

Paulinism	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
bold	NULL
rolling	NULL
eye	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
flashed	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
form	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
time	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
mastery	NULL
now	NULL
beamed	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
rude	NULL
energy	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
theolatry	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
ferocious	NULL
.	NULL

Those	NULL
black	NULL
angularities	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
had	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
put	NULL
on	NULL
when	NULL
his	NULL
wishes	NULL
were	NULL
thwarted	NULL
now	NULL
did	NULL
duty	NULL
in	NULL
picturing	NULL
the	NULL
incorrigible	NULL
backslider	NULL
who	NULL
would	NULL
insist	NULL
upon	NULL
turning	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
wallowing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
mire	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lineaments	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
such	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
complain	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
diverted	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
hereditary	NULL
connotation	NULL
to	NULL
signify	NULL
impressions	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
Nature	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
intend	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

Strange	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
very	NULL
elevation	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
misapplication	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
to	NULL
raise	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
falsify	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
could	NULL
it	NULL
be	NULL
so	NULL
?	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
admit	NULL
the	NULL
ungenerous	NULL
sentiment	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
.	NULL

D'Urberville	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
wicked	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
wickedness	NULL
to	NULL
save	NULL
his	NULL
soul	NULL
alive	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
why	NULL
should	NULL
she	NULL
deem	NULL
it	NULL
unnatural	NULL
in	NULL
him	NULL
?	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
usage	NULL
of	NULL
thought	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
jarred	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
hearing	NULL
good	NULL
new	NULL
words	NULL
in	NULL
bad	NULL
old	NULL
notes	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
greater	NULL
the	NULL
sinner	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
the	NULL
saint	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
dive	NULL
far	NULL
into	NULL
Christian	NULL
history	NULL
to	NULL
discover	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

Such	NULL
impressions	NULL
as	NULL
these	NULL
moved	NULL
her	NULL
vaguely	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
strict	NULL
definiteness	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
nerveless	NULL
pause	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
surprise	NULL
would	NULL
allow	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
stir	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
impulse	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
on	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
sight	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
obviously	NULL
not	NULL
discerned	NULL
her	NULL
yet	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
position	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
moved	NULL
again	NULL
he	NULL
recognized	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
effect	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
lover	NULL
was	NULL
electric	NULL
,	NULL
far	NULL
stronger	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
presence	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
tumultuous	NULL
ring	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
eloquence	NULL
,	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
lip	NULL
struggled	NULL
and	NULL
trembled	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
words	NULL
that	NULL
lay	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
deliver	NULL
them	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
faced	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
their	NULL
first	NULL
glance	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
hung	NULL
confusedly	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
other	NULL
direction	NULL
but	NULL
hers	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
desperate	NULL
leap	NULL
every	NULL
few	NULL
seconds	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
paralysis	NULL
lasted	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
time	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
energies	NULL
returned	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
atrophy	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
as	NULL
fast	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
able	NULL
past	NULL
the	NULL
barn	NULL
and	NULL
onward	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
reflect	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
appalled	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
relative	NULL
platforms	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
wrought	NULL
her	NULL
undoing	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Spirit	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
she	NULL
remained	NULL
unregenerate	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
legend	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
resulted	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
Cyprian	NULL
image	NULL
had	NULL
suddenly	NULL
appeared	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
altar	NULL
,	NULL
whereby	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
priest	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
well	NULL
nigh	NULL
extinguished	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
without	NULL
turning	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
back	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
endowed	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
sensitiveness	NULL
to	NULL
ocular	NULL
beams	NULL
--	NULL
even	NULL
her	NULL
clothing	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
alive	NULL
was	NULL
she	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
fancied	NULL
gaze	NULL
which	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
resting	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
outside	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
barn	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
along	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
point	NULL
her	NULL
heart	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
heavy	NULL
with	NULL
an	NULL
inactive	NULL
sorrow	NULL
;	NULL
now	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
change	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
quality	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
trouble	NULL
.	NULL

That	NULL
hunger	NULL
for	NULL
affection	NULL
too	NULL
long	NULL
withheld	NULL
was	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
displaced	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
almost	NULL
physical	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
implacable	NULL
past	NULL
which	NULL
still	NULL
engirdled	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
intensified	NULL
her	NULL
consciousness	NULL
of	NULL
error	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
practical	NULL
despair	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
break	NULL
of	NULL
continuity	NULL
between	NULL
her	NULL
earlier	NULL
and	NULL
present	NULL
existence	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
hoped	NULL
for	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
after	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
taken	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

Bygones	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
be	NULL
complete	NULL
bygones	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
bygone	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
absorbed	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
recrossed	NULL
the	NULL
northern	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
Long-Ash	NULL
Lane	NULL
at	NULL
right	NULL
angles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presently	NULL
saw	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
ascending	NULL
whitely	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
upland	NULL
along	NULL
whose	NULL
margin	NULL
the	NULL
remainder	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
journey	NULL
lay	NULL
.	NULL

Its	NULL
dry	NULL
pale	NULL
surface	NULL
stretched	NULL
severely	NULL
onward	NULL
,	NULL
unbroken	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
figure	NULL
,	NULL
vehicle	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
mark	NULL
,	NULL
save	NULL
some	NULL
occasional	NULL
brown	NULL
horse-droppings	NULL
which	NULL
dotted	NULL
its	NULL
cold	NULL
aridity	NULL
here	NULL
and	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

While	NULL
slowly	NULL
breasting	NULL
this	NULL
ascent	NULL
Tess	NULL
became	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
footsteps	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turning	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
approaching	NULL
that	NULL
well-known	NULL
form	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
strangely	NULL
accoutred	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
Methodist	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
personage	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
she	NULL
wished	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
encounter	NULL
alone	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
grave	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
thought	NULL
or	NULL
elusion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
yielded	NULL
as	NULL
calmly	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
necessity	NULL
of	NULL
letting	NULL
him	NULL
overtake	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
excited	NULL
,	NULL
less	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
speed	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL

by	NULL
the	NULL

him	NULL

She	NULL
then	NULL

he	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

did	NULL

falling	NULL
casually	NULL

remained	NULL
contemplating	NULL

The	NULL

it	NULL

And	NULL
there	NULL

After	NULL
this	NULL
their	NULL

Frequently	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL

they	NULL
found	NULL
painted	NULL
thereon	NULL

red	NULL

letters	NULL

she	NULL

him	NULL

been	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
pains	NULL

He	NULL
told	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL

himself	NULL

others	NULL

were	NULL
working	NULL

him	NULL

the	NULL

At	NULL
length	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
touched	NULL
the	NULL

Of	NULL
all	NULL
spots	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
bleached	NULL

desolate	NULL

this	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL

It	NULL

D'Urberville	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
dated	NULL
several	NULL
months	NULL
before	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
signed	NULL
by	NULL
Parson	NULL
Clare	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
letter	NULL
began	NULL
by	NULL
expressing	NULL
the	NULL
writer	NULL
's	NULL
unfeigned	NULL
joy	NULL
at	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
's	NULL
conversion	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
thanked	NULL
him	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
kindness	NULL
in	NULL
communicating	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
parson	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
subject	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
expressed	NULL
Mr	NULL
Clare	NULL
's	NULL
warm	NULL
assurance	NULL
of	NULL
forgiveness	NULL
for	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
's	NULL
former	NULL

his	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

for	NULL

He	NULL
,	NULL
Mr	NULL

would	NULL
much	NULL
have	NULL
liked	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
devoted	NULL
so	NULL
many	NULL

helped	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
a	NULL

but	NULL
since	NULL
his	NULL
correspondent	NULL
had	NULL
possibly	NULL
not	NULL
cared	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
this	NULL
on	NULL
account	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
delay	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
entailed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
insist	NULL
upon	NULL
its	NULL
paramount	NULL
importance	NULL

Every	NULL
man	NULL
must	NULL
work	NULL
as	NULL

could	NULL
best	NULL
work	NULL

and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

towards	NULL
which	NULL

D'Urberville	NULL
read	NULL
and	NULL
re-read	NULL
this	NULL
letter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
quiz	NULL
himself	NULL
cynically	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
also	NULL
read	NULL
some	NULL
passages	NULL
from	NULL
memoranda	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
till	NULL
his	NULL
face	NULL
assumed	NULL
a	NULL
calm	NULL

and	NULL
apparently	NULL
the	NULL
image	NULL
of	NULL
Tess	NULL
no	NULL

troubled	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL

She	NULL
meanwhile	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL
hill	NULL

lay	NULL
her	NULL
nearest	NULL

Within	NULL

she	NULL
met	NULL
a	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL

at	NULL
this	NULL
unexpectedly	NULL
gruesome	NULL
information	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
solitary	NULL
man	NULL
behind	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
dusk	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
drew	NULL
near	NULL
to	NULL
Flintcomb-Ash	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lane	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
entrance	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
hamlet	NULL
she	NULL
approached	NULL
a	NULL
girl	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
lover	NULL
without	NULL
their	NULL
observing	NULL
her	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
talking	NULL
no	NULL

the	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL

,	NULL
full	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
stagnant	NULL
obscurity	NULL
upon	NULL
which	NULL
nothing	NULL

intruded	NULL

For	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
the	NULL
voices	NULL
cheered	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
of	NULL
Tess	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
reasoned	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL

its	NULL
origin	NULL

on	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

to	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
close	NULL

the	NULL
girl	NULL
turned	NULL
serenely	NULL

recognized	NULL
her	NULL

the	NULL

XLVI	NULL
Several	NULL
days	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
since	NULL
her	NULL
futile	NULL
journey	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Tess	NULL
was	NULL
afield	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dry	NULL
winter	NULL
wind	NULL
still	NULL
blew	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
screen	NULL
of	NULL
thatched	NULL
hurdles	NULL
erected	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
eye	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
blast	NULL
kept	NULL
its	NULL
force	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL
sheltered	NULL
side	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
turnip-slicing	NULL
machine	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
bright	NULL
blue	NULL
hue	NULL
of	NULL
new	NULL
paint	NULL
seemed	NULL
almost	NULL
vocal	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
otherwise	NULL
subdued	NULL
scene	NULL
.	NULL

Opposite	NULL
its	NULL
front	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
mound	NULL
or	NULL
"	NULL
grave	NULL
"	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
roots	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
preserved	NULL
since	NULL
early	NULL
winter	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
uncovered	NULL
end	NULL
,	NULL
chopping	NULL
off	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
bill-hook	NULL
the	NULL
fibres	NULL
and	NULL
earth	NULL
from	NULL
each	NULL
root	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
throwing	NULL
it	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
operation	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
slicer	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
man	NULL
was	NULL
turning	NULL
the	NULL
handle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
machine	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
trough	NULL
came	NULL
the	NULL
newly-cut	NULL
swedes	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
fresh	NULL
smell	NULL
of	NULL
whose	NULL
yellow	NULL
chips	NULL
was	NULL
accompanied	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
sounds	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
snuffling	NULL
wind	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
smart	NULL
swish	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
slicing-blades	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
choppings	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hook	NULL
in	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
leather-gloved	NULL
hand	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wide	NULL
acreage	NULL
of	NULL
blank	NULL
agricultural	NULL
brownness	NULL
,	NULL
apparent	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
swedes	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
pulled	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
striped	NULL
in	NULL
wales	NULL
of	NULL
darker	NULL
brown	NULL
,	NULL
gradually	NULL
broadening	NULL
to	NULL
ribands	NULL
.	NULL

Along	NULL
the	NULL
edge	NULL
of	NULL
each	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
something	NULL
crept	NULL
upon	NULL
ten	NULL
legs	NULL
,	NULL
moving	NULL
without	NULL
haste	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
rest	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
length	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
two	NULL
horses	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
plough	NULL
going	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
cleared	NULL
ground	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
spring	NULL
sowing	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
hours	NULL
nothing	NULL
relieved	NULL
the	NULL
joyless	NULL
monotony	NULL
of	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
far	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
ploughing-teams	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
speck	NULL
was	NULL
seen	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
fence	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
gap	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
tendency	NULL
was	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
incline	NULL
,	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
swede-cutters	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
proportions	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mere	NULL
point	NULL
it	NULL
advanced	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
shape	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
ninepin	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
soon	NULL
perceived	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
black	NULL
,	NULL
arriving	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
Flintcomb-Ash	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
man	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
slicer	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
nothing	NULL
else	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
continually	NULL
observed	NULL
the	NULL
comer	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Tess	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
occupied	NULL
,	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
perceive	NULL
him	NULL
till	NULL
her	NULL
companion	NULL
directed	NULL
her	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
approach	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
her	NULL
hard	NULL
taskmaster	NULL
,	NULL
Farmer	NULL
Groby	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
semi-clerical	NULL
costume	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
now	NULL
represented	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
once	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
free-and-easy	NULL
Alec	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
being	NULL
hot	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
preaching	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
enthusiasm	NULL
about	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
presence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
grinder	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
embarrass	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
pale	NULL
distress	NULL
was	NULL
already	NULL
on	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
face	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
pulled	NULL
her	NULL
curtained	NULL
hood	NULL
further	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

D'Urberville	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
quietly	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
she	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
glanced	NULL
round	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
were	NULL
overheard	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
at	NULL
some	NULL
distance	NULL

turned	NULL
the	NULL
slicer	NULL

the	NULL
movement	NULL

,	NULL
too	NULL
,	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
prevented	NULL
Alec	NULL
's	NULL

reaching	NULL

D'Urberville	NULL
placed	NULL
himself	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL

screen	NULL
Tess	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
labourer	NULL

turning	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL

he	NULL
continued	NULL

with	NULL
capricious	NULL

In	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL
your	NULL

met	NULL

neglected	NULL

your	NULL

You	NULL
were	NULL
well	NULL
dressed	NULL

and	NULL
I	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
think	NULL

it	NULL

But	NULL
I	NULL
see	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL

hard	NULL

That	NULL

an	NULL

again	NULL
she	NULL

perhaps	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL

She	NULL
put	NULL
the	NULL

After	NULL
this	NULL
her	NULL

brought	NULL

great	NULL
import	NULL

agriculturists	NULL

the	NULL
day	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL

entered	NULL

the	NULL
twelve	NULL
months	NULL

Lady-Day	NULL

those	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
farming	NULL
population	NULL
who	NULL
thought	NULL

changing	NULL
their	NULL
places	NULL
duly	NULL
attended	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
county-town	NULL
where	NULL
the	NULL
fair	NULL

held	NULL
.	NULL

Nearly	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
labourers	NULL
on	NULL
Flintcomb-Ash	NULL
farm	NULL
intended	NULL
flight	NULL

and	NULL
early	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL

the	NULL

Though	NULL
Tess	NULL
also	NULL
meant	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
quarter-day	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
who	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

having	NULL
a	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
peaceful	NULL
February	NULL
day	NULL

of	NULL
wonderful	NULL
softness	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL

and	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
almost	NULL
have	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
winter	NULL

over	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
hardly	NULL
finished	NULL
her	NULL
dinner	NULL
when	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL

the	NULL

which	NULL
she	NULL

Tess	NULL
jumped	NULL
up	NULL

her	NULL
visitor	NULL

knocked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL

D'Urberville	NULL
's	NULL
knock	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
walk	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL

had	NULL
some	NULL
indescribable	NULL
quality	NULL
of	NULL
difference	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
air	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
last	NULL
saw	NULL
him	NULL

They	NULL
seemed	NULL

which	NULL
the	NULL
doer	NULL

ashamed	NULL

She	NULL

she	NULL
arose	NULL

lifted	NULL

stepped	NULL
back	NULL
quickly	NULL

He	NULL
came	NULL
in	NULL

saw	NULL
her	NULL

flung	NULL
himself	NULL
down	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL

he	NULL
began	NULL
desperately	NULL

as	NULL
he	NULL
wiped	NULL

had	NULL
also	NULL
a	NULL

The	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
spoken	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
remaining	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
stunned	NULL
.	NULL

D'Urberville	NULL
retreated	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
sheaves	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
descended	NULL
the	NULL
ladder	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
the	NULL
workers	NULL
below	NULL
rose	NULL
and	NULL
stretched	NULL
their	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shook	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
beer	NULL

had	NULL
drunk	NULL

Then	NULL
the	NULL
threshing-machine	NULL
started	NULL
afresh	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
renewed	NULL
rustle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
straw	NULL
Tess	NULL
resumed	NULL
her	NULL
position	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
buzzing	NULL
drum	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
dream	NULL

untying	NULL

endless	NULL
succession	NULL

XLVIII	NULL
In	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
the	NULL
farmer	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
known	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
rick	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
finished	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
since	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
moon	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
to	NULL
work	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
engine	NULL
was	NULL
engaged	NULL
for	NULL
another	NULL
farm	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
morrow	NULL
.	NULL

Hence	NULL
the	NULL
twanging	NULL
and	NULL
humming	NULL
and	NULL
rustling	NULL
proceeded	NULL
with	NULL
even	NULL
less	NULL
intermission	NULL
than	NULL
usual	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
till	NULL
"	NULL
nammet	NULL
"	NULL
-	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
three	NULL
o-clock	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Tess	NULL
raised	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
and	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
momentary	NULL
glance	NULL
round	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
felt	NULL
but	NULL
little	NULL
surprise	NULL
at	NULL
seeing	NULL
that	NULL
Alec	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
standing	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
hedge	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
lift	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
waved	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
urbanely	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
blew	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
kiss	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
meant	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
quarrel	NULL
was	NULL
over	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
looked	NULL
down	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
carefully	NULL
abstained	NULL
from	NULL
gazing	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
direction	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
dragged	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wheat-rick	NULL
shrank	NULL
lower	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
straw-rick	NULL
grew	NULL
higher	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
corn-sacks	NULL
were	NULL
carted	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
six	NULL
o'clock	NULL
the	NULL
wheat-rick	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
shoulder-high	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
unthreshed	NULL
sheaves	NULL
remaining	NULL
untouched	NULL
seemed	NULL
countless	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
notwithstanding	NULL
the	NULL
enormous	NULL
numbers	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
gulped	NULL
down	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
insatiable	NULL
swallower	NULL
,	NULL
fed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
and	NULL
Tess	NULL
,	NULL
through	NULL
whose	NULL
two	NULL
young	NULL
hands	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
immense	NULL
stack	NULL
of	NULL
straw	NULL
where	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
there	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
nothing	NULL
,	NULL
appeared	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
faeces	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
buzzing	NULL
red	NULL
glutton	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
west	NULL
sky	NULL
a	NULL
wrathful	NULL
shine	NULL
--	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
wild	NULL
March	NULL
could	NULL
afford	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
sunset	NULL
--	NULL
had	NULL
burst	NULL
forth	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
cloudy	NULL
day	NULL
,	NULL
flooding	NULL
the	NULL
tired	NULL
and	NULL
sticky	NULL
faces	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
threshers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
dyeing	NULL
them	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
coppery	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
also	NULL
the	NULL
flapping	NULL
garments	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
clung	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
like	NULL
dull	NULL
flames	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
panting	NULL
ache	NULL
ran	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
rick	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
fed	NULL
was	NULL
weary	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Tess	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
red	NULL
nape	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
neck	NULL
was	NULL
encrusted	NULL
with	NULL
dirt	NULL
and	NULL
husks	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
still	NULL
stood	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
post	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
flushed	NULL
and	NULL
perspiring	NULL
face	NULL
coated	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
corndust	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
white	NULL
bonnet	NULL
embrowned	NULL
by	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
woman	NULL
whose	NULL
place	NULL
was	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
machine	NULL
so	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
shaken	NULL
bodily	NULL
by	NULL
its	NULL
spinning	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
decrease	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stack	NULL
now	NULL
separated	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
Marian	NULL
and	NULL
Izz	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
prevented	NULL
their	NULL
changing	NULL
duties	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
incessant	NULL
quivering	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
every	NULL
fibre	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
frame	NULL
participated	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
thrown	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
stupefied	NULL
reverie	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
worked	NULL
on	NULL
independently	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
consciousness	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
hardly	NULL
knew	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
hear	NULL
Izz	NULL
Huett	NULL
tell	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
below	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
tumbling	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
degrees	NULL
the	NULL
freshest	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
grow	NULL
cadaverous	NULL
and	NULL
saucer-eyed	NULL
.	NULL

Whenever	NULL
Tess	NULL
lifted	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
she	NULL
beheld	NULL
always	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
upgrown	NULL
straw-stack	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
men	NULL
in	NULL
shirt-sleeves	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
gray	NULL
north	NULL
sky	NULL
;	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
the	NULL
long	NULL
red	NULL
elevator	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
Jacob	NULL
's	NULL
ladder	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
perpetual	NULL
stream	NULL
of	NULL
threshed	NULL
straw	NULL
ascended	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
yellow	NULL
river	NULL
running	NULL
uphill	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
spouting	NULL
out	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rick	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
Alec	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
,	NULL
observing	NULL
her	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
point	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
where	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
excuse	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
remaining	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
threshed	NULL
rick	NULL
drew	NULL
near	NULL
its	NULL
final	NULL
sheaves	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
ratting	NULL
was	NULL
always	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
men	NULL
unconnected	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
threshing	NULL
sometimes	NULL
dropped	NULL
in	NULL
for	NULL
that	NULL
performance	NULL
--	NULL
sporting	NULL
characters	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
descriptions	NULL
,	NULL
gents	NULL
with	NULL
terriers	NULL
and	NULL
facetious	NULL
pipes	NULL
,	NULL
roughs	NULL
with	NULL
sticks	NULL
and	NULL
stones	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
another	NULL
hour	NULL
's	NULL
work	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
layer	NULL
of	NULL
live	NULL
rats	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
base	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
stack	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
reached	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
light	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Giant	NULL
's	NULL
Hill	NULL
by	NULL
Abbot	NULL
's	NULL
-	NULL
Cernel	NULL
dissolved	NULL
away	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
white-faced	NULL
moon	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
arose	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
horizon	NULL
that	NULL
lay	NULL
towards	NULL
Middleton	NULL
Abbey	NULL
and	NULL
Shottsford	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

For	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
hour	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
Marian	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
uneasy	NULL
about	NULL
Tess	NULL
,	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
get	NULL
near	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
women	NULL
having	NULL
kept	NULL
up	NULL
their	NULL
strength	NULL
by	NULL
drinking	NULL
ale	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Tess	NULL
having	NULL
done	NULL
without	NULL
it	NULL
through	NULL
traditionary	NULL
dread	NULL
,	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
results	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
home	NULL
in	NULL
childhood	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
Tess	NULL
still	NULL
kept	NULL
going	NULL
:	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
fill	NULL
her	NULL
part	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
to	NULL
leave	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
contingency	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
regarded	NULL
with	NULL
equanimity	NULL
and	NULL
even	NULL
with	NULL
relief	NULL
a	NULL
month	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
earlier	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
a	NULL
terror	NULL
since	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
had	NULL
begun	NULL
to	NULL
hover	NULL
round	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sheaf-pitchers	NULL
and	NULL
feeders	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
worked	NULL
the	NULL
rick	NULL
so	NULL
low	NULL
that	NULL
people	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
could	NULL
talk	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
surprise	NULL
Farmer	NULL
Groby	NULL
came	NULL
up	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
machine	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
that	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
desired	NULL
to	NULL
join	NULL
her	NULL
friend	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
wish	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
on	NULL
any	NULL
longer	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
send	NULL
somebody	NULL
else	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
her	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
"	NULL
friend	NULL
"	NULL
was	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
also	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
concession	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
granted	NULL
in	NULL
obedience	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
request	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
friend	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
enemy	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
shook	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
and	NULL
toiled	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
time	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
rat-catching	NULL
arrived	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
hunt	NULL
began	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
creatures	NULL
had	NULL
crept	NULL
downwards	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
subsidence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rick	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
together	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
bottom	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
being	NULL
now	NULL
uncovered	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL
last	NULL
refuge	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
ran	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
open	NULL
ground	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
directions	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
loud	NULL
shriek	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
by-this-time	NULL
half-tipsy	NULL
Marian	NULL
informing	NULL
her	NULL
companions	NULL
that	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
rats	NULL
had	NULL
invaded	NULL
her	NULL
person	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
terror	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
women	NULL
had	NULL
guarded	NULL
against	NULL
by	NULL
various	NULL
schemes	NULL
of	NULL
skirt-tucking	NULL
and	NULL
self-elevation	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rat	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
dislodged	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
amid	NULL
the	NULL
barking	NULL
of	NULL
dogs	NULL

masculine	NULL

feminine	NULL
screams	NULL

Pandemonium	NULL

the	NULL
drum	NULL
slowed	NULL

the	NULL

ceased	NULL

she	NULL
stepped	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL

Her	NULL
lover	NULL

she	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL

was	NULL
so	NULL
utterly	NULL

now	NULL
hold	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
justified	NULL
in	NULL
giving	NULL
his	NULL
son	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
unbeliever	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
academic	NULL
advantages	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
possible	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
probable	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
those	NULL
very	NULL
advantages	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
used	NULL
to	NULL
decry	NULL
the	NULL
doctrines	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
made	NULL
it	NULL
his	NULL
life	NULL
's	NULL
mission	NULL
and	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
propagate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
mission	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
ordained	NULL
sons	NULL
likewise	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
put	NULL
with	NULL
one	NULL
hand	NULL
a	NULL
pedestal	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
feet	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
faithful	NULL
ones	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
to	NULL
exalt	NULL
the	NULL
unfaithful	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
artificial	NULL
means	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
deemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
alike	NULL
inconsistent	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
convictions	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
position	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
hopes	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
loved	NULL
his	NULL
misnamed	NULL
Angel	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
secret	NULL
mourned	NULL
over	NULL
this	NULL
treatment	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
Abraham	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
mourned	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
doomed	NULL
Isaac	NULL
while	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL
together	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
silent	NULL
self-generated	NULL
regrets	NULL
were	NULL
far	NULL
bitterer	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
reproaches	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
rendered	NULL
audible	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
blamed	NULL
themselves	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
unlucky	NULL
marriage	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
Angel	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
been	NULL
destined	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
farmer	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
thrown	NULL
with	NULL
agricultural	NULL
girls	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
distinctly	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
separated	NULL
him	NULL
and	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
the	NULL
date	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
separation	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
first	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
supposed	NULL
it	NULL
must	NULL
be	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
nature	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
serious	NULL
aversion	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
later	NULL
letters	NULL
he	NULL
occasionally	NULL
alluded	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
intention	NULL
of	NULL
coming	NULL
home	NULL
to	NULL
fetch	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
expressions	NULL
they	NULL
hoped	NULL
the	NULL
division	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
owe	NULL
its	NULL
origin	NULL
to	NULL
anything	NULL
so	NULL
hopelessly	NULL
permanent	NULL
as	NULL
that	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
them	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
relatives	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
doubts	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
decided	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
intrude	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
situation	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
knew	NULL
no	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
bettering	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
eyes	NULL
for	NULL
which	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
letter	NULL
was	NULL
intended	NULL
were	NULL
gazing	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
limitless	NULL
expanse	NULL
of	NULL
country	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mule	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
bearing	NULL
him	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
interior	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
South-American	NULL
Continent	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
coast	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
experiences	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
strange	NULL
land	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
sad	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
severe	NULL
illness	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
shortly	NULL
after	NULL
his	NULL
arrival	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
wholly	NULL
left	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
by	NULL
degrees	NULL
almost	NULL
decided	NULL
to	NULL
relinquish	NULL
his	NULL
hope	NULL
of	NULL
farming	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
long	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
bare	NULL
possibility	NULL
existed	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
remaining	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
kept	NULL
this	NULL
change	NULL
of	NULL
view	NULL
a	NULL
secret	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
parents	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
crowds	NULL
of	NULL
agricultural	NULL
labourers	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
wake	NULL
,	NULL
dazzled	NULL
by	NULL
representations	NULL
of	NULL
easy	NULL
independence	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
,	NULL
died	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wasted	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
mothers	NULL
from	NULL
English	NULL
farms	NULL
trudging	NULL
along	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
infants	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
arms	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
child	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
stricken	NULL
with	NULL
fever	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
die	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
mother	NULL
would	NULL
pause	NULL
to	NULL
dig	NULL
a	NULL
hole	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
loose	NULL
earth	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
bare	NULL
hands	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
bury	NULL
the	NULL
babe	NULL
therein	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
natural	NULL
grave-tools	NULL
,	NULL
shed	NULL
one	NULL
tear	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
trudge	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Angel	NULL
's	NULL
original	NULL
intention	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
emigration	NULL
to	NULL
Brazil	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
northern	NULL
or	NULL
eastern	NULL
farm	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
country	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
fit	NULL
of	NULL
desperation	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
Brazil	NULL
movement	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
agriculturists	NULL
having	NULL
by	NULL
chance	NULL
coincided	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
desire	NULL
to	NULL
escape	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
past	NULL
existence	NULL
.	NULL

During	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
of	NULL
absence	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
mentally	NULL
aged	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
arrested	NULL
him	NULL
now	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
value	NULL
in	NULL
life	NULL
was	NULL
less	NULL
its	NULL
beauty	NULL
than	NULL
its	NULL
pathos	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
long	NULL
discredited	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
systems	NULL
of	NULL
mysticism	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
now	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
discredit	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
appraisements	NULL
of	NULL
morality	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
they	NULL
wanted	NULL
readjusting	NULL
.	NULL

Who	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
moral	NULL
man	NULL
?	NULL

Still	NULL
more	NULL
pertinently	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
moral	NULL
woman	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
beauty	NULL
or	NULL
ugliness	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
character	NULL
lay	NULL
not	NULL
only	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
achievements	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
aims	NULL
and	NULL
impulses	NULL
;	NULL
its	NULL
true	NULL
history	NULL
lay	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
among	NULL
things	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
among	NULL
things	NULL
willed	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
about	NULL
Tess	NULL
?	NULL

Viewing	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
these	NULL
lights	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
regret	NULL
for	NULL
his	NULL
hasty	NULL
judgement	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
oppress	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Did	NULL
he	NULL
reject	NULL
her	NULL
eternally	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
not	NULL
?	NULL

He	NULL
could	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
always	NULL
reject	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
say	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
spirit	NULL
to	NULL
accept	NULL
her	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
growing	NULL
fondness	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
memory	NULL
coincided	NULL
in	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
time	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
residence	NULL
at	NULL
Flintcomb-Ash	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
felt	NULL
herself	NULL
at	NULL
liberty	NULL
to	NULL
trouble	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
circumstances	NULL
or	NULL
her	NULL
feelings	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
greatly	NULL
perplexed	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
perplexity	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
motives	NULL
in	NULL
withholding	NULL
intelligence	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
inquire	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
her	NULL
silence	NULL
of	NULL
docility	NULL
was	NULL
misinterpreted	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
much	NULL
it	NULL
really	NULL
said	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
understood	NULL
!	NULL

--	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
adhered	NULL
with	NULL
literal	NULL
exactness	NULL
to	NULL
orders	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
given	NULL
and	NULL
forgotten	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
despite	NULL
her	NULL
natural	NULL
fearlessness	NULL
she	NULL
asserted	NULL
no	NULL
rights	NULL
,	NULL
admitted	NULL
his	NULL
judgement	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
respect	NULL
the	NULL
true	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
bent	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
dumbly	NULL
thereto	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
before-mentioned	NULL
journey	NULL
by	NULL
mules	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
interior	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
,	NULL
another	NULL
man	NULL
rode	NULL
beside	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Angel	NULL
's	NULL
companion	NULL
was	NULL
also	NULL
an	NULL
Englishman	NULL
,	NULL
bent	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
errand	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
he	NULL
came	NULL
from	NULL
another	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
island	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
both	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
state	NULL
of	NULL
mental	NULL
depression	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
home	NULL
affairs	NULL
.	NULL

Confidence	NULL
begat	NULL
confidence	NULL
.	NULL

With	NULL
that	NULL
curious	NULL
tendency	NULL
evinced	NULL
by	NULL
men	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
especially	NULL
when	NULL
in	NULL
distant	NULL
lands	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
entrust	NULL
to	NULL
strangers	NULL
details	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
lives	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
would	NULL
on	NULL
no	NULL
account	NULL
mention	NULL
to	NULL
friends	NULL
,	NULL
Angel	NULL
admitted	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
man	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
rode	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
sorrowful	NULL
facts	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
marriage	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
stranger	NULL
had	NULL
sojourned	NULL
in	NULL
many	NULL
more	NULL
lands	NULL
and	NULL
among	NULL
many	NULL
more	NULL
peoples	NULL
than	NULL
Angel	NULL
;	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
cosmopolitan	NULL
mind	NULL
such	NULL
deviations	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
social	NULL
norm	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
immense	NULL
to	NULL
domesticity	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
are	NULL
the	NULL
irregularities	NULL
of	NULL
vale	NULL
and	NULL
mountain-chain	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
terrestrial	NULL
curve	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
viewed	NULL
the	NULL
matter	NULL
in	NULL
quite	NULL
a	NULL
different	NULL
light	NULL
from	NULL
Angel	NULL
;	NULL
thought	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
Tess	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
no	NULL
importance	NULL
beside	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
plainly	NULL
told	NULL
Clare	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
wrong	NULL
in	NULL
coming	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
drenched	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
thunder-storm	NULL
.	NULL

Angel	NULL
's	NULL
companion	NULL
was	NULL
struck	NULL
down	NULL
with	NULL
fever	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
died	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
's	NULL
end	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
waited	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
hours	NULL
to	NULL
bury	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
cursory	NULL
remarks	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
large-minded	NULL
stranger	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
knew	NULL
absolutely	NULL
nothing	NULL
beyond	NULL
a	NULL
commonplace	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
sublimed	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
death	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
influenced	NULL
Clare	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
reasoned	NULL
ethics	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
philosophers	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
own	NULL
parochialism	NULL
made	NULL
him	NULL
ashamed	NULL
by	NULL
its	NULL
contrast	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
inconsistencies	NULL
rushed	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
flood	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
persistently	NULL
elevated	NULL
Hellenic	NULL
Paganism	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
expense	NULL
of	NULL
Christianity	NULL
;	NULL
yet	NULL
in	NULL
that	NULL
civilization	NULL
an	NULL
illegal	NULL
surrender	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
certain	NULL
disesteem	NULL
.	NULL

Surely	NULL
then	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
regarded	NULL
that	NULL
abhorrence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
un-intact	NULL
state	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
inherited	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
creed	NULL
of	NULL
mysticism	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
open	NULL
to	NULL
correction	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
was	NULL
due	NULL
to	NULL
treachery	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
remorse	NULL
struck	NULL
into	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
words	NULL
of	NULL
Izz	NULL
Huett	NULL
,	NULL
never	NULL
quite	NULL
stilled	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
memory	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
Izz	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
replied	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
affirmative	NULL
.	NULL

Did	NULL
she	NULL
love	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
Tess	NULL
did	NULL
?	NULL

No	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
replied	NULL
;	NULL
Tess	NULL
would	NULL
lay	NULL
down	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
Tess	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
appeared	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wedding	NULL
.	NULL

How	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
had	NULL
lingered	NULL
upon	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
how	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
hung	NULL
upon	NULL
his	NULL
words	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
a	NULL
god	NULL
's	NULL
!	NULL

And	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
terrible	NULL
evening	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
hearth	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
her	NULL
simple	NULL
soul	NULL
uncovered	NULL
itself	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
,	NULL
how	NULL
pitiful	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
had	NULL
looked	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
rays	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
inability	NULL
to	NULL
realize	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
love	NULL
and	NULL
protection	NULL
could	NULL
possibly	NULL
be	NULL
withdrawn	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
from	NULL
being	NULL
her	NULL
critic	NULL
he	NULL
grew	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
her	NULL
advocate	NULL
.	NULL

Cynical	NULL
things	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
uttered	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
no	NULL
man	NULL
can	NULL
be	NULL
always	NULL
a	NULL
cynic	NULL
and	NULL
live	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
withdrew	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
mistake	NULL
of	NULL
expressing	NULL
them	NULL
had	NULL
arisen	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
allowing	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
influenced	NULL
by	NULL
general	NULL
principles	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
disregard	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
particular	NULL
instance	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
reasoning	NULL
is	NULL
somewhat	NULL
musty	NULL
;	NULL
lovers	NULL
and	NULL
husbands	NULL
have	NULL
gone	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
before	NULL
to-day	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
harsh	NULL
towards	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
there	NULL
is	NULL
no	NULL
doubt	NULL
of	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Men	NULL
are	NULL
too	NULL
often	NULL
harsh	NULL
with	NULL
women	NULL
they	NULL
love	NULL
or	NULL
have	NULL
loved	NULL
;	NULL
women	NULL
with	NULL
men	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
yet	NULL
these	NULL
harshnesses	NULL
are	NULL
tenderness	NULL
itself	NULL
when	NULL
compared	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
universal	NULL
harshness	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
grow	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
harshness	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
temperament	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
means	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
aims	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
to-day	NULL
towards	NULL
yesterday	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
hereafter	NULL
towards	NULL
to-day	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
historic	NULL
interest	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
family	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
masterful	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
d'Urbervilles	NULL
--	NULL
whom	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
despised	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
spent	NULL
force	NULL

touched	NULL
his	NULL

Why	NULL

the	NULL
difference	NULL
between	NULL

In	NULL

and	NULL
falls	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
fact	NULL
that	NULL
would	NULL
soon	NULL
be	NULL
forgotten	NULL
--	NULL
that	NULL
bit	NULL
of	NULL
distinction	NULL
in	NULL
poor	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
blood	NULL
and	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
oblivion	NULL
would	NULL
fall	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
hereditary	NULL
link	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
marble	NULL
monuments	NULL
and	NULL
leaded	NULL
skeletons	NULL
at	NULL
Kingsbere	NULL
.	NULL

So	NULL
does	NULL
Time	NULL
ruthlessly	NULL
destroy	NULL
his	NULL
own	NULL
romances	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
recalling	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
again	NULL
and	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
therein	NULL
a	NULL
flash	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
dignity	NULL
which	NULL
must	NULL
have	NULL
graced	NULL
her	NULL
grand-dames	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
vision	NULL
sent	NULL
that	NULL
_	NULL
aura	NULL
_	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
veins	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
formerly	NULL
felt	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
which	NULL
left	NULL
behind	NULL
it	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
sickness	NULL
.	NULL

Despite	NULL
her	NULL
not-inviolate	NULL
past	NULL
,	NULL
what	NULL
still	NULL
abode	NULL
in	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
as	NULL
Tess	NULL
outvalued	NULL
the	NULL
freshness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
fellows	NULL
.	NULL

Was	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
gleaning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
grapes	NULL
of	NULL
Ephraim	NULL
better	NULL
than	NULL
the	NULL
vintage	NULL
of	NULL
Abiezer	NULL
?	NULL

So	NULL
spoke	NULL
love	NULL
renascent	NULL
,	NULL
preparing	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
for	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
devoted	NULL
outpouring	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
then	NULL
just	NULL
being	NULL
forwarded	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
by	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
;	NULL
though	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
distance	NULL
inland	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
reaching	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Meanwhile	NULL
the	NULL
writer	NULL
's	NULL
expectation	NULL
that	NULL
Angel	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
response	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
entreaty	NULL
was	NULL
alternately	NULL
great	NULL
and	NULL
small	NULL
.	NULL

What	NULL
lessened	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
facts	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
led	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
parting	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
changed	NULL
--	NULL
could	NULL
never	NULL
change	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
her	NULL
presence	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
attenuated	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
absence	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
.	NULL

Nevertheless	NULL
she	NULL
addressed	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tender	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
do	NULL
to	NULL
please	NULL
him	NULL
best	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
arrive	NULL
.	NULL

Sighs	NULL
were	NULL
expended	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
wish	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
more	NULL
notice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tunes	NULL
he	NULL
played	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
harp	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
inquired	NULL
more	NULL
curiously	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
his	NULL
favourite	NULL
ballads	NULL
among	NULL
those	NULL
the	NULL
country-girls	NULL
sang	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
indirectly	NULL
inquired	NULL
of	NULL
Amby	NULL
Seedling	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
followed	NULL
Izz	NULL
from	NULL
Talbothays	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
by	NULL
chance	NULL
Amby	NULL
remembered	NULL
that	NULL

amongst	NULL
the	NULL

It	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
melted	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL

a	NULL

to	NULL
hear	NULL
her	NULL
singing	NULL
these	NULL

in	NULL

Tess	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
wrapt	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
fanciful	NULL
dream	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
seemed	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
how	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
was	NULL
advancing	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
had	NULL
lengthened	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
Lady-Day	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL

and	NULL
would	NULL
soon	NULL
be	NULL
followed	NULL
by	NULL
Old	NULL
Lady-Day	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
end	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
term	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
before	NULL
the	NULL
quarter-day	NULL
had	NULL
quite	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
something	NULL
happened	NULL
which	NULL
made	NULL
Tess	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
far	NULL
different	NULL
matters	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
lodging	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
one	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
sitting	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
downstairs	NULL
room	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
somebody	NULL
knocked	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
inquired	NULL
for	NULL
Tess	NULL
.	NULL

Through	NULL
the	NULL
doorway	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
declining	NULL
light	NULL
a	NULL
figure	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
height	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
breadth	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
child	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
,	NULL
thin	NULL
,	NULL
girlish	NULL
creature	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
recognize	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
twilight	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
girl	NULL
said	NULL

in	NULL
startled	NULL

Her	NULL

whom	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
over	NULL

Tess	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
reverie	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
before	NULL
she	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
asking	NULL
'	NULL
Liza-Lu	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
sit	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
done	NULL
so	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
'	NULL
Liza-Lu	NULL
was	NULL
having	NULL
some	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
decision	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
imperative	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
should	NULL
go	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
agreement	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
end	NULL
till	NULL
Old	NULL
Lady-Day	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
sixth	NULL
of	NULL
April	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
interval	NULL
thereto	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
one	NULL
she	NULL
resolved	NULL
to	NULL
run	NULL
the	NULL
risk	NULL
of	NULL
starting	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
go	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
gain	NULL
of	NULL
twelve-hours	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
tired	NULL
to	NULL
undertake	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
distance	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
morrow	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
ran	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
where	NULL
Marian	NULL
and	NULL
Izz	NULL
lived	NULL
,	NULL
informed	NULL
them	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
begged	NULL
them	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
the	NULL
best	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
case	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
farmer	NULL
.	NULL

Returning	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
got	NULL
Lu	NULL
a	NULL
supper	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
after	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
tucked	NULL
the	NULL
younger	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
packed	NULL
up	NULL
as	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
belongings	NULL
as	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
withy	NULL
basket	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
started	NULL
,	NULL
directing	NULL
Lu	NULL
to	NULL
follow	NULL
her	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

L	NULL
She	NULL
plunged	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
chilly	NULL
equinoctial	NULL
darkness	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
clock	NULL
struck	NULL
ten	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
her	NULL
fifteen	NULL
miles	NULL
'	NULL
walk	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
steely	NULL
stars	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
lonely	NULL
districts	NULL
night	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
protection	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
danger	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
noiseless	NULL
pedestrian	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
knowing	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
Tess	NULL
pursued	NULL
the	NULL
nearest	NULL
course	NULL
along	NULL
by-lanes	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
almost	NULL
have	NULL
feared	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
day-time	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
marauders	NULL
were	NULL
wanting	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
spectral	NULL
fears	NULL
were	NULL
driven	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
by	NULL
thoughts	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
she	NULL
proceeded	NULL
mile	NULL
after	NULL
mile	NULL
,	NULL
ascending	NULL
and	NULL
descending	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
Bulbarrow	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
about	NULL
midnight	NULL
looked	NULL
from	NULL
that	NULL
height	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
abyss	NULL
of	NULL
chaotic	NULL
shade	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
revealed	NULL
itself	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
vale	NULL
on	NULL
whose	NULL
further	NULL
side	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
born	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
already	NULL
traversed	NULL
about	NULL
five	NULL
miles	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
upland	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
some	NULL
ten	NULL
or	NULL
eleven	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
lowland	NULL
before	NULL
her	NULL
journey	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
finished	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
winding	NULL
road	NULL
downwards	NULL
became	NULL
just	NULL
visible	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
wan	NULL
starlight	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
followed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
soon	NULL
she	NULL
paced	NULL
a	NULL
soil	NULL
so	NULL
contrasting	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
above	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
difference	NULL
was	NULL
perceptible	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
tread	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
smell	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
heavy	NULL
clay	NULL
land	NULL
of	NULL
Blackmoor	NULL
Vale	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Vale	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
turnpike-roads	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
penetrated	NULL
.	NULL

Superstitions	NULL
linger	NULL
longest	NULL
on	NULL
these	NULL
heavy	NULL
soils	NULL
.	NULL

Having	NULL
once	NULL
been	NULL
forest	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
this	NULL
shadowy	NULL
time	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
assert	NULL
something	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
old	NULL
character	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
far	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
near	NULL
being	NULL
blended	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
every	NULL
tree	NULL
and	NULL
tall	NULL
hedge	NULL
making	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
presence	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
harts	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
hunted	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
witches	NULL
that	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
pricked	NULL
and	NULL
ducked	NULL

green-spangled	NULL
fairies	NULL

"	NULL
whickered	NULL

at	NULL
you	NULL

in	NULL
them	NULL
still	NULL

they	NULL
formed	NULL
an	NULL
impish	NULL
multitude	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
Nuttlebury	NULL
she	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
inn	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
sign	NULL
creaked	NULL
in	NULL
response	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
greeting	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
footsteps	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
human	NULL
soul	NULL
heard	NULL
but	NULL
herself	NULL
.	NULL

Under	NULL
the	NULL
thatched	NULL
roofs	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
's	NULL
eye	NULL
beheld	NULL
relaxed	NULL
tendons	NULL
and	NULL
flaccid	NULL
muscles	NULL
,	NULL
spread	NULL
out	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
darkness	NULL
beneath	NULL
coverlets	NULL
made	NULL
of	NULL
little	NULL
purple	NULL
patchwork	NULL
squares	NULL

and	NULL
undergoing	NULL
a	NULL

process	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
hands	NULL
of	NULL
sleep	NULL
for	NULL
renewed	NULL
labour	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
morrow	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
hint	NULL
of	NULL
pink	NULL
nebulosity	NULL
appeared	NULL
on	NULL
Hambledon	NULL
Hill	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
three	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
maze	NULL
of	NULL
lanes	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
threaded	NULL

and	NULL
entered	NULL
Marlott	NULL

passing	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
club-girl	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
first	NULL
seen	NULL
Angel	NULL

when	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
danced	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
sense	NULL

remained	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
yet	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL

came	NULL
from	NULL

a	NULL

something	NULL

the	NULL

She	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL

softly	NULL
as	NULL

disturb	NULL
nobody	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

up	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL

came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL

whispered	NULL
that	NULL

no	NULL

she	NULL

sleeping	NULL

Tess	NULL

herself	NULL
a	NULL

then	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
place	NULL
as	NULL
nurse	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL

chamber	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL

when	NULL
she	NULL
contemplated	NULL
the	NULL

they	NULL
had	NULL
all	NULL
a	NULL
curiously	NULL

away	NULL
little	NULL

than	NULL
a	NULL

their	NULL
growth	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
necessity	NULL

applying	NULL

their	NULL

took	NULL
her	NULL
out	NULL

Her	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL

Tess	NULL
postponed	NULL
her	NULL
arguments	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
high	NULL
project	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
grappled	NULL
with	NULL
pressing	NULL
matters	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
seemed	NULL
little	NULL
improved	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
remittances	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
indoor	NULL
necessities	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
eased	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
her	NULL
attention	NULL
to	NULL
external	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
for	NULL
planting	NULL
and	NULL
sowing	NULL
;	NULL
many	NULL
gardens	NULL
and	NULL
allotments	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
villagers	NULL
had	NULL
already	NULL

but	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
allotment	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Durbeyfields	NULL
were	NULL
behindhand	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
found	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
dismay	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
having	NULL
eaten	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL

--	NULL
that	NULL
last	NULL
lapse	NULL

the	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
earliest	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
obtained	NULL
what	NULL
others	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
procure	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
days	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
was	NULL
well	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL

the	NULL
garden	NULL

under	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL

while	NULL
she	NULL
herself	NULL
undertook	NULL
the	NULL

rented	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
field	NULL
a	NULL
couple	NULL
of	NULL
hundred	NULL
yards	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
liked	NULL
doing	NULL
it	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
confinement	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sick	NULL
chamber	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL

her	NULL

in	NULL
a	NULL
high	NULL

dry	NULL

open	NULL
enclosure	NULL

where	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
forty	NULL

fifty	NULL

pieces	NULL

where	NULL
labour	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
its	NULL
briskest	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
hired	NULL
labour	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
had	NULL
ended	NULL
.	NULL

Digging	NULL
began	NULL
usually	NULL
at	NULL
six	NULL
o'clock	NULL
and	NULL
extended	NULL
indefinitely	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
dusk	NULL
or	NULL
moonlight	NULL
.	NULL

Just	NULL
now	NULL
heaps	NULL
of	NULL
dead	NULL
weeds	NULL
and	NULL
refuse	NULL
were	NULL
burning	NULL
on	NULL
many	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
plots	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
dry	NULL
weather	NULL
favouring	NULL
their	NULL
combustion	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
fine	NULL
day	NULL
Tess	NULL
and	NULL
'	NULL
Liza-Lu	NULL
worked	NULL
on	NULL
here	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
neighbours	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
rays	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
smote	NULL
flat	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
pegs	NULL
that	NULL
divided	NULL
the	NULL
plots	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
twilight	NULL
succeeded	NULL
to	NULL
sunset	NULL
the	NULL
flare	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
couch-grass	NULL
and	NULL
cabbage-stalk	NULL
fires	NULL
began	NULL
to	NULL
light	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
allotments	NULL
fitfully	NULL
,	NULL
their	NULL
outlines	NULL
appearing	NULL
and	NULL
disappearing	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
dense	NULL
smoke	NULL
as	NULL
wafted	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
wind	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
a	NULL
fire	NULL
glowed	NULL
,	NULL
banks	NULL
of	NULL
smoke	NULL
,	NULL
blown	NULL
level	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
ground	NULL
,	NULL
would	NULL
themselves	NULL
become	NULL
illuminated	NULL
to	NULL
an	NULL
opaque	NULL

,	NULL
screening	NULL
the	NULL
workpeople	NULL
from	NULL
one	NULL
another	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
meaning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
"	NULL
pillar	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
cloud	NULL
"	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
wall	NULL
by	NULL
day	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
light	NULL
by	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
understood	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
evening	NULL
thickened	NULL
,	NULL
some	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
gardening	NULL
men	NULL
and	NULL
women	NULL
gave	NULL
over	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
number	NULL
remained	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
their	NULL
planting	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
Tess	NULL
being	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
sent	NULL
her	NULL
sister	NULL
home	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
on	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
couch-burning	NULL
plots	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
laboured	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
fork	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
four	NULL
shining	NULL
prongs	NULL
resounding	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
stones	NULL
and	NULL
dry	NULL
clods	NULL
in	NULL
little	NULL
clicks	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
completely	NULL
involved	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
smoke	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
fire	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
leave	NULL
her	NULL
figure	NULL
free	NULL
,	NULL
irradiated	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
brassy	NULL
glare	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
heap	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
oddly	NULL
dressed	NULL
to-night	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
presented	NULL
a	NULL
somewhat	NULL
staring	NULL
aspect	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
attire	NULL
being	NULL
a	NULL
gown	NULL
bleached	NULL
by	NULL
many	NULL
washings	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
black	NULL
jacket	NULL
over	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
effect	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
being	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
wedding	NULL
and	NULL
funeral	NULL
guest	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
women	NULL
further	NULL
back	NULL
wore	NULL
white	NULL
aprons	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
pale	NULL
faces	NULL
,	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
gloom	NULL
,	NULL
except	NULL
when	NULL
at	NULL
moments	NULL
they	NULL
caught	NULL
a	NULL
flash	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
flames	NULL
.	NULL

Westward	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
wiry	NULL
boughs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
bare	NULL
thorn	NULL
hedge	NULL
which	NULL
formed	NULL
the	NULL
boundary	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
rose	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
pale	NULL
opalescence	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
sky	NULL
.	NULL

Above	NULL
,	NULL
Jupiter	NULL
hung	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
full-blown	NULL
jonquil	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
bright	NULL
as	NULL
almost	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
a	NULL
shade	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
small	NULL
nondescript	NULL
stars	NULL
were	NULL
appearing	NULL
elsewhere	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
distance	NULL
a	NULL
dog	NULL
barked	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wheels	NULL
occasionally	NULL
rattled	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
dry	NULL
road	NULL
.	NULL

Still	NULL
the	NULL
prongs	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
click	NULL
assiduously	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
late	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
air	NULL
was	NULL
fresh	NULL
and	NULL
keen	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
whisper	NULL
of	NULL
spring	NULL
in	NULL
it	NULL
that	NULL
cheered	NULL
the	NULL
workers	NULL
on	NULL
.	NULL

Something	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
hours	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
crackling	NULL
fires	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
fantastic	NULL
mysteries	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
and	NULL
shade	NULL
,	NULL
made	NULL
others	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
Tess	NULL
enjoy	NULL
being	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

Nightfall	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
frost	NULL
of	NULL
winter	NULL
comes	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
fiend	NULL
and	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
warmth	NULL
of	NULL
summer	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
lover	NULL
,	NULL
came	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
tranquillizer	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
March	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Nobody	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
or	NULL
her	NULL
companions	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
eyes	NULL
of	NULL
all	NULL
were	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
soil	NULL
as	NULL
its	NULL
turned	NULL
surface	NULL
was	NULL
revealed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
fires	NULL
.	NULL

Hence	NULL
as	NULL
Tess	NULL
stirred	NULL
the	NULL
clods	NULL
and	NULL
sang	NULL
her	NULL
foolish	NULL
little	NULL
songs	NULL
with	NULL
scarce	NULL
now	NULL
a	NULL
hope	NULL
that	NULL
Clare	NULL
would	NULL
ever	NULL
hear	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
notice	NULL
the	NULL
person	NULL
who	NULL
worked	NULL
nearest	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
smockfrock	NULL
who	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
forking	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
plot	NULL
as	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
supposed	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
had	NULL
sent	NULL
there	NULL
to	NULL
advance	NULL
the	NULL
work	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
became	NULL
more	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
when	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
digging	NULL
brought	NULL
him	NULL
closer	NULL
.	NULL

Sometimes	NULL
the	NULL
smoke	NULL
divided	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
it	NULL
swerved	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
were	NULL
visible	NULL
to	NULL
each	NULL
other	NULL
but	NULL
divided	NULL
from	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
fellow-worker	NULL
,	NULL
nor	NULL
did	NULL
he	NULL
speak	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

Nor	NULL
did	NULL
she	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
further	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
recollect	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
been	NULL
there	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
broad	NULL
daylight	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
know	NULL
him	NULL
as	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Marlott	NULL
labourers	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
wonder	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
absences	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
frequent	NULL
of	NULL
late	NULL
years	NULL
.	NULL

By-and-by	NULL
he	NULL
dug	NULL
so	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
fire-beams	NULL
were	NULL
reflected	NULL
as	NULL
distinctly	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
steel	NULL
prongs	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
fork	NULL
as	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
going	NULL
up	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
fire	NULL
to	NULL
throw	NULL
a	NULL
pitch	NULL
of	NULL
dead	NULL
weeds	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
fire	NULL
flared	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
beheld	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
unexpectedness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
presence	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
grotesqueness	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
appearance	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
gathered	NULL
smockfrock	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
worn	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
most	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
labourers	NULL

had	NULL
a	NULL
ghastly	NULL
comicality	NULL
that	NULL
chilled	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
its	NULL
bearing	NULL
.	NULL

D'Urberville	NULL
emitted	NULL
a	NULL
low	NULL
,	NULL
long	NULL
laugh	NULL

"	NULL

it	NULL

perhaps	NULL
it	NULL

the	NULL
three	NULL

it	NULL

disapproved	NULL

almost	NULL

when	NULL

Thus	NULL
the	NULL
Durbeyfields	NULL

once	NULL

saw	NULL
descending	NULL

the	NULL

the	NULL

On	NULL
the	NULL

preceding	NULL
their	NULL
removal	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
getting	NULL
dark	NULL
betimes	NULL
by	NULL
reason	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
drizzling	NULL
rain	NULL
which	NULL
blurred	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
it	NULL

the	NULL
last	NULL

they	NULL
would	NULL
spend	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL

and	NULL
Tess	NULL
was	NULL
keeping	NULL
house	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
return	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
kneeling	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
window-bench	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
casement	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
an	NULL
outer	NULL
pane	NULL
of	NULL
rain-water	NULL
was	NULL
sliding	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
inner	NULL
pane	NULL
of	NULL
glass	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
eyes	NULL
rested	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
web	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
spider	NULL
,	NULL
probably	NULL
starved	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
mistakenly	NULL
placed	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
corner	NULL
where	NULL
no	NULL
flies	NULL
ever	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shivered	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
slight	NULL
draught	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
casement	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
was	NULL
reflecting	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
position	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
household	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
perceived	NULL
her	NULL
own	NULL
evil	NULL
influence	NULL
.	NULL

Had	NULL
she	NULL
not	NULL
come	NULL
home	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
might	NULL
probably	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
on	NULL
as	NULL
weekly	NULL
tenants	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
observed	NULL
almost	NULL
immediately	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL
return	NULL
by	NULL
some	NULL
people	NULL
of	NULL
scrupulous	NULL
character	NULL
and	NULL
great	NULL
influence	NULL
:	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
her	NULL
idling	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
churchyard	NULL
,	NULL
restoring	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
trowel	NULL

baby	NULL
's	NULL
obliterated	NULL

By	NULL
this	NULL
means	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
living	NULL
here	NULL
again	NULL
;	NULL

was	NULL
scolded	NULL

from	NULL
Joan	NULL

had	NULL
independently	NULL
offered	NULL

leave	NULL

she	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
taken	NULL

her	NULL

said	NULL
Tess	NULL
to	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
bitterly	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
intent	NULL
upon	NULL
these	NULL
thoughts	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
hardly	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
took	NULL
note	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
man	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
white	NULL
mackintosh	NULL
whom	NULL
she	NULL
saw	NULL
riding	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

Possibly	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
owing	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
being	NULL
near	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
pane	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
so	NULL
quickly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
directed	NULL
his	NULL
horse	NULL
so	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
cottage-front	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
hoofs	NULL
were	NULL
almost	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
narrow	NULL
border	NULL
for	NULL
plants	NULL
growing	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
touched	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
riding-crop	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
observed	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
rain	NULL
had	NULL
nearly	NULL
ceased	NULL

and	NULL
she	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
casement	NULL
in	NULL
obedience	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
gesture	NULL

they	NULL

why	NULL

punished	NULL
so	NULL

She	NULL
passionately	NULL
seized	NULL
the	NULL

piece	NULL
of	NULL
paper	NULL
that	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
hand	NULL

scribbled	NULL

ran	NULL
out	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL

then	NULL
again	NULL
took	NULL
her	NULL
listless	NULL
place	NULL
inside	NULL
the	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
just	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL

there	NULL

It	NULL
grew	NULL
darker	NULL

the	NULL
fire-light	NULL
shining	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL

The	NULL
two	NULL

gone	NULL
out	NULL

Tess	NULL
at	NULL

They	NULL
all	NULL
became	NULL
silent	NULL

with	NULL
the	NULL
impressibility	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
age	NULL

were	NULL
ready	NULL

conjured	NULL
up	NULL

all	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
momentary	NULL
pause	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
broken	NULL

first	NULL

in	NULL
one	NULL

a	NULL

it	NULL

The	NULL
four	NULL
sang	NULL
on	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
phlegmatic	NULL
passivity	NULL
of	NULL
persons	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
long	NULL

settled	NULL
the	NULL
question	NULL

there	NULL
being	NULL
no	NULL
mistake	NULL
about	NULL
it	NULL

felt	NULL
that	NULL
further	NULL

was	NULL
not	NULL

With	NULL
features	NULL
strained	NULL
hard	NULL
to	NULL
enunciate	NULL
the	NULL
syllables	NULL
they	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
regard	NULL
the	NULL

the	NULL
youngest	NULL

over	NULL

pauses	NULL

rest	NULL

Tess	NULL
turned	NULL
from	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

Darkness	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
fallen	NULL
without	NULL

but	NULL
she	NULL
put	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
pane	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL

peer	NULL
into	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
really	NULL

how	NULL

how	NULL
confidently	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
leave	NULL

But	NULL

in	NULL

it	NULL

Tess	NULL

To	NULL
her	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL

she	NULL
soon	NULL

That	NULL

accomplished	NULL
within	NULL

the	NULL

Tess	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
utmost	NULL
difficulty	NULL
that	NULL

performed	NULL
it	NULL

Though	NULL

it	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL

on	NULL
,	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
saying	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
see	NULL
them	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
case	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
be	NULL
still	NULL
unsuccessful	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
search	NULL
for	NULL
shelter	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
heard	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
rode	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
inn	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shortly	NULL
after	NULL
came	NULL
out	NULL
on	NULL
foot	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
interim	NULL
Tess	NULL
,	NULL
left	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
children	NULL
inside	NULL
the	NULL
bedstead	NULL
,	NULL
remained	NULL
talking	NULL
with	NULL
them	NULL
awhile	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
,	NULL
seeing	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
done	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
them	NULL
comfortable	NULL
just	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
walked	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
churchyard	NULL
,	NULL
now	NULL
beginning	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
embrowned	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
shades	NULL
of	NULL
nightfall	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
church	NULL
was	NULL
unfastened	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
entered	NULL
it	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
life	NULL
.	NULL

Within	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
under	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
bedstead	NULL
stood	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
tombs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
,	NULL
covering	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
dates	NULL
several	NULL
centuries	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
canopied	NULL
,	NULL
altar-shaped	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
plain	NULL
;	NULL
their	NULL
carvings	NULL
being	NULL
defaced	NULL
and	NULL
broken	NULL
;	NULL
their	NULL
brasses	NULL
torn	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
matrices	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
rivet-holes	NULL
remaining	NULL
like	NULL
martin-holes	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
sandcliff	NULL
.	NULL

Of	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL
reminders	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
received	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
people	NULL
were	NULL
socially	NULL
extinct	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
none	NULL
so	NULL
forcible	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
spoliation	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
drew	NULL
near	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
dark	NULL
stone	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
inscribed	NULL
:	NULL
OSTIUM	NULL
SEPULCHRI	NULL
ANTIQUAE	NULL
FAMILIAE	NULL
D'URBERVILLE	NULL
Tess	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
read	NULL
Church-Latin	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
Cardinal	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
that	NULL
this	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
ancestral	NULL
sepulchre	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
tall	NULL
knights	NULL
of	NULL
whom	NULL
her	NULL
father	NULL
had	NULL
chanted	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
cups	NULL
lay	NULL
inside	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
musingly	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
withdraw	NULL
,	NULL
passing	NULL
near	NULL
an	NULL
altar-tomb	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
oldest	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
all	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
recumbent	NULL
figure	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
dusk	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
noticed	NULL
it	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
would	NULL
hardly	NULL
have	NULL
noticed	NULL
it	NULL
now	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
odd	NULL
fancy	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
effigy	NULL
moved	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
drew	NULL
close	NULL
to	NULL
it	NULL
she	NULL
discovered	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
moment	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
figure	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
living	NULL
person	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
shock	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
not	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
alone	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
violent	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
overcome	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
sank	NULL
down	NULL
nigh	NULL
to	NULL
fainting	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
recognized	NULL
Alec	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
form	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
leapt	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
slab	NULL
and	NULL
supported	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
you	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
smiling	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
got	NULL
up	NULL
there	NULL
not	NULL
to	NULL
interrupt	NULL
your	NULL
meditations	NULL

He	NULL
stamped	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
heel	NULL
heavily	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
;	NULL
whereupon	NULL
there	NULL
arose	NULL
a	NULL
hollow	NULL
echo	NULL
from	NULL
below	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
continued	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
he	NULL
blandly	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
in	NULL
passing	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
whispered	NULL
:	NULL
"	NULL
Mind	NULL
this	NULL
;	NULL
you	NULL
'll	NULL
be	NULL
civil	NULL
yet	NULL

"	NULL

When	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
gone	NULL
she	NULL
bent	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
entrance	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
vaults	NULL

and	NULL
said	NULL

"	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL

Marian	NULL

the	NULL

he	NULL

the	NULL

went	NULL
out	NULL

then	NULL
returning	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

It	NULL

though	NULL

inside	NULL

there	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
light	NULL
enough	NULL

Mrs	NULL

He	NULL
soon	NULL
retired	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
morning	NULL
,	NULL
feeling	NULL
exceedingly	NULL
unwell	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
room	NULL
pondering	NULL

The	NULL
circumstances	NULL
amid	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
Tess	NULL
were	NULL
such	NULL
that	NULL
though	NULL
,	NULL
while	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
south	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Equator	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
in	NULL
receipt	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
loving	NULL
epistle	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL
the	NULL
easiest	NULL
thing	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
world	NULL
to	NULL
rush	NULL
back	NULL
into	NULL
her	NULL
arms	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
he	NULL
chose	NULL
to	NULL
forgive	NULL
her	NULL

now	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
arrived	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
so	NULL
easy	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
had	NULL
seemed	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
passionate	NULL

and	NULL
her	NULL
present	NULL
letter	NULL

showing	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
estimate	NULL
of	NULL
him	NULL
had	NULL
changed	NULL
under	NULL
his	NULL
delay	NULL

too	NULL
justly	NULL
changed	NULL

he	NULL
sadly	NULL
owned	NULL

made	NULL
him	NULL
ask	NULL
himself	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
wise	NULL
to	NULL
confront	NULL
her	NULL
unannounced	NULL

the	NULL

Supposing	NULL
that	NULL

to	NULL
dislike	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
weeks	NULL
of	NULL
separation	NULL

a	NULL
sudden	NULL
meeting	NULL

bitter	NULL

Clare	NULL
therefore	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
best	NULL
to	NULL
prepare	NULL
Tess	NULL

her	NULL
family	NULL

sending	NULL
a	NULL

despatched	NULL
the	NULL
inquiry	NULL
that	NULL
very	NULL

before	NULL
the	NULL
week	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
there	NULL
came	NULL
a	NULL
short	NULL
reply	NULL

Mrs	NULL

did	NULL
not	NULL
remove	NULL

embarrassment	NULL

DURBEYFIELD	NULL
It	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
relief	NULL
to	NULL
Clare	NULL
to	NULL
learn	NULL
that	NULL
Tess	NULL
was	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
apparently	NULL
well	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
mother	NULL
's	NULL
stiff	NULL
reticence	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
whereabouts	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
long	NULL
distress	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
angry	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
evidently	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
would	NULL
wait	NULL
till	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
could	NULL
inform	NULL
him	NULL
of	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
return	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
her	NULL
letter	NULL
implied	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
soon	NULL

He	NULL
deserved	NULL
no	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
a	NULL
love	NULL
"	NULL
which	NULL
alters	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
alteration	NULL
finds	NULL
"	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
undergone	NULL
some	NULL
strange	NULL
experiences	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
absence	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
seen	NULL
the	NULL
virtual	NULL
Faustina	NULL

literal	NULL
Cornelia	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
spiritual	NULL
Lucretia	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
corporeal	NULL
Phryne	NULL
;	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
thought	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
taken	NULL
and	NULL
set	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
as	NULL
one	NULL
deserving	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
stoned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
wife	NULL
of	NULL
Uriah	NULL
being	NULL
made	NULL
a	NULL
queen	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
asked	NULL
himself	NULL
why	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
judged	NULL
Tess	NULL
constructively	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
biographically	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
will	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
deed	NULL
?	NULL

A	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
passed	NULL
while	NULL
he	NULL
waited	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
promised	NULL
second	NULL
note	NULL
from	NULL
Joan	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
indirectly	NULL
to	NULL
recover	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
more	NULL
strength	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
strength	NULL
showed	NULL
signs	NULL
of	NULL
coming	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
sign	NULL
of	NULL
Joan	NULL
's	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
he	NULL
hunted	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
letter	NULL
sent	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
Brazil	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
Tess	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
from	NULL
Flintcomb-Ash	NULL

and	NULL
re-read	NULL
it	NULL

The	NULL
sentences	NULL
touched	NULL
him	NULL

had	NULL
first	NULL
perused	NULL

to	NULL

from	NULL

Clare	NULL
determined	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
believe	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
more	NULL
recent	NULL
and	NULL
severer	NULL
regard	NULL

him	NULL

but	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
find	NULL
her	NULL
immediately	NULL

He	NULL
asked	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
if	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
applied	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
money	NULL
during	NULL
his	NULL
absence	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
father	NULL
returned	NULL
a	NULL
negative	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
to	NULL
Angel	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
pride	NULL
had	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
way	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
suffered	NULL
privation	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
his	NULL
remarks	NULL
his	NULL
parents	NULL
now	NULL
gathered	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
reason	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
separation	NULL

their	NULL
Christianity	NULL

LIV	NULL
In	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
Clare	NULL
was	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
whence	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
watched	NULL
his	NULL
thin	NULL
figure	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
disappeared	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
declined	NULL
to	NULL
borrow	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
's	NULL
old	NULL
mare	NULL
,	NULL
well	NULL
knowing	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
necessity	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
household	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
inn	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
he	NULL
hired	NULL
a	NULL
trap	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
wait	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
harnessing	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
very	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
after	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
driving	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
hill	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
three	NULL
or	NULL
four	NULL
months	NULL
earlier	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
,	NULL
Tess	NULL
had	NULL
descended	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
hopes	NULL
and	NULL
ascended	NULL
with	NULL
such	NULL
shattered	NULL
purposes	NULL
.	NULL

Benvill	NULL
Lane	NULL
soon	NULL
stretched	NULL
before	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
hedges	NULL
and	NULL
trees	NULL
purple	NULL
with	NULL
buds	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
other	NULL
things	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
only	NULL
recalled	NULL
himself	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
sufficiently	NULL
to	NULL
enable	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
keep	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL

In	NULL
something	NULL
less	NULL

he	NULL
had	NULL
skirted	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
King	NULL

ascended	NULL

Tess	NULL
had	NULL

compelled	NULL
by	NULL
Alec	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
whim	NULL
of	NULL
reformation	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
swear	NULL
the	NULL
strange	NULL
oath	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
never	NULL
wilfully	NULL
tempt	NULL
him	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
pale	NULL
and	NULL
blasted	NULL
nettle-stems	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
preceding	NULL
year	NULL
even	NULL
now	NULL
lingered	NULL
nakedly	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
banks	NULL

young	NULL
green	NULL
nettles	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
spring	NULL
growing	NULL
from	NULL
their	NULL

Thence	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
verge	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
upland	NULL
overhanging	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
Hintocks	NULL
,	NULL

,	NULL
turning	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL

plunged	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL

calcareous	NULL
region	NULL
of	NULL
Flintcomb-Ash	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
address	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
written	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
letters	NULL

which	NULL
he	NULL
supposed	NULL

the	NULL

her	NULL

.	NULL

Here	NULL
,	NULL
of	NULL
course	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
find	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
what	NULL
added	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
depression	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
discovery	NULL
that	NULL
no	NULL
"	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Clare	NULL
"	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
been	NULL
heard	NULL
of	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
cottagers	NULL
or	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
farmer	NULL
himself	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
Tess	NULL
was	NULL
remembered	NULL
well	NULL
enough	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
Christian	NULL
name	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
name	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
obviously	NULL
never	NULL
used	NULL
during	NULL
their	NULL
separation	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
dignified	NULL
sense	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
total	NULL
severance	NULL
was	NULL
shown	NULL
not	NULL
much	NULL
less	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
abstention	NULL
than	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
hardships	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
chosen	NULL
to	NULL
undergo	NULL
(	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
now	NULL
learnt	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
)	NULL
rather	NULL
than	NULL
apply	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
for	NULL
more	NULL
funds	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
this	NULL
place	NULL
they	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
Tess	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
,	NULL
without	NULL
due	NULL
notice	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
home	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
parents	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
Blackmoor	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
therefore	NULL
became	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
had	NULL
told	NULL
him	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
now	NULL
at	NULL
Marlott	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
curiously	NULL
reticent	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
actual	NULL
address	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
course	NULL
was	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
Marlott	NULL
and	NULL
inquire	NULL
for	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
farmer	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
churlish	NULL
with	NULL
Tess	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
smooth-tongued	NULL
to	NULL
Clare	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
lent	NULL
him	NULL
a	NULL
horse	NULL
and	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
drive	NULL
him	NULL
towards	NULL
Marlott	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
gig	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
arrived	NULL
in	NULL
being	NULL
sent	NULL
back	NULL
to	NULL
Emminster	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
limit	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
's	NULL
journey	NULL
with	NULL
that	NULL
horse	NULL
was	NULL
reached	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
would	NULL
not	NULL
accept	NULL
the	NULL
loan	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
farmer	NULL
's	NULL
vehicle	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
further	NULL
distance	NULL
than	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
outskirts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Vale	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
sending	NULL
it	NULL
back	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
driven	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
put	NULL
up	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
inn	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
entered	NULL
on	NULL
foot	NULL
the	NULL
region	NULL
wherein	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
dear	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
birth	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
yet	NULL
too	NULL
early	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
year	NULL
for	NULL
much	NULL
colour	NULL
to	NULL
appear	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
gardens	NULL
and	NULL
foliage	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
so-called	NULL
spring	NULL
was	NULL
but	NULL
winter	NULL
overlaid	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
thin	NULL
coat	NULL
of	NULL
greenness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
parcel	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
expectations	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
Tess	NULL
had	NULL
passed	NULL
the	NULL
years	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
childhood	NULL
was	NULL
now	NULL
inhabited	NULL
by	NULL
another	NULL
family	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
known	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
new	NULL
residents	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
taking	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
interest	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
doings	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
the	NULL
homestead	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
passed	NULL
its	NULL
primal	NULL
time	NULL
in	NULL
conjunction	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
histories	NULL
of	NULL
others	NULL
,	NULL
beside	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
histories	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
were	NULL
but	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
tale	NULL
told	NULL
by	NULL
an	NULL
idiot	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
walked	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
garden	NULL
paths	NULL
with	NULL
thoughts	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
own	NULL
concerns	NULL
entirely	NULL
uppermost	NULL
,	NULL
bringing	NULL
their	NULL
actions	NULL
at	NULL
every	NULL
moment	NULL
in	NULL
jarring	NULL
collision	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
dim	NULL
ghosts	NULL
behind	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
talking	NULL
as	NULL
though	NULL
the	NULL
time	NULL
when	NULL
Tess	NULL
lived	NULL
there	NULL
were	NULL
not	NULL
one	NULL
whit	NULL
intenser	NULL
in	NULL
story	NULL
than	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

Even	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
birds	NULL
sang	NULL
over	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
they	NULL
thought	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
nobody	NULL
missing	NULL
in	NULL
particular	NULL
.	NULL

On	NULL
inquiry	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
precious	NULL
innocents	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
whom	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
predecessors	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
failing	NULL
memory	NULL
,	NULL
Clare	NULL
learned	NULL
that	NULL
John	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
was	NULL
dead	NULL
;	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
widow	NULL
and	NULL
children	NULL
had	NULL
left	NULL
Marlott	NULL
,	NULL
declaring	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL
live	NULL
at	NULL
Kingsbere	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
instead	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
had	NULL
gone	NULL
on	NULL
to	NULL
another	NULL
place	NULL
they	NULL
mentioned	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
Clare	NULL
abhorred	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
for	NULL
ceasing	NULL
to	NULL
contain	NULL
Tess	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hastened	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
hated	NULL
presence	NULL
without	NULL
once	NULL
looking	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
way	NULL
was	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
field	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
first	NULL
beheld	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
dance	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
as	NULL
bad	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
--	NULL
even	NULL
worse	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
passed	NULL
on	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
churchyard	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
,	NULL
amongst	NULL
the	NULL
new	NULL
headstones	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
saw	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
somewhat	NULL
superior	NULL
design	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
inscription	NULL
ran	NULL

In	NULL

HOW	NULL

THE	NULL
MIGHTY	NULL

Some	NULL
man	NULL
,	NULL
apparently	NULL
the	NULL
sexton	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
observed	NULL
Clare	NULL
standing	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
drew	NULL
nigh	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ah	NULL

"	NULL
And	NULL
why	NULL

n't	NULL
they	NULL
respect	NULL

"	NULL
Oh	NULL

Bless	NULL

I	NULL

even	NULL
this	NULL

all	NULL
the	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Ah	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
put	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
man	NULL
told	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mason	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
village	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
churchyard	NULL
,	NULL
Clare	NULL
called	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
mason	NULL
's	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
statement	NULL
was	NULL
true	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
paid	NULL
the	NULL
bill	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
migrants	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
distance	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
long	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
walk	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
Clare	NULL
felt	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
strong	NULL
desire	NULL
for	NULL
isolation	NULL
that	NULL
at	NULL
first	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
neither	NULL
hire	NULL
a	NULL
conveyance	NULL
nor	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
circuitous	NULL
line	NULL
of	NULL
railway	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
might	NULL
eventually	NULL
reach	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
Shaston	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
he	NULL
must	NULL
hire	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
was	NULL
such	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
enter	NULL
Joan	NULL
's	NULL
place	NULL
till	NULL
about	NULL
seven	NULL
o'clock	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
traversed	NULL
a	NULL
distance	NULL
of	NULL
over	NULL
twenty	NULL
miles	NULL
since	NULL
leaving	NULL
Marlott	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
village	NULL
being	NULL
small	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
little	NULL
difficulty	NULL
in	NULL
finding	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
's	NULL
tenement	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
house	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
walled	NULL
garden	NULL
,	NULL
remote	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
main	NULL
road	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
stowed	NULL
away	NULL
her	NULL
clumsy	NULL
old	NULL
furniture	NULL
as	NULL
best	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
plain	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
reason	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
wished	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
visit	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
call	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
somewhat	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
intrusion	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
came	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
evening	NULL
sky	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
time	NULL
that	NULL
Clare	NULL
had	NULL
ever	NULL
met	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
preoccupied	NULL
to	NULL
observe	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
a	NULL
handsome	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
garb	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
respectable	NULL
widow	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
explain	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
husband	NULL

and	NULL
his	NULL
object	NULL
in	NULL
coming	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
it	NULL
awkwardly	NULL
enough	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
want	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
added	NULL

"	NULL

said	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL
Because	NULL

Joan	NULL

you	NULL
ought	NULL

said	NULL
she	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
admit	NULL
it	NULL

Where	NULL
is	NULL
she	NULL
staying	NULL

"	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
beginning	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
interview	NULL
Joan	NULL
had	NULL
disclosed	NULL
her	NULL
embarrassment	NULL
by	NULL
keeping	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
side	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
cheek	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
--	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL

exactly	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL

she	NULL
answered	NULL

"	NULL
She	NULL

Where	NULL

she	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
is	NULL
not	NULL
there	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

In	NULL
her	NULL
evasiveness	NULL
she	NULL
paused	NULL
again	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
younger	NULL
children	NULL
had	NULL
by	NULL
this	NULL
time	NULL
crept	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL

pulling	NULL
at	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL

the	NULL

Joan	NULL
whispered	NULL

Clare	NULL
saw	NULL
her	NULL
efforts	NULL
for	NULL
reticence	NULL

and	NULL
asked	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
apparent	NULL
that	NULL
Joan	NULL
spoke	NULL
the	NULL
truth	NULL
in	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
pressed	NULL
her	NULL
no	NULL
further	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Are	NULL
you	NULL

want	NULL
of	NULL
anything	NULL

he	NULL

gently	NULL

No	NULL

she	NULL
replied	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL

Without	NULL
entering	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
Clare	NULL
turned	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
station	NULL
three	NULL
miles	NULL
ahead	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
paying	NULL
off	NULL
his	NULL
coachman	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
thither	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
last	NULL
train	NULL
to	NULL
Sandbourne	NULL
left	NULL
shortly	NULL
after	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
bore	NULL
Clare	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL
wheels	NULL
.	NULL

LV	NULL
At	NULL
eleven	NULL
o'clock	NULL
that	NULL
night	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
secured	NULL
a	NULL
bed	NULL
at	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
hotels	NULL
and	NULL
telegraphed	NULL
his	NULL
address	NULL
to	NULL
his	NULL
father	NULL
immediately	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
arrival	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
walked	NULL
out	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
streets	NULL
of	NULL
Sandbourne	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
too	NULL
late	NULL
to	NULL
call	NULL
on	NULL
or	NULL
inquire	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
reluctantly	NULL
postponed	NULL
his	NULL
purpose	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
retire	NULL
to	NULL
rest	NULL
just	NULL
yet	NULL
.	NULL

This	NULL
fashionable	NULL
watering-place	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
eastern	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
western	NULL
stations	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
piers	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
groves	NULL
of	NULL
pines	NULL

its	NULL
promenades	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
its	NULL
covered	NULL
gardens	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
Angel	NULL
Clare	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
fairy	NULL
place	NULL
suddenly	NULL
created	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
stroke	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
wand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
allowed	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
dusty	NULL
.	NULL

An	NULL
outlying	NULL
eastern	NULL
tract	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
enormous	NULL
Egdon	NULL
Waste	NULL
was	NULL
close	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
very	NULL
verge	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
tawny	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
antiquity	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
glittering	NULL
novelty	NULL
as	NULL
this	NULL
pleasure	NULL
city	NULL
had	NULL
chosen	NULL
to	NULL
spring	NULL
up	NULL
.	NULL

Within	NULL
the	NULL
space	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
mile	NULL
from	NULL
its	NULL
outskirts	NULL
every	NULL
irregularity	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
soil	NULL
was	NULL
prehistoric	NULL
,	NULL
every	NULL
channel	NULL
an	NULL
undisturbed	NULL
British	NULL
trackway	NULL
;	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
sod	NULL
having	NULL
been	NULL
turned	NULL
there	NULL
since	NULL
the	NULL
days	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Caesars	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
the	NULL
exotic	NULL
had	NULL
grown	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
prophet	NULL
's	NULL
gourd	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
had	NULL
drawn	NULL
hither	NULL
Tess	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
the	NULL
midnight	NULL
lamps	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
up	NULL
and	NULL
down	NULL
the	NULL
winding	NULL
way	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
new	NULL
world	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
could	NULL
discern	NULL
between	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
and	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
stars	NULL
the	NULL
lofty	NULL
roofs	NULL
,	NULL
chimneys	NULL
,	NULL
gazebos	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
towers	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
numerous	NULL
fanciful	NULL
residences	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
place	NULL
was	NULL
composed	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
city	NULL
of	NULL
detached	NULL
mansions	NULL
;	NULL
a	NULL
Mediterranean	NULL
lounging-place	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
English	NULL
Channel	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
seen	NULL
now	NULL
by	NULL
night	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
even	NULL
more	NULL
imposing	NULL
than	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
sea	NULL
was	NULL
near	NULL
at	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
not	NULL
intrusive	NULL
;	NULL
it	NULL
murmured	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
pines	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
pines	NULL
murmured	NULL
in	NULL
precisely	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
tones	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
thought	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
the	NULL
sea	NULL
.	NULL

Where	NULL
could	NULL
Tess	NULL
possibly	NULL
be	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
cottage-girl	NULL
,	NULL
his	NULL
young	NULL
wife	NULL
,	NULL
amidst	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
wealth	NULL
and	NULL
fashion	NULL
?	NULL

The	NULL
more	NULL
he	NULL
pondered	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
more	NULL
was	NULL
he	NULL
puzzled	NULL
.	NULL

Were	NULL
there	NULL
any	NULL
cows	NULL
to	NULL
milk	NULL
here	NULL
?	NULL

There	NULL
certainly	NULL
were	NULL
no	NULL
fields	NULL
to	NULL
till	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
most	NULL
probably	NULL
engaged	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
something	NULL
in	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
these	NULL
large	NULL
houses	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
sauntered	NULL
along	NULL
,	NULL
looking	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
chamber-windows	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
lights	NULL
going	NULL
out	NULL
one	NULL
by	NULL
one	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wondered	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
might	NULL
be	NULL
hers	NULL
.	NULL

Conjecture	NULL
was	NULL
useless	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
just	NULL
after	NULL
twelve	NULL
o'clock	NULL
he	NULL
entered	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
bed	NULL
.	NULL

Before	NULL
putting	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL
light	NULL
he	NULL
re-read	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
impassioned	NULL
letter	NULL
.	NULL

Sleep	NULL
,	NULL
however	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
--	NULL
so	NULL
near	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
from	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
continually	NULL
lifted	NULL
the	NULL
window-blind	NULL
and	NULL
regarded	NULL
the	NULL
backs	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
opposite	NULL
houses	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
wondered	NULL
behind	NULL
which	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sashes	NULL
she	NULL
reposed	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
might	NULL
almost	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
have	NULL
sat	NULL
up	NULL
all	NULL
night	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
he	NULL
arose	NULL
at	NULL
seven	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
shortly	NULL
after	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
,	NULL
taking	NULL
the	NULL
direction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
chief	NULL
post-office	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
he	NULL
met	NULL
an	NULL
intelligent	NULL
postman	NULL
coming	NULL
out	NULL
with	NULL
letters	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
delivery	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
the	NULL
address	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
Mrs	NULL
Clare	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

asked	NULL
Angel	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
postman	NULL
shook	NULL
his	NULL
head	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
,	NULL
remembering	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
continue	NULL
the	NULL
use	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
maiden	NULL
name	NULL
,	NULL
Clare	NULL
said	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Of	NULL
a	NULL
Miss	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

This	NULL
also	NULL
was	NULL
strange	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
postman	NULL
addressed	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
There	NULL
's	NULL
visitors	NULL
coming	NULL
and	NULL
going	NULL
every	NULL
day	NULL

"	NULL
he	NULL
said	NULL
;	NULL
"	NULL
and	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
't	NULL

"	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
comrades	NULL
hastening	NULL
out	NULL
at	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
name	NULL
was	NULL
repeated	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
know	NULL

"	NULL
said	NULL
the	NULL
second	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
That	NULL
's	NULL
it	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

cried	NULL
Clare	NULL
,	NULL
pleased	NULL
to	NULL
think	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
reverted	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
real	NULL
pronunciation	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
place	NULL
is	NULL
The	NULL
Herons	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
A	NULL
stylish	NULL

.	NULL

'T	NULL
is	NULL
all	NULL

ee	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Clare	NULL
received	NULL
directions	NULL
how	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
hastened	NULL
thither	NULL
,	NULL
arriving	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
milkman	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
Herons	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
an	NULL
ordinary	NULL
villa	NULL
,	NULL
stood	NULL
in	NULL
its	NULL
own	NULL
grounds	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
certainly	NULL
the	NULL
last	NULL
place	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
one	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
find	NULL
lodgings	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
private	NULL
was	NULL
its	NULL
appearance	NULL
.	NULL

If	NULL
poor	NULL
Tess	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
servant	NULL
here	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
feared	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
would	NULL
go	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
back-door	NULL
to	NULL
that	NULL
milkman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
thither	NULL
also	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
doubts	NULL
he	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rang	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
hour	NULL
being	NULL
early	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
landlady	NULL
herself	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
inquired	NULL
for	NULL
Teresa	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
or	NULL
Durbeyfield	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Mrs	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Yes	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

Tess	NULL
,	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
passed	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
married	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
felt	NULL
glad	NULL
,	NULL
even	NULL
though	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
not	NULL
adopted	NULL
his	NULL
name	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Will	NULL

her	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
rather	NULL
early	NULL

What	NULL

"	NULL
Angel	NULL

"	NULL
No	NULL

Angel	NULL

It	NULL
is	NULL
my	NULL
Christian	NULL
name	NULL

She	NULL
'll	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
'll	NULL

she	NULL

awake	NULL

"	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
shown	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
room	NULL
--	NULL
the	NULL
dining-room	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
out	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
spring	NULL
curtains	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
little	NULL
lawn	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
rhododendrons	NULL
and	NULL
other	NULL
shrubs	NULL
upon	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Obviously	NULL
her	NULL
position	NULL
was	NULL
by	NULL
no	NULL
means	NULL
so	NULL
bad	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
feared	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
crossed	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
must	NULL
somehow	NULL
have	NULL
claimed	NULL
and	NULL
sold	NULL
the	NULL
jewels	NULL
to	NULL
attain	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
blame	NULL
her	NULL
for	NULL
one	NULL
moment	NULL
.	NULL

Soon	NULL
his	NULL
sharpened	NULL
ear	NULL
detected	NULL
footsteps	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
stairs	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
which	NULL
his	NULL
heart	NULL
thumped	NULL
so	NULL
painfully	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
hardly	NULL
stand	NULL
firm	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Dear	NULL

what	NULL
will	NULL

of	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
to	NULL
himself	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
opened	NULL
.	NULL

Tess	NULL
appeared	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
threshold	NULL
--	NULL
not	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
expected	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
her	NULL
--	NULL
bewilderingly	NULL
otherwise	NULL

indeed	NULL

Her	NULL
great	NULL
natural	NULL
beauty	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
if	NULL
not	NULL
heightened	NULL
,	NULL
rendered	NULL
more	NULL
obvious	NULL
by	NULL
her	NULL
attire	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
loosely	NULL
wrapped	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cashmere	NULL
dressing-gown	NULL
of	NULL
gray-white	NULL
,	NULL
embroidered	NULL
in	NULL
half-mourning	NULL
tints	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
wore	NULL
slippers	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
hue	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
neck	NULL
rose	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
frill	NULL
of	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
well-remembered	NULL
cable	NULL
of	NULL
dark-brown	NULL
hair	NULL
was	NULL
partially	NULL
coiled	NULL
up	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
mass	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL

partly	NULL
hanging	NULL
on	NULL
her	NULL

the	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
held	NULL
out	NULL

they	NULL
had	NULL
fallen	NULL
again	NULL
to	NULL

Mere	NULL

he	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL

thought	NULL
his	NULL

distasteful	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL

the	NULL

in	NULL
her	NULL
chair	NULL

As	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
her	NULL
eyes	NULL
glanced	NULL
casually	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
ceiling	NULL
till	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
arrested	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
spot	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
white	NULL
surface	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
noticed	NULL
there	NULL
before	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
size	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
wafer	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
first	NULL
observed	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
speedily	NULL
grew	NULL
as	NULL
large	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
palm	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
perceive	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
red	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
oblong	NULL
white	NULL
ceiling	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
scarlet	NULL
blot	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
midst	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL
appearance	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
gigantic	NULL
ace	NULL
of	NULL
hearts	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Brooks	NULL
had	NULL
strange	NULL
qualms	NULL
of	NULL
misgiving	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
got	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
touched	NULL
the	NULL
spot	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
ceiling	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
fingers	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
damp	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
fancied	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
blood	NULL
stain	NULL
.	NULL

Descending	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
parlour	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
upstairs	NULL
,	NULL
intending	NULL
to	NULL
enter	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
overhead	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
the	NULL
bedchamber	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
back	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
nerveless	NULL
woman	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
become	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
bring	NULL
herself	NULL
to	NULL
attempt	NULL
the	NULL
handle	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
listened	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
dead	NULL
silence	NULL
within	NULL
was	NULL
broken	NULL
only	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
regular	NULL
beat	NULL
.	NULL

Drip	NULL
,	NULL
drip	NULL
,	NULL
drip	NULL
.	NULL

Mrs	NULL
Brooks	NULL
hastened	NULL
downstairs	NULL
,	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
front	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
ran	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
street	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
man	NULL
she	NULL
knew	NULL
,	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
workmen	NULL
employed	NULL
at	NULL
an	NULL
adjoining	NULL
villa	NULL
,	NULL
was	NULL
passing	NULL
by	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
begged	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
upstairs	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
feared	NULL
something	NULL
had	NULL
happened	NULL
to	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
lodgers	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
workman	NULL
assented	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
followed	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
landing	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
drawing-room	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
stood	NULL
back	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
entering	NULL
herself	NULL
behind	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
room	NULL
was	NULL
empty	NULL
;	NULL
the	NULL
breakfast	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
substantial	NULL
repast	NULL
of	NULL
coffee	NULL

eggs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
a	NULL
cold	NULL
ham	NULL
--	NULL
lay	NULL
spread	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
table	NULL
untouched	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
it	NULL
up	NULL
,	NULL
excepting	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
carving-knife	NULL
was	NULL
missing	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
asked	NULL
the	NULL
man	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
folding-doors	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
adjoining	NULL
room	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
doors	NULL
,	NULL
entered	NULL
a	NULL
step	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
came	NULL
back	NULL
almost	NULL
instantly	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
rigid	NULL
face	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
good	NULL
God	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
gentleman	NULL
in	NULL
bed	NULL
is	NULL
dead	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
think	NULL
he	NULL
has	NULL
been	NULL
hurt	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
knife	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
lot	NULL
of	NULL
blood	NULL
had	NULL
run	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
floor	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

The	NULL
alarm	NULL
was	NULL
soon	NULL
given	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
lately	NULL
been	NULL
so	NULL
quiet	NULL
resounded	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
tramp	NULL
of	NULL
many	NULL
footsteps	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
surgeon	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
rest	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wound	NULL
was	NULL
small	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
the	NULL
point	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
blade	NULL
had	NULL
touched	NULL
the	NULL
heart	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
victim	NULL
,	NULL
who	NULL
lay	NULL
on	NULL
his	NULL
back	NULL
,	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
fixed	NULL
,	NULL
dead	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
scarcely	NULL
moved	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
infliction	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
blow	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
the	NULL
news	NULL
that	NULL
a	NULL
gentleman	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
temporary	NULL
visitor	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
stabbed	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
bed	NULL
,	NULL
spread	NULL
through	NULL
every	NULL
street	NULL
and	NULL
villa	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
popular	NULL
watering-place	NULL
.	NULL

LVII	NULL
Meanwhile	NULL
Angel	NULL
Clare	NULL
had	NULL
walked	NULL
automatically	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
way	NULL
by	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
entering	NULL
his	NULL
hotel	NULL
,	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
breakfast	NULL
,	NULL
staring	NULL
at	NULL
nothingness	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
eating	NULL
and	NULL
drinking	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
till	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
he	NULL
demanded	NULL
his	NULL
bill	NULL
;	NULL
having	NULL
paid	NULL
which	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
his	NULL
dressing-bag	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
only	NULL
luggage	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
out	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
departure	NULL
a	NULL
telegram	NULL
was	NULL
handed	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
words	NULL
from	NULL
his	NULL
mother	NULL
,	NULL
stating	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
glad	NULL
to	NULL
know	NULL
his	NULL
address	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
informing	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
his	NULL
brother	NULL
Cuthbert	NULL
had	NULL
proposed	NULL
to	NULL
and	NULL
been	NULL
accepted	NULL
by	NULL
Mercy	NULL
Chant	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
crumpled	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
paper	NULL
and	NULL
followed	NULL
the	NULL
route	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
;	NULL
reaching	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
no	NULL
train	NULL
leaving	NULL
for	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
and	NULL
more	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
wait	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
having	NULL
waited	NULL
a	NULL
quarter	NULL
of	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
felt	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
wait	NULL
there	NULL
no	NULL
longer	NULL
.	NULL

Broken	NULL
in	NULL
heart	NULL
and	NULL
numbed	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
nothing	NULL
to	NULL
hurry	NULL
for	NULL
;	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
wished	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
town	NULL
which	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
the	NULL
scene	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
an	NULL
experience	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
station	NULL
onward	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
let	NULL
the	NULL
train	NULL
pick	NULL
him	NULL
up	NULL
there	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
highway	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
followed	NULL
was	NULL
open	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
at	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
distance	NULL
dipped	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
valley	NULL
,	NULL
across	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
could	NULL
be	NULL
seen	NULL
running	NULL
from	NULL
edge	NULL
to	NULL
edge	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
traversed	NULL
the	NULL
greater	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
depression	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
climbing	NULL
the	NULL
western	NULL
acclivity	NULL
when	NULL
,	NULL
pausing	NULL
for	NULL
breath	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
unconsciously	NULL
looked	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
so	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
something	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
impel	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
act	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
tape-like	NULL
surface	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
diminished	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
rear	NULL
as	NULL
far	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
gazed	NULL
a	NULL
moving	NULL
spot	NULL
intruded	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
white	NULL
vacuity	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
perspective	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
human	NULL
figure	NULL
running	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
waited	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
a	NULL
dim	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
somebody	NULL
was	NULL
trying	NULL
to	NULL
overtake	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
form	NULL
descending	NULL
the	NULL
incline	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
woman	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
yet	NULL
so	NULL
entirely	NULL
was	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
blinded	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
idea	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
wife	NULL
's	NULL
following	NULL
him	NULL
that	NULL
even	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
nearer	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
recognize	NULL
her	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
totally	NULL
changed	NULL
attire	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
he	NULL
now	NULL
beheld	NULL
her	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
till	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
close	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
could	NULL
believe	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
Tess	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
saw	NULL
you	NULL
--	NULL
turn	NULL
away	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
station	NULL
--	NULL
just	NULL
before	NULL
I	NULL
got	NULL
there	NULL
--	NULL
and	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
following	NULL
you	NULL
all	NULL
this	NULL
way	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
pale	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
breathless	NULL
,	NULL
so	NULL
quivering	NULL
in	NULL
every	NULL
muscle	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
ask	NULL
her	NULL
a	NULL
single	NULL
question	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
seizing	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pulling	NULL
it	NULL
within	NULL
his	NULL
arm	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
led	NULL
her	NULL
along	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
avoid	NULL
meeting	NULL
any	NULL
possible	NULL
wayfarers	NULL
he	NULL
left	NULL
the	NULL
high	NULL
road	NULL
and	NULL
took	NULL
a	NULL
footpath	NULL
under	NULL
some	NULL
fir-trees	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
deep	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
moaning	NULL
boughs	NULL
he	NULL
stopped	NULL
and	NULL
looked	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL
inquiringly	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Angel	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
she	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
waiting	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
do	NULL
you	NULL
know	NULL
what	NULL

tell	NULL
you	NULL

"	NULL

A	NULL
pitiful	NULL
white	NULL
smile	NULL
lit	NULL
her	NULL
face	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
What	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
thinking	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
strangeness	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
manner	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
some	NULL
delirium	NULL

I	NULL

she	NULL
continued	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Still	NULL
,	NULL
I	NULL
owed	NULL
it	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
myself	NULL

Angel	NULL
.	NULL

I	NULL
feared	NULL
long	NULL
ago	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
I	NULL
struck	NULL
him	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
mouth	NULL
with	NULL
my	NULL
glove	NULL

that	NULL
I	NULL
might	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
some	NULL
day	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
trap	NULL
he	NULL
set	NULL
for	NULL
me	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
simple	NULL
youth	NULL

his	NULL
wrong	NULL
to	NULL
you	NULL
through	NULL
me	NULL

He	NULL
has	NULL
come	NULL
between	NULL
us	NULL

ruined	NULL
us	NULL

and	NULL
now	NULL
he	NULL
can	NULL
never	NULL
do	NULL
it	NULL
any	NULL
more	NULL

I	NULL
never	NULL
loved	NULL
him	NULL
at	NULL
all	NULL

as	NULL
I	NULL
loved	NULL

You	NULL

You	NULL

to	NULL
me	NULL

I	NULL
was	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL

him	NULL

Why	NULL

I	NULL

By	NULL

attempted	NULL

at	NULL

what	NULL

his	NULL
horror	NULL
at	NULL
her	NULL

mixed	NULL
with	NULL
amazement	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
strength	NULL
of	NULL
her	NULL
affection	NULL
for	NULL
himself	NULL

and	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
strangeness	NULL
of	NULL
its	NULL
quality	NULL

had	NULL

her	NULL

weeping	NULL
with	NULL
happiness	NULL

were	NULL
an	NULL
aberration	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
momentarily	NULL
flashed	NULL
through	NULL
his	NULL
mind	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
family	NULL
tradition	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
coach	NULL
and	NULL
murder	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
arisen	NULL
because	NULL
the	NULL
d'Urbervilles	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
known	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
these	NULL
things	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
well	NULL
as	NULL
his	NULL
confused	NULL
and	NULL
excited	NULL
ideas	NULL
could	NULL
reason	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
supposed	NULL
that	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
moment	NULL
of	NULL
mad	NULL
grief	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
spoke	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
had	NULL
lost	NULL
its	NULL
balance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
plunged	NULL
her	NULL
into	NULL
this	NULL
abyss	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
very	NULL
terrible	NULL
if	NULL
true	NULL
;	NULL
if	NULL
a	NULL
temporary	NULL
hallucination	NULL
,	NULL
sad	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
,	NULL
anyhow	NULL
,	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
this	NULL
deserted	NULL
wife	NULL
of	NULL
his	NULL
,	NULL
this	NULL
passionately-fond	NULL
woman	NULL
,	NULL
clinging	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
without	NULL
a	NULL
suspicion	NULL
that	NULL
he	NULL
would	NULL
be	NULL
anything	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
protector	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
saw	NULL
that	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
otherwise	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
mind	NULL
,	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
region	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
possible	NULL
.	NULL

Tenderness	NULL
was	NULL
absolutely	NULL
dominant	NULL
in	NULL
Clare	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
kissed	NULL
her	NULL
endlessly	NULL
with	NULL
his	NULL
white	NULL
lips	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
held	NULL
her	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
I	NULL
will	NULL
not	NULL
desert	NULL
you	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
will	NULL
protect	NULL
you	NULL
by	NULL
every	NULL
means	NULL
in	NULL
my	NULL
power	NULL
,	NULL
dearest	NULL
love	NULL
,	NULL
whatever	NULL
you	NULL
may	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
or	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
done	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
then	NULL
walked	NULL
on	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
,	NULL
Tess	NULL
turning	NULL
her	NULL
head	NULL
every	NULL
now	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
to	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Worn	NULL
and	NULL
unhandsome	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
become	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
plain	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
discern	NULL
the	NULL
least	NULL
fault	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
appearance	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
her	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
of	NULL
old	NULL
,	NULL
all	NULL
that	NULL
was	NULL
perfection	NULL
,	NULL
personally	NULL
and	NULL
mentally	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
still	NULL
her	NULL
Antinous	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
Apollo	NULL
even	NULL
;	NULL
his	NULL
sickly	NULL
face	NULL
was	NULL
beautiful	NULL
as	NULL
the	NULL
morning	NULL
to	NULL
her	NULL
affectionate	NULL
regard	NULL
on	NULL
this	NULL
day	NULL
no	NULL
less	NULL
than	NULL
when	NULL
she	NULL
first	NULL
beheld	NULL
him	NULL
;	NULL
for	NULL
was	NULL
it	NULL
not	NULL
the	NULL
face	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
man	NULL
on	NULL
earth	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
loved	NULL
her	NULL
purely	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
who	NULL
had	NULL
believed	NULL
in	NULL
her	NULL
as	NULL
pure	NULL
!	NULL

With	NULL
an	NULL
instinct	NULL
as	NULL
to	NULL
possibilities	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
now	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
intended	NULL
,	NULL
make	NULL
for	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
station	NULL
beyond	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
plunged	NULL
still	NULL
farther	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
firs	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
here	NULL
abounded	NULL
for	NULL
miles	NULL
.	NULL

Each	NULL
clasping	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
round	NULL
the	NULL
waist	NULL
they	NULL
promenaded	NULL
over	NULL
the	NULL
dry	NULL
bed	NULL
of	NULL
fir-needles	NULL
,	NULL
thrown	NULL
into	NULL
a	NULL
vague	NULL
intoxicating	NULL
atmosphere	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
consciousness	NULL
of	NULL
being	NULL
together	NULL
at	NULL
last	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
no	NULL
living	NULL
soul	NULL
between	NULL
them	NULL
;	NULL
ignoring	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
corpse	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
they	NULL
proceeded	NULL
for	NULL
several	NULL
miles	NULL
till	NULL
Tess	NULL
,	NULL
arousing	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
looked	NULL
about	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
said	NULL
,	NULL
timidly	NULL
--	NULL
"	NULL
Are	NULL
we	NULL
going	NULL
anywhere	NULL
in	NULL
particular	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
,	NULL
dearest	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
do	NULL
n't	NULL
know	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Well	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
might	NULL
walk	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
miles	NULL
further	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
it	NULL
is	NULL
evening	NULL
find	NULL
lodgings	NULL
somewhere	NULL
or	NULL
other	NULL
--	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
lonely	NULL
cottage	NULL
,	NULL
perhaps	NULL
.	NULL

Can	NULL
you	NULL
walk	NULL
well	NULL
,	NULL
Tessy	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
O	NULL
yes	NULL
!	NULL

I	NULL
could	NULL
walk	NULL
for	NULL
ever	NULL
and	NULL
ever	NULL
with	NULL
your	NULL
arm	NULL
round	NULL
me	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

Upon	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
a	NULL
good	NULL
thing	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
.	NULL

Thereupon	NULL
they	NULL
quickened	NULL
their	NULL
pace	NULL
,	NULL
avoiding	NULL
high	NULL
roads	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
following	NULL
obscure	NULL
paths	NULL
tending	NULL
more	NULL
or	NULL
less	NULL
northward	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
unpractical	NULL
vagueness	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
movements	NULL
throughout	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
;	NULL
neither	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
them	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
consider	NULL
any	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
effectual	NULL
escape	NULL
,	NULL
disguise	NULL
,	NULL
or	NULL
long	NULL
concealment	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
every	NULL
idea	NULL
was	NULL
temporary	NULL
and	NULL
unforefending	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
the	NULL
plans	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
children	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
mid-day	NULL
they	NULL
drew	NULL
near	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
roadside	NULL
inn	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Tess	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
entered	NULL
it	NULL
with	NULL
him	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
something	NULL
to	NULL
eat	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
he	NULL
persuaded	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
remain	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
and	NULL
bushes	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
half-woodland	NULL
,	NULL
half-moorland	NULL
part	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
till	NULL
he	NULL
should	NULL
come	NULL
back	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
clothes	NULL
were	NULL
of	NULL
recent	NULL
fashion	NULL
;	NULL
even	NULL
the	NULL
ivory-handled	NULL
parasol	NULL
that	NULL
she	NULL
carried	NULL
was	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
shape	NULL
unknown	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
retired	NULL
spot	NULL
to	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
wandered	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
cut	NULL
of	NULL
such	NULL
articles	NULL
would	NULL
have	NULL
attracted	NULL
attention	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
settle	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
tavern	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
soon	NULL
returned	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
food	NULL
enough	NULL
for	NULL
half-a-dozen	NULL
people	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
bottles	NULL
of	NULL
wine	NULL
--	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
last	NULL
them	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
or	NULL
more	NULL
,	NULL
should	NULL
any	NULL
emergency	NULL
arise	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
upon	NULL
some	NULL
dead	NULL
boughs	NULL
and	NULL
shared	NULL
their	NULL
meal	NULL
.	NULL

Between	NULL
one	NULL
and	NULL
two	NULL
o'clock	NULL
they	NULL
packed	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
remainder	NULL
and	NULL
went	NULL
on	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
feel	NULL
strong	NULL
enough	NULL
to	NULL
walk	NULL
any	NULL
distance	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
she	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
we	NULL
may	NULL
as	NULL
well	NULL
steer	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
general	NULL
way	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
interior	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
country	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
we	NULL
can	NULL
hide	NULL
for	NULL
a	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
are	NULL
less	NULL
likely	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
looked	NULL
for	NULL
than	NULL
anywhere	NULL
near	NULL
the	NULL
coast	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
Clare	NULL
remarked	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Later	NULL
on	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
have	NULL
forgotten	NULL
us	NULL
,	NULL
we	NULL
can	NULL
make	NULL
for	NULL
some	NULL
port	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
made	NULL
no	NULL
reply	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
beyond	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
grasping	NULL
him	NULL
more	NULL
tightly	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
straight	NULL
inland	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
was	NULL
an	NULL
English	NULL
May	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
was	NULL
serenely	NULL
bright	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
quite	NULL
warm	NULL
.	NULL

Through	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL
miles	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
walk	NULL
their	NULL
footpath	NULL
had	NULL
taken	NULL
them	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
depths	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
New	NULL
Forest	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
towards	NULL
evening	NULL
,	NULL
turning	NULL
the	NULL
corner	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
lane	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
perceived	NULL
behind	NULL
a	NULL
brook	NULL
and	NULL
bridge	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
board	NULL
on	NULL
which	NULL
was	NULL
painted	NULL
in	NULL
white	NULL
letters	NULL

;	NULL
particulars	NULL
following	NULL

with	NULL
directions	NULL
to	NULL
apply	NULL
to	NULL
some	NULL

Passing	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
see	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
brick	NULL
building	NULL
of	NULL
regular	NULL
design	NULL
and	NULL
large	NULL
accommodation	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL

said	NULL
Clare	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
Some	NULL

Tess	NULL

"	NULL
All	NULL
these	NULL

"	NULL

"	NULL
You	NULL
are	NULL
getting	NULL

my	NULL
Tess	NULL

"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
We	NULL
'll	NULL
stop	NULL
soon	NULL

"	NULL

And	NULL
kissing	NULL
her	NULL
sad	NULL
mouth	NULL
,	NULL
he	NULL
again	NULL
led	NULL
her	NULL
onwards	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
was	NULL
growing	NULL
weary	NULL
likewise	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
wandered	NULL
a	NULL
dozen	NULL
or	NULL
fifteen	NULL
miles	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
it	NULL
became	NULL
necessary	NULL
to	NULL
consider	NULL
what	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
do	NULL
for	NULL
rest	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
looked	NULL
from	NULL
afar	NULL
at	NULL
isolated	NULL
cottages	NULL
and	NULL
little	NULL
inns	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
were	NULL
inclined	NULL
to	NULL
approach	NULL

of	NULL
the	NULL
latter	NULL
,	NULL
when	NULL
their	NULL
hearts	NULL
failed	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
sheered	NULL
off	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
length	NULL
their	NULL
gait	NULL
dragged	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Could	NULL
we	NULL
sleep	NULL
under	NULL
the	NULL
trees	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
asked	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
thought	NULL
the	NULL
season	NULL
insufficiently	NULL
advanced	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
have	NULL
been	NULL
thinking	NULL
of	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Let	NULL
us	NULL
go	NULL
back	NULL
towards	NULL
it	NULL
again	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
retraced	NULL
their	NULL
steps	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
half	NULL
an	NULL
hour	NULL
before	NULL
they	NULL
stood	NULL
without	NULL
the	NULL
entrance-gate	NULL
as	NULL
earlier	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
then	NULL
requested	NULL
her	NULL
to	NULL
stay	NULL
where	NULL
she	NULL
was	NULL
,	NULL
whilst	NULL
he	NULL
went	NULL
to	NULL
see	NULL
who	NULL
was	NULL
within	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
sat	NULL
down	NULL
among	NULL
the	NULL
bushes	NULL
within	NULL
the	NULL
gate	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Clare	NULL
crept	NULL
towards	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
absence	NULL
lasted	NULL
some	NULL
considerable	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
when	NULL
he	NULL
returned	NULL
Tess	NULL
was	NULL
wildly	NULL
anxious	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
for	NULL
herself	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
for	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
found	NULL
out	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
boy	NULL
that	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
only	NULL
an	NULL
old	NULL
woman	NULL
in	NULL
charge	NULL
as	NULL
caretaker	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
only	NULL
came	NULL
there	NULL
on	NULL
fine	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
hamlet	NULL
near	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
open	NULL
and	NULL
shut	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
would	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
shut	NULL
them	NULL
at	NULL
sunset	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Now	NULL

we	NULL
can	NULL
get	NULL
in	NULL

one	NULL
of	NULL

and	NULL
rest	NULL
there	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
.	NULL

Under	NULL
his	NULL
escort	NULL
she	NULL
went	NULL
tardily	NULL
forward	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
main	NULL
front	NULL
,	NULL
whose	NULL
shuttered	NULL
windows	NULL
,	NULL
like	NULL
sightless	NULL
eyeballs	NULL
,	NULL
excluded	NULL
the	NULL
possibility	NULL
of	NULL
watchers	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
door	NULL
was	NULL
reached	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
steps	NULL
further	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
one	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
beside	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
open	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
clambered	NULL
in	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
pulled	NULL
Tess	NULL
in	NULL
after	NULL
him	NULL
.	NULL

Except	NULL
the	NULL
hall	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
rooms	NULL
were	NULL
all	NULL
in	NULL
darkness	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
ascended	NULL
the	NULL
staircase	NULL
.	NULL

Up	NULL
here	NULL
also	NULL
the	NULL
shutters	NULL
were	NULL
tightly	NULL
closed	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
ventilation	NULL
being	NULL
perfunctorily	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
for	NULL
this	NULL
day	NULL
at	NULL
least	NULL
,	NULL
by	NULL
opening	NULL
the	NULL
hall-window	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
upper	NULL
window	NULL
behind	NULL
.	NULL

Clare	NULL
unlatched	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
chamber	NULL
,	NULL
felt	NULL
his	NULL
way	NULL
across	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
parted	NULL
the	NULL
shutters	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
width	NULL
of	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
inches	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
shaft	NULL
of	NULL
dazzling	NULL
sunlight	NULL
glanced	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
,	NULL
revealing	NULL
heavy	NULL
,	NULL
old-fashioned	NULL
furniture	NULL
,	NULL
crimson	NULL
damask	NULL

,	NULL
and	NULL
an	NULL
enormous	NULL
four-post	NULL
bedstead	NULL
,	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
head	NULL
of	NULL
which	NULL
were	NULL
carved	NULL
running	NULL
figures	NULL
,	NULL
apparently	NULL
Atalanta	NULL
's	NULL
race	NULL

"	NULL
Rest	NULL
at	NULL

said	NULL
he	NULL
,	NULL
setting	NULL
down	NULL
his	NULL
bag	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
parcel	NULL
of	NULL
viands	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
remained	NULL
in	NULL
great	NULL
quietness	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
caretaker	NULL
should	NULL
have	NULL
come	NULL
to	NULL
shut	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
:	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
precaution	NULL
,	NULL
putting	NULL
themselves	NULL
in	NULL
total	NULL
darkness	NULL
by	NULL
barring	NULL
the	NULL
shutters	NULL
as	NULL
before	NULL
,	NULL
lest	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
should	NULL
open	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
chamber	NULL
for	NULL
any	NULL
casual	NULL
reason	NULL
.	NULL

Between	NULL
six	NULL
and	NULL
seven	NULL
o'clock	NULL
she	NULL
came	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
did	NULL
not	NULL
approach	NULL
the	NULL
wing	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
in	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
heard	NULL
her	NULL
close	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
,	NULL
fasten	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
lock	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
away	NULL
.	NULL

Then	NULL
Clare	NULL
again	NULL
stole	NULL
a	NULL
chink	NULL
of	NULL
light	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
window	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
shared	NULL
another	NULL
meal	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
by-and-by	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
enveloped	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
shades	NULL
of	NULL
night	NULL
which	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
candle	NULL
to	NULL
disperse	NULL
.	NULL

LVIII	NULL
The	NULL
night	NULL
was	NULL
strangely	NULL
solemn	NULL
and	NULL
still	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
small	NULL
hours	NULL
she	NULL
whispered	NULL
to	NULL
him	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
story	NULL
of	NULL
how	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
walked	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
sleep	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
arms	NULL
across	NULL
the	NULL
Froom	NULL
stream	NULL
,	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
imminent	NULL
risk	NULL
of	NULL
both	NULL
their	NULL
lives	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
laid	NULL
her	NULL
down	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
stone	NULL
coffin	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
ruined	NULL
abbey	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
had	NULL
never	NULL
known	NULL
of	NULL
that	NULL
till	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL
did	NULL
n't	NULL
you	NULL
tell	NULL
me	NULL
next	NULL
day	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

he	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
prevented	NULL
much	NULL
misunderstanding	NULL
and	NULL
woe	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
think	NULL
of	NULL
what	NULL
's	NULL
past	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

said	NULL
she	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
am	NULL
not	NULL
going	NULL
to	NULL

outside	NULL
of	NULL
now	NULL

Why	NULL
should	NULL
we	NULL
!	NULL

Who	NULL
knows	NULL
what	NULL
to-morrow	NULL
has	NULL

"	NULL

But	NULL
it	NULL
apparently	NULL
had	NULL
no	NULL
sorrow	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
morning	NULL
was	NULL
wet	NULL
and	NULL
foggy	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
Clare	NULL
,	NULL
rightly	NULL
informed	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
caretaker	NULL
only	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
windows	NULL
on	NULL
fine	NULL
days	NULL
,	NULL
ventured	NULL
to	NULL
creep	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
chamber	NULL
and	NULL
explore	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
Tess	NULL
asleep	NULL
.	NULL

There	NULL
was	NULL
no	NULL
food	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
premises	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
there	NULL
was	NULL
water	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
he	NULL
took	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
fog	NULL
to	NULL
emerge	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
mansion	NULL
and	NULL
fetch	NULL
tea	NULL
,	NULL
bread	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
butter	NULL
from	NULL
a	NULL
shop	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
place	NULL
two	NULL
miles	NULL
beyond	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
also	NULL
a	NULL
small	NULL
tin	NULL
kettle	NULL
and	NULL
spirit-lamp	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
might	NULL
get	NULL
fire	NULL
without	NULL
smoke	NULL
.	NULL

His	NULL
re-entry	NULL
awoke	NULL
her	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
breakfasted	NULL
on	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
brought	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
were	NULL
indisposed	NULL
to	NULL
stir	NULL
abroad	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
day	NULL
passed	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
following	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
next	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
next	NULL
;	NULL
till	NULL
,	NULL
almost	NULL
without	NULL
their	NULL
being	NULL
aware	NULL
,	NULL
five	NULL
days	NULL
had	NULL
slipped	NULL
by	NULL
in	NULL
absolute	NULL
seclusion	NULL
,	NULL
not	NULL
a	NULL
sight	NULL
or	NULL
sound	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
human	NULL
being	NULL
disturbing	NULL
their	NULL
peacefulness	NULL
,	NULL
such	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
changes	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
weather	NULL
were	NULL
their	NULL
only	NULL
events	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
birds	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
New	NULL
Forest	NULL
their	NULL
only	NULL
company	NULL
.	NULL

By	NULL
tacit	NULL
consent	NULL
they	NULL
hardly	NULL
once	NULL
spoke	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
incident	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
past	NULL
subsequent	NULL
to	NULL
their	NULL
wedding-day	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
gloomy	NULL
intervening	NULL
time	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
sink	NULL
into	NULL
chaos	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
present	NULL
and	NULL
prior	NULL
times	NULL
closed	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
it	NULL
never	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
.	NULL

Whenever	NULL
he	NULL
suggested	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
should	NULL
leave	NULL
their	NULL
shelter	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
go	NULL
forwards	NULL
towards	NULL
Southampton	NULL
or	NULL
London	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
showed	NULL
a	NULL
strange	NULL
unwillingness	NULL
to	NULL
move	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Why	NULL

peeped	NULL
out	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL

her	NULL
cheek	NULL
against	NULL

never	NULL

and	NULL
the	NULL

of	NULL
a	NULL
bird	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
cage	NULL
used	NULL
often	NULL
to	NULL
make	NULL
me	NULL
cry	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

They	NULL
remained	NULL
yet	NULL
another	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
the	NULL
dull	NULL
sky	NULL
cleared	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
result	NULL
was	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
old	NULL
caretaker	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
cottage	NULL
awoke	NULL
early	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
brilliant	NULL
sunrise	NULL
made	NULL
her	NULL
unusually	NULL
brisk	NULL
;	NULL
she	NULL
decided	NULL
to	NULL
open	NULL
the	NULL
contiguous	NULL
mansion	NULL
immediately	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
to	NULL
air	NULL
it	NULL
thoroughly	NULL
on	NULL
such	NULL
a	NULL
day	NULL
.	NULL

Thus	NULL
it	NULL
occurred	NULL
that	NULL
,	NULL
having	NULL
arrived	NULL
and	NULL
opened	NULL
the	NULL
lower	NULL
rooms	NULL
before	NULL
six	NULL
o'clock	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
ascended	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
bedchambers	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
to	NULL
turn	NULL
the	NULL
handle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
wherein	NULL
they	NULL
lay	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
that	NULL
moment	NULL
she	NULL
fancied	NULL
she	NULL
could	NULL
hear	NULL
the	NULL
breathing	NULL
of	NULL
persons	NULL
within	NULL
.	NULL

Her	NULL
slippers	NULL
and	NULL
her	NULL
antiquity	NULL
had	NULL
rendered	NULL
her	NULL
progress	NULL
a	NULL
noiseless	NULL
one	NULL
so	NULL
far	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
made	NULL
for	NULL
instant	NULL
retreat	NULL
;	NULL
then	NULL
,	NULL
deeming	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
hearing	NULL
might	NULL
have	NULL
deceived	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
anew	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
and	NULL
softly	NULL
tried	NULL
the	NULL
handle	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
lock	NULL
was	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
order	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
a	NULL
piece	NULL
of	NULL
furniture	NULL
had	NULL
been	NULL
moved	NULL
forward	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
inside	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
prevented	NULL
her	NULL
opening	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
an	NULL
inch	NULL
or	NULL
two	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
stream	NULL
of	NULL
morning	NULL
light	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
shutter-chink	NULL
fell	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
faces	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
,	NULL
wrapped	NULL
in	NULL
profound	NULL
slumber	NULL
,	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
lips	NULL
being	NULL
parted	NULL
like	NULL
a	NULL
half-opened	NULL
flower	NULL
near	NULL
his	NULL
cheek	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
caretaker	NULL
was	NULL
so	NULL
struck	NULL
with	NULL
their	NULL
innocent	NULL
appearance	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
elegance	NULL
of	NULL
Tess	NULL
's	NULL
gown	NULL
hanging	NULL
across	NULL
a	NULL
chair	NULL
,	NULL
her	NULL
silk	NULL
stockings	NULL
beside	NULL
it	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
pretty	NULL
parasol	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
habits	NULL
in	NULL
which	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
arrived	NULL
because	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
none	NULL
else	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
her	NULL
first	NULL
indignation	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
effrontery	NULL
of	NULL
tramps	NULL
and	NULL
vagabonds	NULL
gave	NULL
way	NULL
to	NULL
a	NULL
momentary	NULL
sentimentality	NULL
over	NULL
this	NULL
genteel	NULL
elopement	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
.	NULL

She	NULL
closed	NULL
the	NULL
door	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
withdrew	NULL
as	NULL
softly	NULL
as	NULL
she	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
,	NULL
to	NULL
go	NULL
and	NULL
consult	NULL
with	NULL
her	NULL
neighbours	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
odd	NULL
discovery	NULL
.	NULL

Not	NULL
more	NULL
than	NULL
a	NULL
minute	NULL
had	NULL
elapsed	NULL
after	NULL
her	NULL
withdrawal	NULL
when	NULL
Tess	NULL
woke	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
then	NULL
Clare	NULL
.	NULL

Both	NULL
had	NULL
a	NULL
sense	NULL
that	NULL
something	NULL
had	NULL
disturbed	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
though	NULL
they	NULL
could	NULL
not	NULL
say	NULL
what	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
uneasy	NULL
feeling	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
engendered	NULL
grew	NULL
stronger	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
he	NULL
was	NULL
dressed	NULL
he	NULL
narrowly	NULL
scanned	NULL
the	NULL
lawn	NULL
through	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
inches	NULL
of	NULL
shutter-chink	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
I	NULL
think	NULL
we	NULL
will	NULL
leave	NULL
at	NULL
once	NULL
,	NULL
"	NULL
said	NULL
he	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
It	NULL
is	NULL
a	NULL
fine	NULL
day	NULL

And	NULL
I	NULL
can	NULL
not	NULL
help	NULL
fancying	NULL
somebody	NULL
is	NULL
about	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
any	NULL
rate	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
woman	NULL
will	NULL
be	NULL
sure	NULL
to	NULL
come	NULL
to-day	NULL
.	NULL
"	NULL

She	NULL
passively	NULL
assented	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
putting	NULL
the	NULL
room	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
took	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
articles	NULL
that	NULL
belonged	NULL
to	NULL
them	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
departed	NULL
noiselessly	NULL
.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
got	NULL
into	NULL
the	NULL
Forest	NULL
she	NULL
turned	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
a	NULL
last	NULL
look	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
house	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Ah	NULL
,	NULL
happy	NULL
house	NULL
--	NULL
goodbye	NULL
!	NULL
"	NULL

she	NULL
said	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
My	NULL
life	NULL
can	NULL
only	NULL
be	NULL
a	NULL
question	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
weeks	NULL
.	NULL

Why	NULL
should	NULL
we	NULL
not	NULL
have	NULL
stayed	NULL
there	NULL
?	NULL
"	NULL

"	NULL
Do	NULL
n't	NULL
say	NULL
it	NULL

Tess	NULL
!	NULL

We	NULL
shall	NULL
soon	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
district	NULL
altogether	NULL

We	NULL
'll	NULL
continue	NULL
our	NULL
course	NULL
as	NULL
we	NULL

it	NULL

in	NULL
the	NULL
north	NULL

away	NULL

"	NULL

Having	NULL
thus	NULL
persuaded	NULL
her	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
plan	NULL
was	NULL
pursued	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
they	NULL
kept	NULL
a	NULL
bee-line	NULL
northward	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
long	NULL
repose	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
manor-house	NULL
lent	NULL
them	NULL
walking	NULL
power	NULL
now	NULL
;	NULL
and	NULL
towards	NULL
mid-day	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
approaching	NULL
the	NULL
steepled	NULL
city	NULL
of	NULL
Melchester	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
lay	NULL
directly	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
way	NULL
.	NULL

He	NULL
decided	NULL
to	NULL
rest	NULL
her	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
clump	NULL
of	NULL
trees	NULL
during	NULL
the	NULL
afternoon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
push	NULL
onward	NULL
under	NULL
cover	NULL
of	NULL
darkness	NULL
.	NULL

At	NULL
dusk	NULL
Clare	NULL
purchased	NULL
food	NULL
as	NULL
usual	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
their	NULL
night	NULL
march	NULL
began	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
boundary	NULL
between	NULL
Upper	NULL
and	NULL
Mid-Wessex	NULL
being	NULL
crossed	NULL
about	NULL
eight	NULL
o'clock	NULL
.	NULL

To	NULL
walk	NULL
across	NULL
country	NULL
without	NULL
much	NULL
regard	NULL
to	NULL
roads	NULL
was	NULL
not	NULL
new	NULL
to	NULL
Tess	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
she	NULL
showed	NULL
her	NULL
old	NULL
agility	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
performance	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
intercepting	NULL
city	NULL
,	NULL
ancient	NULL
Melchester	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
obliged	NULL
to	NULL
pass	NULL
through	NULL
in	NULL
order	NULL
to	NULL
take	NULL
advantage	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
bridge	NULL
for	NULL
crossing	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
river	NULL
that	NULL
obstructed	NULL
them	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
about	NULL
midnight	NULL
when	NULL
they	NULL
went	NULL
along	NULL
the	NULL
deserted	NULL
streets	NULL
,	NULL
lighted	NULL
fitfully	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
few	NULL
lamps	NULL
,	NULL
keeping	NULL
off	NULL
the	NULL
pavement	NULL
that	NULL
it	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
echo	NULL
their	NULL
footsteps	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
graceful	NULL
pile	NULL
of	NULL
cathedral	NULL
architecture	NULL
rose	NULL
dimly	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
left	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
lost	NULL
upon	NULL
them	NULL
now	NULL
.	NULL

Once	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
they	NULL
followed	NULL
the	NULL
turnpike-road	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
after	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
miles	NULL
plunged	NULL
across	NULL
an	NULL
open	NULL
plain	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
the	NULL
sky	NULL
was	NULL
dense	NULL
with	NULL
cloud	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
diffused	NULL
light	NULL
from	NULL
some	NULL
fragment	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
moon	NULL
had	NULL
hitherto	NULL
helped	NULL
them	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
.	NULL

But	NULL
the	NULL
moon	NULL
had	NULL
now	NULL
sunk	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
clouds	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
settle	NULL
almost	NULL
on	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
night	NULL
grew	NULL
as	NULL
dark	NULL
as	NULL
a	NULL
cave	NULL
.	NULL

However	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
found	NULL
their	NULL
way	NULL
along	NULL
,	NULL
keeping	NULL
as	NULL
much	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
turf	NULL
as	NULL
possible	NULL
that	NULL
their	NULL
tread	NULL
might	NULL
not	NULL
resound	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
easy	NULL
to	NULL
do	NULL
,	NULL
there	NULL
being	NULL
no	NULL
hedge	NULL
or	NULL
fence	NULL
of	NULL
any	NULL
kind	NULL
.	NULL

All	NULL
around	NULL
was	NULL
open	NULL
loneliness	NULL
and	NULL
black	NULL
solitude	NULL
,	NULL
over	NULL
which	NULL
a	NULL
stiff	NULL
breeze	NULL
blew	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
proceeded	NULL
thus	NULL
gropingly	NULL
two	NULL
or	NULL
three	NULL
miles	NULL
further	NULL
when	NULL
on	NULL
a	NULL
sudden	NULL
Clare	NULL
became	NULL
conscious	NULL
of	NULL
some	NULL
vast	NULL
erection	NULL
close	NULL
in	NULL
his	NULL
front	NULL
,	NULL
rising	NULL
sheer	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
almost	NULL
struck	NULL
themselves	NULL
against	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

listened	NULL

The	NULL

a	NULL
booming	NULL
tune	NULL

No	NULL

Clare	NULL
felt	NULL
the	NULL

It	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
of	NULL
solid	NULL
stone	NULL

without	NULL

Carrying	NULL
his	NULL

onward	NULL
he	NULL
found	NULL
that	NULL
what	NULL
he	NULL
had	NULL
come	NULL
in	NULL
contact	NULL

was	NULL
a	NULL
colossal	NULL
rectangular	NULL

by	NULL
stretching	NULL
out	NULL
his	NULL

he	NULL
could	NULL
feel	NULL

At	NULL
an	NULL

something	NULL
made	NULL
the	NULL
black	NULL

which	NULL
had	NULL
the	NULL

they	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
be	NULL
still	NULL
out	NULL

The	NULL

Tess	NULL
drew	NULL
her	NULL

Angel	NULL

Feeling	NULL
sideways	NULL
they	NULL
encountered	NULL

the	NULL

something	NULL

all	NULL

went	NULL

her	NULL

holding	NULL
one	NULL

The	NULL

that	NULL

downlands	NULL
in	NULL
all	NULL
the	NULL

warmth	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
July	NULL

.	NULL

The	NULL

houses	NULL
had	NULL

dried	NULL
off	NULL

the	NULL

their	NULL

an	NULL

market-day	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
western	NULL
gate	NULL
aforesaid	NULL
the	NULL
highway	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
every	NULL
Wintoncestrian	NULL
knows	NULL
,	NULL
ascends	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
and	NULL
regular	NULL
incline	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
exact	NULL
length	NULL
of	NULL
a	NULL
measured	NULL
mile	NULL
,	NULL
leaving	NULL
the	NULL
houses	NULL
gradually	NULL
behind	NULL
.	NULL

Up	NULL
this	NULL
road	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
precincts	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
two	NULL
persons	NULL
were	NULL
walking	NULL
rapidly	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
unconscious	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
trying	NULL
ascent	NULL
--	NULL
unconscious	NULL
through	NULL
preoccupation	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
through	NULL
buoyancy	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
had	NULL
emerged	NULL
upon	NULL
this	NULL
road	NULL
through	NULL
a	NULL
narrow	NULL
,	NULL
barred	NULL
wicket	NULL
in	NULL
a	NULL
high	NULL
wall	NULL
a	NULL
little	NULL
lower	NULL
down	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
seemed	NULL
anxious	NULL
to	NULL
get	NULL
out	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sight	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
houses	NULL
and	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
kind	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
this	NULL
road	NULL
appeared	NULL
to	NULL
offer	NULL
the	NULL
quickest	NULL
means	NULL
of	NULL
doing	NULL
so	NULL
.	NULL

Though	NULL
they	NULL
were	NULL
young	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
walked	NULL
with	NULL
bowed	NULL
heads	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
gait	NULL
of	NULL
grief	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
's	NULL
rays	NULL
smiled	NULL
on	NULL
pitilessly	NULL
.	NULL

One	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
was	NULL
Angel	NULL
Clare	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
budding	NULL
creature	NULL
--	NULL
half	NULL
girl	NULL
,	NULL
half	NULL
woman	NULL
--	NULL
a	NULL
spiritualized	NULL
image	NULL
of	NULL
Tess	NULL
,	NULL
slighter	NULL
than	NULL
she	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
same	NULL
beautiful	NULL
eyes	NULL
--	NULL
Clare	NULL
's	NULL
sister-in-law	NULL
,	NULL
'	NULL
Liza-Lu	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
pale	NULL
faces	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
have	NULL
shrunk	NULL
to	NULL
half	NULL
their	NULL
natural	NULL
size	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
moved	NULL
on	NULL
hand	NULL
in	NULL
hand	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
never	NULL
spoke	NULL
a	NULL
word	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
drooping	NULL
of	NULL
their	NULL
heads	NULL
being	NULL
that	NULL
of	NULL
Giotto	NULL
's	NULL
"	NULL
Two	NULL
Apostles	NULL

.	NULL

When	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
nearly	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
top	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
great	NULL
West	NULL
Hill	NULL
the	NULL
clocks	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
town	NULL
struck	NULL
eight	NULL
.	NULL

Each	NULL
gave	NULL
a	NULL
start	NULL
at	NULL
the	NULL
notes	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
walking	NULL
onward	NULL
yet	NULL
a	NULL
few	NULL
steps	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
reached	NULL
the	NULL
first	NULL
milestone	NULL
,	NULL
standing	NULL
whitely	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
green	NULL
margin	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
grass	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
backed	NULL
by	NULL
the	NULL
down	NULL
,	NULL
which	NULL
here	NULL
was	NULL
open	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
.	NULL

They	NULL
entered	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
turf	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
impelled	NULL
by	NULL
a	NULL
force	NULL
that	NULL
seemed	NULL
to	NULL
overrule	NULL
their	NULL
will	NULL
,	NULL
suddenly	NULL
stood	NULL
still	NULL
,	NULL
turned	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
waited	NULL
in	NULL
paralyzed	NULL
suspense	NULL
beside	NULL
the	NULL
stone	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
prospect	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
summit	NULL
was	NULL
almost	NULL
unlimited	NULL
.	NULL

In	NULL
the	NULL
valley	NULL
beneath	NULL
lay	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
just	NULL
left	NULL
,	NULL
its	NULL
more	NULL
prominent	NULL
buildings	NULL
showing	NULL
as	NULL
in	NULL
an	NULL
isometric	NULL
drawing	NULL
--	NULL
among	NULL
them	NULL
the	NULL
broad	NULL
cathedral	NULL
tower	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
its	NULL
Norman	NULL
windows	NULL
and	NULL
immense	NULL
length	NULL
of	NULL
aisle	NULL
and	NULL
nave	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
spires	NULL
of	NULL
St	NULL
Thomas	NULL
's	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
pinnacled	NULL
tower	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
College	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
,	NULL
more	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
right	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
tower	NULL
and	NULL
gables	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
ancient	NULL
hospice	NULL
,	NULL
where	NULL
to	NULL
this	NULL
day	NULL
the	NULL
pilgrim	NULL
may	NULL
receive	NULL
his	NULL
dole	NULL
of	NULL
bread	NULL
and	NULL
ale	NULL
.	NULL

Behind	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
swept	NULL
the	NULL
rotund	NULL
upland	NULL
of	NULL
St	NULL
Catherine	NULL
's	NULL
Hill	NULL
;	NULL
further	NULL
off	NULL
,	NULL
landscape	NULL
beyond	NULL
landscape	NULL
,	NULL
till	NULL
the	NULL
horizon	NULL
was	NULL
lost	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
radiance	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
sun	NULL
hanging	NULL
above	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

Against	NULL
these	NULL
far	NULL
stretches	NULL
of	NULL
country	NULL
rose	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
front	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
other	NULL
city	NULL
edifices	NULL
,	NULL
a	NULL
large	NULL
red-brick	NULL
building	NULL
,	NULL
with	NULL
level	NULL
gray	NULL
roofs	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
rows	NULL
of	NULL
short	NULL
barred	NULL
windows	NULL
bespeaking	NULL
captivity	NULL
,	NULL
the	NULL
whole	NULL
contrasting	NULL
greatly	NULL
by	NULL
its	NULL
formalism	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
quaint	NULL
irregularities	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Gothic	NULL
erections	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
somewhat	NULL
disguised	NULL
from	NULL
the	NULL
road	NULL
in	NULL
passing	NULL
it	NULL
by	NULL
yews	NULL
and	NULL
evergreen	NULL
oaks	NULL
,	NULL
but	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
visible	NULL
enough	NULL
up	NULL
here	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
wicket	NULL
from	NULL
which	NULL
the	NULL
pair	NULL
had	NULL
lately	NULL
emerged	NULL
was	NULL
in	NULL
the	NULL
wall	NULL
of	NULL
this	NULL
structure	NULL
.	NULL

From	NULL
the	NULL
middle	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
building	NULL
an	NULL
ugly	NULL
flat-topped	NULL
octagonal	NULL
tower	NULL
ascended	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
east	NULL
horizon	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
viewed	NULL
from	NULL
this	NULL
spot	NULL
,	NULL
on	NULL
its	NULL
shady	NULL
side	NULL
and	NULL
against	NULL
the	NULL
light	NULL
,	NULL
it	NULL
seemed	NULL
the	NULL
one	NULL
blot	NULL
on	NULL
the	NULL
city	NULL
's	NULL
beauty	NULL
.	NULL

Yet	NULL
it	NULL
was	NULL
with	NULL
this	NULL
blot	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
not	NULL
with	NULL
the	NULL
beauty	NULL
,	NULL
that	NULL
the	NULL
two	NULL
gazers	NULL
were	NULL
concerned	NULL
.	NULL

Upon	NULL
the	NULL
cornice	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
tower	NULL
a	NULL
tall	NULL
staff	NULL
was	NULL
fixed	NULL
.	NULL

Their	NULL
eyes	NULL
were	NULL
riveted	NULL
on	NULL
it	NULL
.	NULL

A	NULL
few	NULL
minutes	NULL
after	NULL
the	NULL
hour	NULL
had	NULL
struck	NULL
something	NULL
moved	NULL
slowly	NULL
up	NULL
the	NULL
staff	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
extended	NULL
itself	NULL
upon	NULL
the	NULL
breeze	NULL
.	NULL

It	NULL
was	NULL
a	NULL
black	NULL
flag	NULL
.	NULL

"	NULL
Justice	NULL
"	NULL
was	NULL
done	NULL
,	NULL
and	NULL
the	NULL
President	NULL
of	NULL
the	NULL
Immortals	NULL
,	NULL
in	NULL
Aeschylean	NULL
phrase	NULL
,	NULL
had	NULL
ended	NULL
his	NULL
sport	NULL
with	NULL
Tess	NULL
.	NULL

And	NULL
the	NULL
d'Urberville	NULL
knights	NULL
and	NULL
dames	NULL
slept	NULL
on	NULL
in	NULL
their	NULL
tombs	NULL
unknowing	NULL
.	NULL

The	NULL
two	NULL
speechless	NULL
gazers	NULL
bent	NULL
themselves	NULL
down	NULL
to	NULL
the	NULL
earth	NULL
,	NULL
as	NULL
if	NULL
in	NULL
prayer	NULL

and	NULL
remained	NULL
thus	NULL
a	NULL
long	NULL
time	NULL
,	NULL
absolutely	NULL
motionless	NULL
:	NULL
the	NULL
flag	NULL
continued	NULL
to	NULL
wave	NULL
silently	NULL
.	NULL

As	NULL
soon	NULL
as	NULL
they	NULL
had	NULL
strength	NULL
,	NULL
they	NULL
arose	NULL

joined	NULL
hands	NULL
again	NULL

went	NULL
on	NULL
