Identification of a Major Positive Regulatory Element Located 5 ' to the Human { -Globin Gene By Daniel E. Sabath , Karen M. Koehler , Wei-Qing Yang , Kathryn Patton , and George Stamatoyannopoulos The function of the { -globin promoter was studied using a series of { -globin promoter deletion constructs to drive luciferase expression in transiently transfected human erythroleukemia cells .
The promoters were used without enhancers , or with enhancers derived from the -globin locus control region and the a-globin HS-40 enhancer .
When transfected into K562 cells , which express { -globin , comparable amounts of activity were obtained from the -557 and -417 t-luciferase constructs and the a-luciferase constructs when no enhancers or the a-globin locus enhancers were used .
When the constructs were transfected into OCIM1 cells , which do not express ( -globin , the { -globin promoters were at best 20 % as active as the « -globin promoters .
When sequences from -417 to -207 5 ' to the { -globin mRNA cap -GLOBIN IS THE EMBRYONIC FORM of a-globin ; its expression is confined to yolk sac-derived primitive erythroid cells .
Transgenic mice containing the human & -globin gene express the gene in a developmentally correct fashion , even if as little as 128 bp of the & -globin proximal promoter is present . ``
'' The 5 ' flanking region of the -globin gene is sufficient for developmentally correct expression , because transgenic mice containing bacterial 3-galactosidase under control of the E-globin promoter express 3-galactosidase only in the embryonic yolk sac .
Some investigators have shown a negative regulatory element within the E-globin promoter , * `` but in contrast with the embryonic B-like globin gene , e , no developmental silencer has been detected in the 5 ' flanking region of the { -globin gene .
`` ** While transgenic mouse experiments have been useful for showing qualitative function of the -globin promoter , it has not been possible to quantitate promoter activity in transgenic mice , because { -globin transgene expression appears to be dependent on the site of integration in the mouse genome . ``
An alternate method for studying E-globin promoter function is to transfect C-globin expression constructs into erythroid cell lines that do or do not express & -globin .
Two issues regarding { -globin promoter function can be addressed with such studies .
First , regions of the promoter necessary for high-level expression in embryonic cells can be identified .
It may also be possible to identify negative regulatory elements by transfecting cells that do not express C-globin .
A negative regulatory element would be identified if its deletion resulted in increased expression .
The possibility that positive and negative elements overlap must be considered as well .
Besides the function of the promoter itself , it is important to determine whether enhancer sequences are necessary for E-globin expression , and if so , what regions of the enhancer and promoter mediate this interaction .
A number of structure-function studies have been performed on the -globin promoter , some with conflicting con-clusions .
Early transient transfection studies of erythroid and nonerythroid cells suggested there was a negative regulatory element in the 5° flanking region of the -globin gene .
* `` However , these studies were hampered by poor sensitivity because erythroid-specific enhancer elements , which had not Blood , Vol 85 , No 8 ( May 1 } , 1995 : pp 2587-2597 site were deleted , up to 95 % of the { -globin promoter activity was lost in K562 cells .
Reinsertion of these sequences into { -luciferase constructs missing the -417 to -207 region showed that the sequences lack classical enhancer activity .
Point mutation of a GATA-1 site at -230 reduced promoter activity by 37 % .
Point mutation of a CCACC site at -240 had no effect .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that the -230 GATA-1 site has a relatively low affinity for GATA-1 .
These experiments show the presence of a strong posi-tive-acting element , located between -417 and -207 bp 5 to the { -globin mRNA cap site , is necessary for high-level promoter activity in K562 cells .
This element requires GATA-1 and additional unknown factors for maximal activity .

been characterized at that time , were not used .
In addition , some of these experiments used nonerythroid cells to identify negative regulatory elements ; these elements may not function in erythroid cells .
More recent experiments using the HS-40 enhancer'* ' have failed to reproduce this result .
They showed instead that GATA-1 sites at -230 and -105 positively regulate C expression in K562 cells , `` a human erythroid cell line that expresses embryonic hemoglobins .
`` `` '° Stable transfection of { -globin genes into murine erythroleukemia cells , which only express adult globins , also failed to show a stage-specific silencer . ``
Because of the sometimes-conflicting data in the literature regarding the function of the & -globin promoter , we have performed experiments to answer the following questions : ( 1 ) What parts of the promoter are important for expression in embryonic erythroid cells ?
( 2 ) What enhancers work best with the C-globin promoter , and what elements within the promoter interact with enhancers ?
and ( 3 ) Is there a negative regulatory element within the C-globin promoter ?
To address these questions , we have used luciferase as a reporter gene in the transient transfection of two cell lines with different patterns of globin expression : K562 cells , a human erythroid cell line that expresses embryonic globins , `` * `` `` and OCIM !

2588 we show that the { -globin promoter is quite effective at driving reporter gene expression in K562 cells .
In addition , sequences between -417 and -207 , designated the upstream regulatory region ( URE ) , are required for high-level E-globin promoter activity in K562 cells , and the promoter functions autonomously , ie , relative promoter activity is independent of the enhancer used to increase expression .
Although it is very effective at increasing & -globin promoter activity , the URE is not a classical enhancer because its activity is posi-tion- and orientation-dependent .
The URE contains a GATA-1 site at -230 , but GATA-1 binding to this site is only partially responsible for the activity of the URE .
These results further define regions of the E-globin promoter that are important for expression of { -globin , and suggest that novel factors may be involved in regulation of { -globin expression .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines .
- K562 cells `` ( a gift of S.A. Jane , St Jude Children 's Research Hospital , Memphis , TN ) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mmol/L glutamine , 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate , 50 U/mL penicillin , 50 pg/mL streptomycin , 5 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , and 5 % defined calf serum .

Both cell lines were grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO , .
Plasmids .
The Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV ) -luciferase plasmid used in these studies , designated pRSV-Luc , contains a 3.3-kbp Nde I-BamHI fragment isolated from plasmid pRSV/L* containing the RSV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) promoter , `` luciferase cDNA , the simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) small t-antigen intron , and the polyadenyla-tion signal from plasmid pSV2 . ``
pRSV/L was digested with Nde I , the ends were made blunt , the DNA was digested with BamHI , and the resulting fragment was subcloned into pUCI19 that had been digested with Sma I and BamHL The plasmid designated pRSV-LacZ contains the RSV LTR promoter and LacZ sequences from plasmid pRSV-GGal* `` linked to the SV40 sequences from pRSV-Luc .
It was constructed by subcloning a 4.5-kbp Nhel-Dral fragment from pRSV-GGal into pUC19 that had been cut with HinclI and Xbal .
This plasmid was cut with Pst L , the ends were made blunt , the DNA was cut with and the resulting fragment was subcloned into pRSV-Luc that had the RSV and luciferase sequences removed by digestion with Sma I and HindIII .
All globin-luciferase constructs were generated by subcloning promoter sequences as HZindIII-Sal I fragments into a luciferase expression cassette ( Fig 1B ) .
The luciferase cassette was made by subcloning luciferase and SV40 sequences from pRSV-Luc into pBluescript SK- ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) as a 2.7-kbp HindIII-BamHI fragment .
The HindIII site was removed by cutting with HindIII , making the ends blunt , and religating .
The luciferase and SV40 sequences were then subcloned into pUC19 as a Sal I-BamHI fragment .
The promoter sequences were derived from the four HS2- { -globin deletion constructs used to construct transgenic mice .
The Sal I sites of the constructs were first removed by cutting with Sal I , making the ends blunt , and religating .
The plasmids were then cut with Sty I , which cuts 2 bp 3 ' to the E-globin mRNA cap site , the ends were made blunt , and synthetic Sal I linkers ( Promega , Madison , WI ) were added .
The DNA was digested with HindIII and Sal I , and the resulting fragments were subcloned into the luciferase expression SABATH ET AL cassette .
For the construct , an EcoRI site was removed by cutting , blunting , and religating before insertion into the luciferase cassette .
The ( A ( -417/-207 ) construct was made by generating a 249-bp polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) product from plasmid using sense primer ACAGG-3 ' ( complementary to flanking plasmid sequences ) and antisense | primer - 5-GGGGTACCCTTCCACTTTGTCTCTGGA-TTC-3 ' ( complementary to E-globin sequences -415 to -442 with an added Kpn I site ) .
The Kpn I fragment from this PCR product was subcloned into the £ ( -207 ) construct .
Enhancerless constructs were derived by deleting the HS2 region , an 873-bp BamHI frag-ment .
`` * For fragments containing the micro locus control region ( LCR ) construct , the HindIII-Sal I & promoter fragments were subcloned 3 ' to the LCR sequences in plasmid LAR , which contains hypersensitive sites 1 through 4 of the # -globin LCR as a 2.5-kbp Pst 1-HindIH fragment in pBluescript SK- . ``
The internal HirdllI site was removed by cutting , blunting , and religating .
The plasmids were digested with EcoRI , which cuts 5 ' to the LCR sequences , HindIII linkers were added , and the resulting HindIII-Sal I gLCR-C fragments were subcloned into the luciferase cassette .
The constructs containing HS-40 were made by blunt-end ligation of the 1.4-kbp HindIII-EcoRl genomic DNA fragment containing the HS-40 core enhancer `` ( a gift of D.R .
Higgs , University of Oxford , Oxford , UK ) into the HindIII site of the enhancerless { -luciferase constructs .
The uHS-40 constructs containing the core HS-40 enhancer sequences `` were made with a 307-bp PCR product amplified from the above HS-40-containing plasmid with sense primer 5'-AAAGCTTC-GACCCTCTGGAACCTATCAG-3 ' and antisense primer 5'-AAA-GCTTGCCTGGCTGTGAACACTTTGGG-3 ' .
Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a DNA synthesizer ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) .
The PCR product was subcloned into plasmid pCR ( In-vitrogen , San Diego , CA ) .
The PCR product was then isolated as a HindIII fragment and subcloned into the enhancerless C-luciferase constructs digested with HindIII .
All enhancers were oriented in the same 5'-3 ' direction relative to the { -globin gene as they are on chromosomes 11 or 16 relative to their respective globin genes .
To make the a-luciferase constructs , the 5 `` end of the human a2 gene was isolated from a 1.5-kbp Pst I fragment containing the a2 gene in pUC18 ( a gift of EM .
Rubin , Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory , Berkeley , CA ) .
The plasmid was digested with Dde I , which cuts 24 bp 3 `` to the a2-globin mRNA cap site , the ends were made blunt , the plasmid was digested with Pst I , and the resulting 590-bp fragment was subcloned into pUC19 that had been digested with Sma I and Pst 1 .
This plasmid was digested with BamHI , the ends were made blunt , Saf I linkers were added , and after HindIII and Sai I digestion , the « 2-globin promoter was subcloned into the luciferase cassette .
The 1.4-kbp fragment containing HS-40 and the mHS-40 fragment were subcloned into the HindIII site as with the C-luciferase constructs .
HS2 was isolated from plasmid pHS25 ( -557 ) as an bp BamHI fragment and blunt-end ligated into the HindIII site .
The uLCR construct was isolated from plasmid pLAR as a BamHI-EcoRI fragment and blunt-end ligated into the HindIII site .
As with the { luciferase constructs , the enhancers were used in their genomic orientations .
The upstream regulatory element ( URE ) insertion constructs were made by modifying the { A ( -417/-207 ) construct so as to have a unique BamHI site at the -417/-207 deletion site , 5 `` to the { -globin sequences , or 3 ' to the SV40 sequences ( see Fig 6A ) .
A 275-bp PCR product spanning -422 to -163 was generated using the sense primer 5-GCTCTAGAGGGTACTGGCATGTGGTTGG-3 `` and the antisense primer S-CCATCGATCTCCTGTTCCTCTCCTGTGG-3 ' , The PCR product was cloned into the Sma I site of pUC19 .

RESULTS Cells and constructs used for transient transfection .
- One goal of these studies was to use transient transfection to compare the activity of the { -globin promoters in erythroid cell lines that do or do not express their endogenous E-globin gene .
Two cell lines , K562 , which expresses G-globin , and OCIM1 , which does not , were selected for this analysis .
To verify the phenotype of each cell line , an RNAase protection experiment was performed using antisense RNA probes for the various human globins .
As shown in Fig 1A , K562 cells express C- , a- , and 6-globin RNA .
The K562 cells were used in an uninduced state ; hemin induction resulted in a twofold increase in { -globin RNA levels ( data not shown ) .
No e- or B-globin RNA was detected in these K562 cells .
Other clones of K562 cells are known to express e-globin , especially when induced with hemin . '
'' *'* The lack of e expression in this case may be a unique property of the specific K562 cells used , or a result of not inducing the K562 cells .
OCIM1 cells express only a- and y-globin RNA ; no -globin RNA was detected even after long exposures of the RNAase protection gel , nor was any e- or -globin RNA detected .
A series of { -globin promoter deletion constructs was used to drive expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene ( Fig 1B ) .

The various promoter constructs were used without enhancers as well .
These constructs were transfected into K562 and OCIM 1 cells by electroporation along with a 3-galactosidase expression plasmid that served as an internal control .
To compare relative enhancer activities , the x-luciferase constructs , the constructs , and pRSV-Luc were transfected into K562 cells ; the results of these experiments are shown in Fig 2 .
The activities of the a- and C-globin promoters are expressed as a percentage of the RSV LTR `` promoter 's activity .
Hypersensitive site 2 of the -globin LCR produced the highest levels of a-globin promoter activity ( 188 % of RSV activity ) , although the uHS-40 enhancer was nearly as effective ( 179 % of RSV ) .
The a-globin promoter was less active when coupled to HS-40 or uLCR ( 87 % and 58 % of RSV , respectively ) .
The uHS-40 construct was most effective at driving the { -globin promoter ( 79 % of RSV ) .
Less luciferase activity was produced from the E-globin promoter coupled to HS-40 or HS $ 2 ( 31 % and 34 % of RSV , respectively ) .
As with the -globin promoter , the LCR enhancer was the least active of the enhancers tested in driving the « -and & -globin promoter ( 9 % of RSV ) .
Very little luciferase activity was produced by the constructs lacking enhancers ( 0.4 % and 0.3 % of RSV for a and G , respectively ) , although the luciferase activity observed was still fivefold higher than background .

Effect of deletions of the { -globin 5° flanking region on promoter function in OCIM1 cells .
OCIM1 cells were transfected and assays were performed as described for the K562 cells in the legend to Fig 2 .
In these experiments , the OCIM1 cells were transfected with the RSV and a-globin constructs as well as the { -globin deletion constructs .
The enhancers used are the same as in Fig 3 .
The activities of the constructs are shown as a percentage of the activity of the corresponding -globin promoter construct , defined as 100 % activity .
( F ) shows the result of an internal deletion of the { -globin promoter from -417 to -207 compared with the { ( -557 ) - , { ( -128 ) - , and a-luciferase constructs , all using the HS-40 enhancer .
hancers , the promoters containing 207 bp of 5 ' flanking sequence were 8 % and 7 % as active as corresponding full-length constructs ( Fig 3 , A and C ) .
The HS2 and uHS-40 & ( -207 ) constructs were 14 % and 33 % as active as the corresponding full-length constructs ( Fig 3 , B and D ) .
In the absence of an enhancer , the £ ( -207 ) construct was 17 % as active as the full-length construct , showing that this putative positive element does not require an enhancer for its function ( Fig 3E ) .
No further decrease in promoter activity was observed when additional sequences between -207 and -128 were deleted .
An internal deletion from -417 to -207 resulted in the same loss in promoter activity as the 5 ' terminal deletion to -128 , showing that the sequences 5 to -417 SABATH ET AL have little effect on the { -globin promoter activity in K562 cells ( Fig 3F ) .
No evidence for the existence of a negative regulatory element was found in these experiments .
Thus , there is a positive regulatory element located between -417 and -207 5 `` to the { -globin transcription start site , designated the URE .
This element acts autonomously because it does not require an enhancer for its activity .
To determine what effect these deletions of the E-globin promoter might have in a cell line that does not express L-globin , the & - and a-luciferase constructs were transfected into OCIM1 cells .
Because of the low level activity of the { -globin promoter in OCIM1 cells , a-luciferase constructs were included in each experiment , and the results are given as a percentage of -globin promoter activity .
The highest levels of E-luciferase activity were obtained with the HS-40 and LHS-40 enhancers .
With these enhancers , C-luciferase activity was at most 20 % the activity of the a-luciferase ( Fig 4 , C and D ) .
With uLCR , the G-luciferase constructs were at most 5 % as active as the -luciferase constructs ( Fig 4A ) , with HS2 , the E-luciferase constructs were at most 10 % as active ( Fig 4B ) , and with no enhancer , the C-luciferase constructs were at most 7 % as active as the -luciferase construct ( Fig 4E ) .
The large decrease in the C-globin promoter activity observed with deletion of the URE in K562 cells was not as pronounced in the OCIM1 cells .
There is a suggestion that the -207 and -128 constructs have less activity with the LCR and HS-40 enhancers ( Fig 4 , A and C ) , but this effect is not seen with the other constructs .
A similar small decrease in activity is seen with the -417 to -207 internal deletion ( Fig 4F ) .
It is likely that because of the low levels of { -globin promoter activity in the OCIM1 cells , the effect of the deletion is more difficult to discern .
Primer extension analysis of luciferase RNA .
- To verify that the physiologic & -globin transcription start site was being used to drive luciferase expression , primer extension analysis was performed using an oligonucleotide primer specific for luciferase sequences .
Primer extension analysis performed on RNA transcripts starting at the physiologic & -globin cap site produces an 82 base product using a primer complementary to the 5 ' end of the luciferase RNA .
The correct 82 base product was produced using total cellular RNA from K562 cells transfected with either the -557 or -417 C-luciferase constructs ( Fig 5A ) .
The primer extension product was barely detectable from cells transfected with either the -207 or -128 constructs , showing that the lower levels of luciferase obtained were due to lower RNA levels .
As with the K562 cells , correctly initiated transcripts were detected in OCIM 1 cells transfected with the -557 and -417 constructs , but not the -207 or -128 constructs ( Fig 5B ) .
This suggests that the lower levels of luciferase activity obtained with the uLCR and HS-40 constructs containing shorter { -globin promoters ( Fig 4 , A , C , and F ) reflect relatively less { -globin promoter activity , and that the URE has some activity in OCIM1 cells .
Again , no evidence of a negative regulatory element in the { -globin promoter was observed .
The URE lacks classical enhancer activity .

The HS-40 enhancer was included in these constructs to increase expression .
Like in the previous experiments , high levels of luciferase activity were obtained from the RSV- , a- , and wild-type G-luciferase constructs ; the CA ( -417/-207 ) -luciferase construct was 6 % as active as the wild-type E-luciferase construct ( Fig 6B ) .
When cloned into its physiologic position in the sense orientation , the URE PCR product increased the activity of the -207 ) -luciferase construct by 10-fold ( Fig 6B ) .
In contrast , when cloned in the antisense orientation , or in the 5 ' or 3 ' positions , the URE PCR product failed to increase the activity of the construct .
Therefore , although this element has a strong positive effect on E-globin promoter activity , the URE only functions in the correct site and orientation , and thus , is not a classical enhancer .
Site-directed mutagenesis of GATA-1 and CCACC sites in the URE .
- Previous work by others has shown that there is a GATA-1 site at -230 in the -globin promoter that binds nuclear proteins from erythroid cells ( presumably GATA-1 ) , and that there is a CCACC site at -240 that binds proteins in nonerythroid cells , thought to be Sp1 .
* Furthermore , mutation of the -230 GATA-1 site has been shown to decrease activity of the & -globin promoter in transient transfection . ``
To reproduce this finding , and to determine whether GATA-1 is responsible for the activity of the URE , a point mutation of the -230 GATA-1 site in the E-luciferase construct was made by site-directed mutagenesis ( Fig 7A ) .
In addition , to determine what role the -240 CCACC site plays , if any , a mutation of this site was made .
The two mutations were combined in a third construct .
The HS-40 enhancer was included to increase expression , because the low levels of activity of the enhancerless constructs make it difficult to detect small magnitude changes in promoter activity .
To determine whether these mutations abolished factor binding , the wild-type and mutant sequences were used in EMSA .
When the mutant -230 GATA-1 sequence was incubated with a GST/GATA-1 fusion protein , no shifted band was observed ( Fig 7B ) .
On the other hand , an intense shifted band was obtained with the wild-type probe .
Unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotide was able to compete for binding with the wild-type probe ; the mutant oligonucleotide was unable to compete for GST/GATA-1 binding ( Fig 7B ) .
Similar results were obtained with crude nuclear extracts from K562 and OCIM1 cells ( not shown ) .
This shows that the mutation eliminated GATA-1 binding .
When the wild-type CCACC oligonucleotide was used as an EMSA probe , only faint binding of proteins in K562 nuclear extracts was observed , and only after extended autoradiography ( Fig 7C ) .
Nonethe-less , the shifted band was not observed when the mutant -240 CCACC sequence was used as a probe , the wild-type oligonucleotide competed for binding of this protein , and the mutant sequence did not .
Identical results were obtained with OCIM1 nuclear extracts ( not shown ) .
The identity of this complex is unknown .
An erythroid-specific CCACC-binding protein , EKLF , `` provided as a GST fusion protein , did not bind the -240 CCACC oligonucleotide , nor did recombinant Spl ( not shown ) .
The wild-type and mutant constructs were transfected into K562 and OCIM1 cells .
The -240 CCACC mutant by itself had no effect on the -globin promoter activity , and the mutation even seemed to increase promoter activity somewhat in the K562 cells but not in the OCIM1 cells ( Fig 8 ) .
The -230 GATA-1 mutation retained 67 % of the wild-type { -globin promoter activity in the K562 cells , considerably greater than the 10 % of wild-type activity obtained with the -207 deletion in the same experiment ( Fig 8A ) .
In the OCIM1 cells , the GATA-1 mutation was 50 % as active as the wild-type promoter ( Fig 8B ) .
In other experiments , the activity was greater , although these differences are difficult to interpret because the wild-type promoter has such low activity in OCIM1 cells .
When the -240 CCACC mutation was added to the -230 GATA-1 mutation , no additional loss in promoter activity was observed .

( B ) Results of transfection of K562 cells with URE insertion constructs as well as RSV-luciferase , eluciferase , wild-type { -luciferase , and { 6 ( -417/-207 ) -lu-ciferase constructs .
Transfections were performed as described in the legend to Fig 2 .
Activities of the various constructs are shown as a percentage of « -globin promoter activity .
The -230 GATA-1 site has low affinity for GATA-1 .
- One explanation for the relatively small effect of the -230 GATA-1 mutation on & -globin promoter activity is that the -230 GATA-1 site has low affinity for GATA-1 .
For this reason , EMSA was performed with a probe for the -230 GATA-1 site , and its binding activity was compared with the activities of two other GATA-1 sites .
One site was from +2,392 in the B-globin 3 ' enhancer . ``
The other was the GATA-1 site located at -105 in the { -globin 5 `` flanking region .
When the -230 GATA-1 site was used as a probe with K562 ( Fig 9A ) and OCIMI1 ( Fig 9B ) nuclear extracts , a faint band was obtained .
The -globin 3 ' enhancer probe SABATH ET AL produced a band of moderate intensity , and the -105 L-globin GATA-1 site produced a very intense band with the nuclear extracts .
When used as an unlabeled competitor in a 100-fold molar excess , the -230 GATA-1 oligonucleotide failed to compete for GATA-1 binding with either the 3-globin 3 ' enhancer probe or the -105 & -globin probe .
On the other hand , these two latter oligonucleotides competed very effectively with the -230 probe for binding .
The 3-globin 3 ' enhancer oligonucleotide had partial activity in competing for the -105 { -globin GATA-1 complex , whereas the -105 site competed efficiently for GATA-1 binding to the 3-globin 3 ' enhancer probe .
On the basis of these experiments , the affinity of GATA-1 for the three different GATA-1 sites is -105 { -globin greater than B-globin 3 `` enhancer greater than -230 C-globin .
DISCUSSION In this report , we analyzed the upstream C-globin promoter using a series of deletion mutants of the promoter to drive luciferase expression in transiently transfected erythroleu-kemic cell lines that had different patterns of globin expression .
The { -globin promoter was active in K562 cells , which contain C-globin RNA , and was less active in OCIM1 cells , which do not contain detectable { -globin RNA .
In contrast , the -globin promoter was active in both cell lines , both of which contain a-globin RNA .
In this study we have identified a novel positive regulatory element in the region between 417 and 207 bp 5 ' to the C-globin RNA cap site that is necessary for high-level promoter activity in K562 cells , which we have designated the URE .
This element is not a classical enhancer , in that its function is position- and orientation-dependent .
The URE also appears to have activity in OCIM1 cells , but because the baseline promoter activity was low in the OCIM1 cells , the effect of this positive regulatory element was less dramatic .
The activity of the URE is an autonomous property of the & -globin promoter because deletion of the URE results in a significant decrease in C-luciferase activity regardless of what enhancer , if any , is used ( Fig 4 ) .
In a previous study by Zhang et al `` a deletion from -557 to -88 caused a marked reduction in { -globin promoter activity , but the effect was only observed when the promoter was linked to the HS-40 core enhancer .
Because the data presented in the current study show that an enhancer does not interact with the URE , combining these data with those of Zhang et al suggests that enhancer sequences may interact with the proximal promoter in the region between -128 and -88 .
Our original hypothesis had been that the GATA-1 site at -230 or the CCACC site at -240 would be responsible for the positive regulatory activity in the -417 to -207 region .
Instead , the -230 GATA-1 mutation reduced the { -globin promoter activity by only 37 % , compared with the 90 % decrease activity observed with the full deletion .
The -240 CCACC site mutation had no effect .
The EMSA comparing the -230 GATA-1 site to two other GATA-1 sites suggests that GATA-1 has low affinity for this site .
If this is the case , even if GATA-1 activates the promoter when it binds at -230 , it is likely that this site is only partially occupied by From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

The autoradiograph was exposed for 7 days at -70°C with intensifying screens .
GATA-1 in vivo , and so removing GATA-1 has only a partial negative effect on promoter activity .
Comparison of the human -417 to -207 region to corresponding regions of other species ' { -globin 5 ' flanking regions shows some areas of identity , but none that correspond to any known erythroid transcription factor binding sites .
We speculate that the URE contains binding sites for proteins that have not yet been shown to be important for globin expression .
It is noteworthy that the 5 `` flanking region of the human & -globin pseu-dogene , { 1 , lacks this URE . ``
This provides an explanation for some earlier studies in which the C1 5 ' flanking region was fused to the { -globin coding regions , but failed to direct RNA transcription . ``
While the URE is important for high-level promoter A B `` u ( Z GSTGATA1 - » .
Cd = « Free probe -- i » .
Free probe -- i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 activity , it is most likely not important for developmental regulation of E-globin , because constructs lacking these sequences are expressed in a developmentally regulated fashion in transgenic mice . ``
Because the embryonic 3-like globin gene , e , has been shown to have a developmental silencer in the 5 ' flanking region , `` * it is significant that deletion of various portions of the 5 `` flanking region had little effect on increasing & -promoter activity in K562 or OCIM 1 cells .
The lack of an obvious silencer is consistent with observations made using transgenic mouse and stable transfection systems . ``
A silencer may still exist in the proximal { -globin promoter .
Constructs containing smaller deletions that retain the URE may be able to show such an element .
