L. , G. V. , S. T. ] , Italy ABSTRACT Different types of acute myeloid leukemia blast cells were induced to differentiate in vitro with all-frans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) and vitamin D ; , ( VD ) .
MO/M1 leukemic cells are not sensitive to differentiating agents , whereas M3 leukemic cells are induced to undergo granulocytic differentiation after ATRA treatment but are not sensitive to VD .
M2 leukemic blast cells behave differently because they undergo monocytic differentiation with both the differentiation inducers .
To gain some insight into the maturation of M2-type leukemic cells , we studied the molecular mechanisms underlying monocytic differentiation induced by ATRA and VD in spontaneous M2 blast cells as well as in Kasumi-1 cells ( an acute myeloid leukemia M2-type cell line ) .
Our results indicate that ATRA as well as VD efficiently increases the nuclear abundance of VD receptor ( VDR ) and promotes monocytic differentiation .
VDR is functionally active in ATRA-treated Kasumi-1 cells because it efficiently heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor , binds to a DR3-type vitamin D-responsive element , and activates the transcription of a vitamin D-responsive element-regulated reporter gene .
Consistent with these findings , VD-responsive genes are induced by ATRA treatment of Kasumi-1 cells , suggesting that the genetic program underlying monocytic differentiation is activated .
The molecular mechanism by which ATRA increases the nuclear abundance of a functional VDR is still unknown , but our data clearly indicate that the M2 leukemic cell context is only permissive of monocytic differentiation .
INTRODUCTION Myelopoiesis of acute leukemias is characterized by an altered balance between quiescent , cycling , and differentiating cells .
AML » blast cells are , in fact , mainly arrested in the G , phase of the cell cycle and are unable to progress spontaneously toward terminal differentiation ( 1 , 2 ) .
The growth advantage of leukemic blast cells is therefore achieved mainly through a prolonged survival time , probably caused by a maturation arrest and an inefficient activation of the apoptotic program ( 3 , 4 ) .
A unique and specific genetic disorder has been discovered in APL in which the t ( 15 ; 17 ) translocation involves the genetic loci of RARa and the promyelocytic leukemia gene ( 5-8 ) .
Patients affected by this type of leukemia can undergo complete remission when treated with ATRA , which induces terminal granulocytic differentiation in vitro and in vivo ( 9 , 10 ) .

F. ] , and the availability of compounds capable of inducing APL blast cells to differentiate and therefore undergo apoptosis provides an opportunity to modify the course of the malignancy .
In a high percentage of the other AML types , genetic abnormalities are extremely heterogeneous and are not specific ( 11 ) .
For example , only 20 % of M2-AML is characterized by t ( 8 ; 21 ) ( 12 ) , and a very low percentage of cases carry t ( 6 ; 9 ) ( 13 ) .
Moreover , very few cases of AML are characterized by t ( 3 ; 21 ) ( 14 ) .
In principle , genetic abnormalities might contribute to the maturation arrest , but no clear correlation can be made between the level of the differentiation block and the genetic aberrations , with the exception of the M3-AML ( 15 ) .
Furthermore , despite the fact that the vast majority of acute leukemia blast cells express several growth factor receptors ( 16 , 17 ) , they are poorly sensitive to the differentiation activity of the corresponding cytokines in vitro and in vivo ; consequently , the therapeutic use of hematopoietic growth factors in AML is controversial ( 18 ) .
Interest-ingly , cytokine antagonists can block leukemic myeloid cell proliferation due to an autocrine mechanism ( 19 ) .
Despite the poor evidence that exists on the physiological role of ATRA and VD in normal hematopoiesis , these inducers could be suitable to force the differentiation block in AML blast cells ( 20 , 21 ) .
It is well known that VD and ATRA exert their action by binding to specific nuclear receptors with high affinity .
These nuclear receptors regulate gene expression in target cells by binding to specific DNA-responsive elements ( VDRE and RARE ) via heterodimerization with RXR ( 22 ) .
It has to be pointed out that our previous studies suggest that myeloid precursors at all stages of differentiation are equipped with the machinery required to trigger the VD-dependent genetic program , eventually leading to terminal differentiation .
In other words , they contain VDR protein that is fully active in binding their DNA sites and in promoting transcription ( 23 ) .
The response to VD is therefore likely to depend on steps located downstream of the nuclear receptor/DNA interaction , such as chromatin structure , nu-cleosome organization , and gene-nuclear matrix interaction .
To gain some insight into the differentiation potential of different types of AML blast cells ( MO/M1 , M2 , and M3 ) , we have investigated the expression levels and function of RARa , VDR , and RXR nuclear receptors ( 22 , 24 ) and the ability of ATRA or VD to induce terminal granulocytic or monocytic differentiation in vitro ( 25-27 ) .
Our data suggest that a monocytic differentiation window exists in M2-type blast cells because ATRA and VD can only trigger monocytic differentiation in M2-type Kasumi-1 cells ( 28 ) as well as in spontaneous leukemic blast cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Cultures and Differentiation .
Blast cell populations were obtained by leukapheresis from five patients with MO/M1-AML , five patients with M2-AML , and three patients with M3-AML before any pharmacological treatment .
All of the blast cells were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation to obtain extremely homogeneous populations ( > 95 % blast cells ) .
The phenotype in each case was defined by morphological , cytochemical ( 29 , 30 ) , immunological ( 31 ) , cytogenetic , and molecular criteria , at least for the molecular analysis of t ( 8 ; 21 ) ( 32 ) and t ( 15 ; 17 ) translocations ( 33 ) .

MONOCYTIC DIFFERENTIATION OF AML-M2 BLAST CELLS cell populations were cultured in Iscove 's medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine and 20 % heat-inactivated FCS .
Kasumi-1 ( M2 AML ) and HL-60 ( M2/M3 AML ) cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15 % heat-inactivated FCS and 2 mM L-glutamine .
Differentiation was induced in blast cells as well as in Kasumi-1 and HL-60 ( 34 , 35 ) cells by treatment with either 107° m ATRA ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Luis , MO ) or 10~ ' m VD ( F. Hoffmann-La Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) as described previously ( 36 ) .
The differentiation was monitored by direct immunofluorescence analysis of surface markers ( 37 ) , such as CD14 ( 38 ) , CD11b ( 39 ) , and CD45 ( 40 ) .
Each antibody was incubated directly into the cellular suspension ( 5-10 ug/10° cells ) for 20 min at 4°C .
The cells were washed twice with PBS and then analyzed by cytofluorometric analysis .
Morphology was assessed by cytocen-trifugation followed by May Grunwald Giemsa staining .
RNA Analysis .
Total cellular RNA was extracted using a modification of the guanidinium-cesium chloride centrifugation technique ( 41 ) and digested with RQ1-DNase ( Promega , Madison , WI ) to avoid DNA contamination as described previously ( 42 ) .
RT-PCR reactions were carried out using a modification of a previously described technique ( 42 ) .
RT-PCR analysis was performed using oligodeoxynucleotide primers specific for RARa ( 43 ) , RXR ( 44 ) , VDR ( 45 , 46 ) , CD14 ( 47 ) , HMSE-1 ( 48 ) , hOC ( 49 ) , and 2m , ( 50 ) .
The oligonucleotides used as DPs or RPs were as follows : ( a ) RARa & -DP ( 5'-CCAGACTGTCTGCCTCCCTIT-3 ' ) and RAR & -RP ( 5'-GTTTCGGTCGTIT-TCTCACAGAC-3 `` ) ; ( b ) RXRa-DP ( 5-CATTTCCTGCCGCTCGATTTC-3 `` ) and ( 5-CTGCTGCTGACGGGGTTCAT-3 ' ) ; ( c ) VDR-DP ( 5'-GGAGACTTTGACCGGAACGTG-3 ' ) and VDR-RP ( 5-GAACTGGCA-GAAGTCGGAGTA-3 ' ) ; ( d ) VDR primary transcript-DP ( 5'-CAGTGACGT-GACCAAAGGTATGCCTAG-3 ' ) and VDR primary transcript-RP ( 5'-GGGAGACGATGCAGATGGCCATGAGCA-3 `` ) ; ( e ) CDI14-DP ( 5'-TCC-AGAGCCTGTCCGGAGCTCAGA-3 ' ) and CDI4-RP ( 5-GCGTTCGC-CCAGTCCAGGATTGTCA-3 ' ) ; ( / ) HMSE-1-DP ( §-CCTCCTATGTG-CACCCAAGAT-3 ' ) and HMSE-1-RP ( 5-GCATCCC-ATCAATCACAG-TGC-3 ' ) ; ( g ) hOC-DP ( 5-GAGCCCTCACACTCCTCGCCCTATT-3 ' ) and hOC-RP ( 5-GTAGAAGCGCCGATAGGCCTCCTGA-3 `` ) ; and ( A ) B2m-DP ( 5-CTCGCGCTACTCTCTCTTTCT-3 ' ) and B2m-RP ( 5-TCCATTCT-TCAGTAAGTCAACT-3 ' .
The primers used for the detection of t ( 8 ; 21 ) and t ( 15 ; 17 ) were as described previously ( 32 , 33 ) .
Northern blot analysis to monitor p21 ( 51 ) , E3 ( 52 ) , and IRF-1 ( 53 ) expression was performed as described previously ( 54 ) .
Preparation of NEs and CEs .
NEs and CEs were obtained from the different myeloid cells as described previously ( 23 , 55 ) , before and after 12 h of VD treatment .
Western Blotting .
Western blotting was performed using the method described by Burnette ( 56 ) , with minor modifications ( 23 ) .
The 9A7y rat monoclonal anti-VDR ( ABR ; Affinity Bioreagents , Golden , CO ) and Rpo ( F ) rabbit polyclonal anti-RARa ( a generous gift of Prof. P. Chambon , Institute de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire , IlIkirch Cedex , France ) were used as primary antibody for the detection of the VDR and RARa proteins , respectively .
The detection was carried out by the enhanced chemi-luminescence method ( Amersham Life Science , Little Chalfont , United King-dom ) .
Gel Shift Assay .
Oligonucleotides were synthesized with an automated solid-phase DNA synthesizer ( Model 394 ; Applied Biosystem , Inc. , Foster City , CA ) with the standard phosphoramidite chemistry and purified by PAGE , followed by electroelution as described previously ( 57 ) .
The DR3 oligonucleotide 5'-AGCTTCAGGTCAAGGAGGTCAGAGAGC-3 ' ( 58 ) and its complement were synthesized and used as probe in the gel shift assay .
Oligonucleotide annealing was performed as described previously ( 58 , 59 ) .
The double-stranded oligonucleotide was further purified by PAGE , electrocluted , and 5 ' end-labeled ( 100 ng ) as described previously ( 60 ) .
Specific radioactivity ranged from 1-3 X 10° cpm/ug DNA .
Gel retardation assays were performed as described previously ( 60 ) .
The following mAbs were used ( a ) 9A7y ( rat monoclonal anti-VDR ; ABR ; Affinity Bioreagents ) ; ( b ) 4RX-1D12 ( mouse monoclonal anti-RXR « , -B , and -y ; kindly provided by Dr. P. Chambon ) ; and ( c ) AbIa ( F ; mouse monoclonal anti-RARa ; kindly provided by Dr. P. Chambon ) .
In all of the gel shift mobility experiments , the VDR specificity of the shifted bands was confirmed by the disruption of shift complex when anti- VDR antibody was added .
In several control experiments , VDRE specificity was also confirmed by adding a 100-fold excess of cold VDRE oligonucleotides ( data not shown ) .
The use of anti-RARa or anti-RXRa mAb has the ability to detect a supershifted band when these nuclear receptors are complexed in a heterodimeric conformation .
All antibodies were added to the samples at 1:20 final dilution .
The reaction mixtures were then loaded on a 5 % polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 % TBE ( 45 mm Tris , 45 mm boric acid , and 1 mM EDTA ) , prerun for 1 h at room temperature .
Finally the gel was fixed , vacuum dried , and exposed to X-ray films for 2-4 h. Cell Transfection .
The following plasmids were used in the transfection experiments : ( a ) pCMVB ( Clontech Laboratories Inc. , Palo Alto , CA ) , a -galactosidase expression vector ; ( b ) pOsteo/CABP-CAT , which contains the CAT reporter gene under the control of the VDRE of the hOC gene ( -511/ -480 ; Ref .
61 ) and the minimal promoter region of the chicken Calbindin gene ( 62 ) ; and ( c ) pTK/RAREGB2-CAT ( kindly provided by Prof. V. Colantuoni , Universita di Napoli `` Federico II `` , Napoli , Italy ) , containing the CAT reporter gene under the control of the RARERB2 and the minimal promoter region of the human TK gene ( -104/+51 ) .
Cells ( 2.5 X 10 `` ) were transfected by electroporation with 30 ug of pOsteo/CABP-CAT or pTK/RAREB2-CAT plasmid and 3 pg of pCMV B plasmid .
Electroporation was performed at 250 V and 960 F ( Gene Pulser Apparatus ; Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) .
Transfected cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 15 % FCS with or without VD or ATRA for 48 h and then harvested for B-galactosidase and CAT assay ( 63 ) .
B-Galactosidase activity was used to normalize the amount of cell extract to be assayed for CAT activity ( 63 ) .
RESULTS Differentiation Capacity of Myeloid Blast Cells Arrested at Different Levels of Maturation after 5 Days of Treatment with ATRA or VD .
Fig .
1 shows the results obtained by cytofluorometric analysis of CD14 , CD11b , and CD45 expression in leukemic cell populations .
The induction of the CD11b marker is associated with granulocytic differentiation , whereas the simultaneous induction of CD14 and CD11b is associated with monocytic differentiation .
The expression of panleukocytic CD45 antigen indicates the percentage of cell viability .
Fig .
14 shows the results obtained in five cases of MO/M1-AML populations : all cell populations studied express a high level of €D45 and very low levels of CD14 and CD11b before and after treatment with ATRA or VD .
The pattern of surface marker expression in five cases of M2-AML populations before differentiation treatment is characterized by a high level of expression of CD45 and a very low expression of CD14 and CD11b ( Fig .
1B ) .
After VD or ATRA treatment , a high percentage of cells express CD14 and CD11b , indicating that monocytic differentiation occurs in these cells ( 39 ) , independent of the inducer used ( Fig .
1B ) .
Granulocytic differentiation is observed when leukemic blast cells of the M3 type are treated with ATRA ; in fact , only CD11b is clearly induced in all populations studied ( Fig .
1C ) .
In contrast , VD treatment has no effect on these cells .
Morphological analysis is consistent with the pattern of surface marker expression in all types of AML cells ( data not shown ) .
VDR , RARa , and RXR Expression in MO/M1 , M2 , and M3-AML Blast Cells .
To clarify whether the different sensitivity to ATRA or VD could depend on the differential expression of VDR , RARa , and RXR nuclear receptors , we performed RT-PCR analysis in all types of AML blast cells .
Fig .
2A shows that RARa , RXRa , and VDR mRNAs are present in the vast majority of spontaneous leukemic cell populations studied , although with a different abundance .
The only exceptions are a MO/M1 population expressing a low level of RARa mRNA and no VDR mRNA ( Lane 4 ) and one M3-AML population ( Lane 12 ) in which VDR mRNA is not detectable .
RT-PCR products of B2m mRNA used to monitor the amount of the RNA in each sample are also reported in Fig .
24 , Lanes 1-13 .
Nuclear receptor expression is detectable in Kasumi-1 ( M2-type AML ) and HL-60 ( M2/M3-type AML ) cell lines before and after 12 h of ATRA or VD treatment ( Fig .
2B ) .

The histograms show the levels of expression , as evaluated by flow cytometric analysis , of CD45 ( Ratched bars ) , CD14 ( L ] ) , and CD11b ( MI ) surface markers in AML MO/MI1 ( five blast cell populations ; A ) , AML M2 ( five blast cell populations ; B ) , and AML M3 ( three blast cell populations ; C ) cells treated with ATRA or VD for 5 days or left untreated .
The values are expressed in percentages .
The reported results are the average of three different sets of experiments .
Variability in each experiment was less than 10 % .
Furthermore , t ( 8 ; 21 ) can be detected by RT-PCR in only one of five cases of M2-AML ( Fig .
24 , C. C. ) , whereas all M3-AMLs were t ( 15 ; 17 ) positive ( data not shown ) .
VDR Protein Expression in MO/M1 , M2 , and M3-AML Blast Cells .
Western blot analysis was performed to detect VDR protein in CEs ( data not shown ) and NEs obtained from MO/MI1 ( Fig .
34 ) , M2 ( Fig .
3B ) , and M3 ( Fig .
3C ) AML blast cells .
The results show that no VDR can be detected before VD treatment in either the cytoplasmic ( data not shown ) or the nuclear compartment ( Fig .
3 , A-C , Lane 1 ) .
On the contrary , VDR is clearly present in NEs of all types of AML blast cells after 12 h of VD treatment ( Fig .
3A-C , Lane 3 ) .
Surpris-ingly , 12 h of ATRA treatment causes the appearance of VDR only in M2 blast cell NEs ( Fig .
3B , Lane 2 ) , and not in the other types of blast cells studied .
The same VDR expression pattern is observed in the other four cases of this type of AML ( data not shown ) .

Flow cytometric analysis of CD45 , CD14 , and CD11b expression in Kasumi-1 and HL-60 cells treated with ATRA or VD for 5 days or left untreated .
Peak 1 corresponds to the expression of CD11b , peak 2 corresponds to the expression of CD14 , and peak 3 corresponds to the expression of CD45 .
The expression of the markers listed above has been evaluated in proliferating Kasumi-1 cells ( A ) and in Kasumi-1 cells treated with ATRA ( B ) or VD ( C ) , in proliferating HL-60 cells ( D ) , and in HL-60 cells treated with ATRA ( E ) or VD ( F ) .
of Number Differentiation Effects of ATRA and VD in Kasumi-1 and HL-60 Cells .
To better characterize ATRA-induced monocytic differentiation of M2 blast cells , we have compared the differentiation capacity of Kasumi-1 cells derived from the peripheral blood of a patient with M2-AML ( 28 ) with the well-known differentiation capacity of HL-60 cells ( M2/M3-AML ) after 5 days of treatment with ATRA or VD .
Morphological analysis performed on differentiated cells shows that only monocytic differentiation can be induced in Kasumi-1 cells with both inducers , whereas HL-60 cells differentiate to monocytes when treated with VD and differentiate to granulocytes after ATRA treatment ( data not shown ) .
This observation was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of surface marker expression ( Fig .
4 ) .
In fact , a clear induction of CD11b and CD14 expression ( peak I and peak 2 , respectively ) is observed in Kasumi-1 cells after treatment with ATRA ( Fig .
4B ) or with VD ( Fig .
4C ) , even if a bimodal distribution of CD14/CD11b expression is observed , due to the presence of negative cells .
Despite this observa-tion , the majority of Kasumi-1 cells differentiate upon ATRA and VD treatment .
HL-60 cells express only CD11b after ATRA treatment ( Fig .
46 ) and coexpress CD14 and CD11b after VD treatment ( Fig .
4F ) .
A high expression level of CD45 is evident in both cell lines before and after treatment with the differentiation inducers ( Fig .
4A-F , peak 3 ) .
VDR and RARa Expression in Kasumi-1 and HL-60 Cells before and after 12 h of ATRA or VD Treatment .
Western blot analysis reveals immunoreactive RARa bands in the NEs of both cell lines before and after treatment for 12 h with ATRA or VD ( Fig .
54 , Lanes 1-6 ) .
Thus , ATRA treatment is not crucial for RARa detection .
The apparent molecular weight of this nuclear receptor is not homogeneous in the two different cell types .
Because RARa is a phospho-protein , the size variability ranging from M , 54,000 to M , 58,000 is probably due to different levels of phosphorylation ( 64 ) .
Two main RARa bands are detected in proliferating and ATRA-treated Kasumi-1 cells ( Fig .

is detected in VD-treated Kasumi-1 cells ( Fig .
54 , Lane 3 ) , whereas in HL-60 cells , only a M , 54,000 band is evident with both inducers ( Fig .
5A , Lanes 4-6 ) .
VD treatment is crucial for VDR detection because NEs obtained from untreated Kasumi-1 and HL-60 cells do not show the receptor band ( Fig .
5B , Lanes 1 and 4 ) .
VDR is clearly observed in the NEs of both cell lines after VD treatment ( Fig .
5B , Lanes 3 and 6 ) .
In Kasumi-1 cells , a clear VDR band is evident in the NEs after ATRA treatment ( Fig .
5B , Lane 2 ) .
This result is superimposable to that obtained in spontaneous M2-AML blast cells ( Fig .
3B ) .
On the contrary , ATRA-treated HL-60 cells , in keeping with the results described for M3 spontaneous blast cells ( Fig .
3C ) , do not show any increase of VDR abundance in the nuclear compartment ( Fig .
5B , Lane 5 ) .
To clarify whether the VDR induction in Kasumi-1 cells could depend on transcriptional regulation by ATRA , we performed RT-PCR analysis on the VDR primary transcript in Kasumi-1 and HL-60 cells before and after the differentiation induction .
In fact , it has been recently described that a functional RARE is present in intron 1C of the VDR gene ( 46 ) .
Our results clearly indicate that in both cellular contexts , VDR primary transcript is detectable after ATRA treatment , suggesting that VDR protein expression in Kasumi-1 cells is not due to transcriptional regulation ( data not shown ) .
DNA Binding Activity of VDR in Kasumi-1 and HL-60 Cells .
Because Kasumi-1 cells are induced to monocytic differentiation both with ATRA and VD , we investigated the ability of VDR , which is present in the NEs after ATRA treatment , to bind a DR3-type VDRE in EMSA .
As shown in Fig .
6A , Lanes 2 and 5 , in untreated Kasumi-1 cells , a major complex is detected , even if the band intensity is lower than that in VD- or ATRA-treated cells ( Fig .
6B , Lanes 8 and 11 ; Fig .
6C , Lanes 14 and 17 , respectively ) .
This complex certainly contains RXRa because a clear supershifted band is detected with the anti-RXR mAb ( Fig .
6A , Lanes 4 and 7 ) .
Very little or no RARa and VDR are present in the complex because it is not affected by anti-RARa or anti- VDR mAb ( Fig .
64 , compare Lanes 2 and 3 and Lanes 5 and 6 ) .
After 12 h of treatment of Kasumi-1 cells with ATRA or VD , VDR is clearly detected in the major complex ( Fig .
6B , Lane 8 ; Fig .
6C , Lane 14 ) because a consistent decrease in intensity is caused by the VDR mAb ( Fig .

No supershift of the major complex is evident in Kasumi-1 NEs after VD or ATRA treatment , when they are matched with RARa mAb ( Fig .
6B , compare Lanes 8 and 9 ; Fig .
6C , compare Lanes 17 and 18 ) .
After VD and ATRA treatment of Kasumi-1 cells , the NEs showed an increased abundance of RXR because an increased intensity of the supershifted band is detected with the RXR mAb ( Fig .
6B , Lanes 10 and 13 ; Fig .
6C , Lanes 16 and 19 ) .
These data clearly show that in ATRA- or VD-treated Kasumi-1 cells , VDR can heterodimerize with RXR and efficiently bind to the DR3-responsive element .
In HL-60 cells , on the contrary , a VDR-containing bandshift complex is observed only after VD treatment ( Fig .
6E , compare Lanes 30 and 31 ) and not upon ATRA treatment ( Fig .
6F , compare Lanes 36 and 37 ) .
Our results indicate that VDR-VDRE complex formation is greatly enhanced by VD or ATRA treatment in Kasumi-1 cells , even if we can not exclude that a ligand-independent complex might be present in untreated cells ( Fig .
6A , compare Lanes 5 and 6 ) .

CAT assays of transfected Kasumi-1 and HL-60 cells .
pOSTEO/CaBPCAT ( A and C ) or pTK/RAREB2-CAT ( B and D ) was transfected in Kasumi-1 ( A and B ) and HL-60 ( C and DD ) cells .
Where indicated , cells were treated with ATRA or VD for 48 h. Amounts of cell extracts used were normalized to the same value of the B-galactosidase activity .
Ability of Endogenous VDR to Activate Transcription of a VDRE-dependent Promoter in Kasumi-1 and HL-60 Cells .
To examine the transactivation capacity of endogenous VDR and RAR , we transiently transfected Kasumi-1 and HL-60 cells with the reporter constructs pOsteo/CaBP-CAT and pRAREB2/TK-CAT and then treated them for 48 h with ATRA or VD .
As shown in Fig .
7 , both ATRA treatment and VD treatment of Kasumi-1 cells cause transcriptional activation of the pOsteo/CaBP-CAT reporter gene ( Fig .
7A , Lanes 4 and 6 ) , whereas ATRA treatment but not VD treatment causes the transcriptional activation of pTK/RARERB2-CAT ( Fig .
7B , Lanes 10 and 12 ) .
This observation provides further evidence that in Kasumi-1 cells , ATRA specifically activates transcription through a VDRE just as efficiently as VD .
The effect of ATRA on VDRE-dependent transcription is restricted to M2-type blast cells because no transcriptional activation of pOsteo/CaBP-CAT is evident after ATRA treatment of HL-60 cells ( Fig .
7C , Lane 16 ) ; in these cells , reporter activity is observed only after VD treatment ( Fig .
7C , Lane 18 ) .
The pTK/RAREB2-CAT construct is transactivated quite consistently in HL-60 cells after ATRA treatment , but not after VD treatment ( Fig .
7D , Lanes 24 and 22 , respectively ) .
These results suggest that the pOsteo/CaBP-CAT activation observed in Kasumi-1 cells after ATRA treatment is due to a VDR induction .
Even if several reports indicate that a VD-independent transactivation may occur mainly in kidney and intestine epithelial cells ( 65-67 ) , pOsteo/CaBP-CAT transactivation observed in Kasumi-1 cells after ATRA treatment seems to be more dependent on increased VDR nuclear abundance than on ligand-independent activation , as also demonstrated by VDR protein expression and EMSA experiments .
Expression of ATRA and VD Primary Response Genes in Kasumi-1 and HL-60 Cells .
To monitor the ability of ATRA and VD to activate the genetic program underlying monocytic differentiation in the M2 cellular context , we have investigated the expression of VD-responsive genes ( Fig .
8 ) such as HMSE-1 , CD14 , and hOC by RT-PCR and the expression of genes controlled by a functional VDRE , such as p21*** ' ( 51 ) , or RARE , such as E3 ( 52 ) , IRF-1 ( 53 ) and p21 `` ~* `` ( 68 ) , by Northern blot analysis after different times of ATRA or VD treatment .
Fig .
8 shows that both ATRA and VD treatment of Kasumi-1 cells causes a rapid induction of HMSE-1 , CD14 , and hOC expression , demonstrating VDR involvement in ATRA-dependent monocytic differentiation of M2-type blast cells .
In fact , these VD-responsive genes are not induced in ATRA-treated HL-60 cells .
In addition , neither VD treatment nor ATRA treatment is able to modify the expression of RA primary responsive genes , such as E3 and IRF-1 , that are constitutively expressed in Kasumi-1 cells , suggesting that no induction of granulocytic differentiation occurs in these cells ( data not shown ) .
The same analysis performed on HL-60 cells shows a rapid induction of E3 and IRF-1 expression after ATRA treatment , as expected .

MONOCYTIC DIFFERENTIATION OF AML-M2 BLAST CELLS with ATRA or VD treatment , p21*** ' expression is induced after 1 h by both differentiating agents , suggesting that its expression is not sufficient to induce monocytic differentiation , as suggested recently ( 51 ) .
The level of the constitutively expressed B2m mRNA was assessed to monitor RNA abundance in all samples ( Fig .
8 , Lanes 1-6 ) .
DISCUSSION Differentiation of AML blast cells is blocked at different levels of maturation , as demonstrated by the French- classification ( 29 ) and the immunological classification ( 31 ) .
Blast cells maintain the capacity to divide , but the rate of cell division decreases progressively as blast cells undergo a series of differentiation transi-tions .
The consequence of this biological behavior is that the vast majority of leukemic blast cells are arrested in the G , phase of the cell cycle , and , despite the expression of cyclin-dependent inhibitors , never reach spontaneous terminal differentiation ( 1 , 2 , 69 ) .
Differentiation induction therapy based on treatment with hemopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor , granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor , or monocyte colony-stimulating factor is inefficient because blast cells are not responsive to these cytokines , despite the expression of the corresponding receptors ( 16-18 ) .
In vitro experiments indicate that these hematopoietic growth factors are more efficient in recruiting blast cells to the proliferative pathway than to the differentiative pathway ( 70 ) .
Efficacy of differentiation therapy based on ATRA has been demonstrated only in APL blast cells ( 9 , 10 , 71 ) .
Because differentiation therapy with physiological inducers is a highly attractive approach to control leukemic cell growth ( 72 ) , we have evaluated the capacity of ATRA and VD to induce myeloid differentiation in different types of AML blast cells .
We found that spontaneous M2-type AML blast cells , independent of the presence of t ( 8 ; 21 ) , are induced to monocytic differentiation with either ATRA treatment or VD treatment .
Spontaneous MO/M1 blast cells are not responsive to these inducers .
M3-type AML blast cells , as already described , are responsive only to ATRA , and not to VD .
Our original observation is that VDR protein is detected after ATRA treatment in the nuclear compartment of M2 cells , but not in the NEs of MO/M1 and M3 cells , suggesting that both ATRA and VD are able to increase the nuclear abundance of VDR in M2-type blast cells .
To gain some insight into the molecular mechanism underlying monocytic differentiation induced by ATRA in M2-AML blast cells , we studied VDR and RARa expression and VDR function in two AML cell lines : ( a ) Kasumi-1 ( M2-type cell line ) ; and ( b ) HL-60 ( M2/M3-type cell line ) .
Kasumi-1 cells are representative of spontaneous M2-AML blast cells because only monocytic differentiation is achieved by ATRA or VD treatment ( Fig .
4 ) .
HL-60 cells are a classical model of myeloid maturation because they differentiate to granulocytes or monocytes when treated with ATRA or VD , respectively ( Fig .
4 ; Ref .
35 ) .
Our results indicate that nuclear VDR protein is detected in Kasumi-1 cells after either ATRA or VD treatment ( Fig .
5 ) .
Furthermore , VDR is functionally active in this cellular context because it is capable of binding a DR3 oligonucleotide after heterodimerization with RXR ( Fig .
6 ) and activating the transcription of the transfected pOsteo/CaBP-CAT vector ( Fig .
7 ) .
These results are obtained in HL-60 cells after VD treatment , but not after ATRA treatment .
On the other hand , ATRA can transactivate the pTK/RAREB2-CAT vector ( Fig .
7 ) in HL-60 cells and in Kasumi-1 cells , suggesting that RARa is functionally active in both cellular contexts .
Recent reports indicate that there is a cross-over of the nuclear signaling pathways of RA and VD , but it is still unclear whether the interplay between the different nuclear receptors can activate different signaling pathways during hematopoietic differentiation ( 73-75 ) .
The peculiarity of our results is that both ATRA and VD lead to the activation of monocytic differentiation in M2-type blast cells .
Furthermore , the described ATRA-induced pOsteo/CaBP-CAT transactivation is also obtained with compounds such as 8-bromo-cyclic AMP ( 67 ) and okadaic acid ( 66 , 67 ) , which are known to induce a VD-independent , VDR-mediated transactivation of reporter genes ( 65 ) .
This transcription activation is achieved through a modulation of VDR phosphorylation levels and does not involve a VDR protein expression induction ( 67 ) , which is , conversely , clearly observed in ATRA-treated Kasumi-1 cells .
Moreover , the formation of spontaneous VD-independent complexes between endogenous VDR-RXR het-erodimers and genomic DNA can probably be hypothesized only for tissues characterized by high levels of VDR nuclear protein expression , such as intestinal epithelial cells ( 65 ) .
The existence of basal VDR-RXR/DNA interaction complexes is unlikely in hematopoietic cells , in which the detection of significant amounts of nuclear VDR protein is strictly dependent on VD treatment ( 23 ) .
We can thus conclude that VDR-mediated activation of gene expression induced in Kasumi-1 cells by ATRA probably resides on mechanisms that are not strictly related to VD-independent transcription activation of VDR .
The molecular mechanisms by which ATRA induces a functionally active VDR nuclear protein in Kasumi-1 cells and M2 blast cells are still unclear .
Transcription of the VDR gene , which is probably RARE dependent ( 46 ) , is activated by ATRA in both Kasumi-1 and HL-60 cells because a primary VDR transcript is clearly detectable in both the cellular contexts by RT-PCR , suggesting that the ATRA-induced VDR expression observed in Kasumi-1 cells is not strictly regulated at the transcriptional level .
Furthermore , VDR expression studies in spontaneous leukemic blast cells showed a discrepancy between VDR mRNA and protein levels .
VDR mRNA is , in fact , detected in all types of AML blast cells before VD treatment ( Fig .
24 ) .
VDR protein ( Fig .
3 ) , on the other hand , is detected in the nuclear compartment of all myeloid blast cells only after VD treatment and after ATRA treatment of M2-type blast cells .
The RARa expression pattern is different because both mRNA and protein are detected in untreated AML blast cells , and protein is not significantly modulated in the NEs after ATRA treatment ( Fig .
3D ) .
Comparable results were observed in the HL-60 and Kasumi-1 leukemic cell lines ( Figs .
2 and 5 ) .
However , these expression studies indicate clearly that VDR protein abundance in untreated leukemic cells is very low , and that after VD treatment , posttranscriptional mechanisms such as protein stabilization ( 76 ) or , as described in other systems , increased translation efficiency of compartmentalized mRNA ( 77 ) take part in increasing the VDR protein abundance in the nuclear compartment .
This VDR posttranscriptional regulation also occurs in M2-type blast cells after ATRA treatment .
Both ATRA treatment and VD treatment of Kasumi-1 cells ( Fig .
8 ) rapidly induce the expression of VD-responsive genes such as HMSE-1 , CD14 , and hOC .
These data clearly demonstrate that VDR is involved in ATRA-dependent monocytic differentiation of M2-type blast cells .
Moreover , these VD-responsive genes are not induced in ATRA-treated HL-60 cells .
In addition , neither VD treatment nor ATRA treatment is able to modify the expression of RA primary responsive genes , such as E3 and IRF-1 , which are constitutively expressed in Kasumi-1 cells , suggesting that no induction of granulocytic differentiation occurs in M2-type blast cells , even if RARa is expressed and is functionally active in transactivating the pTK/RARE/ B2-CAT construct .

MONOCYTIC DIFFERENTIATION OF AML-M2 BLAST CELLS shows a rapid induction of E3 and IRF-1 expression after few hours of ATRA treatment , as expected .
Despite the differential phenotypic effect observed in HL-60 cells with ATRA or VD treatment , p21*** ' expression is induced after 1 h by both differentiating agents , suggesting that its expression is not sufficient to induce monocytic differentiation , as suggested recently ( 51 ) .
These results are consistent with a recent report showing that p21 `` ** `` expression after ATRA treatment is associated with granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells ( 68 ) .
In conclusion , our data allow us to hypothesize that the M2 cellular context can be considered a differentiation window permissive only of monocytic differentiation because both VD and ATRA differentiation inducers are capable of activating this differentiation program through the induction of a functional nuclear VDR protein .
This observation might open a new therapeutic application of ATRA , even if the response of AML patients ( including M2-type AML ) to treatment with this differentiating agent remains to be verified .
