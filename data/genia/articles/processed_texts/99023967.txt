Bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induces monocytes to express a variety of genes by activating the NF- « B/Rel transcription factor family .
Recently , we have reported that the tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 1 signaling pathways activate two kinases , IKK1 and IKK2 .
Phosphorylation of the IxB cytoplasmic inhibitors , IxBa , IBB , and IxBe , by these kinases triggers proteolytic degradation and the release of NF- « B/Rel proteins into the nucleus .
At pres-ent , the role of the IKKs in LPS signaling has not been investigated .
Here , we report that LPS induces IKK activity in human monocytes and THP-1 monocytic cells .
The kinetics of activation of kinase activity in monocytic cells are relatively slow with maximal activity observed at 60 min , which coincides with the degradation of IxBs and the nuclear translocation of NF- « B .
In trans-fection experiments , overexpression of wild type IKK1 , a dominant negative mutant IKK1 ( K44M ) , or wild type IKK2 did not affect LPS-induced B-dependent transcription in monocytic cells .
In contrast , a dominant negative mutant of IKK2 inhibited LPS induction of « B-dependent transcription in a dose-dependent manner .
These results indicate that LPS induction of « B-dependent gene expression in human monocytic cells requires activation of IKK2 .
Monocytes and macrophages play essential roles in inflammation and mobilization of the host defense against bacterial infec-tion .
Following exposure to foreign microbes , monocytes develop an increased capacity to kill bacteria and secrete inflammatory mediators that are involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock .
Bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria , is one of the most potent activators of monocytes ( 1 ) .
LPS stimulation of monocytes activates many second messengers and signal transduction pathways ( 2-5 ) .
These signaling pathways in turn activate various transcription factors , including the NF- « B/Rel family , which co * This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant HL48872 ( to N.

30410 ordinate the induction of genes encoding inflammatory media-tors , such as tumor necrosis factor a ( TNFa ) and interleukin 1 ( 2 ) .
The NF- « B/Rel family of proteins comprises RelA ( p65 ) , RelB , c-Rel , NF- « B1 ( p105/p50 ) , and NF- « B2 ( p100/p52 ) , which form various homo- or heterodimers .
NF-KB is activated in response to various extracellular stimuli , including cytokines , LPS , phorbol esters , viruses , and oxidative stress ( 6-8 ) .
In unstimulated monocytes , NF- « B is retained in the cytoplasm by the binding of a family of inhibitors ( IxBa , IxBB , and IxBe ) .
Activation of NF- « B requires sequential phosphoryla-tion , ubiquitination , and degradation of the IxBs , which permits nuclear translocation of NF- « B/Rel proteins .
A high molecular mass kinase complex ( 700 kDa ) has been described that contains a kinase activity specific for Ser®* and Ser®® of IxBa and Ser ?
and Ser of IkBB ( 9 ) .
More recently , we and others have cloned two IB kinases , IKK1 ( IKKa , CHUK ) and IKK2 ( IKK $ ) , that are present in a multisubunit complex , which we termed the IKK signalsome ( 10-14 ) .
Although IKK1 and IKK2 can homo- and heterodimerize , the major form of IKK contains both IKK1 and IKK2 .
These recent studies have elucidated the mechanism by which the TNFa and interleukin 1 signaling pathways activate NF- « B .
In this study , we used primary human monocyte-derived macrophages ( Mo ) and human monocytic THP-1 cells to investigate the role of these novel IKKs in the LPS signaling path-way .
We demonstrate that LPS activates IKK activity , in particular IKK2 activity , relatively slowly with maximal activity at 60 min .
A dominant negative mutant of IKK2 inhibited LPS-induced « B-dependent transcription in a dose-dependent manner in THP-1 cells .
Taken together , these results suggest that LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NF- « B in human monocytic cells is mediated , in part , by the activation of IKK2 .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials-LPS ( Escherichia coli serotype O111 : B4 ) and the proteasome inhibitor , MG182 , were purchased from Calbiochem .
Recombi-nant human TNFa was purchased from Collaborative Biomedical Products ( Bedford , MA ) .
Cell Culture-Human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells ( 15 ) were obtained from ATCC ( Manassas , VA ) .
THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium ( BioWhittaker , Walkersville , MD ) with 8 % fetal calf serum ( Omega Scientific , Inc. , Tarzana , CA ) , L-glutamine ( Irvine Scientific , Santa Ana , CA ) , and 2-mercaptoethanol ( complete media ) .
Monocyte Isolation-Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from heparinized blood from healthy volunteers by buoyant density centrifugation on a low endotoxin Ficoll-Hypaque ( 16 ) .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( 4 X 10°/ml ) were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates in complete media , and monocytes were allowed to adhere for 90 min at 37 °C .
Subsequently , cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline to deplete nonadherent cells .
Adherent cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 1 h at 37 °C , and cell lysates were prepared .
IxB Kinase Activity-Mo and THP-1 cells were unstimulated or stimulated with LPS for various times .
Cell lysates were mixed with 1.5 ug of control rabbit anti-goat IgG antibody , 1.5 ug of a rabbit affinity-purified anti-IKK2 polyclonal antibody , which was raised against a This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog LPS Activation of IKK2 in Monocytes unique region of the IKK2 C terminus and is specific for IKK2 , or 1.5 ug of a rabbit affinity-purified anti-IKK no .

The immunoprecipitate was prepared as described previously ( 10 ) , resuspended in kinase buffer containing 10 uM adenosine triphosphate and 1-8 mCi of [ y- `` °PJATP , and incubated at 34 °C for 30 min in the presence of the substrates GST-I « Ba- ( 1-54 ) , GST-IxBB- ( 1-44 ) , or mutant substrates .
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE , and radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography .
Western Blotting-THP-1 cells were unstimulated or stimulated with 10 ug/ml LPS for various times , and cytosolic extracts were prepared ( 17 ) .
Cytosolic proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-enhanced chemiluminescence membrane ( ECL ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) .
IxBa or IxBB protein was detected according to the ECL protocol ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) using a 1:1000 dilution of anti-I « Ba or anti-IkBB antibodies ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. , Santa Cruz , CA ) .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay-Nuclear extracts were prepared from 5 X 10° cells as described previously ( 17 ) .
A radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe ( Operon Technologies Inc. , Ala-meda , CA ) containing the murine Igx « B site ( underlined ) , 5'-CA-GAGGGGACTTTCCGAGA-3 ' , was used to detect p50-p65 ( 17 ) .
Protein-DNA complexes were separated from a free DNA probe by electrophoresis through 6 % nondenaturing acrylamide gels ( Novex , San Diego , CA ) in 0.5 % Tris borate EDTA buffer .
Gels were dried , and protein-DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography .
Plasmids and Transfections-In THP-1 cells , « B-dependent transcription was measured using a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid , p ( xB ) , LUC , which contained four NF- « B sites cloned upstream of the minimal ( SV40 ) promoter in pGL2 promoter ( Promega Corp. , Madison , WI ) ( 17 ) .
pTNF-LUC contains -615 base pairs of the human TNFa promoter ( 18 ) .
Eukaryotic expression plasmids containing cDNAs encoding wild type IKK1 , mutant IKK1 ( KA44M ) , wild type IKK2 , and mutant IKK2 ( KA44M ) have been described ( 10 ) .
peDNA8 ( Invitrogen Corp. , San Diego , CA ) was used as a control .
THP-1 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran protocol ( 19 ) .
After transfection , cells were incubated in complete media for 46 h at 37 °C before stimulating with 10 ug/ml LPS or 10 ng/ml TNFa for 5 h at 37 °C .
In some experiments , cells were preincubated with MG132 ( 5 pM ) for 30 min at 37 °C before the addition of LPS .
Cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity as described in the manufacturer 's protocol ( Promega Corp. ) using a Monolight 2010 luminometer ( Analytical Luminescence Labo-ratory , San Diego , CA ) .
In selected experiments , cells were co-transfected with pRLTK that expresses Renilla luciferase ( Promega Corp. ) .
Renilla luciferase was measured according to the manufacturer 's protocol ( Promega Corp. ) and used to normalize the activity of the firefly luciferase .
Results were expressed as mean + S.D .
Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired Student 's £ test .
Expression levels of wild type and mutant IKK1 in transfected cells were determined by Western blotting using an anti-hemagglutinin ( 1:1000 ) antibody .
RESULTS LPS Induces IKK Activity in Human Monocytes and THP-1 Cells-IKK activity was determined in human Mo and human THP-1 monocytic cells stimulated with LPS .
Following immunoprecipitation of the IKKI1-IKK2 complex from cell extracts using an anti-IKK2 antibody , IKK activity was determined by phosphorylation of the substrate GST-IxBa- ( 1-54 ) ( Fig .
1 ) .
LPS stimulation dramatically increased IKK activity in both Mo and THP-1 cells .
No phosphorylation of IxBa- ( 1-54 ) was observed when either the anti-IKK antibody was replaced with a control rabbit anti-goat IgG antibody or when GST-IxBa- ( 1-54 ) was replaced with a mutant GST-I « kBa- ( 1-54 , S82T , S86T ) demonstrating specificity for the kinase and for the serines required for targeted degradation of I [ xBa .
Similar results were observed using an antibody that recognizes both IKK1L and IKK2 ( data not shown ) .
These results indicated that THP-1 cells were a valid model for studying LPS-induced IKK activation in monocytes .
Our previous studies have shown that LPS activation of NF- « B and induction of « B-dependent gene expression in THP-1 cells are similar to that of human monocytes ( 17 , 20 ) .

cells stimulated with LPS for various times ( 0-60 min ) .
Following immunoprecipitation of the IKKI1-IKK2 complex from cell extracts using an antibody that recognizes both IKK1 and IKK2 , IKK activity was determined by phosphorylation of the substrates GST-IxBa- ( 1-54 ) and GST-IxBB- ( 1-44 ) ( Fig .
2 ) .
In contrast to the rapid activation of IKK activity in TNF-stimulated HeLa cells ( 10 , 11 ) , LPS induced a slow increase in IKK activity that continued to increase up to 1 h. A longer time course ( 0-180 min ) revealed that LPS-induced IKK activity peaks at 60 min and decreases thereafter but is still present at 180 min ( Fig .
3 , top panels ) .
The kinetics of IKK activity in response to LPS were compared with the kinetics of degradation of IxBa and IxBB ( Fig .
3 , middle panels ) .
IxBa was rapidly degraded within 15 min of LPS stimulation with maximal degradation between 30 and 90 min .
Resynthesis of I [ xBa was observed at 180 min .
In contrast , degradation of I « BB occurred more slowly with maximal degradation at 60 min and no resynthesis at 180 min .
Nuclear translocation of NF- « B was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( Fig .
3 , bottom panel ) .
In unstimulated THP-1 cells , no nuclear NF-kB was detected .
LPS stimulation induced a rapid nuclear translocation of NF- « B , which was detectable within 15 min , reached a maximum at 30 min , and was still present at 180 min .

This induction was strongly inhibited ( > 95 % ) by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 ( 5 uM ) , suggesting that it was mediated by NF- « B/Rel proteins .

THP-1 cells were unstimulated or stimulated with LPS ( 10 ug/ml ) for various times ( 0-180 min ) , and cell extracts were prepared .
IKKs were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts , and kinase activity was determined using GST-IxBa- ( 1-54 ) or GST-I « BB- ( 1-44 ) as substrates .
Cytoplasmic extracts of THP-1 cells were prepared , proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE , and Western blot analysis was carried out using anti-I « Ba or antibodies .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using nuclear extracts from THP-1 cells and a « B oligonucleotide probe .
LPS Activation of IKK2 in Monocytes control .
Fig .
4 demonstrated that wild type IKK1 or IKK2 had no effect on LPS-induced « B-dependent transcription .
An IKK1L mutant , IKK1 ( KA44M ) , also did not affect LPS-induced kB-de-pendent transcription .
Western blotting for hemagglutinin-tagged IKK1 and IKK1 ( KA44M ) confirmed that these proteins were expressed in transfected cells ( data not shown ) .
In contrast to the results with IKK1 ( K44M ) , a dominant negative IKK2 mutant significantly inhibited LPS-induced « B-dependent reporter activity ( Fig .
4 ) .
Mean inhibition of « B-dependent transcription IKK2 ( KA4M ) was 44 + 2.5 % ( mean + S.E .
, n = 7 , p = 0.0008 ) .
A detailed dose experiment performed with IKK2 ( KA4M ) demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of « B-dependent transcription ( Fig .
5 ) .
Maximal inhibition ( 44 % ) was observed with 4 ug of IKK2 ( KA44M ) , and no further inhibition was observed with 5 or 6 ug of plasmid DNA .
For comparison , we determined the degree of inhibition of TNF-stimulated « B-dependent transcription by IKK2 ( KA4M ) .
IKK2 ( KA44M ) inhibited TNF and LPS-stimulated « B-dependent transcription to a similar extent ( Fig .
6 ) .
To determine whether IKK2 ( K44M ) inhibited an authentic « B-dependent promoter in a similar manner to the multimer-ized kB reporter , we examined the effect of IKK2 ( KA44M ) on the human TNF promoter .
Fig .
7 shows that IKK2 ( KA44M ) significantly inhibited LPS induction of the cloned human TNF promoter in THP-1 cells .
These data indicate that IKK2 plays a biological role in LPS induction of « B-dependent gene expression in human monocytic cells .
DISCUSSION LPS stimulates multiple signaling pathways in monocytes , some of which lead to proteolytic degradation of IxBa and IxBB and activation of NF- « B .
Signaling molecules activated by LPS include G proteins , phospholipids , ceramide , and protein kinases , such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase , protein kinase C , tyrosine kinases , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , and the IKK1 IKK2 T 1004 100- 75 - 75 9 50 - 50 Lad & 8 25 - 257 Fic .

Forty-six hours after transfection , cells were stimulated with LPS ( 10 ug/m1 ) for 5 h. Firefly luciferase was determined in cell lysates and normalized with the internal control Renilla luciferase activity , and results were expressed as a percentage of control induction .

ERK , p38 , and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways ( 2-5 ) .
The search for the IxB kinase led to many potential candidates that phosphorylate I « B in vitro , including protein kinase C ( 21 ) and casein kinase II ( 22 ) .
However , these kinases lacked the ability to target the serines of IxBs required for targeted degradation ( 22 , 23 ) .
More recently , two studies reported that in response to phorbol ester , but not TNFa , the ribosomal S6 kinase , pp90'** ' , phosphorylated Ser® ?
of IxBa and physically associated with this inhibitor in vivo ( 24 , 25 ) .
Furthermore , a dominant negative form of pp90 ' * ' inhibited IxBa degradation in response to phorbol ester ( 25 ) .
These studies suggested that there may be multiple IxB kinases that are differentially activated by various stimuli ( 26 ) .
We and others have shown that the TNFa and interleukin-1 signaling pathways activate a novel IKKI1-IKK2 complex in Hela cells ( 10-14 ) .
In this study , we examined the role of IKKI-IKK2 in LPS activation of NF- « B in human monocytic cells .
LPS stimulated IKK activity in human Mo and human THP-1 monocytic cells .
IxBa was rapidly phosphorylated and degraded with resynthesis by 3 h after LPS stimulation .
In contrast , IBB was phosphorylated and degraded more slowly , and no resynthesis was noted at 3 h. LPS-stimulated monocytic cells exhibit prolonged NF- « B activity in the nucleus ( > 3 h ) , which may be because of the prolonged degradation of I « BB .
Similarly , in murine 702/83 pre-B cells , LPS induces nuclear translocation of NF- « B by 15 min and remains for > 4 h , which coincides with a slow persistent degradation of IxBB ( 27 ) .
In contrast , TNFa induces a rapid I « xBa degradation without affecting IBB in 70 % /3 cells and EL-4 T cells ( 27 , 28 ) .
Our results suggest that the persistence of NF- « B that is observed in LPS-stimulated monocytic cells may be because of a slower IKK-dependent phosphorylation of IkBB .
Overexpression of the wild type IKK1 and IKK2 had no effect on LPS-induced « B-driven gene transcription ( Fig .
4 ) .
A dominant negative IKK1 ( KA44M ) did not inhibit « B-dependent transcription in THP-1 cells , which is consistent with the inability of IKK1 ( KA44M ) to inhibit « B-dependent transcription or nuclear translocation of RelA in TNFo-stimulated Hela cells ( 10 , 11 ) .

Forty-six hours after transfection , cells were stimulated with LPS ( 10 ug/ml ) for 5 h. Luciferase activity in cell lysates was determined , and results were expressed as relative light units ( RLU ) .

Differences in the cell type , reporter plasmids , or different substitutions of the lysine residue may be responsible for this anomaly .
Antisense to IKK1 inhibited TNFa and interleukin 1-induced « B-dependent transcription in Hela cells , suggesting that IKK1 functions in cytokine-stimulated activation of NF- « B in Hela cells ( 29 ) .
Expression of a dominant negative IKK2 ( KA44M ) inhibited LPS-induced « B-dependent transcription in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .
4 ) .
IKK2 ( KA44M ) and other IKK2 mutants strongly inhibit cytokine-induced « B-dependent transcription and RelA nuclear translocation in HeLa cells and 293 cells ( 10 , 12 , 14 ) .
A dominant negative mutant of IKK2 appears to have less of an effect on LPS-induced « B-dependent transcription in monocytic cells ( maximal inhibition of 44 % ) than on cytokine-induced « < B-dependent transcription in Hela cells .
We com 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog 30414 pared LPS and TNFa-mediated « B-dependent transcription in THP-1 cells ( Fig .
6 ) .
IKK2 ( KA44M ) inhibition of LPS-mediated « B-driven transcription ( 44 % ) was similar to that of TNF ( 32 % ) , suggesting that there are differences in the relative efficiency of the dominant negative mutants to inhibit IKK2 in different cell types .
IKK2 ( KA44M ) also inhibited LPS-induced TNF promoter activity ( 25 % ) .
The lesser effect of IKK2 ( KA44M ) on LPS-induced TNF promoter activity may be because of compensation by other transcription factors that are involved in the induction of this complex promoter ( 18 ) .
Thus , monocytic cells appear to be more resistant than other cell types to the effects of dominant negative kinases .
NF- « B-inducing kinase , a member of the TNF signaling pathway , has been reported to phosphorylate IKK1 on Ser `` © ( 30 ) .
It was recently demonstrated that overexpression of NF- « B-inducing kinase stimulates both IKK1 and IKK2 activities ( 31 ) .
However , overexpression of MEK kinase 1 , a member of the 900-kDa signalsome and an activator of NF- « B , preferentially stimulates IKK2 activity ( 31 ) .
These results suggest that NF- « B-inducing kinase and MEK kinase 1 independently activate the IKK complex , and the kinase activities of IKK1 and IKK2 are differentially regulated by NF- « B-inducing kinase and MEK kinase 1 , which respond to different stimuli .
The upstream members of the LPS signaling pathway leading to IKK2 activation have not yet been elucidated .
In summary , this study demonstrates that LPS stimulation of human monocytes induces nuclear translocation of NF- « B by activation of IKK2 .
NF- « B is a key regulator of LPS-induced gene expression in monocytes , and therefore targeting key components of the LPS-mediated NF- « B signaling pathway , such as IKK2 , may prove beneficial in the treatment of sepsis and inflammatory diseases .
