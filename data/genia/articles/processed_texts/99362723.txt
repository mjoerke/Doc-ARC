Many of the effects of CD40 are believed to be achieved through altered gene expression .
In addition to Bcl-x , a known CD40-regulated antiapoptotic molecule , we identified a related antiapoptotic molecule , A1/Bfl-1 , as a CD40-inducible gene .
Inhibition of the NF- « B pathway by overexpression of a dominant-active inhibitor of NF-B abolished CD40-induced up-regulation of both the Bfl-1 and Bcl-x genes and also eliminated the ability of CD40 to rescue Fas-induced cell death .
Within the upstream promoter region of Bcl-x , a potential sequence was found to support NF- « B-dependent transcriptional activation .
Furthermore , expression of physiological levels of Bel-x protected B cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis in the absence of signaling .
Thus , our results suggest that CD4O0-mediated cell survival proceeds through NF-rB-dependent up-regulation of Bcel-2 family members .
CD40 is a 50-kDa glycoprotein member of the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor ( TNFR ) superfamily , a family of type I receptors with more than 20 known members , which mediates a diverse array of biological processes ( 1 ) .
Studies with X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome ( HIGMX ) , a genetic defect in the corresponding CD40 ligand ( CD4O0L ) gene , and with mice lacking either the CD40 or CD40L gene have demonstrated that interaction between CD40 and CD4O0L during T and B cell contact is essential for all events in thymus-dependent antigen responses such as Ig production , isotype switching , somatic hypermutation , and induction of B cell memory ( 2-5 ) .
Recently published studies indicate that CD40/CDA4O0L interactions also play important roles in the activation of T cells , macrophages , natural killer cells , and endothelial cells ( 6 ) .
The molecular mechanisms for these biological effects of CD40/ CD40L interactions , however , remain to be elucidated .
An important aspect of CD40 signaling in B cells is its ability to control apoptosis ( 7 ) .
Isolated germinal center B cells , which spontaneously undergo apoptosis in culture , are capable of surviving for extended periods when treated with anti-CD40 antibodies or CD4O0L .
In addition , CD40 is known to rescue immature B cells , such as WEHI 231 cells , and mature B cells from surface IgM ( sIgM ) and Fas-mediated apoptosis , respectively ( 8-10 ) .
Many studies indicate that the antiapoptotic function of CD40 is mediated by up-regulated expression of the Bcl-x , gene , an antiapoptotic member of the Bel-2 family of proteins ( 11-13 ) .
This family includes other antiapoptotic members such as Bfl-1/A1 , Mcl-1 , and Bel-w , as well as proapoptotic members such as Bax , Bad , Bid , and the alternatively spliced Bcl-xs ( 14 ) .
Studies show that overexpression of exogenous Bcl-x , ( hereafter referred to as Bel-x ) is capable of preventing The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

9136 B cell apoptosis by various stimuli such as Fas activation , sIgM crosslinking , and exposure to various chemical inducers of cell death ( 15 ) .
Studies by our laboratory , as well as those of others , have determined that TNF receptor-associated factor ( TRAF ) adapter proteins , most notably TRAF 2 , are crucial for the activation of CD4O0-signaling pathways such as the NF- « B and stress-activated protein kinase ( SAPK ) pathways ( 16 ) .
The NF- « B pathway activates a number of related transcription factors collectively known as the Rel family , including five mammalian members : NF- « B1 ( p50 ) , NF- « B2 ( p52 ) , c-Rel , RelA ( p65 ) , and ReIB ( 17 ) .
These molecules typically exist as inactive hetero- /homodimers in the cytoplasm complexed with an inhibitory IxB ( inhibitor of NF- « B ) molecule .
Studies with fibroblast cell lines from RelA-deficient mice or cell lines overexpressing a dominant-active IxB- « mutant , with the critical serines at positions 32 and 36 converted to alanine residues , demonstrate that the NF- « B-signaling pathway plays an essential antiapoptotic role and that this function requires protein synthesis ( 18-20 ) .
In an effort to identify genes up-regulated by CD40 signaling , our laboratory discovered , through representational difference analysis screening , that Bfl-1/A1 , an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member , was up-regulated by CD40 activation .
Along with Bcl-x , this represents the second Bel-2 relative known to be up-regulated by CD40 signaling .
Using cell lines overexpressing a super-repressor , dominant-active IxB , it was established that the NF- « B-signaling pathway is essential for CD40-induced up-regulation of both of these antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members as well as for CD4O0-mediated rescue of Fas-induced B cell apoptosis .
Our results also identify a potential NF- « B-binding region within the promoter of the Bcl-x gene , which binds NF-kB subunits and supports NF- « B-mediated transcription , as assessed through reporter gene analysis .
Finally , by using cell lines expressing various levels of exogenous Bcl-x , it was also shown that the levels of Bcl-x induced by CD40 activation are sufficient to protect against Fas-mediated cell death in cells lacking functional NF-KB activity .
Thus , our studies provide a crucial link in CD40-mediated antiapoptosis by linking the activation of the NF- « B-signaling pathway to the up-regulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members .

The CH11 , G28.5 , and anti-FLAG antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology , American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA ) , and Babco ( Richmond , CA ) , respectively .
4-Hydroxytamoxifen ( 4-OHT ) was purchased from Calbiochem .
Plasmid Construction .
The 5'-FLAG-tagged IxB mutant was fused in-frame to the 5 end of the mutant estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain ( ER ) , and the chimera was cloned into the HindIlII/EcoRI sites of pCDNA3 to generate the pCDNA3-IxBm-ER construct .
The pEBB-puro-Bel-x-HA construct was generated by PCR cloning of human Bel-x , which then was inserted into the BamHI and NotI sites of pEBB-puro-HA in-frame with the 3 ' influenza hemagglutinin ( HA ) tag .
For luciferase assays , a 650-bp region of the Bcl-x pro-moter , spanning -640 to +9 relative to the transcriptional start site , was inserted between the Xhol and HindIII sites of the pGL2-Basic luciferase vector ( Promega ) .
The NF-KB mutant promoter had an internal deletion spanning the two potential NF- « B cis elements from -84 to -46 relative to the transcriptional start site .
Cell Culture and Transfection .
Cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin .
For electroporations , cells were pulsed at 250 V/975 uF and then selected and maintained in 1 mg/ml active G418 ( Mediatech , Washington , DC ) or in 2.5 ug/ml puromycin ( Sigma ) .
293T cells were maintained in DMEM ( GIBCO/BRL ) supplemented with 10 % FBS and were transfected by using standard calcium phosphate methods .
Representational Difference Analysis .
Two identical cultures of 20 X 10° Daudi cells at a density of 5 X 10° cells per ml were incubated for 14 hr in the presence or absence of G28.5 at 1 ug/ml .
Poly ( A ) * RNA was extracted from whole cells by using a commercial mRNA isolation kit ( Pharmacia ) , and cDNA was generated by using Superscript reverse transcrip-tase ( GIBCO ) .
Representational difference analysis was performed essentially as described previously ( 21 , 22 ) .
Two rounds of hybridization-PCR amplification were performed , and the products of the second round of subtraction were cloned into pSKII Bluescript ( Stratagene ) for sequencing .
Electrophoretic Mobility-Shift Assays .
For gel-shift assays , cells were treated as indicated in the text .
Nuclear extracts were prepared and used in binding reactions with either a y- `` °P-labeled MHC II NF- « B-specific hairpin oligonucleotide ( 23 ) or with a -labeled annealed sense and antisense oligonucleotide encoding the Bcl-x promoter from -84 to -46 by using previously published protocols ( 24 ) .
The sequence of the sense strand of the Bel-x probe is GGCGGGGGGGACTGC-CCAGGGAGTGACTTTCCGAGGAAG .
For supershifts , 1 pl of the appropriate antibody was added to the nuclear extracts for 20 min on ice before addition of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe .
Laddering Assay .
For DNA laddering , cells were stimulated in 5 ml of medium for 24 hr with the appropriate stimuli before processing the samples by using previously published protocols ( 25 ) .
Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorter ( FACS ) Analysis .
Cells were stained with a hypotonic propidium iodide solution ( 3.4 mM sodium citrate/0.3 % Triton X-100/0.1 mg/ml propidium iodide/20 ug/ml of ribonuclease A ) and used immediately for cell cycle analysis on a FACScan flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson ) .
RESULTS Identification of Bfl-1 as a CD40-Induced Gene in Human B Cells .
CD40 signaling is believed to activate a number of downstream pathways , which lead to the activation of specific transcription factors , including the SAPK/JNK pathway , the p38 kinase pathway , the extracellular signal-regulated kinase Proc .
Natl .

USA 96 ( 1999 ) 9137 ( ERK ) pathway , and the NF- « B pathway .
To identify target effector genes that mediate the complex biological responses of CD40 activation , representational difference analysis was undertaken .
Daudi cells , a human B cell lymphoma line , were either stimulated for 14 hr with the anti-human CD40 antibody , G28.5 , or cultured under identical conditions without stimulation .
Using cDNA isolated from both pools of cells , screening was performed through two rounds of hybridization-PCR amplification , after which the subtracted products representing CD4O0-induced genes were subcloned for sequencing .
Among the genes identified were a number of known CD40-inducible molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and various class II MHC chains .
Through this process , we identified a protein known as Bfl-1/A1/GRS .
Bfl-1 is a member of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis-regulatory proteins , which are expressed in various tissues during development and adult life .
It was reported to be overexpressed in a number of cancer cell lines ( 26 ) and was shown to protect cells from apoptosis and cooperate with the adenoviral E1A protein to transform cells in culture ( 27 ) .
In addition to Bfl-1 , our screen isolated another Bcl-2 family member , Bcl-x , which has been characterized previously as an antiapoptotic molecule induced by CD40 .
To confirm the induction of Bfl-1 in B cells , we probed Northern blots containing RNA from three human B cell lines : Daudi , Ramos , and BJAB ( Fig .
14 ) .
In all three cell lines , there is a dramatic increase in Bfl-1 RNA after 16 hr of CD40 stimulation .
Thus , Bfl-1 expression , like that of Bcl-x , appears to respond strongly to CD40 stimulation in B cells .
Rapid and Transient CD4O0-Mediated Induction of Bfl-1 and Bcl-x Occurs Independently of New Protein Synthesis .
Because the activation of apoptosis occurs rapidly through the processing of preformed components , the induction of antiapoptotic molecules by CD40 also must be rapid to be effective .
We investigated the temporal regulation of Bcl-x and Bfl-1 in CD4O0-stimulated Daudi cells by analyzing RNA samples collected at various time points after stimulation with G28.5 .

- Bcl-x and Bfl-1 are rapidly induced primary response genes .
( 4 ) CD40 inducibility of Bfl-1 was confirmed in three human B cell lines cultured for 16 hr in the presence or absence of G28.5 .
All cells were treated with 1 ug/ml G28.5 at a density of 1 X 10° cells per ml .
Eighteen micrograms of total RNA was loaded per lane , and the Northern blot was hybridized with a human Bfl-1 probe .
The Northern blot was stripped , and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) expression was probed as a standard .
( B ) The kinetics of Bfl-1 and Bcl-x induction in Daudi cells were determined by examining gene expression after various periods of G28.5 stimulation .
To determine the requirement for new protein synthesis in the CD4O0-mediated induction of these genes , cells were pretreated for 30 min with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide ( CHX ) at 25 ug/ml and then stimulated with G28.5 antibody for various periods of time in the presence of CHX .
All cells were treated with 1 ug/ml G28.5 at a density of 1 X 105 cells per ml .
Eighteen micrograms of total RNA was loaded per lane , and the Northern blots were hybridized with a human Bfl-1 or Bcl-x probe .
Northern blots were stripped , and GAPDH expression was probed as a standard .
9138 Cell Biology : Lee et al .
same results were observed by using soluble CD40 ligand as the stimulus ( data not shown ) .
As seen in Fig .
1B , both molecules are induced rapidly by CD40 stimulation , with peak expression levels at 4-8 hr after activation , followed by a decline in the levels of both transcripts at later time points .
At the protein level , however , Bel-x still was induced strongly even at 24 hr ( Fig .
2C ) .
To determine whether or not the induction of these genes requires the synthesis of intermediate factors , we stimulated Daudi cells for different time periods in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide ( CHX ) .
Northern blot analysis of the products of these cells revealed that both Bcl-x and Bfl-1 transcripts continue to be synthesized in the absence of new protein synthesis ( Fig .
1B ) ; however , the use of CHX affects the expression of these two genes in different ways .
Although the magnitude of induction of Bcl-x remains the same , the response of Bfl-1 to CD40 stimulation is blunted , suggesting that full induction of Bfl-1 requires the participation of transcription factors whose activity is sensitive to protein synthesis inhibition .
These results suggest that the regulatory mechanisms of these two genes are not identical , but they have in common a rapid and transient induction phase that is not abolished by protein synthesis inhibition .
Establishing NF-B-Blocked Daudi and Ramos Stable Cell Lines .
In addition to our data showing the up-regulation of Bfl-1 and Bcl-x by CD40 signaling , Bfl-1 also has been shown to be induced by various stimuli such as TNF-a , lipopolysac-charide , granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor , and IL-1 , whereas Bcl-x has been shown to be up-regulated by CD40 and sIgM signaling ( 11 , 28-30 ) .
All of these stimuli share the common feature of signaling through NF-kB .

- Cells expressing IxB-ER have a functional block in NF- « B signaling and do not up-regulate Bcl-x and Bfl-1 in response to CD40 activation .

Six micrograms of nuclear extracts then were used in binding assays with the radiolabeled MHC II oligonucleotide .
Cells induced with 4-OHT were pretreated with 200 nM of the synthetic estrogen for 3 hr before G28.5-mediated activation .

USA 96 ( 1999 ) the established link between NF- « B signaling and the regulation of apoptosis , we sought to determine the role of NF-KB signaling in CD40-mediated up-regulation of both Bel-2 family members .
To determine this role , we established human B cell lines with a functional block in the NF- « B-signaling pathway .
The strategy involved the overexpression of a chimeric fusion protein consisting of a dominant-active IxB- « mutant ( with serine-to-alanine mutations at positions 32 and 36 ) fused to a mutated estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain ( ER ) ( 31 ) .
The IxB mutant is incapable of being phosphorylated at the critical serine residues and , therefore , is not targeted for proteosomal degradation upon activation of the IxB kinase complex .
The fused ER confers inducible activation of the gene of interest upon exposure to the synthetic estrogen 4-OHT .
The FLAG-I « B-mutant-ER construct was cloned into the pCDNA3 expression vector and stably transfected into Daudi and Ramos cells .
Single clones were isolated , and those that expressed the construct by Western analysis ( data not shown ) were chosen for further characterization by electrophoretic mobility-shift assay .
To determine whether the IxB-ER construct was functioning to block NF- « B signaling , nuclear extracts from cells either untreated or treated with the human CDA4O-activating G28.5 antibody were assessed for binding activity to a radiolabeled MHC II NF-kB oligonucleotide probe ( H2 probe ) through electrophoretic mobility-shift assay .
As shown in Fig .
24 , nuclear extracts from parental Ramos and Daudi cells treated with the G28.5 antibody were capable of generating gel-shift complexes representing inducible NF- « B activity .
These gel-shift complexes formed just as strongly in the presence of 4-OHT ( data not shown ) , indicating that the drug did not interfere with NF- « B signaling .
In stable Daudi and Ramos clones expressing the IxB-ER construct , however , CD40-mediated NF- « B induction was completely abolished in the presence of 4-0OHT .
These cell lines also had significantly decreased NF-KB induction in the absence 4-OHT , indicating some leakage in the system .
Because 4-OHT treatment produced maximal suppression of NF-KB activity , all subsequent experiments were performed in the presence of 4-OHT .
The NF-xB Pathway Is Essential for CD40-Mediated Bcl-x and Bfl-1 Induction .
Using the NF- « B-blocked cell lines described above , we examined CD40 regulation of both Bel-x and Bfl-1 through Northern blot analysis .
In the presence of 4-OHT , parental Daudi and Ramos cells , as well as Daudi-IxB-ER and Ramos-IxB-ER cells , were left unstimulated or treated with the G28.5 antibody for 8 hr .
As seen in Fig .
2B , induction of both genes in response to CD40 treatment was abolished in -treated Daudi-IkxB-ER and Ramos-IxB-ER cells but not in parental Daudi and Ramos cells , suggesting that these cells require NF- « B signaling to induce both of these genes .
Expression of Bel-x also was examined at the protein level in the same cell lines stimulated through CD40 in the presence of 4-OHT for different time periods .
In agreement with the above results , Western blot analysis showed that Bcl-x expression could not be induced by CD40 in the NF- « B-blocked cell lines ( Fig .
2C ) .
We also observed that although the induction of Bcl-x , both at the RNA and protein levels , was completely abolished in IxB-ER cells , its basal expression was not af-fected .
This suggests that other transcription factors may be able to substitute for NF- « B in the baseline expression of this gene or that there is enough leak-through NF-KB activity , even in the presence of 4-O0HT , to enable low-level Bel-x expression .
An Consensus Sequence in the Bcl-x Promoter Binds NF-B Complexes and Supports Transcriptional Activity .
The Northern and Western blot analyses with the stable cell lines strongly support the role of NF-kB signaling in CD40-mediated up-regulation of Bfl-1 and Bcl-x .
In agreement with these results , visual inspection of the human Bel-x promoter Cell Biology : Lee et al .
identified two tandem , potential NF- « B-binding sites , one starting at position -77 relative to the transcriptional start site , with the sequence GGGACTGCCC , and the other starting at position -62 , with the sequence GTGACTTTCC .
A radiolabeled oligonucleotide spanning the two potential NF- « B-binding sites was used with nuclear extracts from unstimulated and G28.5-stimulated Daudi cells to assess binding by electrophoretic mobility-shift assay .
As shown in Fig .
34 , nuclear extracts from parental Daudi cells stimulated with the G28.5 antibody were capable of generating several band shifts , probably corresponding to the different NF- « B dimer complexes bound to the probe ; however , extracts from stable cell lines expressing the I « kB-ER construct did not produce an inducible shift , indicating that NF- « B activity is necessary to bind to the Bcl-x NF- « B probe upon CD40 activation .
Super-shifted bands were detected with the anti-p50 , anti-p65 , and anti-c-Rel antibodies , but only weakly , if at all , with the other anti-Rel antibodies , indicating that the gel-shift complexes consisted predominantly of p50 , p65 , and c-Rel .
Further gel-shift analysis indicated stronger NF-kB binding to the upstream site spanning positions -77 to -68 than to the downstream site ( data not shown ) .
Luciferase reporter assays also were performed to assess the ability of Rel family members to drive transcription from the Bcl-x promoter .
A 650-bp DNA fragment spanning the Bcl-x 5-prime promoter region was inserted into the pGL2-Basic luciferase vector ( Bel-x WT ) .
Another reporter with an internal deletion spanning the potential NF- « B-binding region ( Bcl-x « B- ) also was created .
293T cells were transfected with the indicated reporters ( Fig .
3B ) and p6S5-expressing DNA vector or control vector DNA .

Rel members are capable of mediating transcriptional activation through the Bcl-x promoter by binding to NF-kB cis elements .
( 4 ) The NF- « B complex binding to the putative NF- « B-binding sites within the Bcl-x promoter consists predominantly of p50 , p65 , and c-Rel .
Nuclear extract harvests and binding reactions were performed as described previously .
Supershifts were performed by the addition of the appropriate antibody to the nuclear extracts on ice 20 min before the binding reaction .
( B ) p65 is capable of mediating transcriptional activation through the Bcl-x promoter .
A Bcl-x promoter fragment spanning -640 to +9 relative to the transcriptional start site ( Bcl-x WT promoter ) and another fragment missing the NF- « B-binding sequence ( Bcl-x « B- promoter ) were cloned into the pGL2-Basic luciferase reporter vector .
293T cells were transfected with 100 ng of the indicated reporter plasmids and either 2 ug of p65 /RelA expression vector or 2 ug of pBABE-puro control vector as carrier .
Samples were harvested 36 hr after transfection and assessed for luciferase activity .

These experiments suggest that Rel members are capable of directly activating transcription from the Bel-x promoter .
Activity Is Required for Protection of B Cells from Fas-Mediated Apoptosis .
To study the role of NF-KB signaling in CD4O0-mediated rescue from cell death , we investigated whether the NF- « B pathway was crucial for CD4O0-mediated inhibition of Fas-activated cell death .
Parental Ramos cells , as well as the IxB-ER stable cell line , were either left untreated , treated with the G28.5 antibody , treated with the human Fas-activating antibody , CH11 , or treated with both G28.5 and CH11 .
After incubation for 24 hr , the samples were harvested and processed for apoptotic markers , including oligonucleo-somal DNA laddering ( Fig .
44 ) and analysis of fraction by propidium iodide staining and FACScan cell cycle analysis ( Fig .
4B ) .
Wild-type Ramos cells treated with the CH11 antibody display the characteristic laddering profile of apoptotic cells and also had a high fraction ( 15.3 % ) .
This profile is inhibited upon CD40 activation , which reduces the sub-G4 fraction to 1.9 % and decreases the amount of DNA laddering .
In the Ramos IkB-ER cells , the laddering and the increased sub-G ; fraction is still observed upon treatment with the CH11 antibody , but cotreatment with the G28.5 antibody does not inhibit the laddering process or decrease the sub-G1 fraction , indicating that cell death is not rescued by CD40 activation in the I « kB-ER cells .
Daudi cells were not sensitive to Fas-mediated killing ( data not shown ) and , thus , were not used to assess CD4O0-mediated inhibition of this process .
These results show that in Ramos cells , the CD4O0-mediated inhibition of Fas-activated cell death requires signaling through the NF- « B-signaling pathway .
Expression of Bcl-x at Physiologically Induced Levels Is Capable of Protecting Against Fas-Mediated Cell Death in the Absence of NF-xB Activity .
As shown in the previous sections , CD40-mediated rescue of Fas-induced apoptosis proceeds through an NF- « B-dependent pathway that may involve the up-regulation of Bel-x and Bfl-1 .
To determine the contribution of Bel-x to CD40-mediated antiapoptosis , we introduced exogenous HA-tagged Bel-x into the Ramos I « B-ER cells and A 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 $ Cell Line G28.5 CH11 B as | = = Percentage Sub-G1 a o i 102 3 4 § 06 70 % Fig .

Cells were harvested , and DNA fragmentation ( 4 ) and the sub-G fraction ( B ) were assayed as described in Materials and Methods .
9140 Cell Biology : Lee et al .
then determined the sensitivity of individual clones to Fas-mediated cell death .
The HA-tagged Bel-x protein migrates slightly slower than the endogenous Bcl-x , allowing for comparative analysis of expression levels in the isolated clones ( Fig .
54 ) .
Ramos IxB-ER-Bel-x clone A expresses exogenous Bcl-x at levels similar to those seen in parental Ramos cells after 8-16 hr of CD40 stimulation .
Ramos I « B-ER-Bcl-x clone B , however , expresses exogenous Bel-x at relatively lower levels .
To determine the protection afforded by Bcl-x against Fas-mediated death , parental Ramos cells , Ramos IxB-ER cells , and the two Bel-x-expressing IxB-ER cell lines were stimulated with the human Fas-activating CH11 antibody for 24 hr , and cell death was assessed by DNA laddering and propidium iodide staining .
As shown in Fig .
5 B and C , apoptosis was induced in both the parental Ramos and Ramos IxB-ER cell lines after treatment with the CH11 antibody .
Ramos IxB-ER-Bcel-x clone A , which expresses exogenous Bcl-x near physiologically induced levels , is resistant to Fas-mediated cell death , whereas the lower-expressing Ramos IxB-ER-Bcl-x clone B was still sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis .
Other clones , which expressed exogenous Bcl-x at levels between those seen in clones A and B , likewise were protected at intermediary levels ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that the levels of Bcl-x that are induced by CD40 activation are sufficient for mediating its antiapoptotic effects against Fas activation .

Expression of exogenous Bcl-x protects against Fas-mediated cell death .
( 4 ) Ramos IxB-ER cells were transfected by electroporation with a pEBB-puro-Bcl-x-HA construct , and stable clones were isolated by limiting dilution plating and selection with puromycin .
Expression of exogenous Bcl-x then was assessed by Western analysis and compared with the levels of endogenous Bcl-x that are up-regulated in response to CD40 activation by the G28.5 antibody .
( B ) DNA fragmentation was assessed in parental Ramos , Ramos IxB-ER , and Ramos IxB-ER-Bcl-x clones A and B after being untreated or treated for 24 hr with CH11 .
( C ) The sub-G fraction was assessed by FACScan analysis after propidium iodide staining in Ramos cells , Ramos IxB-ER cells , and Ramos IxB-ER-Bel-x clones A and B after being untreated or treated for 24 hr with the CH11 antibody .

USA 96 ( 1999 ) DISCUSSION In addition to their roles in inflammation and immunity ( 17 ) , members of the Rel family of transcription factors also are believed to play important roles in preventing programmed cell death .
Enhanced cytotoxicity in response to TNF treatment has been observed in RelA~'~ fibroblasts and macrophages , as well as in a variety of cells , including fibroblasts , fibrosarcoma cells , and lymphoma cells , in which NF- « B signaling or protein synthesis has been blocked specifically through the overexpression of dominant-negative pathway components or through the use of cycloheximide ( 18-20 ) .
Taken together , these results would indicate that NF- « B may prevent cell death through the up-regulation of specific gene products , whereas apoptosis can proceed in the absence of new protein synthesis through the activation of the preformed caspase cascade .
Indeed , the rapid induction kinetics characteristic of the NF- « B family are most likely crucial to its ability to compete with the transcription-independent apoptosis pathway .
A large number of genes , including many inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules , are regulated by NF-KB ( 32 ) , but the mediators of this pathway 's antiapoptotic effect have remained a mystery until the recent identification of a few candidate molecules , including the antiapoptotic inhibitor of apoptosis molecules 1 and 2 ( c-IAP 1 and 2 ) , TRAFs 1 and 2 , IEX-1L , and A20 ( 33-36 ) .
Although members of the IAP family recently have been suggested to act as direct inhibitors of caspases , their mechanisms of action-and certainly those of the TRAFs , A20 and IEX-1L-are not yet clearly under-stood .
Here we report the identification of two antiapoptotic members of the Bel-2 family as targets of NF-KB signaling .
We find Bfl-1 to be induced by CD40 signaling in multiple B cell lines ( Fig .
14 ) .
In addition , Bcl-x has been well characterized as a CD40-responsive inhibitor of apoptosis in B cells ( 11-13 ) .
Both Bcl-x and Bfl-1 are induced rapidly by CD40 activation ( Fig .
1B ) via an NF- « B-dependent signaling pathway ( Fig .
2B ) .
We also have identified an NF- « B consensus sequence in the promoter of Bel-x , and an inducible nuclear complex that is recognized by antibodies against p50/NF- « B1 , c-Rel , and p65/RelA was shown to bind this sequence in stimulated control cells but not in -treated , IxB-ER-expressing cells ( Fig .
34 ) .
In addition , a luciferase reporter construct driven by the Bcl-x upstream promoter region responded strongly to p65 expression ; however , this response was inhibited by the removal of the putative NF- « B-binding sequence from the promoter ( Fig .
3B ) .
Thus , we have demonstrated that the Bcl-x promoter contains an element that binds NF-KB transcription factors and supports transcriptional activation by a member of this family .
CD40 signaling increases NF-KB activity and is known to play instrumental roles in the activation , proliferation , and differentiation of B cells ( 3 , 37 ) .
Activated proliferating germinal center B cells undergo a process of somatic hypermu-tation of Ig variable regions followed by antigen-driven selection of high-affinity clones as they migrate to the periphery of the germinal center .
Low-affinity clones , as well as those that acquire self-reactivity through the mutation process , are believed to be removed through apoptosis .
CD40 stimulation is able to rescue germinal center B cells from programmed cell death ( 7 ) .
Cross-linking of Fas leads to B cell death , and CD40 signaling can protect against this ( 9 ) .
Interestingly , CD40 also has been reported to up-regulate Fas expression in mature B cells and , thus , actually sensitize them to Fas-mediated killing under some conditions ( 38 ) .
Thus , CD40 activation intensifies the death signal of Fas by increasing Fas expression while , at the same time , protecting against this effect through the induction of Bel-x above basal levels and possibly through the expression of additional antiapoptotic molecules such as Bfl-1 .
This protective effect of CD40 alone , however , is transient in Cell Biology : Lee et al .
nature , and prolonged activation of Fas can overcome it , unless other stimuli , such as sIgM stimulation through high-affinity antigen binding , are also present ( 39 ) .
This is consistent with our data demonstrating the transient induction of Bel-x and Bfl-1 at the RNA level ( Fig .
1B ) .
We demonstrate that a blockade of the NF- « B pathway , which leads to a loss of Bel-x and Bfl-1 induction ( Fig .
2B ) , abolishes the protective effect of CD40 against Fas-mediated apoptosis in Ramos B cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
When Bcl-x is reintroduced into NF- « B-blocked cells , they are protected against the apoptotic effects of Fas ligation ( Fig .
5 ) .
The level of ectopic Bel-x protein required for this protective effect is roughly equivalent to the levels of endogenous Bcl-x induced by CD40 treatment in cells with intact NF-KB signaling .
Together with the data discussed above , these results suggest that NF- « B-mediated induction of Bel-x expression is sufficient for the ability of CD40 to protect B cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis .
The ability of NF- « B to induce antiapoptotic proteins is consistent with its cytoprotective nature .
Interestingly , the level of Bcl-x expression capable of protecting against Fas-mediated killing represents an induction of only a few fold above baseline , emphasizing the quantitatively fine nature of this balance .
Because the NF- « B pathway must act rapidly to counteract the amplification of the apoptosis signal , it may be important that quantitatively minor changes in protein expression level be sufficient to achieve this end .
Finally , although physiological levels of Bel-x alone are sufficient to protect against apoptosis , the fact that Bfl-1 also is induced strongly by CD40 suggests that this protein also may play a role in protecting B cells .
Because the response of NF-kB against apoptosis must be rapid , leaving little room for error , the induction of two Bcl-2 family members where one is sufficient may represent a precautionary reserve of antiapoptotic activity .
