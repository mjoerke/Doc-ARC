D. W. ] Abstract Tumor cell lines with a defective retinoblastoma gene are unable to transcribe the HLA class II genes in response to IFN-y treatment , and reconstitution of functional Rb rescues IFN-y-induced class II gene expression .
However , the molecular mechanism of Rb rescue of the class II genes is unknown .
We have examined the effect of Rb expression on the activation of the promoter for HLA-DRA , the prototype class II gene .
Oct-1 , a POU domain transcription factor , was identified as a repressor of HLA-DRA promoter activity in the Rb-defective cells .
Rb expression led to phosphorylation of Oct-1 , thus relieving its repressive effect .
Oct-1 has also been shown to repress interleukin 8 promoter activity .
Consistent with reduced levels of Oct-1 DNA binding activity in the Rb-transformed cell lines , interleukin 8 expression is higher in these cell lines .
Introduction Rb° , a well-studied tumor suppressor , is required for regulating cell proliferation and differentiation ( 1 , 2 ) .
Inactivation of the Rb gene due to deletions or mutations has been found in a variety of human tumors , including retinoblastoma , os-teosarcoma , and lung , bladder , and prostate carcinomas ( 3 ) .
Reconstituting functional Rb in some of these tumor cell lines leads to potentially contradictory results .
The retinoblastoma cell line Weri-27 and the osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2 have significantly reduced tumor formation capacities after transient transfection of an Rb expression vector and injection Received 4/2/99 ; revised 5/14/99 ; accepted 5/18/99 .

into nude mice ( 4 , 5 ) .
Tumorigenicity is also partially suppressed by stable expression of Rb in the Rb-defective bladder carcinoma cell line 5637 , the Weri-27 cell line , and the Saos-2 cell line ( 6 ) .
In some of these studies , Rb expression in the Rb-defective tumor cell lines had no effect on the growth rate or morphology of the in vitro cultured tumor cells ( 6 , 7 ) .
Discrepancies between the growth characteristics of the Rb-transformed cells in vitro and the effectiveness of Rb expression in eliminating tumor growth in vivo may reflect a host 's defense mechanism cooperating with Rb in the prevention of tumorigenesis .
Whereas an extensive body of work on Rb has focused on its growth suppression function , there is emerging evidence indicating that Rb plays a role in the modulation of the immune functions of tumor cells ( 8-13 , 17 ) .
The aberrant production of IL-6 by neoplastic cells is regarded as a strong contributory factor in the growth of a variety of malignancies , especially multiple myeloma , leukemia , and lymphomas ( 11 , 12 ) .
A survey of the Rb status in the cells representing acute myeloblastic leukemia indicated that Rb defects in the acute myeloblastic leukemia blast cells closely correlate with the increased IL-6 mRNA expression in these cells .
Also , a reduction of Rb expression with antisense oligonucleotide in the normal blast cells induces IL-6 mRNA expression , and overexpression of Rb represses an IL-6 promoter reporter construct ( 8 , 13 ) .
The HLA class II genes encode heterodimeric cell surface proteins that present antigens to CD4+ T helper cells .
The interaction between the HLA class II molecules on tumor cells and the T-cell receptors may help the host 's immune system to recognize tumor cell antigens and to mount an immune response against tumor cells ( 14 , 15 ) .
Studies from our laboratory have established that Rb is required for the IFN-y inducibility of HLA class II expression in tumor cell lines .
Tumor cell lines defective for Rb expression express little or no HLA class II after IFN-y treatment ; however , HLA class II inducibility can be restored by exogenous expression of Rb ( 9 , 10 , 17 ) .
In this study , we used a combination of EMSAs and transfection experiments to examine the effect of Rb expression on the HLA-DRA promoter .
Oct-1 , a ubiquitously expressed POU domain transcription factor , was determined to play a role in the effect of Rb expression on the activity of the promoter of the HLA-DRA gene , which encodes the heavy chain of the HLA class II DR molecule .
This work also led to the conclusion that Rb enhances IL-8 expression by an Oct-1-related mechanism .
Results Oct-1 Binding Activity to the HLA-DRA Promoter Is Reduced in Rb-transformed Cell Lines .
To elucidate the mechanism of Rb rescue of HLA-DRA inducibility , we compared HLA-DRA promoter protein DNA binding activities in 458 - Rb Regulation of Oct-1 and IL-8 Table 1 - Cell lines used in this study Cell lines ( refs . )

Nuclear extracts were obtained from 5637 cells and its subclones , as well as MDA-468-54 ( S4 ) and its Rb-transformed subclone S4-MTRb-1 .
Equal amounts of these extracts were analyzed by EMSA , and the oligonucleotide probes used in the experiment included the previously characterized HLA-DRA promoter X , Y , and octamer box elements ( 18 ) .
Oct-1 binding activity was markedly reduced in the Rb-transformed subclones compared to the Rb-defective control subclones ( Fig .
1A , compare Lane 2 with Lane 1 and Lane 4 with Lane 3 ) .
Protein binding to the HLA-DRA Y box is shown in Fig .
1B .
The identity of Oct-1 was verified by anti-Oct-1 antibody supershift ( Fig .
14 , Lanes 6-8 ) and by binding competition with unlabeled wild-type or mutated octamer element ( Fig .
1A , Lanes 9-12 ) .
Nonspecific binding to the octamer element was completely eliminated by an excess of both wild-type and mutated octamer oligonucleotides ( Fig .
1A , lower bands ) .
Because the HLA-DRA promoter is activated by IFN-y treatment , we examined whether the difference in Oct-1 binding in the Rb-defective versus the Rb-transformed cells is maintained in the presence of IFN-y .
EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts from IFN-y-treated and untreated 5637 cells and its subclones , 1A¥4 and 12-27 ( Table 1 ) .
The result indicated that IFN-y treatment caused a slight decrease in the Oct-1 DNA binding activity in the Rb-defective 5637 subclone 1A4 as well as in the Rb-transformed subclone 12-27 ( Fig .
1C , compare Lanes 1-3 with Lanes 4-6 ) .
However , the difference in Oct-1 binding between the Rb-defective and Rb-transformed cells remained unchanged in the presence of IFN-y .
IFN-y-treated Rb-defective cells retained a higher Oct-1 binding activity than their Rb-transformed counterparts .
The Repressive Effect of Oct-1 on HLA-DRA Promoter Activity Is Relieved by Rb Expression .
To determine whether the difference in the Oct-1 DNA binding activities could have an effect on HLA-DRA promoter activity , we devised a strategy to assess the impact of endogenous Oct-1 DNA binding activity on an HLA-DRA promoter reporter construct .
We generated two promoter reporter constructs by subcloning the -176 to +45 region of the HLA-DRA promoter ( 19 ) into pGL3 luciferase vector .
One construct has the wild-type octamer element of the HLA-DRA promoter ( pDRAlucWT ) , and the other construct contains the mutant octamer element generated by substituting four nucleotides within the octamer box ( pDRAlucOCTmut ; `` Materials and Methods `` ) .
The octamer element has been shown to have a repressive effect on HLA-DRA promoter activity , and the nucleotide substitutions eliminate this repressive effect ( 19 ) .
These substitutions also represent the mutated octamer sequence used in the EMSA described above ( Fig .
1A ) .
We reasoned that if the higher level of Oct-1 DNA binding activity in the Rb-defective cells affected HLA-DRA promoter activity , then the mutations in the octamer element would have a greater effect in the Rb-defective cells than in the Rb-transformed cells .
That is , if the endogenous Oct-1 differences between the two cell types could affect promoter activity , then the mutations in the octamer box should lead to a greater relief of repression in the Rb-defective cells .
The wild-type and mutant constructs were transiently transfected into the Rb-defective 5637 cells and the Rb-transformed subclone 12-27 .
Transfected cells were treated with IFN-y , and the cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity by scintillation counting .
In the Rb-defective 5637 cells , the activity of the HLA-DRA promoter with the mutated octamer box was increased by 1.7-fold compared with that of the wild-type promoter ( Fig .
2 ) , consistent with the original data indicating that Oct-1 is a negative regulator of HLA-DRA promoter ( 19 , 20 ) .
However , in the Rb-transformed 12-27 cells , there was no significant difference in promoter activity between the wild-type and mutant promoter constructs ( Fig .
2 ) , consistent with reduced Oct-1 binding in this Rb-transformed cell line .
Increased IL-8 Secretion in Rb-transformed Cells .
Oct-1 is a transcriptional repressor for the human IL-8 gene promoter ( 21 ) .
We wanted to determine whether Rb expression also relieves the repressive effect of Oct-1 on the IL-8 promoter .
First , we tested whether reconstitution of Rb in the Rb-defective 5637 cells affects the amount of IL-8 secretion .
Culture media was collected 24 h after cell plating and analyzed by ELISA for IL-8 , which revealed that IL-8 was secreted by the Rb-defective and Rb-transformed 5637 cells , and that the secretion of IL-8 was increased in the Rb-transformed subclones ( Fig .
3 ) .
After 24 h of culture , the amount of IL-8 secretion from the Rb-transformed subclone 12-27 is 1.6-fold higher than that for 144 cells , which were paired with 12-27 cells as the Rb-defective control for this experiment .
The amount of IL-8 secretion from the Rb-transformed cell line 10-1 was 5.3-fold higher than that of the Rb-defective 1¥1 subclones , paired with 10-1 as a control in a separate experiment .
The Repressive Effect of Oct-1 on IL-8 Promoter Activity Is Relieved by Rb Expression .
Next , we wanted to determine whether increased IL-8 secretion by the Rb-transformed cells could be attributed to a lower level of Oct-1 DNA binding activity in these cells .
We first used a strategy similar to the strategy used in the analysis of the effect of the Rb-related Oct-1 differences on the HLA-DRA promoter , as described above .
As described above , this strategy was designed to determine the effect of the differences in the endogenous levels of Oct-1 DNA binding activity on IL-8 promoter activity .
IL-8 promoter luciferase constructs containing a wild-type or mutated octamer element ( 21 ) were transfected into the Rb-defective and Rb-transformed 5637 cells , and cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity .

Reduced Oct-1 binding to the HLA-DRA promoter octamer element using extracts from Rb-transformed cells .
Equal amounts ( 5 ug ) of nuclear extracts from the Rb-defective and Rb-transformed cells ( Table 1 ) were analyzed by EMSA .
A 26-bp synthetic oligonucleotide including the HLA-DRA promoter octamer element was used as a probe .
A , cells lines are as indicated ( Table 1 ; Lanes 1-4 ) .
The identity of the Oct-1-DNA complex was verified by antibody supershift ( Lanes 6-8 ) and binding competition using an excess of unlabeled wild-type and octamer-mutated oligonucleotides ( Lanes 9-72 ) using nuclear extract from the 14 cells .
B , DNA-protein complexes formed using extracts from 1A4 and 12-27 cells and the HLA-DRA Y box as probe are shown in the top panel .
Oct-1 DNA binding activity for the same extracts is shown in the bottom panel .
C , cells were either left untreated ( Lanes 1-3 ; 5637 , 1A4 , and 12-27 , respectively ) or treated with 400 units/ml IFN-y ( Lanes 4-6 ; 5637 , 1¥4 , and 12-27 , respectively ) .

4 ) .
Northern blotting was performed to be certain that the increased level of IL-8 secretion by the Rb-transformed cells reflected an increase in IL-8 mRNA levels .
The mRNA bands were quantified and normalized to 28S rRNA .
Setting the ratio of IL-8 mRNA:28S rRNA in parental 5637 cells as 1 , we observed relative ratios of 1.73 and 4.23 in the Rb-defective 1A4 subclone and the Rb-transformed 12-27 subclone , respectively ( Table 2 ) .
Oct-1 Binding to the IL-8 Promoter Octamer Element Is Reduced in Rb-transformed Cells .
As indicated above , Oct-1 binding to the HLA-DRA promoter octamer element is reduced in Rb-transformed cells .
One report ( 22 ) has indicated that different kinase activities leading to Oct-1 phosphorylation might differentially affect the binding of Oct-1 to different octamer elements .
To verify that Oct-1/IL-8 octamer box binding was similarly reduced in the Rb-transformed cells , an EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts from the parental 5637 cell line and its subclones 144 and 12-27 ( Table 1 ) .

Culture Media from the Rb-transformed Cells Enhances Neutrophil Migration .
IL-8 is a potent chemotactic factor for neutrophils and lymphocytes .
It may also be involved in the angiogenesis and metastasis of some tumors ( 23 , 24 ) .
To assess a possible functional significance of the differences in IL-8 secretion among the 5637 subclones , we used a microwell chemotaxis chamber assay .
In this experiment , the chemotactic agent ( f.e .

Migrated neutrophils on the filter were microscopically evaluated and counted ( Fig .

The number of migrated neutrophils was increased by culture media from the Rb-transformed 12-27 cells ( Fig .

Table 3 shows the neutrophil migration rates from two independent experiments .
In one experiment , a 1:1 dilution of the Rb-transformed 12-27 culture media led to a migration rate of 30 % versus 2 % for a 1:1 dilution of the Rb-defective 144 culture media .
Additional experiments indicated similar differences in the migration rates generated by culture media from Rb-transformed versus Rb-defective cell lines .
Hyperphosphorylation of Oct-1 in Rb-transformed Tumor Cells .
To elucidate the mechanism of reduced Oct-1 binding to the HLA-DRA and IL-8 octamer elements ( Figs .
1A and 5 ) , we performed Western blotting to evaluate Oct-1 protein levels in the nuclear extracts from both the Rb-defective and Rb-transformed 5637 subclones .
Equivalent amounts of Oct-1 were detected in the Rb-defective 1A4 and 1A1 subclones and the Rb-transformed 12-27 and 10-1 subclones ( Fig .
74 ) , excluding the possibility that differences in Oct-1 protein levels accounted for promoter binding differences in these cells .

Oct-1 binding to the IL-8 promoter octamer element .
EMSA was performed as described in the legend to Fig .
1 , and the probe used in this experiment is a 20-bp synthetic oligonucleotide including the IL-8 promoter octamer element .
Oct-1 DNA binding activity can be detected in extracts from the Rb-defective parental 5637 cell line and the 1¥4 subclone ( Lanes 2 and 3 ) , and Oct-1 DNA binding activity is nearly absent in extracts from the Rb-transformed 12-27 cells ( Lane 4 ) .
The Oct-1-DNA complex was verified by binding competition ( Lanes 5 and 6 ) and antibody supershift ( Lanes 7 and 8 ) .
The large complex below Oct-1 binds both the octamer element and the mutated octamer element , indicating that this complex is nonspecific .
However , the complex is apparently disrupted by the anti-Oct-1 antibody , for unknown reasons .
Because phosphorylation of Oct-1 reduces its DNA binding activity ( 22 , 25 ) , we analyzed the phosphorylation state of Oct-1 in the 5637 subclones .
Cultured cells were metabolically labeled by [ °PJorthophosphate , Oct-1 was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts by anti-Oct-1 monoclonal antibody , and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography ( `` Materials and Methods `` ) .
Results revealed that Oct-1 was phosphorylated in both the Rb-defective and Rb-transformed 5637 subclones ( Fig .
7B , top panel ) , but that phosphorylation of Oct-1 was increased in the Rb-transformed 12-27 subclone at 24 h and 48 h after plating of the cells .
This same gel was then transferred and blotted with anti-Oct-1 antibody ( Fig .
7B , bottom panel ) to determine the total amount of Oct-1 .
Oct-1 phosphorylation levels in the Rb-defective and Rb-transformed 5637 subclones were quantified and normalized to total Oct-1 as detected by the Western analysis ( `` Materials and Methods `` ) .
Setting the Oct-1 phosphorylation levels ( phosphorylated Oct-1 : total Oct-1 ) in the Rb-defective 1A4 subclone at 24 h after plating as 1 , we obtained a relative level of 1.7 in the Rb-transformed 12-27 subclone cultured during the same time period .
The differences in Oct-1 phosphorylation between the 1¥4 and 12-27 cells remained constant at 48 h after plating ( Table 4 ) .
Discussion Relief of Oct-1-mediated Repression by Rb .
The ubiquitously expressed transcription factor Oct-1 functions as either a positive or a negative regulator of a wide range of cellular genes , including genes for snRNA ( 26 ) , H2B ( 27 ) , immunoglobulin ( 28 ) , CD11 ( 29 ) , CD20 ( 30 ) , IL-2 , and IL-4 ( 31 ) .
The regulation of these genes is dependent on Oct-1 interaction with the octamer motifs ( ATTTGCAT or its vari-ants ) present in the promoters or enhancers ( 27 , 28 , 32 ) .
The genes regulated by Oct-1 encode products participating in a variety of cellular processes , ranging from housekeeping to cell growth and differentiation ( 27 , 28 , 32 ) .
As discussed above , IFN-y treatment of Rb-defective cells does not lead to HLA class II gene transcription or leads to only a very low level of transcription .
Rb expression rescues HLA class II inducibility ( 9 , 10 , 17 ) .
Data described in this report indicate that the repressive effect of Oct-1 on the HLA-DRA promoter is alleviated by reconstitution of functional Rb ( Figs .
1 and 2 ) .
However , relief of Oct-1-mediated repression is unlikely to represent an explanation for the entire effect of Rb on the HLA class II genes because HLA-DRB , which encodes the other polypeptide of the HLA-DR molecule , does not have an octamer site in its promoter .
Also , no octamer sites have been described for the HLA-DP genes , the induction of which is also dependent on Rb .
However , it is interesting to note that the HLA-DRA gene seems more heavily dependent on Rb than do other HLA class II genes ( 9 ) , suggesting the possibility that Oct-1-mediated repression and a second Rb-related mechanism simultaneously regulate HLA-DRA induction .
Oct-1 is also a transcriptional repressor of the IL-8 promoter , in which a variant of the octamer element overlaps a CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein binding site ( 21 ) .
As with the HLA-DRA promoter , the repressive effect of Oct-1 on the IL-8 promoter is relieved by expression of Rb ( Fig .
4 ) , with the expected consequence of higher levels of IL-8 production by Rb-transformed cells .
This is the first report that the IL-8 gene expression is regulated by Rb .
Phosphorylation of Oct-1 by Rb Expression .
The Western blotting and immunoprecipitation analyses of Oct-1 ( Fig .
7 ) revealed that Oct-1 is hyperphosphorylated in Rb-transformed cells , which explains the reduced Oct-1 binding to the HLA-DRA and IL-8 promoters ( Figs .
1 and 5 ) .
Other than Rb expression , only one process has been reported to alter Oct-1 DNA binding activity or phosphorylation : mitosis ( 25 , 33 ) .
In mitosis , Oct-1 becomes highly phosphorylated , with a concomitant loss of DNA binding activity ( 25 ) .
Although phosphorylation of Oct-1 by either protein kinase A or protein kinase C ( 22 ) in vitro reduces its binding to the octamer element , the Oct-1 kinase ( s ) that functions in vivo is unknown ( 33 ) .
Oct-1 and Growth Control .
Oct-1 is a transactivator involved in the cell cycle regulation of H2B gene transcription and in the activation of the snRNA genes , which are presumably important for rapid cell division .
Re-expression of Rb in the Rb-defective tumor cells probably leads to reduced Oct-1 binding to the H2B and snRNA promoters , facilitating Rb-mediated G , growth arrest .
If so , this would be the first E2F-independent link between Rb and growth control .
However , this proposal is not supported by the conclusion that the vast majority of H2B gene regulation occurs at the level of H2B mRNA stability , not at the level of transcription ( 34 ) .
Thus , Oct-1 is thought to effect only a minor increase in H2B promoter activity .
However , it is not known whether Oct-1 is required for basal level H2B or snRNA transcription .

Enhanced neutrophil migration in response to culture media from Rb-transformed cells .
Neutrophil migration was evaluated by the microwell chemotaxis chamber assay ( `` Materials and Methods `` ) .
Photomicrographs ( magnification , X40 ) show representative fields of the migrated neutrophils in response to ( 4 ) RPMI 1640 with 10 % FCS ( negative control ) , ( B ) 100 ng/ml recombinant human IL-8 ( positive control ) , ( C ) culture media from the Rb-defective 1A4 subclone , or ( D ) culture media from the Rb-transformed 12-27 subclone .

Antitumor Immunity and Rb .
Baskar et a/ .
( 35 , 36 ) have found that tumor cells transfected with and expressing class II molecules can immunize mice against a subsequent challenge of parental , class II-negative tumor cells .
Similar conclusions have been drawn using a rat model system ( 37 ) .
Thus , tumor cells defective for Rb , which can not express HLA class II after exposure to IFN-y , may be less immuno-genic .
IL-8 secretion now represents a second immune function regulated by Rb .
Enhanced neutrophil migration in response to culture media from the Rb-transformed cells is consistent with this increased IL-8 secretion having a functional impact on the neutrophils , although it is not known whether there could be additional , Rb-dependent components of the culture media enhancing neutrophil migration .
A role for IL-8 in antitumor immunity is suggested by the following : ( a ) recombinant IL-8 inhibits the proliferation of some non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines , and anti-IL-8 antibody eliminates this effect ( 38 ) ; ( b ) Taxol , an antitumor drug , induces the secretion of IL-8 but not IL-1 or IL-6 from ovarian carcinoma cell lines ( 39 ) ; ( c ) differentiation-inducing agents , such as retinoic acid , calcitriol , and sodium butyrate , up-regulate IL-8 expression in HL-60 cells ( 40 ) ; and ( d ) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes express high levels of IL-8 ( 41 ) .
However , there are also reports contradicting the proposal that IL-8 enhances Cell Growth & Differentiation t p el 'yum Ravel C ce yeu wel wl w= Oct-1 mp moura _ ( A ) 4 £ & £ & da g $ | und ~ o OU Op o e < od < d ves !

This same gel was transferred and blotted by anti-Oct-1 antibody ( arrow , bottom panel ! )
.
antitumor immunity ( 24 , 42 , 43 ) .
Melanoma cell lines with higher IL-8 secretion have a stronger tendency for metastasis in nude mice ( 43 ) , and the ability of IL-8 to induce angiogenesis in tumors is regarded as the contributing factor in tumor development ( 42 ) .
Although a determination the exact roles of HLA class II and IL-8 in the antitumor response requires additional investigation , it is clear that Rb can regulate at least two tumor cell immune functions in addition to cell growth and differentiation .
Materials and Methods Cell Culture .
The human bladder carcinoma cell line 5637 ( ATCC HTB-9 ; Refs .
16 and 17 ) was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % FCS ( Hyclone } , 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin , 3 mm L-glutamine , and 1 mm sodium pyruvate .
1A4 and 1¥1 are Rb-defective 5637 subclones transformed with the G418-resistant gene .
12-27 and 10-1 are 5637 subclones transformed with an Rb expression vector and the G418-resistant gene ( Table 1 ; Refs .
6 and 16 ) .
They are maintained by adding 200 ug/ml Geneticin ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) to the culture media used for culturing the 5637 cells .
S4-MTRb-1 is a Rb-transformed subclone of the human breast carcinoma cell line $ 4 ( Table 1 ; Refs .

epidermal growth factor ( Boehringer Mannheim ) .
Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and EMSAs .
Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Schreiber et al .
( 44 ) , with minor modifications .
Briefly , cells ( 1 x 10° cells/10-cm dish ) were washed twice with cold PBS and once with hypotonic buffer containing 20 mm HEPES , 1 mm EDTA , 1 mm EGTA , 20 mm sodium fluoride , 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate , 1 mm sodium orthovanadate , 1 mm DTT , and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl flu-oride .
Cells were then lysed in 300 wl of hypotonic buffer containing 0.2 % NP4O0 and protease inhibitors ( 0.5 ug/ml !
leupeptin , 2 ug/ml !
aprotinin , and 50 ug/ml antipain ; Boehringer Mannheim ) .
Nuclei were separated from cytosolic components by centrifugation at 15,000 x g for 30 s and resuspended in 100 wl of high salt buffer ( 20 mm HEPES , 840 mm sodium Table 4 - Quantitative analysis of Oct-1 phosphorylation POct-1 `` Oct-1 POct-1:0ct-1 Relative ratio 144 ( 24 h ) 121.8 178.8 0.6812 1.000 12-27 ( 24 h ) 188.1 160.6 1.171 1.719 144 ( 48 h ) 174.1 201.0 0.8662 1.271 12-27 ( 48 h ) 232.9 113.1 2.059 3.023 `` POct-1 , phosphorylated Oct-1 .
chloride , 1 mm EDTA , 1 mm EGTA , 40 % glycerol , 1 mm sodium fluoride , 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate , 1 mm sodium orthovanadate , 1 mm DTT , 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , and the protease inhibitors ) .
After 30 min of intermittent mixing at 4°C , the tubes were centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 5 min ( 4°C ) .
The supernatants ( nuclear extracts ) were aliquoted and stored at -70°C for later use .
Protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay following the manufacturer 's protocol ( Pierce ) .
The probes used for the EMSAs have been described previously ( 19 , 21 , 45 ) .
The sequences of the synthesized wild-type and mutant HLA-DRA octamer oligonucleotides , with the octamer element underlined and the mutated nucleotides in lowercase letters , are as follows : wild-type , 5'-AGAGTAATTGATITGCATTTTAATGG-3 ' ( sense strand ) and 5'-CCATTA-AAATGCAAATCAATTACT-3 ' ( antisense strand ) ; and mutant , 5'-AGAG-TAATTGecaTGgATITTAATGG-3 ' ( sense strand ) and 5'-CCATT-AAAATcCAtggCAATTACT-3 ' ( antisense strand ) .
The HLA-DRA Y box oligonucleotide sequences are 5'-AAATATTTTITCTGATTGGCCAAAGAG-TAAT-3 ' ( sense strand ) and 5'-ATTACTCTTTGGCCAATCAGAAAAAT-3 ' ( antisense strand ) .
The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for the IL-8 promoter octamer probes are as follows : wild-type , 5'-TCATCAGT-TGCAAATCGTGG-3 ' ( sense strand ) and 5'-TCCACGATITGCAACT-GATG-3 ' ( antisense - strand ) ; and - mutant , - 5'-TCATCtigTGCAAt-gCGTGG-3 ' ( sense strand ) and 5'-TCCACGcaTTGCAcaaGATG-3 ' ( antisense strand ) .
EMSAs were performed according to Yu et al .
( 46 ) .
Nuclear extract ( 5 ug ) was incubated with 0.025 pmol of [ a-°2P ] dCTP or [ a-°°P ] dATP end-labeled double-stranded probe for 30 min at 30°C in a 20-ul incubation mixture containing 1 ug of poly ( deoxyinosinic-deoxy-cytidylic acid ) ( Sigma ) and 5 ug of bovine serum albumin ( Boehinger Mannheim ) .
For competition or supershift experiment , 5 ug of nuclear extract were preincubated with a 10-fold or 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides or 1 ul of monoclonal antibody ( anti-Oct-1 and the control anti-epidermal growth factor receptor were both bought from Upstate Biotechnology ) for 30 min at room temperature and then combined with the labeled probes .
The protein-DNA complexes formed were separated on an 8 % nondenaturing polyacylam-ide gel and autographed .
Reporter Constructs , Transfections , and Luciferase Assays .
To generate the wild-type HLA-DRA luciferase reporter ( pDRAlucWT ) , the -176 to +45 fragment of HLA-DRA promoter was excised from pDRA-CAT ( 19 ) and subcloned into pUC18 .
The fragment was then excised from pUC18 using Asp `` '® and Sa/l .
This fragment was then cloned into the Asp `` '® and Xhol sites upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in the pGL3 vector ( Promega ) .
The corresponding mutant construct ( pDRAlucOCTmut ) was generated by subcloning the same DRA promoter fragment with four nucleotide substitutions within octamer box ( 5'-ATTTGCAT-3 ' to 5'-ccalTG @ gAT-3 ' ) into the pGL3 vector .
Both the wild-type and octamer mutant DRACAT plasmids were generous gifts of Dr. Laurie Glimcher ( Harvard University School of Public Health , Boston , MA } .
Both DRA luciferase constructs were verified by DNA sequencing .
The wild-type and octamer-mutated IL-8 promoter luciferase reporter constructs have been described previously ( 21 ) .
For transient transfections , 5637 or 12-27 cells were plated at a density of 2 x 10° cells/35-mm dish and incubated at 37°C with 7.5 % CO , .
Each transfection was performed five times .
After 24 h , 100 ng ( DRA promoter reporters ) or 1 ug ( IL-8 promoter reporters ) of DNA was transfected using a liposome method ( Trans IT-LT1 ; Mirus Corp. ) following the manufacturer 's recommendations .
Six h after transfection , cells were washed once with PBS , received fresh media , and were cultured for an additional 42 h. Cells were then harvested and lysed in 100 ul of 0.25 m Tris-HCI ( pH 8.0 ) by three rounds of freezing ( 95 % ethanol/dry ice ) and thawing ( 37°C ) .
The whole cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 5 min at 4°C .
The supernatants were assayed for luciferase activity using commercial re 463 Rb Regulation of Oct-1 and IL-8 agents ( Promega ) .
Light emissions were measured by a liquid scintillation counter ( Beckman ) .
Isolation of the Cytoplasmic RNA and Northern Blotting Analysis .
Cytoplasmic RNAs from the cultured 5637 cells and its subclones were extracted and stored as an ethanol precipitate as described previously ( 47 ) .
Northern blotting was performed as described by Luca et al .
( 24 ) , with minor modifications .
RNA ( 30 ug ) from each sample was fractionated in a 1 % denaturing formaldehyde/agarose gel .
The fractionated RNA was then transferred to a nylon filter membrane ( Hybond-N ; Amersham ) and UV cross-linked ( UV-Stratalinker 1800 ; Stratagene ) .
Prehybridization was performed at 42°C in 6 x SSC containing 50 % deionized formamide , 0.2 % SDS , and 100 g/m !
salmon sperm DNA .
A 0.5-kb EcoRI fragment representing human IL-8 cDNA ( 23 , 24 ) was purified from the agarose gel by using the Qiaquick kit ( Qiagen ) and labeled with [ a-° `` P ] dCTP using a nick translation kit ( Sigma ) .
Hybridization was carried out overnight at 42°C .
The membrane was washed twice with 2 x SSC and 0.1 % SDS for 30 min at 50°C and then washed once with 0.1 x SSC and 0.1 % SDS for 30 min at 60°C and exposed to Kodak film with an intensifying screen at -70°C .
Another set of RNA samples was fractionated by electrophoresis under the same conditions described above and stained with ethidium bromide to evaluate the integrity and concentration of the ribosomal RNAs .
Quantitation of the IL-8 mRNA and the corresponding 28S rRNA bands was done using ImageQuaNT computer software ( version 4.2a , Molecular Dynamics ) .
ELISA and Neutrophil Migration Assay .
Culture media for 5637 subclones were collected at 24 h after plating .
ELISA determination of IL-8 concentrations was performed in the Cytokine Core Laboratory at University of Maryland at Baltimore ( Baltimore , MD ) .
Culture media from triplate samples of each subclone were analyzed .
Neutrophil migration assay was performed by using a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber ( Neuro Probe , Inc. , Cabin John , MD ) following the manufacturer 's proto-col. Neutrophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of normal adult volunteers ( South West Florida Blood Bank , Tampa , FL ; Ref .
48 ) .
Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting .
5637 subclones ( 50-80 % confluent monolayer in 10-cm dish ) were cultured in 3 m !
of labeling media [ phosphate free-DMEM ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) containing 5 % dialyzed FCS and 0.1 mCi/ml !
inorganic phosphate ( NEXO54 ; DuPont New England Nuclear ) ] .
Nuclear extracts were isolated from the labeled cells as described above .
For immunoprecipitation of Oct-1 , 5 ul of mouse anti-human Oct-1 antibody ( Upstate Biotechnology ) and 10 ul recombinant protein G agarose ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) were added to 250 ul ( 100 ug ) of nuclear extracts and incubated for 2 h at 4°C .
Immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 5 min and washed three times with PBS at 4°C .
Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 10 % gel , the wet gel was exposed to Kodak film for the detection of °P-labeled Oct-1 , and the band intensities were quantified using ImmageQuaNT software ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
To immunoblot Oct-1 , proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( Du-Pont New England Nuclear Research Products ) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris , 192 mm glycine , and 20 % methanol overnight at 4°C .
The membrane was then blocked in 10 ml of PBS containing 5 % milk and 0.1 % Tween 20 overnight at 4°C .
Antibody blotting was performed by incubating the membrane in 10 ml of 5 % milk containing 10 wl of anti-Oct-1 ( 1:1,000 dilution ) for 2 h at room temperature .
The membrane was washed three times with PBS containing 0.1 % Tween 20 for 5 min each time at room temperature , and 2.5 pl ( 1:12,500 dilution ) of horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit antimouse antibody ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) were added and incubated with the membrane for 1 h. The reaction was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents ( Amersham ) .
