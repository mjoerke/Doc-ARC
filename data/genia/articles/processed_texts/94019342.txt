To understand the mechanisms underlying the cell-type-specific expression of this gene , we have characterized the regulatory functions and the DNA-protein interactions of the 5'-flanking region of the mouse perforin gene ( Pfp ) .
A region extending from residues +62 through -141 , which possesses the essential promoter activity , and regions further upstream , which are able to either enhance or suppress gene expression , were identified .
The region between residues -411 and -566 was chosen for further characterization , since it contains an enhancer-like activity .
We have identified a 32-mer sequence ( residues -491 to -522 ) which appeared to be capable of enhancing gene expression in a killer cell-specific manner .
Within this segment , a 9-mer motif ( 5'-ACAGGAAGT-3 ' , residues -505 to -497 ; designated NF-P motif ) , which is highly homologous to the Ets proto-oncoprotein-binding site , was found to interact with two proteins , NF-P1 and NF-P2 .
NF-P2 appears to be induced by reagents known to up-regulate the perforin message level and is present exclusively in killer cells .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and UV cross-linking experiments revealed that NF-P1 and NF-P2 may possess common DNA-binding subunits .
However , the larger native molecular mass of NF-P1 suggests that NF-P1 contains an additional non-DNA-binding subunit ( s ) .
In view of the homology between the NF-P motif and other Ets proto-oncoprotein-binding sites , it is postulated that NF-P1 and NF-P2 belong to the Ets protein family .
Results obtained from the binding competition assay , nevertheless , suggest that NF-P1 and NF-P2 are related to but distinct from Ets proteins , e.g .
, Ets-1 , Ets-2 , and NF-AT/EIf-1 , known to be expressed in T cells .
Perforin , the pore-forming protein ( PFP ) , is a cytolytic protein specifically expressed in killer lymphocytes , including cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) , natural killer cells , lymphokine-activated killer ( LAK ) cells , and 4/8 T cells .
Together with other effector molecules , PFP is thought to play a crucial role in lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity by forming transmembrane pores that lead to target cell lysis ( 18 , 32 , 42 , 48 ) .
We and others have previously shown that perforin message level can be up-regulated by a variety of T-cell activators such as interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , lectins , and phorbol ester and is partially down-regulated by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A ( 15 , 23 , 24 ) .
Results obtained from these studies , however , provided no clues to the mechanisms that control the cell-type-specific expression of the perforin gene ( Pfp ) .
Recently , the genomic organizations of mouse and human Pfp have been defined ( 21 , 41 , 47 ) .
Their 5'-flanking sequences , being homologous to each other , share also some homology with known cis-acting elements ( 21 , 47 ) .
In the case of mouse Pfp , these include TATA box- and GC box-related promoter sequences ; cyclic AMP- , phorbol es-ter- , and gamma interferon-responsive site-like elements ; and NF- « B binding site-like elements ( summarized in Fig .
1A ) ( 47 ) .

6690 and their cognate trans-acting factors are involved in regulating the transcription of Pfp , virtually no information is available concerning the regulatory functions and the DNA-protein interactions of the Pfp 5'-flanking region .
The tissue- and cell-specific manner of gene expression has been shown to rely primarily on the combined actions of various transcription factors .
These transcription factors may interact with their cognate regulatory sequences ( pro-moters , enhancers , or silencers ) of the gene to be transcribed ( 27 , 29 ) .
The presence of multiple regulatory elements allows specific transcription factors to initiate efficient transcription in a coordinated manner within a cell at different times during its growth , differentiation , or activation .
Mechanisms that control the expression of lymphocyte-specific genes have recently been elucidated , mainly through the studies on T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin genes .
It has been shown that T- or B-cell-specific nuclear factors , such as TCF-1/LEF-1 , GATA-3 , and OTF-2/Oct-2 , are involved in restricting the expression of T-cell receptor or immunoglobulin genes to lymphocytes by interacting with their cognate cis-acting elements ( 20 , 35 ) .
On the basis of the premise that killer lymphocytes should also contain their particular transcription factors to regulate Pfp expression , we have attempted to localize the functional DNA sequences which control Pfp expression in killer cells .
In this paper , we report the identification of the promoter region and several additional upstream regulatory sequences of Pfp .
Among these sequences , a 32-bp segment ( residues -522 to -491 ) appears to be capable of driving gene expres- Vor .
13 , 1993 sion in a killer cell-specific fashion .
This segment contains a 9-mer motif located between residues -505 and -497 which is homologous to the Ets proto-oncoprotein-binding site ( EBS ) .
We present results suggesting that this 9-mer motif probably plays a role in controlling Pfp expression in killer cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells .
Murine cell lines P815 ( mastocytoma ) , YAC-1 ( T-cell leukemia ) , and EL-4 ( thymoma ) were maintained in a « -modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 5 % fetal calf serum ( Hyclone Laboratories , Logan , Utah ) and antibiotics .
IL-2-dependent CTL lines CTLL-R8 and CTLL-2 were further supplemented with 10 % conditioned medium [ the culture supernatant of rat splenocytes stimulated for 48 h with 10 mg of concanavalin A ( ConA ; Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , Mo . )
per ml and 20 ng of phorbol myristyl acetate ( PMA ) ( Sigma ) per ml ] ( 15 , 23 ) .
The resting CTLL-R8 cells were prepared by depriving confluent R8 cells of the conditioned medium for 1 week prior to being used in the experiments .
In some experiments , EL-4 and resting CTLL-R8 were stimulated for 24 h with 100 U of recombinant human IL-2 ( Cetus Corp. , Emeryville , Calif. ) per ml , ConA and PMA ( 10 mg and 20 ng , respectively , per ml ) , or 10 % conditioned medium .
Murine spleens and livers were obtained from young C57BL/6 mice .
Adherent LAK cells were derived from nylon-wool-purified splenic T cells ( 15 , 49 ) .
Plasmid constructs .
A panel of plasmid constructs containing sequential deletion of the Pfp 5'-flanking sequence fused to a reporter gene , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) , was prepared .
An artificial fragment of Pfp 5'-flanking region was generated by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) with a 5 ' primer that incorporated a SacI site into the sequence encoding residues -700 through -684 of the mouse Pfp and a 3 ' primer complementary to residues +45 through +62 plus a HindIII site .
The PCR-amplified fragments were digested with Sacl and HindIII and then cloned into a SaclI-HindIII-digested pSVCAT vector which contains the simian virus 40 early promoter and the CAT gene so that the Pfp 5 ' sequence would be located upstream to the CAT gene and downstream to the simian virus 40 promoter .
To create shorter deletional constructs , the original reporter construct was linearized with SacI !
and digested with Bal 31 nuclease for different lengths of time , and the inserts were released by HindIII digestion , purified , and polished by SacI linker ligation and then by SacI digestion .
The shortened inserts were finally ligated into Sacl-HindlII-digested pSVCAT vector , and the precise 5 ' edge of the Pfp regulatory sequence in each prepared construct was determined by nucleotide sequencing .
Alternatively , the longer insert was cleaved with Pvull enzyme at residues -522 and -141 , and the desired fragment was purified , polished , and cloned into the vector .
This series of reporter plasmids was designated pCAToco ( ooo indicates the 5'° edge of the Pfp sequence incorporated ) constructs .
To analyze the function of the NF-P motif , two types of constructs were prepared .
An oligonucleotide encoding three copies of the Pvull-KpnI fragment sequence ( residues -522 through -491 ) in tandem was synthesized and inserted upstream of the Pfp 5 ' sequence in pCAT_ , , , ( containing Pfp 5 ' sequence up to residue -411 ) .
DNA fragments containing mutation within the NF-P motif were amplified by PCR with the universal 3 ' primer and mutated oligonucleotides ( M2 and M3 [ see be-low ] ) as the 5 ' primer .
These fragments ( corresponding to KILLER CELL-SPECIFIC REGULATORY ELEMENT OF MOUSE Pfp 6691 residues -522 through +62 of the Pfp sequence ) were subcloned into the pSVCAT vector , and mutations of the NF-P motif were verified by sequencing .
DNA transfection .
Plasmids twice purified by CsCl banding were transfected into cells by electroporation .
Briefly , 5 x 10° cells in 400 pl of phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) were electroporated in the presence of 40 ug of plasmid DNA at 960 F and 280 V ( CTLL-R8 ) or 300 V ( EL-4 and P815 ) , in a 4-mm-diameter electroporation cuvette by using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser ( Richmond , Calif. ) .
After incubation for 10 min on ice , electroporated cells were transferred to 150-mm-diameter petri dishes containing prewarmed media and incubated for 48 h. CAT assay .
CAT activity in the transfected cells was tested by using a CAT enzyme assay kit ( Promega Co. , Madison , Wis. ) .
Cell extracts for CAT assay were prepared by freezing and thawing cells three times in 150 pl of 0.25 M Tris-HCl , pH 8.0 .
The extracts were heated at 60°C for 10 min to inactivate endogenous acetylase and spun for 10 min to remove particulate debris .
The level of CAT activity was normalized to the amount of CAT plasmid DNA introduced by transfection , as determined by DNA dot blot analysis ( 1 ) .
Briefly , 10 pl of cell extract was sequentially incubated at 37°C for 30 min ( each ) with RNase A ( 100 ug/ml ! )
and then with proteinase K ( 100 pg/ml ) .
After incubation , 2 volumes of 20 % SSC ( 1x SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate ) was added , and the DNA was denatured in 0.25 N NaOH for 10 min at room temperature .
Samples were serially diluted on prechilled 0.125 N NaOH-0.125x SSC and dotted onto GeneScreen Plus membranes ( New England Nuclear , Boston , Mass . )
.
Membranes were prehybridized for 30 min and hybridized to *°P-labeled pCAT DNA .
After being washed , the membranes were subjected to autoradiography .
The volumes of the cell extracts used in CAT assay were normalized to the relative amount of transfected CAT DNA , determined by the intensities of the hybridization signals .
The reaction mixture containing the normalized volume of cell extract , 25 ug of n-butyryl coenzyme A , and 0.05 wCi of [ '*CJ ) chloramphenicol ( New England Nuclear ) supplemented with 0.25 M Tris-HCl , pH 8.0 , to a final volume of 125 pl .
The reaction was carried out at 37°C overnight , with an additional 25 ug of n-butyryl coenzyme A added at 2 to 4 h after the initiation of the reaction .
The amount of acetylated chloramphenicol produced was determined either by liquid scintillation counting or by thin-layer chromatography .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) .
Cell nuclear extracts ( NEs ) were prepared as previously described ( 8 , 11 ) .
Briefly , cells were washed three times with PBS , resuspended in 3 pelleted cell volumes of buffer A ( 10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N ' -2-ethanesulfonic acid [ HEPES ; pH 7.9 ] , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 10 mM KCl , 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [ PMSF ] , 0.5 mM dithiothrei-tol [ DTT ] ) , incubated on ice for 10 min , homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer ( 10 strokes , type B pestle ) , and centrifuged at 1,000 x g to sediment the nuclei .
The nucleus pellet was resuspended in a 0.5 packed-nuclei volume of buffer B ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 20 mM KCl , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM PMSF , 0.5 mM DTT , 25 % [ vol/vol ] glycerol ) .
A 0.5 packed-nuclei volume of buffer C ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 1.2 M KCI , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM PMSF , 0.5 mM DTT , 25 % glycerol ) was subsequently added drop by drop with constant agitation .
The nuclei were extracted at 4°C for 30 min and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 30 min .
The supernatant collected was dialyzed against 50 volumes of buffer D ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 6692 KOIZUMI ET AL .
7.9 ] , 100 mM KCI , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.2 mM PMSF , 0.5 mM DTT ) for 1 h and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 20 min .
The NEs thus prepared were stored at -70°C until use .
NE of HeLa cells was obtained from Stratagene ( La Jolla , Calif. ) .
Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method ( 6 ) with a Bio-Rad assay kit .
An Ncol-KpnI fragment of the 5 ' region of Pfp ( residues -609 through -491 ) was labeled with [ « - `` P ] dCTP by using Klenow fragment .
Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [ y- > P ] JATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) .
A typical binding reaction mixture ( 25-pl final volume ) consisted of 5 ug of NE , 2 x 10° cpm of end-labeled probe ( 0.2 to 0.5 ng ) , 2.5 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia LKB , Piscat-away , N.J. ) , 25 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.9 ) , 6.25 mM MgCl , , 0.5 mM EDTA , 50 mM KCI , 0.5 mM DTT , and 10 % glycerol .
After incubation for 20 min at 0°C , the resulting DNA-protein complexes were resolved from the free probe by electrophoresis on a 6 % native polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography .
Synthetic oligonucleotides .
The coding-strand sequences of synthetic oligonucleotides are shown in Fig .
3C ( overlapping oligonucleotides , OL 1 to 3 ) , Fig .
4A ( multiple-base mutations , M1 to 4 ) , and Fig .
4B ( one-point mutations , OP 1 to 10 ) .
Mutations were designed to substitute purines with the nonpairing pyrimidine residues and vice versa .
An oligonucleotide containing the Ets-1 binding site was synthesized as a 32-mer ( 5-TTCCAGAGGATGTGGCTTCTGCGGGAG AGCTT ) derived from the reported sequence ( 13 ) , and the 30-bp oligonucleotide containing the NF-AT binding site was kindly provided by A. Granelli-Piperno ( The Rockefeller University ) ( 12 ) .
UV cross-linking experiment .
In situ UV cross-linking of DNA-protein with end-labeled OL 2 was performed by the established procedure ( 30 ) with some modifications .
After resolution by EMSA , the gels were subjected to autoradiog-raphy briefly to locate the DNA-protein complexes .
The areas identified were excised , pooled in 35-mm-diameter petri dishes , and irradiated with UV for 1 h. Alternatively , the gels were first subjected to UV irradiation ( 2,500 mJ ) by using a Stratalinker ( Stratagene ) , and the areas containing the DNA-protein complexes were located by autoradiogra-phy and excised .
The cross-linked DNA-protein complexes were then collected by either electroelution or passive diffusion into the soaking buffer , boiled in sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -containing loading buffer , and resolved by SDS-10 or 6 % PAGE .
After electrophoresis , the gel was dried under vacuum and subjected to autoradiography .
Controls for this type of experiment included SDS-PAGE of the DNA-protein complexes eluted from a nonspecific band on EMSA following UV cross-linking or of the complexes without being cross-linked by UV irradiation prior to SDS-PAGE .
RESULTS Functional mapping of the mouse Pfp promoter and regulatory regions .
Although several potential regulatory elements in mouse Pfp have been identified by sequence comparison ( Fig .
1A ) , functional relevances of these elements have not yet been established .
Recently , several groups , including ours , have attempted to address this issue ( 22 , 40 ) .
To locate the promoter region that potentially regulates Pfp expression , we have constructed a series of plasmids that contain 5 ' sequential deletions of mouse Pfp 5'-flanking region fused to the CAT gene .

Sequence comparison and functional analysis of the 5'-flanking region of mouse Pfp .
( A ) Alignment of the potential regulatory elements identified by computer-assisted sequence com-parison .
( B ) CTLL-R8 , EL-4 , and P815 cells were transiently transfected with the pCAT reporter construct .
To adjust for the different transfection efficiencies , volumes of cell extracts containing the same amount of plasmid DNA as determined by dot blot analysis ( see Materials and Methods ) were used for CAT assays .
The CAT activities were determined by liquid scintillation counting and normalized against the activity obtained from cells transfected with the pSVCAT vector , which usually gave no or low counts .
The result for each construct was derived from at least three independent experiments .
constructs prepared in a plasmid vector which contains the CAT gene alone drove the expression of the CAT gene only weakly , we generated constructs with similar 5'-flanking sequences cloned into a plasmid vector containing the CAT gene and the early promoter of simian virus 40 in order to potentiate the activity of the Pfp sequences .
These constructs were transiently expressed in both CTLs and non-CTLs , and the levels of CAT expression were normalized against the expression driven by the simian virus 40-CAT vector .
Although the region encompassing nucleotides +62 through -141 ( transcription initiation site as +1 ) was able to drive the expression of CAT in CTLL-R8 , EL-4 , and P815 cells , a much higher efficiency was observed in CTLL-R8 ( 47-fold ) than in nonkiller cells ( 4-fold for EL-4 and 6-fold for P815 ) ( Fig .
1B ) .
These results suggest that a basal promoter activity for Pfp is present within this region .
Incorporation of the sequence between residues -142 through -411 into the construct failed to drive more CAT expression ( com-paring the results obtained with i , -i41 and pCAT is : .. -411 , respectively ) , suggesting that this region does not contain strong regulatory elements ( Fig .
1B ) .
No-tably , a construct ( pCAT_14 ; i , -316 ) lacking the sequence encompassing residues +62 through -141 lost its ability to drive the CAT expression , indicating again that the essential promoter activity for Pfp resides within the 5'-flanking sequence up to residue -141 .
Vor .
13 , 1993 Inclusion of sequence extending to residue -566 in the reporter construct enhanced CAT expression profoundly in CTLL-R8 but only slightly in EL-4 and P815 cells ( Fig .
1B ) .
Further extension of the Pfp 5'-flanking sequence to residue -670 and residue -700 , however , reduced the CAT gene expression in all three cell types examined .
These results suggest that a killer cell-specific positive regulatory ele-ment ( s ) is present between residue -412 and -566 .
Therefore , we decided to further characterize this region .
DNA-protein interactions in the Ncol-KprI region ( residues -609 through -491 ) of mouse Pfp .
Since DNA-binding proteins may represent frams-acting factors that affect the transcription of Pfp , we first set out to identify proteins that interact with the -566 to -412 sequence .
To circumvent the limitation of available restriction sites surrounding this region , we initially used a 119-bp Ncol-KpnI fragment ( residues -609 through -491 ) as a probe in EMSA to examine the 5 ' end of the region of interest .
Comparing the electrophoretic profile of unstimulated CTLL-R8 ( Fig .
2A , lane 1 ) with that of the CTLL-RS8 stimulated with conditioned medium , IL-2 , or ConA and PMA ( lanes 2 to 4 , respectively ) , it was noted that the amount of a DNA-protein complex ( designated B1 ) was reduced , and concomitantly , the amount of another complex ( designated B2 ) was reciprocally induced in the stimulated cells .
This phenomenon was also observed for primary killer cells .
The electrophoretic profile of adherent LAK cells , which were derived from IL-2-stimulated splenic T lymphocytes ( 15 , 49 ) , showed a strong B2 band and a faint B1 band ( lane 6 ) , whereas that of the unstimulated splenic T cells displayed only the B1 band ( not shown ) .
Interestingly , the electrophoretic profile of confluent resting CTLL-R8 cells ( see Materials and Methods ) exhibited an intermediate pattern , with the B1 and B2 bands equally present ( lane 5 ) .
B1 and B2 bands were also observed in the electrophoretic profile of another CTL line , CTLL-2 , maintained in conditioned medium ( not shown ) .
A third DNA-protein complex , located below the B2 band and present at variable intensities in different cells , was not further investigated since it was not modulated by the T-cell activators ( Fig .
2A ) .
Another DNA fragment , KpnI-HinPI ( residues -490 through -263 ) , was similarly tested in the binding assay to examine the effect of the rest of the targeted region ( residues -566 through -412 ) .
However , DNA-protein complexes formed by this probe displayed similar electrophoretic patterns in both unstimulated and stimulated CTLL-R8 cells ( { not shown ) .
These results suggest that the B1-B2 modulation observed with the Ncol-KprI fragment may solely account for the increased transcription of the CAT gene driven by the sequence between residues -412 and -566 in CTLL-R8 ( Fig .
1B ) .
To verify the cell-type specificity of B1 and B2 formation , we have also tested nonlymphoid cells ( primary hepato-cytes , P815 , and HeLa cells [ Fig .
2A , lanes 7 and 8 , and not shown , respectively ] ) and nonkiller T lymphocytes ( YAC-1 and EL-4 [ Fig .
2A , lanes 9 and 10 to 12 , respectively ] ) in EMSA by using the Ncol-KpnI probe .
B1 was found to be ubiquitously present in all cell types tested .
B2 , on the other hand , appeared to be killer cell specific , since it was not present in EL-4 cells stimulated with conditioned medium , IL-2 , or ConA and PMA ( Fig .
2A , lanes 11 to 13 , respectively , compared with unstimulated EL-4 cells , lane 10 ) .
Furthermore , these stimuli failed to reduce Bl in EL-4 .
Similar results were observed in a human non-CTL T-cell line , Jurkat , stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and PMA ( 12 ) ( not shown ) .
Thus , the occurrence of the B1-B2 modu- KILLER CELL-SPECIFIC REGULATORY ELEMENT OF MOUSE Pfp 6693 A CTLL-R8 liver cells P815 YAC-1 12°03 , 4 - 5 mo -f geo- 10 'M 12 13 Ncol-Kpnl control DNA B C o 1T ?

In the following , the nuclear factors that form the ubiquitous B1 and the killer cell-specific B2 will be referred to as NF-P1 and NF-P2 , respectively .
Localization of the binding sites for NF-P1 and NF-P2 .
To localize the binding sites for NF-P1 and NF-P2 , the Ncol-KpnI fragment ( residues -609 through -491 ) was digested with Pvull to generate two smaller fragments for use in the binding competition assay .
The Pvull-KpnI fragment ( residues -522 through -491 ) was able to inhibit both the B1 and the B2 complexes ( Fig .
3A , lane 5 ) as effectively as the intact Ncol-KpnI fragment ( lane 2 ) , whereas the NcoI-Pvull fragment ( residues -609 through -523 ) ( lane 4 ) displayed no such effect at all .
These results revealed that the protein-binding sites for both factors reside within the 32-bp Pvull-KpnI fragment .
Overlapping oligonucleotides ( OL 1 to 3 [ Fig .
3C ] ) , of which OL 2 is identical to the Pvull-KpnI region , were then used in the competition assay to define further the sites involved in DNA-protein interaction .
Both complexes were specifically inhibited by OL 2 and OL 3 ( lanes 7 and 8 ) but not by OL 1 ( lane 6 ) .
Direct binding assay also showed that OL 1 could not form B1 and B2 complexes , whereas both OL 2 and OL 3 did ( Fig .
3B ) .

Identification of the protein-binding sequence .
( A ) Upper panel : competition assay with multiple-base mutated oligonucleotides ( M1 to 4 ) .
End-labeled OL 2 was incubated with 5 ug of NE of resting CTLL-R8 cells in the absence of the competitor ( - ) or in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of the wild-type OL 2 ( WT ) or M 1 to 4 .
Lower panel : nucleotide sequences of M 1 to 4 .
The sequences are aligned with the wild-type OL 2 , and identical bases are denoted by dashes .
( B ) Upper panel : competition assay with one-point mutated oligonucleotides ( OP 1 to 10 ) .
The experiment was performed exactly the same as for panel A , except for the use of OP 1 to 10 .
Lower panel : location of the nucleotide substituted in OP 1 to 10 .
OP 1 to 5 and OP 8 to 10 contain mutations 5 ' and 3 ' , respectively , to the putative core sequence GGAAGT .
OP 6 and 7 are mutants of the core sequence ( see text ) .
identical behaviors of OL 2 and OL 3 in these experiments , it is concluded that a 12-bp DNA region , where OL 2 overlaps with OL 3 but not with OL 1 ( residues -504 through -491 [ underlined in Fig .
3C ] ) , contains the binding site ( s ) for both NF-P1 and NF-P2 .
Identical DNA sequence recognized by NF-P1 and NF-P2 .
Segments of the 32-bp sequence of OL 2 were then mutated to test their effects on complex formation ( oligonucleotides M 1 to 4 , Fig .
4A ) .
M 3 and M 4 , representing mutation in the 12-bp putative binding sequence ( Fig .
3C ) , and M 1 and M2 , containing irrelevant mutation in the flanking region , were synthesized and similarly used in the binding competition assay .
M 1 competed for the binding as effectively as the wild-type OL 2 , whereas M 2 and M 4 only partially competed , and M 3 failed to compete at all .
These results indicate that both B1 and B2 complexes were formed by the binding of proteins through a central sequence , 5'-GGAAGT , defined by mutant M 3 , and a couple of the adjacent residues defined by mutants M 2 and M 4 .
To elucidate the protein-binding residues in more detail , we then used one-point ( OP ) mutated oligonucleotides spanning both sides of the central sequence in the binding competition Vor .
13 , 1993 assay ( OP 1 to 10 [ Fig .
4BJ ) .
Among the 5 OPs ( OP 1 to 5 ) , OP 1 and OP 2 competed for the binding as effectively as the wild-type oligonucleotide , whereas OP 3 and OP 4 only partially competed .
These results imply that the 5 ' edge of the protein-binding sequence is the adenine located at position -505 , as defined by OP 3 .
Surprisingly , OP 5 appeared to have stronger binding affinity for DNA , since it competed more effectively than the wild-type oligonucleotide ( Fig .
4B ) .
In the direct binding assay , OP 5 indeed displayed enhanced complex formation ( not shown ) .
Since all 3 ' OPs ( OP 8 to 10 ) showed the same competition profile as that of the wild-type oligonucleotide ( Fig .
4B ) , the 3 ' ends of the central sequence were further mutated ( OP 6 and OP 7 ) .
Of the two oligonucleotides prepared , OP 6 could not compete for the binding , whereas OP 7 did to some extent .
These results indicate that the thymine located at position -497 , mutated in OP 7 , is the 3 ' terminus of the binding sequence and that the guanine , located at position -498 , substituted in OP 6 , is essential for protein binding .
It is important to note that B1 and B2 exhibited identical competition profiles with respect to the mutated oligonucleotides M 2 to 4 and OP 3 to 7 ( Fig .
4 ) .
On the basis of these results , the sequence requirement and the binding specificity of NF-P1 and NF-P2 are most likely identical ( residues -505 through -497 , mutated in OP 3 to 5 and M 3 ) .
We shall refer to this purine-rich 9-mer sequence , 5 !
-ACAGGAAGT ( -505 to -497 ) , hereafter as the NF-P motif .
Subsequent sequence comparison revealed the location of the human cognate NF-P motif , 5'-gCAGGAAGT , being between residues -618 and -610 of human Pfp ( 21 ) .
Positive regulatory function of the NF-P motif .
To examine whether the 9-mer sequence identified above is responsible for the positive regulatory function originally observed for the pCAT_ , , , reporter construct , a synthetic oligonucleotide containing in tandem three copies of the residues -522 through -491 sequence was linked 5 ' to the Pfp sequence in the pCAT_,4 , , construct .
This construct ( designated pCATai , .
, ) was transfected into CTLL-R8 and non-CTL EL-4 cefls , and the CAT enzyme activity was monitored in the transfected cell lysates .
In several repeating experiments , increased CAT expression over that driven by pCAT _ , , , was found in CTLL-R8 but not in EL-4 cells ( Fig .
5A and B ) .
Interestingly , an intermediate level of enhancement of CAT expression occurred when the pCAT , ; ; , , was transfected into CTLL-R8 cultured in medium without IL-2 [ CTLL-R8 ( NC ) ( Fig .
5B ) ] .
These results suggest that the observed positive regulatory activity is killer cell specific , IL-2 inducible , and likely mediated by the NF-P motif , as no other protein-binding sequence has been identified within this region .
Since pCAT_ ; , , appeared to be more efficient than pCAT , , , , , , in enhancing the CAT expression , the possibility that additional positive regulatory elements are present within the region of residues -412 through -566 still can not be ruled out .
To verify further the role of the NF-P motif in the transcription of Pfp , two reporter constructs containing the Pfp sequence spanning from residue +62 to residue -522 with the NF-P motif being mutated [ 5-CACGGAAGT-3 ' ( pCATy ; ; ) and 5'-ACATTCCTG-3 ' ( pCATy ; , ) ; mutated as underlined ] were prepared .
Analyses with the lysates of CTLL-R8 transfected with these constructs showed little or virtually no expression of the CAT gene ( Fig .
5C ) .
These results suggest that the integrity of the NF-P motif not only is important for enhancing Pfp expression but also is essential for the normal function of downstream regulatory sequences .

Relationship between NF-P1 and NF-P2 , Ets-1 , and NF-AT/EIf-1 , analyzed by EMSA .
( A ) Competition assays with OL 2 and Ets-1 oligonucleotides .
NE of CTLL-R8 cells was incubated in the absence of competitor ( Comp . )
( lanes 1 and 6 ) or in the presence of a 50-fold ( lanes 2 and 7 , OL 2 ; lanes 4 and 9 , Ets-1 ) or 200-fold ( lanes 3 and 8 , OL 2 ; lanes 5 and 10 , Ets-1 ) molar excess of unlabeled competitors , and then end-labeled OL 2 ( lanes 1 to 5 ) or the Ets-1 probe ( lanes 6 to 10 ) was added .
Both oligonucleotides consist of 32 bp .
The specific Ets-1 complex is indicated by an arrow .
( B ) Competition assays with OL 2 and NF-AT/Elf-1 oligonucleotides .
The experiments were performed as for panel A , except that a 30-bp NF-AT/EIf-1 oligonucleotide was used instead of the Ets-1 oligonucleotide , and the binding reactions were performed at 20°C .

sequence , A/CGGAA , /T ) ( 7 , 16 , 20 , 31 , 45 ) .
To determine whether NF-P1 and NF-P2 are Ets-related proteins , two members of Ets protein family , Ets-l and NF-AT/Ef-1 , known to be expressed in T cells or thymocytes ( 3 , 4 , 13 , 14 , 36 , 38 ) , were compared with NF-P1 and NF-P2 in EMSA .
A 32-bp oligonucleotide comprising the native Ets-1 binding site of human T-cell receptor « -chain gene enhancer ( core sequence , AGGAT ) ( 13 ) and a 30-bp oligonucleotide consisting of the native NF-AT binding site ( recently shown to interact with Elf-1 and another factor [ 14 , 38 ] ) of the human IL-2 gene enhancer ( core sequence , AGGAA , same as the NF-P motif ) ( 12 ) were used in EMSA , in comparison with the binding of NF-P1 and NF-P2 to OL 2 .
As shown in Fig .
6 , the putative Ets-l or NF-AT/EIf-1 complex migrated much more slowly than B1 or B2 ( Fig .
6A and B , compare lanes 1 and 6 ) , indicating that the molecular masses of NF-P1 and NF-P2 differ significantly from those of the two Ets proteins .
To further distinguish NF-P1 and NF-P2 from Ets-1l and Ets-2 , EMSA with OL 2 as the probe was performed in the presence of monoclonal antibodies specific for either Ets-1 or Ets-2 ( kindly provided by T. S. Papas , National Cancer Institute ) .
These antibodies neither inhibited the formation of B1 and B2 nor shifted the positions of these complexes to a higher-molecular-weight region ( the so-called supershift [ 5 ] ) ( Fig .
6C ) , suggesting that the specific Ets-1 and Ets-2 epitopes recognized by the monoclonal antibodies tested are not present in NF-P1 and NF-P2 .
In the binding competition analysis , the binding of NF-P1 and NF-P2 to labeled OL 2 was efficiently inhibited by unlabeled OL 2 ( Fig .
6A and B , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
However , it was only slightly inhibited by the Ets-1 oligonucleotide and not at all inhibited by the NF-AT/EIf-1 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
6A and B , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
Conversely , unlabeled OL 2 failed to inhibit the formation of the DNA-protein complexes when labeled Ets-1 or NF-AT/EIf-1 probe was used ( Fig .
6A and B , lanes 6 to 10 ) .
These results strongly suggest that NF-P1 and NF-P2 are distinct from Ets-1 and NF-AT/EIf-1 .
Nevertheless , the weak cross-competition observed between OL 2 and Ets-1 oligonucleotides ( Fig .
6A ) implies that NF-P1 and NF-P2 still overlap with Ets-1 to a certain degree in terms of their DNA-binding specificity .
Therefore , it is possible that NF-P1 and NF-P2 are also members of the Ets family .
They are , however , only distantly related to Ets-1 .
Similar-size DNA-binding subunits present in NF-P1 and NF-P2 .
To estimate the native molecular masses of NF-P1 and NF-P2 , NE prepared from resting CTLL-R8 cells was separated on a size-exclusion column , and a portion of each fraction collected was assayed by EMSA for the formation of B1 and B2 complexes .
Maximal B1 and B2 formations were detected in fractions 45 and 55 , respectively ( Fig .
7A ) .
By comparison with molecular mass standards , the native molecular masses of NF-P1 and NF-P2 were estimated to be in the range of 208 to 234 and 91 to 100 kDa , respectively .
The DNA-binding specificity of partially purified NF-P1 or NF-P2 was also examined by EMSA with two mutant DNA probes , M 3 and OP 6 .
The results obtained showed that neither of the two mutant probes formed B1 or B2 complexes with the two factors present in the column fractions ( not Vor .

Molecular masses of NF-P1 and NF-P2 .
( A ) Size-exclusion chromatography .
Two milligrams of NE of CTLL-R8 cells was loaded on a Sephacryl $ -300 column ( 50-ml column volume ; Pharmacia ) that had been equilibrated in 0.1 M KCl-buffer D ( 18 ) , and 0.5-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min .
Aliquots ( 20 wl ) of each fraction were incubated with labeled OL 2 and then subjected to EMSA .
The positions of molecular weight standards eluted are indicated on top of the figure .
( B ) UV cross-linking analysis of the B1 and B2 complexes .

shown ) .
In situ UV cross-linking was then performed to determine the molecular components and the masses of both NF-P1 and NF-P2 under denaturing conditions .
In some earlier experiments in which DNA-protein complexes were electroeluted overnight at room temperature , cross-linked B1 and B2 were found to contain several similar-size polypeptide species : two major ones of ~90 and ~40 kDa and , occasionally , a minor one of ~30 kDa ( Fig .
7B ) .
Since proteolysis or photocleavage ( 10 ) of proteins under harsh experimental conditions was a serious concern , we later adopted a milder UV cross-linking and protein elution pro-tocol .
After UV irradiation , the gel slices were incubated at 4°C overnight in soaking buffer containing 1 mM PMSF , during which time DNA-protein complexes would passively diffuse into the buffer .
Upon electrophoresis on SDS-6 % PAGE ( for better resolution of the high-molecular-weight species ) under reducing conditions , the ~90-kDa species was resolved into two polypeptide species migrating closely at around 80 to 90 kDa ; this was found for both the B1 and B2 complexes ( Fig .
7C , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
These two 80- to 90-kDa species may represent either two different subunits with similar molecular masses or , instead , isoforms of the same protein .
In addition to these dominant doublet bands , two more slowly migrating bands were found in the B1 complex but not in the B2 complex eluate ( Fig .
7C , lane 1 ) .
Lower-molecular-weight species , probably generated because of incomplete inhibition of proteolysis , were still detected .
The cross-linked DNA-protein complexes eluted from an irrelevant third band did not contain the two species migrating at around 80 to 90 kDa ( Fig .
7C , lane 6 ) , suggesting that the 80- to 90-kDa doublet species were unique for NF-P1 and NF-P2 .
These 80- to 90-kDa protein species could not be detected when the nuclear extract was not added during EMSA or if the DNA-protein complexes were not subjected to UV irradiation prior to SDS-PAGE ( Fig .
7C , lanes 3 to 5 ) , which indicated that the association between the proteins and oligonucleotides was specific .
Taken together , these results suggest that NF-P1 and NF-P2 share a common DNA-binding subunit ( s ) .
That NF-P1 and NF-P2 differ in native molecular mass but share similar-size DNA-binding subunits suggests that NF-P1 differs from NF-P2 by having additional non-DNA-binding subunits .
It is speculated that the higher-molecular-weight species present in the B1 complex eluate might represent cross-linked entities which contain both the DNA-binding and the non-DNA-binding subunit ( s ) .
Additional experiments , in particular the V8 6698 KOJIZUMI ET AL .
mapping , are being carried out to clarify whether the similar-size DNA-binding subunits present in NF-P1 and NF-P2 are in fact identical .
DISCUSSION During CTL activation , a number of genes , including that encoding perforin , become transcriptionally active .
In view of the tight regulation of the perforin gene , we have attempted to dissect the mechanisms controlling its expression .
In this study , we have partially elucidated the promoter and regulatory sequences for mouse Pfp by using CAT reporter constructs .
We have concentrated on studying the 5'-flanking sequences only up to residue -700 , since the promoter and important regulatory elements for most genes usually reside not too far away from the transcription initiation site .
Results obtained in our present study showed that the 5'-flanking sequence up to residue -141 contains an essential promoter activity for Pfp , which is in agreement with a report published while this paper was being prepared ( 22 ) .
Sequence comparison has revealed several potential regulatory elements , including the TATA box-like , GC box-like , and AP-2 binding site-like elements present within the promoter region .
In our present study , a positive and a negative regulatory function were identified in the regions of residues -412 through -566 and -567 through -700 , respectively , as judged from the functional analysis of the CAT reporter constructs ( Fig .
1B ) .
Although the Pfp promoter and the upstream regions appeared to regulate gene expression efficiently in CTLs transiently transfected with the reporter constructs , they also drove the gene expression in non-CTLs in a similar manner .
Differing from the results reported by others ( 22 ) , we have not identified any region that controls Pfp expression in a reciprocal fashion in perforin-positive and perforin-negative cells .
The reasons for this discrepancy are currently unclear .
A more detailed and extensive functional analysis of the 5'-flanking sequences of mouse Pfp will be required in order to resolve this issue .
In the present study , we have focused on ( i ) fine mapping the positive regulatory element present between residues -412 and -566 and ( ii ) identifying the cognate trans-acting factors .
By means of EMSA and mutational analysis , we have identified two DNA-binding proteins , NF-P1 and NF-P2 , that interact with a particular motif within this region .
These two proteins displayed three prominent features .
Firstly , NF-P1 was ubiquitously found in all cell types examined , whereas NF-P2 appeared to be present exclusively in killer lymphocytes ( Fig .
2A ) .
Secondly , NF-P1 and NF-P2 were reciprocally and specifically modulated in killer cells upon activation ( Fig .
2A ) .
Thirdly , both proteins bound to an identical 9-mer purine-rich sequence , 5 !
-ACAGGA AGT ( residues -505 through -497 ; designated the NF-P motif [ Fig .
4 ] ) .
All these three features suggest the involvement of NF-P1l1 and NF-P2 in the cell-type-specific Pfp transcription .
Sequence comparison revealed that the NF-P motif is highly homologous to the known binding sites for the Ets proteins , which generally consist of purine-rich 9- to 11-mer sequences with a core motif , GGAA/T ( 7 , 16 , 20 , 31 , 45 ) .
The Ets proteins , which are products of the ets proto-oncogene family ( 25 , 44 ) , have recently been shown to be a new and large group of transcription activators ( 16 , 25 ) involved in the transcription of genes encoding a variety of proteins across a wide range of cell types .
Several Ets family members have been shown to play a crucial role in the differential expression of T-cell-specific genes , such as the T-cell recep- Mor .

tor and IL-2 ( 13 , 20 ) .
Since NF-P1 and NF-P2 are present in T-cell populations ( Fig .
2A ) , we have specifically examined their relationship with two known T-cell Ets proteins , Ets-1 and NF-AT/Elf-1 ( 13 , 36 , 38 ) .
The results obtained from cross-competition experiments showed that NF-P1 and NF-P2 share a certain degree of DNA-binding specificity with Ets-1 and , therefore , may be Ets-related proteins ( Fig .
6A ) .
They are , however , distinct from Ets-1 and NF-AT/ Elf-1 .
This conclusion is supported by the differences in molecular sizes and binding specificities of the proteins bound to each of the three oligonucleotide probes encoding the NF-P motif and the putative Ets-1 and NF-AT/EIf-1-binding sites , as observed for CTLL-R8 ( Fig .
6 ) , YAC-1 , EL-4 , and human Jurkat cells ( 17a ) .
Considering the similarities between various Ets-binding sequences and the presence of multiple Ets family members in T cells , it is possible that the Ets-1 oligonucleotide tested might have formed complexes with other Ets-related proteins , instead of the genuine Ets-1 .
The difference in the mobilities of the complexes formed with different oligonucleotide probes tested , therefore , does not necessarily indicate that NF-P1 and NF-P2 are distinct from Ets-1 .
To rule out this possibility , we performed EMSA in the presence of either anti-Ets-1 or anti-Ets-2 monoclonal antibody .
On the basis of the results that these antibodies neither blocked the formation of B1-B2 with OL-2 nor induced a super-shift of B1-B2 ( Fig .
6C ) , it appears unlikely that either NF-P1 or NF-P2 is identical to Ets-1 or Ets-2 .
Given the complexity and the widespread nature of both the Ets-related proteins and their cognate binding sequences , proper interaction between these trans-and cis-acting elements obviously requires certain regula-tion .
It has been suggested that the differences in the sequences flanking the GGAA/T core play a role in controlling the specific recognition by different Ets family proteins ( 31 , 45 ) .
Although an EBS-specific probe , with a sequence highly homologous to the NF-P motif ( AgAGGAAGT ) , could efficiently bind Ets-1 or NF-AT/Elf-1 proteins ( 43 ) , the genuine NF-P motif exhibited low or virtually no affinity for Ets-1 and NF-AT/EIf-1 ( Fig .
6 ) .
These results suggest that the 5 ' end and/or the flanking nucleotides of the NF-P motif discriminate against various Ets proteins and allow only the specific interaction with NF-P1 and NF-P2 .
In this respect , it has recently been reported that the 3'-end residues of the EBS may be involved in determining the specific interaction of each EBS motif with its corresponding Ets family member ( 43 ) .
Another possible controlling mechanism is based on the interaction of Ets proteins with other proteins , which then confers the specificity of binding of Ets proteins to unique EBSs ( 7 ) .
Whether this protein-protein interaction also determines the specific binding of NF-P1 and NF-P2 to the NF-P motif still remains to be investigated .
In addition to Ets-1 and NF-AT/Elf-1 , three other members of the Ets family , Ets-2 , Fli-1 , and GABPa , are known to be expressed in T cells ( 2-4 , 19 ) .
However , NF-P1 and NF-P2 also seem to be different from all of them .
Ets-2 is generally thought to display a binding specificity similar to that of Ets-1 ( 43 , 45 ) and most likely is distinct from NF-P1 and NF-P2 .
The inability of anti-Ets-2 antibody to modify the migration of B1-B2 is also in favor of this conclusion .
Fli-1 is a single-polypeptide factor ( 2 ) , whereas NF-P1 and NF-P2 appear to be composed of at least two polypeptide subunits ( Fig .
7B and C ) .
GABPa , which forms an a , B ; tetramer with the non-DNA-binding subunit GABPRG ( 19 , 39 ) , possesses a molecular mass of 51 kDa , which is significantly different from those of NF-P1 and NF-P2 ( Fig .
7B and C ) .
Furthermore , Fli-1 and GABPa are reported to be Vor .
13 , 1993 constitutively expressed in thymus and spleen cells ( 2 , 19 , 39 ) , while NF-P2 seems to be induced only upon cell activation ( Fig .
2A ) .
Although it is unclear whether the expression of Fli-1 and GABPa will be further up-regulated upon cell activation , it is tempting to conclude that , on the basis of the characteristics discussed above , NF-P1 and NF-P2 are distinct from either Fli-1 or GABPa .
The definite identities of NF-P1 and NF-P2 , nonetheless , can be resolved only when the amino acid or cDNA sequences of these proteins become available .
| EBS has been identified in different promoters/enhancers of different viral and mammalian genes .
Regulation of the transcription of these genes often correlates with the presence of Ets-related proteins .
Most known mammalian Ets family members are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and presumably contribute to the regulation of cell- or tissue-specific gene transcription .
For instance , Ets-1 and NF-AT/EIf-1 are preferentially expressed in T cells ( 3 , 36 , 38 ) ; PU.1 is expressed in macrophage and B cells ( 17 ) ; elk- ] is expressed in lung and testis ( 34 ) ; and PEA 3 is expressed in epididymis and brain tissue ( 46 ) .
NF-P2 identified in the present study appears to be a novel killer cell-specific Ets-related protein .
Although the biological function of this factor remains somewhat obscure , two lines of evidence support the role of NF-P2 as a killer cell-specific activator for mouse Pfp .
Firstly , NF-P2 was detected only in lymphocytes with a killer phenotype , and its expression could be modulated by reagents known to activate T cells and up-regulate perforin message levels .
Secondly , the NF-P motif to which NF-P2 binds was capable of enhancing gene expression when the particular reporter construct ( pCAT .
, , ; , , ) was transiently expressed in CTLL-R8 but not in EL-4 ( Fig .
5 ) .
That the functional activity of pCAT , , ; , , did not lead to a greater CAT expression driven by pCAT_ ; 4 , ( Fig .
5 ) implies that the NF-P motif is not the only positive regulatory element present within that region of Pfp .
In this regard , sequences homologous to the AP-1- and AP-2-binding sites were also identified near the NF-P motif in the -flanking region of mouse Pfp .
Precedents showing that Ets proteins interact with AP-1 and/or other transcription factors so as to become functionally active have been reported ( 9 , 26 , 28 , 33 ) .
It is likely that , for Pfp , NF-P1 and NF-P2 also play a regulatory role by cooperating with proteins bound to either the other regulatory elements or the basal promoter , thereby suppressing or initiating the gene expression in perforin-negative or perforin-positive cells .
Since NF-P1 was found to be present in all cell types examined , it may simply bind to the NF-P motif and hence prevent the subsequent binding or interaction of other factors which , together with NF-P2 , would form an active transcription machinery .
Upon activation of the killer cells , NF-P1 may either be displaced or replaced by NF-P2 or , alternatively , be transformed into NF-P2 ( Fig .
8 ; see below ) , which then assembles into the effective transcription machinery .
Nevertheless , the possibility that NF-P1 could directly suppress the basal and inducible transcription of Pfp in non-CTLs and resting CTLs , much like what ETs-1 does to the T-cell receptor-B gene ( 25 ) , still can not be ruled out .
The precise functions of NF-P1 and NF-P2 , therefore , await clarification through further in vitro transcription assays with the purified proteins .
The possibility of the NF-P motif as a killer cell-specific regulatory element for Pfp is further strengthened by sequence comparison with human Pfp .
The NF-P motif and its flanking region are found to be also well conserved in the human gene .

Hypothetical models for the involvement of the NF-P motif and NF-P1 and NF-P2 in cell-specific transcription of mouse Pfp .
( A ) Upon activation , NF-P1 , which originally occupies the NF-P motif and prevents other transcription factors from binding to the nearby regulatory elements , may be expelled .
NF-P2 and other factors are now allowed to access the DNA and initiate efficient transcription in a cooperative fashion .
( B ) The non-DNA-binding subunits which block the binding of other transcription factors are released from the NF-P1 complex upon activation .
The trimmed NF-P2 interacts with the other transcription factor and enhances transcription .

the mouse sequence between residues -522 and -491 ( with a 27 of 32 bases identity ) .
Sequence comparison showed that the human NF-P motif counterpart resides between residues -618 and -610 , consisting of 5'-gCAGGAAGT ( with an eight of nine bases identify to the mouse NF-P ) .
On the basis of this , it is postulated that the highly conserved NF-P motif should play an important role in the perforin gene expression .
Systematic mutational analysis addressing the precise function of this motif and its relationship with other potential regulatory elements in controlling killer cell-specific Pfp expression is currently being performed .
With respect to the molecular structure of NF-P1 and NF-P2 , UV cross-linking experiments revealed that the two factors contained similar-size DNA-binding subunits ( Fig .
7B and C ) .
NF-P1 , however , had a higher native molecular mass than NF-P2 ( Fig .
7A ) .
This difference in molecular mass may be attributed to an additional NF-Pl-specific 6700 KOIZUMI ET AL .
protein component ( s ) that does not bind DNA .
The postulated non-DNA-binding subunit ( s ) , however , may be in close proximity to DNA .
The results obtained from UV cross-linking experiments revealed that two high-molecular-weight species , in addition to the dominant common subunits , were eluted from Bl ( Fig .
7C ) , suggesting that the different subunits of NF-P1 might have been cross-linked together and migrated as undissociated complexes even in the presence of SDS and reducing agent .
This kind of close spatial relationship which leads to cross-linking of the non-DNA-binding unit to DNA has previously been reported for GABP ( 39 ) .
Cross-linking of two proteins , which bind to adjacent DNA-binding sequences , forming an SDS-resistant complex , has been observed for PU.1 and its axillary factor ( 33 ) .
The possibility that NF-P1 is an alternative and inactive form of NF-P2 is further supported by our recent finding that NF-P1 may be converted into NF-P2 upon treatment with denaturing agents such as SDS plus Nonidet P-40 or guani-dine hydrochloride ( 13a ) .
A similar model has recently been proposed for the pancreas-specific transcription factor PTF1 , in which the nuclear form PTFla differs from the cytoplasmic form B by an additional protein component which lacks the DNA-binding activity ( 37 ) .
Therefore , it is possible that cell stimulations result in the release of the additional subunit ( s ) from NF-P1 exclusively in killer lymphocytes for reasons as yet unclear .
The loss of the additional subunit ( s ) may result in the conversion of NF-P1 ( transcriptionally inactive ) into NF-P2 ( transcriptionally ac-tive ) ( Fig .
8B ) .
This postulation is consistent with the B1-B2 modulation observed in EMSA ( Fig .
2A ) , since the hypothetical conversion should lead to the decrease of NF-P1 and the increase of NF-P2 , which were indeed observed .
In vitro reconstitution and dissociation analyses are being carried out to further test this hypothesis .
