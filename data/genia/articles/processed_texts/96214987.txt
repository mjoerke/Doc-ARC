Transcriptional Regulation of the Interleukin-2 Gene in Normal Human Peripheral Blood T Cells CONVERGENCE OF COSTIMULATORY SIGNALS AND DIFFERENCES FROM TRANSFORMED T CELLS* ( Received for publication , September 27 , 1995 , and in revised form , December 20 , 1995 ) Christopher C. W. Hughes $ # and Jordan S. Pober From the Molecular Cardiobiology Program , Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , Connecticut 06536 To study transcriptional regulation in normal human T cells , we have optimized conditions for transient transfection .
Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) promoter-reporter gene behavior closely parallels the endogenous gene in response to T cell receptor and costimulatory signals .
As assessed with mutagenized promoters , the most important IL-2 cis-regulatory elements in normal T cells are the proximal AP-1 site and the NF-KB site .
Both primary activation , with phytohemagglutinin or antibodies to CD3 , and costimulation , provided by pairs of CD2 antibodies or B7-positive ( B cells ) or B7-negative ( endothe-lial ) accessory cells , are mediated through the same cis-elements .
Interestingly , the nuclear factor of activated T cell sites are much less important in normal T cells than in Jurkat T cells .
We conclude that IL-2 transcriptional regulation differs in tumor cell lines compared with normal T cells and that different costimulatory signals converge on the same cis-elements in the IL-2 promoter .
The initiation of an immune response involves interaction between foreign antigenic peptide bound to major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) molecules on the antigen-presenting cell ( APC ) and a cognate antigen receptor on the T cell ( 1 ) .
Under physiological conditions , specific antigen-MHC complexes are usually limiting , and T cells require additional costimulatory signals to be fully activated ( 2 ) .
The major source of such signals appears to be direct interaction of cell surface ligands on the T cell and the APC .
T cells that receive the correct combination of T cell receptor ( TCR ) -mediated and costimulatory signals enter the cell cycle , express activation antigens such as CD69 and CD25 , and begin synthesis of several cytokines , including the T cell autocrine/ paracrine growth factor interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) ( 2 , 3 ) .
IL-2 is an essential factor required for progression of newly activated T cells from G , to S phase , and the quantity of IL-2 produced is a * This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants HL51014 and HL 48364 .

major determinant of whether an effective response can be generated .
Moreover , inadequate IL-2 synthesis can lead to T cell death or induction of a state of unresponsiveness known as clonal anergy ( 4 ) .
Numerous T cell surface molecules have been suggested as mediators of costimulatory signals , the best characterized being CD2 , interacting primarily with CD58 ( LFA-3 ) and CD59 on the APC ( 5-8 ) , and CD28 , interacting with CD80 ( B7-1 ) and CD86 ( B7-2/B70 ) on the APC ( 9-13 ) .
CTLA-4 is a second T cell molecule that interacts with the same ligands as CD28 and may also mediate costimulatory signals ( 14 ) , although this has been disputed ( 15 , 16 ) .
However , costimulatory activity is not limited to these molecules ( 17 , 18 ) .
Both the CD2 and CD28 pathways of costimulation are thought to increase the level of IL-2 transcription in human T cells , although this may not be the case for CD28 in murine T cell clones ( 19 ) .
CD28-mediated signals may additionally stabilize IL-2 mRNA and affect post-transcriptional nuclear processing ( 19 , 20 ) .
The IL-2 gene is not actively transcribed in resting T cells .
Transcription of IL-2 can be detected as early as 40 min after activation , leading to peak levels of mRNA around 6 h and a return to near zero levels by 12-18 h ( 2 , 5 ) .
Approximately 300 base pairs of the IL-2 promoter are sufficient to confer cell-specific , inducible expression to reporter gene constructs ( 21 ) , although other regulatory sequences may lie outside of this region ( 22 ) .
Within these 300 base pairs , several transcription factor-binding sites have been identified as positive regulatory elements in tumor T cells ( see Table II ) , including proximal and distal specific sequences for the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) ( 21 , 23 , 24 ) and proximal and distal sequences for AP-1 ( 25 , 26 ) , for NF- « B ( 27 , 28 ) , for NIL-2A ( 29 ) , for CD28-activated factors ( 30 ) , and for octamer factors ( 31 ) .
An additional AP-1 site has also recently been identified just downstream of the dNFAT sequence ( 25 ) , which we have designated as NFAP-1 as it appears to be functionally a part of the `` NFAT `` binding sequence .
Also , a binding site for SP1 and EGR-1 has been identified immediately upstream of the distal NFAT site ( 32 ) .
Many of these sites vary from consensus sequences in other genes , and it appears that these differences account , at least in part , for the T cell-specific expression of the IL-2 gene ( 33 ) .
Activation of T cells through the TCR-CD3 signaling pathway leads to the activation of transcription factors specific to several of these sites .
It has been proposed that costimulatory signals increase transcription by either 1 ) altering the composition of transcription factors that bind to sites targeted by TCR/CD3-derived signals or 2 ) inducing new factors that bind to novel combinations of sites .
We have previously presented evidence that human umbilical vein endothelial cell ( EC ) costimulation modifies the composition of the AP-1 complex binding to the proximal AP-1 ( pAP-1 ) site in mitogen-activated T 5369 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 5370 IL-2 Transcription in Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes cells ( 34 ) .
Furthermore , in murine LBRM-33 cells , IL-1 induces c-Jun , which combines with c-Fos protein induced by TCR-mediated signals , and binds to the AP-1 sites ( 85 ) .
IL-1 also induces AP-1 proteins in mouse EL-4 cells ( 36 ) .
However , normal human T cells constitutively express high levels of c-Jun and do not respond to IL-1 as a costimulator ( 34 ) .
In Jurkat cells , CD28 has been found to induce a transcription factor composed of NFKB1 ( p50 ) , RelA ( p65 ) , and c-Rel ( 37 , 38 ) that binds to a variant NF- « B site called the CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) ( 39 ) .
Recently , this site has been found to be also targeted by signals other than CD28 ( 40 ) .
It is not known whether different accessory cell types activate different combinations of nuclear factors .
Much of the information on IL-2 transcription has been obtained from studies of tumor cell lines such as Jurkat , LBRM-33 , and EL-4 , although recently , the role of NF- « B regulation in IL-2 transcription has been studied in CD4* T cell clones ( 41 ) .
Little information is available on transcriptional control in freshly isolated normal human T cells .
The major barrier to such studies has been technical ; it is very difficult to measure the low transcriptional rate of the IL-2 gene observed in normal T cells by conventional assays , such as nuclear run-off .
Also , such cells are generally resistant to transfection by reporter genes .
It has been reported that human peripheral blood mononuclear cells can be made transfection-competent by a brief period of suboptimal stimulation with the polyclonal mitogenic lectin phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) ( 42 ) .
Unfortunately , this approach has proven inconsistent and has not been widely used .
Here we describe an optimization of this technique that permits routine measurement of IL-2 transcription , which is responsive to TCR and costimulatory signals , in small numbers of normal human blood T cells .
In this study , we have used this model to characterize IL-2 transcription in normal human T cells and find that the nuclear factor-binding sites that are important in these cells differ from those required for optimal transcription in Jurkat cells .
Furthermore , we have characterized the sites required for responsiveness to various costimulatory signals and accessory cell types .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Preparation and Transfection of T Cells-Normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were prepared by centrifugation of whole blood over lymphocyte separation medium according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Litton Bionetics , Kensington , MD ) .
Blood was obtained by venipuncture of normal healthy donors .
Cells were cultured for 19.5-20 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum , antibiotics ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) , and 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol with 1 ug/ml PHA-L ( Sigma ) at 3 X 10° cells/ml to induce transfection competence .
After washing , cells were resuspended in fresh lymphocyte medium at 2 X 10¢/ml .
Aliquots of 0.25 ml were electroporated in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 250 V and 960 microfarads at room temperature in the presence of 60 ug/ml reporter gene DNA ( see below ) .
Where different mutant promoters were being compared in a single experiment , pXGH ( growth hormone driven by the metallothionein promoter ) or pCMV-B-gal ( B-galactosidase driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter ) ( 10 pg/ml ) was added to control for transfection efficiency .
Normalizing for transfection efficiency was not necessary when a single promoter ( usually wild-type ) was being assayed under different condi-tions ; here separate transfections were pooled before use .
The gap width of the cuvettes was 0.4 em , which resulted in a 7 of 45-50 ms. Jurkat cells , treated with PHA in parallel with PBMC , were electroporated under the same conditions , except that a volume of 0.5 ml was used , which reduced r to 20-25 ms. After electroporation , cells were immediately removed and added to 10 ml of medium , washed , and resuspended in fresh medium .
Cells were plated ( see below ) after resting for 2 h at 37 °C .
Sorting of Cells by FACS-PBMC were electroporated as described above and then incubated with antibodies directly conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or phycoerythrin for 20 min on ice in phos-phate-buffered saline , 0.1 % mouse serum .
After washing , cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium , 0.5 % fetal calf serum , and aliquots were sorted on a FACScan cell sorter ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) .
mAbs used were as follows : anti-CD4-fluorescein isothiocyanate and anti-CD8-phycoerythrin against T cells ( Sigma ) , anti-CD19-phycoerythrin against B cells , and anti-CD14-fluorescein isothiocyanate against monocytes ( the latter two from Becton Dickinson ) .
Detection of Reporter Genes-For detection of luciferase and B-galactosidase activity , plates were spun down , and 150 ul of medium was removed ( this was saved for IL-2 bioassay ; see below ) .
To the remaining 50 pl containing the cells was added 100 pl of 1.5 X reporter lysis buffer ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .
This amount of medium did not interfere significantly with the subsequent assays .
Light output from luciferase was assayed in a luminometer ( Berthold LB9501 , Wallac , Gaithers-burg , MD ) using acetyl-CoA to prolong the usable signal ( Promega ) .
Forty ul of lysate was assayed in 100 pl of assay buffer .
Experiments were performed in triplicate , and results are expressed as mean + S.E .
Human growth hormone secreted into the medium was detected by immunoradioisotopic assay ( Nichols Institute , San Juan Capistrano , CA ) .
B-Galactosidase activity was measured using a commercially available kit ( Promega ) .
Culture of Endothelial Cells and B Cells with T Lymphocytee-Human umbilical vein EC were plated in fibronectin-coated round bottom 96-well plates and grown to confluence in medium M199 containing 20 % fetal bovine serum , antibiotics , endothelial cell growth supplement , and heparin as described previously ( 43 , 44 ) .
B cells ( 1 x 10*/well ) were suspended in lymphocyte medium and plated into round bottom 96-well plates .
After transfection and washing , T cells ( 3 x 10°/well ) were added to EC , to B cells , or alone to fibronectin-coated wells in lymphocyte medium .
This number of T cells represents a ratio of ~30:1 over APC .
The same number of Jurkat T cells was added to similarly coated wells .
PHA was used at 5 ug/ml .
Anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 was bound to anti-mouse Ig-coated beads according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Dynal , Inc. , Great Neck , NY ) .
The final concentration of bead-bound mAb in the well was ~0.5-1 ug/ml .
Phorbol ester ( PMA ; Sigma ) was used at 10 ng/ml and ionomycin at 200 ng/ml .
The stimulating anti-CD2 mAbs CB6 and GD10 ( a gift of Chris Benjamin , Biogen Inc. , Cambridge , MA ) were purified from ascites and used at 1 ug/ml .
Anti-CD2 mAb TS2/18 and anti-LFA-3 mAb TS2/9 ( a gift of Tim Springer , Center for Blood Research , Boston ) were purified from ascites and used at 10 pg/ml .
Anti-CD28 mAbs 3D10 ( a gift of Gary Gray , Repligen , Cambridge , MA ) , 9.3 ( a gift of J. Ledbetter , Bristol-Myers Squibb , Seattle ) , and L293 ( Becton Dickinson ) were used at 1 ug/ml .
CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein , control Ig fusion protein , mAb 9.3 Fab frag-ments , and control Fab fragments were also gifts of Gary Gray and were used at 10 pg/ml .
IL-2 Bioassay-The concentration of IL-2 in the medium was determined by HT-2 bioassay as described previously ( 84 ) .
HT-2 cells were a gift of A. Abbas ( Brigham and Women 's Hospital , Boston ) .
At least three serial dilutions of each supernatant were tested , and results are shown as mean + S.D .
None of the reagents used were found to significantly alter HT-2 cell survival .
Generation of IL-2 Promoter Mutations-A 600-base pair HindIII fragment of the human IL-2 promoter ( a gift of G. Crabtree , Stanford University , Stanford , CA ) was subcloned into the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2-Enhancer ( Promega ) , and the orientation was confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping .
Three base pair mutations in individual cis-elements were generated by recombinant PCR ( 45 ) .
Three base pair mutations were selected that altered nucleotides known to be critical for nuclear factor binding ( see Table II ) .
Reaction conditions were as follows : 100 pg of template , 20 pmol of each primer , 2 mM MgCl , , and 200 uM each dNTP in 1 x polymerase buffer with 1 unit of Tag polymerase in a final volume of 50 pl ; initial denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min ; amplification for 30 cycles ( 95 °C for 30 s , 50-53 °C ( depending on primer pair ) for 30 s , and 72 °C for 1 min ) ; and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min .
Overhangs at the 3'-end , generated by Tag terminal transferase activity , were removed by treatment with T4 DNA polymerase ( 46 ) .
Amplification products were separated on 1.5 % low melting point agarose gels ( Sea Plaque LM , FMC Corp. BioProducts , Rockland , ME ) ; bands were cut out and purified ; and the two halves of the promoter generated by the first round of PCR were then recombined by PCR .
The promoters were subcloned back into pGL2-Enhancer , and the sequences were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing ( U. S. Biochemical Corp. ) .
Large-scale DNA preparations were performed by selective ad-sorption to resin columns according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( QIAGEN Inc. , Chatsworth , CA ) .
Experiments comparing different promoter mutations were performed with at least two independent plasmid preparations .
Experiments using the wild-type promoter were repeated with more than five independent plasmid preparations .

Nuclear extract , normalized for protein concentration , was prepared from PHA-activated PBMC and analyzed as described previously ( 34 ) .
RESULTS Transfection of Normal Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes-To investigate the regulation of IL-2 transcription in normal human T cells , we have developed a reproducible assay based on transient transfection by electroporation of IL-2 promoter-luciferase reporter gene constructs .
The technique is sufficiently sensitive to detect luciferase activity in as few as 8 X 10 % cells ( 40 ul of a 150-ull lysate ) , allowing routine analysis of microwell cultures .
Circulating human T cells are not transfectable .
This has led most investigators to work with T cell tumor lines , cells that may not accurately reflect normal T cell behavior ( see below ) .
However , we have found that the T cells in a freshly isolated population of PBMC , upon stimulation with a concentration of PHA ( 1 ug/ml ) that is insufficient to cause significant IL-2 secretion , pass through a window of transfection competency .
The mitogen PHA polyclonally activates T cells by binding with high affinity to the TCR , but not to CD3 , and inducing calcium fluxes in a similar manner to anti-CD3 or anti-TCR mAb ( 47 ) .
Thus , presentation of antigen by MHC molecules is bypassed .
In the two separate experiments shown in Fig .
1 , PBMC were transfected by electroporation as described under `` Experimental Procedures `` at the indicated times after PHA stimulation ; luciferase was assayed in all cases after restimulation for 6 h with PHA ( 5 pg/ml ) plus PMA ( 50 nm ) .
A sharp peak of luciferase activity was found for transfection at 20 h ( Experiment 1 ) and 19.5 h ( Experiment 2 ) .
We have found consistently high responses when cells are transfected during this window .
To determine the time course of transcription mediated by the IL-2 promoter in transfected normal T cells , we transfected cells as described , stimulated them with optimal doses of PHA and PMA , and then assayed luciferase activity and secreted IL-2 over the next 48 h. As shown in Fig .

Normal T cells were transfected with the wild-type IL-2 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid ( 60 ug/ml ) as described under `` Experimental Procedures `` and cultured in the presence of PHA ( 5 ug/ml ) and PMA ( 50 nM ) for the indicated times before harvest of the supernatant for IL-2 bioassay and of the cells for luciferase assay .
Means and standard errors are as described for Fig .

between 4 and 8 h and declines rapidly to ~20 % of peak levels by 18 h and then more slowly to near basal levels by 48 h. These kinetics are consistent with previously reported kinetics of mRNA appearance following the activation of resting human blood T cells ( 5 ) and parallel the behavior of IL-2 promoter-reporter genes in the widely used T cell tumor line , Jurkat ( data not shown and Ref .
2 ) .
More important , no transcription was detectable in transfected PBMC in the absence of additional stimulation , despite the prior exposure to low concentrations of PHA .
Secreted IL-2 was measured as an indicator of the activity of the endogenous gene in the medium of the same cultures .
No secreted IL-2 is detectable in the absence of stimulation , indicating that the native IL-2 gene is not active as a result of the prior manipulations to render the cells transfection-competent .
IL-2 is first measurable in the medium at ~3-6 h and then rapidly increases over the next 20 h. Levels begin to plateau after ~24 h. These data are also consistent with previously published reports of resting T cells ( 34 , 48 ) .
The Transfected IL-2 Promoter Can Only Be Activated in T Cells-An important consideration in interpreting our data is that we transfect a mixed population of cells that , in addition to T cells , contains monocytes , B cells , natural killer cells , and dendritic cells .
We have found that highly purified T cells can not be made transfection-competent by treatment with PHA alone ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , to determine which cell types in the unfractionated PBMC population are expressing the IL-2 promoter-luciferase construct under the stimulation conditions we use , we sorted cells by FACS after transfection using directly conjugated mouse anti-human mAb specific for CD4* T cells , CD8* T cells , B cells , and monocytes .
Sorting produced populations of > 99.5 % purity .
When assayed for luciferase activity , only CD4* T cells and , to a lesser extent , CD8* T cells expressed significant activity in response to PHA plus PMA .
An equal number of monocytes or B cells ( 10-fold more than are present in unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cell preparations ) expressed little to no activity ( Fig .
3 ) .

The transfected IL-2 promoter is only active in T cells .
Total PBMC were transfected with the wild-type IL-2 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid ( 60 ug/ml ) as described under `` Experimental Procedures `` and then sorted by FACS using mAbs specific for CD4 ( T cells ) , CD8 ( T cells ) , CD19 ( B cells ) , and CD14 ( monocytes ) .
Sorting produced populations of > 99.5 % purity .
IL-2 secretion for the purified stimulated populations was as follows : CD4* cells , 29 units/ml ; CD8 cells , 2 units/ml ; and B cells and monocytes , not detectable .
Means and standard errors are as described for Fig .

Luciferase is detectable in this population when the SV40 promoter is used to drive reporter gene expression ( pGL2-Con ) , indicating that some cells in the non-T cell population are transfectable ( data not shown ) .
In the experiment shown in Fig .
3 ( and data not shown ) , the endogenous gene , measured as IL-2 secretion , was also only active in the T cells ( CD4* , 29 units/ml ; CD8 * , 2 units/ml ; and monocytes , B cells , and non-T cells , not detectable ) .
These data confirm that in the population of cells used in our experiments , only CD4* T cells and , to a lesser extent , CD8* T cells express the transfected IL-2 promoter-luciferase construct .
Response of the Transfected Cells to Various Stimulators and Costimulators-We next investigated the response of the IL-2 promoter in normal T cells to various primary ( T cell receptor-directed ) and secondary ( costimulatory ) signals in order to determine if transfected cells behave similarly to normal un-transfected cells .
It is well established that in normal T cells , the IL-2 promoter responds well to a combination of ionomycin , a calcium ionophore , and PMA , but only weakly to either agent alone ( 48 ) .
We have confirmed that the transfected promoter behaves similarly ( Table I , Experiment 1 ) and that it parallels the response of the endogenous gene in these cells , measured as secreted IL-2 .
As we reported above , both the lectin PHA and anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 , which activate T cells via the T cell receptor , also activate transcription of the reporter gene ( Table I , Experiment 2 ) .
PHA , which alone provides an exceptionally strong signal that in many cases bypasses the need for a co-stimulator , activated the IL-2 promoter almost 4-fold above background levels and induced significant IL-2 synthesis .
OKT3 alone , however , only weakly activated the promoter and did not induce IL-2 synthesis .
CD28 ligation on T cells provides strong costimulatory signals , but antibody to CD28 alone only weakly activated the promoter and again did not induce significant IL-2 synthesis .
However , anti-CD28 mAb synergized with TaBuE I Transfected T cells respond to several different primary and secondary activation signals Transfected T cells ( 8 X 10°/well ) were cultured with the indicated reagents at the following concentrations : ionomycin ( 200 ng/ml ) , PMA ( 10 nm ) , PHA ( 6 pg/ml ) , OKT3 ( 0.5-1 ug/ml ) , mAb 9.3 ( 1 ug/ml ) , and anti-CD2 mAbs CB6 + GD10 ( 1 pg/ml ) .
Cells were analyzed for luciferase and secreted IL-2 as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
Means of three wells are shown .

OKT3 to stimulate both IL-2 transcription and IL-2 synthesis .
Finally , it has been previously shown that pairs of anti-CD2 mAbs can activate T cells and induce IL-2 synthesis in the absence of T cell receptor ligation .
As shown in Table I ( Experiment 2 ) , such mAbs stimulate IL-2 promoter-dependent transcription in transfected normal cells .
Effect of B7-positive and B7-negative Accessory Cells on IL-2 Promoter-dependent Transcription-We next examined the effect of different accessory cell populations on costimulation of IL-2 promoter-dependent transcription and IL-2 synthesis in normal T cells .
We compared B cells , which express CD28 ligands , with EC , which do not .
Three B cell lines were tested : JY , an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed line ; Raji , an Epstein-Barr virus-positive Burkitt 's lymphoma line ; and BJAB , an Epstein-Barr virus-negative Burkitt 's lymphoma line .
All three lines expressed CD28 ligands , and results were similar , except that JY and BJAB cells were generally better costimulators of IL-2 synthesis than were Raji cells ; data from experiments with JY and BJAB cells are presented .
EC were tested from multiple donors with similar results , and representative results are shown .
As shown in Fig .
4A , both B cells and EC augmented reporter gene transcription in PHA-activated normal T cells above the level induced by PHA alone .
Over several experiments , augmentation ranged from 2- to 7-fold , with EC and B cells augmenting to approximately the same level .
Expression of the endogenous gene was also augmented , but B cells seemed to be much more effective at augmenting secreted IL-2 than were EC ( Fig .
4B ) .
Both B cells and EC also costimulated T cells purified by FACS .
In this case , little or no luciferase or secreted IL-2 was detectable in the absence of accessory cells .
IL-2 promoter-dependent transcription was detectable in both highly purified CD4* and CD8* T cells stimulated by accessory cells , and both cell types secreted IL-2 .
CD4* T cells were severalfold more responsive than CD8* T cells ( data not shown ) .
To identify the surface molecules involved in costimulation by B cells and EC , we used blocking antibodies and fusion proteins .
mAb to CD2 blocked transcription and IL-2 secretion induced by B cells or EC ( Fig .
4 , A and B ) .
Consistent with our previous findings ( 5 ) , anti-CD2 mAb could not completely inhibit EC costimulation .
Blocking of B cell costimulation with anti-CD2 mAb was also incomplete , ranging from 40 to 90 % .
Most experiments were performed with anti-CD2 mAb TS2/18 ; 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog IL-2 Transcription in Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes 5373 A 500 400 300 RLU 200 100 none EC BJAB Stimulating cell 4 B R Contro !

however , we obtained identical results using anti-CD2 mAbs 35.1 and TS1/8 or anti-LFA-3 mAb TS2/9 ( data not shown ) .
To investigate the role of CD28-mediated signals in this system , we used CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein , which binds to B7-1 and B7-2 and blocks interaction with their ligands , CD28 and CTLA-4 .
Consistent with our previous data demonstrating the absence of CD28 ligands on human EC and the lack of effect of CTLA-4-Ig or anti-CD28 mAb Fab fragments on EC costimulation of IL-2 secretion ( 49 ) , CTLA-4-Ig did not block EC costimulation of IL-2 promoter-dependent transcription ( Fig .
4A ) .
Similarly , this reagent did not block IL-2 secretion in response to EC .
In sharp contrast , however , CTLA-4-Ig was very effective at blocking the costimulatory effects of CD28 ligand-bear-ing B cells on both transcription ( Fig .
4A ) and IL-2 secretion ( Fig .
4B ) .
Indeed , CTLA-4-Ig completely inhibited the augmented secretion of IL-2 in response to B cell costimulation .
We have found substantially similar , although somewhat more variable , results using anti-CD28 mAb Fab fragments ( data not shown ) .
Analysis of IL-2 Promoter Elements in Human Peripheral Blood T Cells-In the next series of experiments , we examined the function of different sequence elements in the IL-2 promoter by transfection of normal human T cells .
Specific mutations were generated in several of the recognized cis-acting sites of the human IL-2 promoter by a recombinant PCR technique ( Table II ) .
Three base pair mutations were selected that altered nucleotides known to be critical for nuclear factor binding .
This approach allows sequences to be altered without affecting the spacing between individual sites .
The result of each mutagenesis reaction was confirmed by sequencing , and the functional significance of the mutation was tested by annealing the inside primers and using this double-stranded probe to compete for protein binding with the wild-type sequence in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
In all of the mutant constructs tested , the base pair changes we introduced were found to eliminate binding of the cognate transcription factors in vitro .
It should be noted , however , that lack of binding in vitro does not necessarily rule out binding of factors in vivo .
Representative data for the NF-kB site are shown in Fig .
5 .
In this experiment , nuclear factor bound to the wild-type NF- « B probe and was competed for by an excess of wild-type , but not mutant , probe .
Each of the mutant promoters was cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene and transfected into normal T cells along with either pXGH ( a growth hormone-expressing plasmid ) or pCMV-B-gal ( a B-galactosidase-expressing plasmid ) to normalize for transfection efficiency .

then stimulated with PHA or with PHA plus PMA and harvested 12 h later .
Levels of secreted IL-2 produced by the transfected cells varied by < 10 % between the different construct pools ( data not shown ) .
As shown in Fig .
6 , mutations in several sites reduced transcription in PHA-activated normal T cells , including the dNFAT , NF- « B , and pAP-1 sites .
Over several experiments , the pAP-1 site was consistently the most important single site .
Mutation of this element reduced transcription by 85-95 % .
Mutating the NFAP-1 or dAP-1 sites generally had small effects ( 0-30 % reduction ) , and in several experiments , mutating the dAP-1 site had no effect .
Interestingly , we noted a striking difference between normal T cells activated with PHA plus PMA and those activated with PHA alone .
Specifically , the NF- « B site appeared to be much more important in the absence of the strong protein kinase C activator PMA ( Fig .
6 ) .
We have repeated this experiment using normal T cells activated with anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 and find the same pattern as with PHA alone .
Under these conditions , the pAP-1 and NF- « B sites appear to be the dominant sites , and there are significant contributions from the NFAT and NFAP-1 sites as well as the pOCT site ( data not shown ) .
IL-2 Promoter cis-Elements Targeted by Different Accessory Cells-We have established that two different accessory cells , B cells and EC , costimulate T cells through different surface molecules .
EC engage T cell CD2 via LFA-3 ( and/or CD59 ) , but do not stimulate through CD28 .
Conversely , B cells stimulate T cells through CD2 and CD28 ( and/or CTLA-4 ) .

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis of nuclear factor binding to mutant NF- « B IL-2 promoter-binding site .
The inside PCR primers used to create specific mutations were annealed to form a double-stranded probe for competition .
The wild-type probe was end-labeled with [ y-* `` P ] JATP and incubated with 1-2 ug of nuclear extract for 10 min at room temperature in the presence of 100 ng of poly ( dl-dC ) and a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild-type ( WT ) or mutant ( MT ) competitor probe .
Bound and unbound probes were resolved on 6 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels , which were then dried and exposed to storage phosphor screens and analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager .
accessory cells may also stimulate through other pathways not examined in this report .
We next wished to determine whether these different accessory cells activate the IL-2 promoter via the same combination of promoter cis-elements or through novel combinations .
Peripheral blood T cells were transfected with the various mutant promoter constructs and then stimulated in the presence of B cells or EC .
As shown in Fig .
7A , mutations of the various cis-elements affect B cell and EC costimulation equally .
Specifically , mutations in the pAP-1 site or the NF- « B site were most effective in reducing transcription , with important contributions from the pOCT and NFAT sites .
The pNFAT site was consistently more important than the dNFAT site , although mutations in both were additive .
Interestingly , mutation of the CD28RE did not affect costimulation by the CD28 ligand-positive B cells , an unexpected result given the previous identification of this site as the target of CD28-mediated signaling .
Over several experiments , using B cells as costimulators , we consistently failed to see a reduction in transcription as a result of mutating this site .
Finally , we repeated these experiments to compare defined costimulatory antibodies with accessory cells .
We used an activating pair of anti-CD2 mAbs or an anti-CD28 mAb in conjunction with an anti-CD3 mAb ( Fig .
7B ) and compared these to EC and B cells ( Fig .
7C ) .
Again , the same combination of cis-regulatory elements was critical in each case .
The pAP-1 and NF- « B sites were most important for CD2- , CD28- , or accessory cell-mediated costimulation .
The pOCT and NFAT sites also contributed , along with the NFAP-1 site .
Interestingly , although the CD28RE mutation did not affect CD2- , B cell- , or EC-mediated costimulation , it did have a variable effect on anti-CD28 mAb-mediated transcription : in three of five experiments , we saw a 25-50 % reduction in transcription from the mutant CD28RE promoter compared with the wild-type promoter ( Fig .
7B and data not shown ) .

Cells were transfected with the wild-type ( WT ) and mutant ( mt ) IL-2 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids ( 60 pg/ml ! )
along with a B-galactosidase-expressing control plasmid ( 10 pg/ml ) as described under `` Experimental Procedures `` and cultured for 12 h before harvest of the supernatant for IL-2 bioassay and of the cells for B-galactosidase and luciferase assay .
Transfected normal T cells ( pretreated with 1 ug/ml PHA ) were restimulated with PHA ( 5 pg/ml ) and PMA ( 10 ng/ml ! )
( closed bars ) or with PHA alone ( open bars ) .
Luciferase expression for the different constructs was normalized to B-galactosidase , and then corrected expression of each construct was normalized to the wild type .
Uncorrected wild-type expression for normal T cells was 245 relative light units ( RLU ) .
Data are representative of one of three similar experiments .

Comparison of Normal T Cells with Jurkat Tumor Cells-The Jurkat T cell tumor line is the most widely used model for study of human transcriptional regulation of IL-2 .
Typically , these cells are stimulated with PHA plus PMA ; activation in the absence of PMA is ineffective .
In the experiments reported here , we also pretreated the Jurkat cells with low doses of PHA so that the conditions were comparable to those used for normal cells , although pilot experiments established that this treatment did not affect the observed results .
Results with Jurkat T cells differed in several respects from those observed with normal T cells examined in parallel ( Fig .
8 ) .
Most striking , mutation of the dNFAT and NFAP-1 sites was consistently much more effective at reducing transcription in Jurkat cells ( up to 75 % ) than were these same mutations in normal T cells ( 0-50 % ) .
These results are consistent with previously published reports detailing the importance of the dNFAT site in Jurkat cells ( 21 , 27 , 50 ) .
Mutation of the NF- « B site is without effect , but this may be attributable to the need to use PMA to activate the cells ( see above ) .
DISCUSSION Transfected normal human T cells provide a sensitive and physiologically relevant model for studying cytokine transcription .
We have used this system to analyze the regulation of IL-2 synthesis and find that the human IL-2 promoter is inducible in these cells and responds to the same primary and costimulatory signals as the endogenous promoter .
Furthermore , we find that the regulation of IL-2 transcription in normal T cells differs from that in the tumor cell line Jurkat .
Finally , we have shown that transfected normal human T cells respond to costimulation by different APC and that B cells and EC signal through different costimulatory ligands , but target the same cis-acting elements in the IL-2 promoter .

Comparison of nuclear factor-binding site mutations on IL-2 transcription in normal T cells versus Jurkat tumor T cells .
The normal T cell results are the same as those shown in Fig .
6 for cells activated by PHA plus PMA .
The conditions for transfection and activation of Jurkat cells are the same as for normal T cells .
Uncorrected wild-type expression for normal T cells was 245 relative light units ( RLU ) , and that for Jurkat cells was 67,599 relative light units .
Data are representative of one of three similar experiments .
d/pNFAT is a construct with both NFAT sites mutated .
WT , wild-type construct ; mt , mutant construct ; open bars , normal T cells + PHA + PMA ; closed bars , Jurkat tumor T cells ( JK ) + PHA + PMA .
In the experiments described here , we have transfected a mixed population of cells .
However , by use of FACS of transfected cells , we have determined that only T cells express the luciferase reporter gene and that only T cells secrete IL-2 .
CD4* T cells are severalfold more active in this respect than CD8 * T cells .
Thus , in this system , the IL-2 promoter is highly T cell-specific .
A potential limitation of these studies is that we must culture normal T cells with 1 ug/ml PHA to induce transfection competence .
Under these conditions , there is no significant IL-2 production .
IL-2 is required for progression of T cells from G ; to S phase ( 2 ) .
This treatment , therefore , probably moves the T cells from G , to G , .
However , several observations demonstrate that transfected normal T cells still respond similarly to freshly isolated resting T cells .
1 ) Once transfected , the cells do not secrete IL-2 or transcribe the reporter gene unless further activated with mitogen .
2 ) The kinetics of the transcriptional response parallel those of the endogenous IL-2 gene in resting T cells .
3 ) OKT3 signals are weak and must be costimulated by anti-CD28 mAb to activate optimal IL-2 transcription .
4 ) The cells can receive costimulation from APC .

The IL-2 promoter contains numerous transcription factor-binding sites .
Several of these have been shown by genomic footprinting to bind proteins , and some have been shown to be functional by transfection of mutant reporter gene constructs ( 21 , 24 , 28 , 35 , 39 , 41 , 50 ) .
However , nearly all of these studies have been done in tumor cell lines , with the assumption that gene regulation in these cells would be identical to that in normal T cells , and there is little or no direct information as to which sites are relevant for IL-2 transcription in normal nontransformed T cells .
A step toward analysis of the IL-2 promoter in vivo has been made by the generation of transgenic mice with the IL-2 promoter driving lacZ expression ( 51 ) .
This study suggests that differences between normal cells and tumor cells do exist .
In Jurkat cells , for example , we confirm that the dNFAT site is critical for inducible transcription regulated by the IL-2 promoter ( 50 ) .
The nearby sequence we have designated as NFAP-1 was equally important .
In normal T cells , however , these sites were far less important .
We found instead that the pNFAT site is more important than the dNFAT site and that the NF- « B and pAP-1 sites are quan-titatively most important .
Mutation of either element almost completely blocked transcription in PHA-stimulated normal T cells .
The recent generation of an NF-kB p50 knockout mouse suggests that the NF-kB site may be important in vivo as T cells from these mice failed to proliferate to mitogenic signals , suggesting a defect in the generation of IL-2 ( 52 ) .
Surprisingly , we found a difference in the importance of the NF- « B site in normal T cells in the presence and absence of PMA .
Specifically , in the presence of PMA , mutation of the NF-kB site reduced transcription by < 50 % .
However , when normal T cells were activated in the absence of PMA , by PHA , by OKT3 plus anti-CD28 mAb , or by pairs of anti-CD2 mAbs , mutation of the NF- « B site consistently reduced transcription by 75-90 % .
Most studies of Jurkat cells have used PHA plus PMA or ionomycin plus PMA to activate the cells .
This suggests that studies of tumor cells requiring the use of nonphysiologic activators such as PMA may additionally complicate interpretation of results .
APC activate T cells by presenting antigen in the context of self- MHC molecules and providing costimulatory signals such as those mediated by CD2 and CD28 .
We compared B cells , bone marrow-derived `` professional `` APC expressing B7 , with B7-negative EC , which have been described as `` semiprofes-sional `` APC for their ability to costimulate IL-2 transcription and secretion from mitogen-activated normal T cells ( 49 , 53 ) .
We have previously shown that EC can stimulate allogenic T cell proliferation ( 54 ) and do so because they provide costimulatory signals that result in augmented IL-2 transcription and secretion ( 34 ) .
EC signal T cells through LFA-3-CD2 and CD59-CD2 interaction and through a second , unidentified pathway ( 55 ) .
In this study , CD2 was found to be critical in mediating signals that resulted in enhanced IL-2 transcription and secretion when either B cells or EC were used as costimulators .
In contrast , the CD28 pathway proved to be critical for B cell costimulation of transcription and IL-2 secretion , but was not productively engaged by EC .
Thus , costimulation by two different accessory cells can be distinguished by the surface ligands through which they signal T cells .
It is likely that both B cells and EC also signal through other ligands , not addressed in this report .
An interesting finding was that transcription induced by B cells or EC was usually of comparable magnitude , whereas secreted IL-2 was usually greater from T cells costimulated by B cells .
One explanation for this finding is that B cells do increase transcription beyond that registered by the transfected promoter , but do so through a site outside of the 600 base pairs we used .
It is more likely that B cells , probably acting through CD28 , are affecting IL-2 levels post-transcriptionally .
Indeed , the increased secretion of IL-2 in response to B cell costimulation can be almost completely blocked by CTLA-4-Ig ( Fig .
4 ) .
It has been reported that CD28 signaling has effects on IL-2 stability as well as on processing of nuclear transcripts and export from the nucleus ( 19 , 20 ) .
A similar mechanism has also been described for regulation of IL-2 transcripts in the absence of CD28 signaling ( 56 ) .
These effects are likely specific for IL-2 mRNA and presumably would not affect the reporter gene .
A major conclusion of this study is that although different accessory cells costimulate T cells through different surface ligands , the same sites in the IL-2 promoter appear to be targeted .
Thus , for both B cell and EC costimulation , the NF- « B and pAP-1 sites and , to a lesser extent , the NFAT , NFAP-1 , and pOCT sites are critical .
This same combination of sites was also important for signaling by pairs of anti-CD2 mAbs .
A surprising finding in these studies was the failure of the CD28RE mutation to reduce transcription induced by B cell costimulation , given that the mutation muted the effects of anti-CD28 mAb .
T cell CD28 was productively engaged by B cell CD28 ligands in these experiments as CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein blocked augmentation of secreted IL-2 .
The most likely interpretation is that natural ligands for CD28 may deliver signals that differ from those produced by some anti-CD28 mAbs and that these signals do not induce activation of factors that bind to the CD28RE .
Indeed , a recent report suggests that not all signaling through CD28 is identical .
Using a panel of anti-CD28 mAbs , Nunés et al .
( 57 ) found that whereas a given pair of anti-CD28 mAbs may induce similar calcium fluxes in T cells , they can induce very different levels of IL-2 secretion .
The mAbs recognize several different epitopes on CD28 , and the implication is that signaling through CD28 ( perhaps involving different epitopes ) activates more than one signaling pathway .
Alternatively , B cells ( and potentially EC ) , unlike single mAbs , provide multiple costimulatory signals that result in expression of functionally redundant sets of transcription factors , obviating the role of factors bound to the CD28RE .
This interpretation presupposes that CD28-mediated signals target other sites in addition to the CD28RE .
Interestingly , the CD28RE has recently been shown to bind members of the NF- « B family of proteins , specifically NFKB1 ( p50 ) , RelA ( p65 ) and c-Rel ( 38 ) , suggesting that CD28 may also activate the NF- « B site .
However , in normal T cells , the NF-KB site and the CD28RE do not appear to be a functionally redundant pair since mutation of the NF- « B site can not be compensated for by a functional CD28RE .
Although the same combination of IL-2 promoter elements is targeted by different costimulatory molecules , we have not ruled out the possibility that different combinations of nuclear factors may bind to these sites .
Indeed , we have previously shown that when T cells are costimulated by EC , they express enhanced levels of c-Fos mRNA , and the AP-1 complex that binds to the pAP-1 site contains severalfold higher levels of Fos protein compared with cells activated in the absence of EC ( 34 ) .
Interestingly , a c-Fos knockout mouse has recently been generated that displays normal IL-2 induction , suggesting that other Fos proteins can substitute for c-Fos in these mice ( 58 ) .
There are also multiple NFAT proteins that may have differing roles under different conditions .
Thus , it is possible that in response to different accessory cells , sequential expression of nuclear factors , expression of different family members , or expression of factors with longer half-lives , for example , may affect transcription .
Indeed , IL-2 mRNA levels remain elevated longer in the presence than in the absence of EC costimula- 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog IL-2 Transcription in Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes tion . ``
The data presented in this study define the sites most relevant for future study of nuclear factor binding .
In conclusion , our findings suggest that the IL-2 promoter in normal T cells integrates signals by using a combination of several sites to activate transcription .
This model is in agreement with a previous proposal describing fine tuning of IL-2 transcription ( 83 ) .
Furthermore , these studies emphasize the feasibility of working with normal nontransformed cells and the possibility that such cells may differ in significant ways from the tumor cells that have become `` standard `` models for the study of transcriptional regulation .
