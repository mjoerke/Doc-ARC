Transactivation of the Interleukin-la Promoter by Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type I and Type II Tax Proteins By Naoki Mori and Diane Prager Human T-cell leukemia virus type | ( HTLV-l ) } -infected T-cell lines constitutively produce high levels of interleukin-1a ( IL-1a } .
To analyze the mechanisms that lead to the expression of IL-1a « in HTLV -- infected cell lines , we studied regulatory regions of the human IL-1 « promoter involved in activation of the IL-1a gene .
IL-1a promoter constructs drive transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter gene in HTLV-I~positive MT-2 cells , which constitutively produce IL-1a .
In a cotransfection assay , the Tax protein of both HTLV-I and HTLV-II specifically activated transcription from the IL-1a promoter in an uninfected Jurkat cell line .
A mutant Tax protein deficient in transactivation of genes by the nuclear factor ( NF ) -xB pathway was unable to induce transcriptional activity of IL-1 @ promoter-CAT constructs , but was rescued by exogenous provision of p65/p50 NF- « B .
We DULT T-CELL leukemia/lymphoma ( ATLL ) is one of the peripheral T-cell malignant neoplasms strongly associated with a retrovirus , human T-cell leukemia virus type-I ( HTLV-D. ' `` ATLL is characterized by high white blood cell counts with convoluted nuclei , hepatosplenomegaly , lymphadenopathy , skin lesions , frequently hypercalcemia , and a rapidly progressive terminal course . ``
'' Interleukin-1a @ ( IL-1 @ ) is not expressed by resting T lymphocytes and T-cell lines not infected by HTLV-II such as the Jurkat cell line .
Several investigators have reported that HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and leukemic cells from patients with ATLL aberrantly express IL-la mRNA .
`` * HTLV T cells constitutively secrete this cytokine into the conditioned medium of cell lines and leukemic cells from ATLL patients . ``
'' IL-1 has been shown to act as a potent osteoclast-activat-ing factor and to cause the bone resorption . ``
IL-1 can also produce neutrophilia , acute inflammatory protein secretion by hepatocytes , and fever in vivo .
`` * `` `` Many of these phenomena are also frequently associated with ATLL .
Thus , it is possible that IL-1 activation during HTLV-I infection contributes to these phenomena and clinical symptoms .

0006-497 1/96/8708-0023 $ 3.00/0 3410 found that two IL-1a « B-like sites ( positions -1,065 to -1,056 and +646 to +655 ) specifically formed a complex with NF- « B-containing nuclear extract from MT-2 cells and that NF- « B bound with higher affinity to the 3 ' NF- « B binding site than to the 5° NF-xB site .
Moreover , deletion of either 5 or 3 ' NF- « B sites reduced IL-1a « promoter activity in MT-2 cells and transactivation of the IL-1a promoter by exogenous NF- « B and Tax in Jurkat cells .
These data suggest a general role for Tax induction of IL-1 @ gene transcription by the NF- « B pathway .
Expression of IL-ia @ by HTLV-I productively infected cells may be important in the hypercalcemia , osteolytic bone lesions , neutrophilia , elevation of C-reactive protein , and fever frequently seen in patients with HTLV-I-induced adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma .

gene in HTLV-I-infected T cells are presently un-clear .
The genomes of both HTLV-I and HTLV-II contain sequences at their 3 ' end that encode two nonstructural pro-teins , Tax and Rex . '
'' * `` `` The transactivating Tax proteins of HTLV-I and HTLV-II function as an important transcriptional activator of the HTLV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) . ``
Tax is also able to transactivate a number of cellular genes , including those for IL-2 , IL-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) a chain , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , IL-6 , parathyroid hormone-related protein , and lymphotoxin .
`` '* `` The regulator of virion protein expression , HTLV-I Rex , acts in trans on viral RNA to suppress splicing of the primary transcript .
`` * In addition , the Rex protein of HTLV-II has been shown to act in trans to modulate Tax gene-mediated transactivation in a concentration-dependent fashion `` and HTLV-I Rex has been associated with increases in IL-2R a chain mRNA stability in HTLV-I-infected cells . ``
Therefore , it was of interest to determine whether Tax or Rex could activate the IL-l promoter in T cells and , if so , through which cis-acting elements it may act .
At least four Tax-responsive elements have been identified : the 21-bp repeats of HTLV-I LTR , the nuclear factor ( NF ) - « B binding motif ( « B site ) , the serum-response element , and the AP-1 site , which binds members of the Fos/Jun family .
We recently reported that HTLV-I Tax is involved in the activation of the IL-1 « gene . ``
' We show here that the Tax proteins of HTLV-I and HTLV-II can transactivate the human IL-la promoter , a mechanism that could explain constitutive IL-la gene expression .
Tax activation of the IL-la promoter occurs via an NF- « B pathway .
The IL-la promoter region required for Tax activation contains the two NF- « B binding sites .

RESULTS Activity of IL-la promoter constructs in human T cells .
To determine whether HTLV-I has an effect on transcription through the IL-1a promoter , we performed studies with human IL-la promoter constructs ( Fig 1A ) .
In MT-2 cells , the transfected CAT gene was activated when both fragments of the IL-la promoter region ( -1,437/+19 and -1,437/ +725 ) were inserted into pBLCATS ( Fig 1B ) .
In contrast , pBLCATS , the reporter vector without a promoter insert , was not active .
The larger IL-1a promoter fragment ( -1,437/ +725 ) had approximately twofold greater activity than did the smaller fragment ( -1,437/+ 19 ) .
This result indicates that the IL-la promoter constructs are able to potently drive transcription of the heterologous CAT reporter gene in the MT-2 cell line .
To further elucidate the nature of HTLV-I activation of the IL-la promoter constructs , we performed similar transfection studies in Jurkat cells ( Fig 1B ) .
In contrast to MT-2 cells , both IL-1a sequences tested ( -1,437/+19 and -1,437/ +725 ) were not able to drive CAT activity in Jurkat cells ( Fig 1B ) .
By inspection , we discovered two sequences similar but not identical to the previously identified NF- « B binding site on the Ig -chain gene ( Fig 1A `` ) .
One is located -1,065/-1,056 bp upstream of the cap site , and the other is located +646/+655 bp .
The finding of putative NF-kB sites was of interest because ( 1 ) HTLV-I-infected cells have been shown to have high levels of active NF-kB `` and ( 2 ) Tax has been shown to activate some cellular genes by causing an increase in NF-kB levels . ``
'' Transactivation of the IL-la promoter by HTLV-I and HTLV-II Tax .
In view of the results presented above , we were interested in determining whether HTLV Tax regulates IL-la « promoter expression .
Transient transfection assays were used to analyze the ability of Tax to transactivate the human promoter .
The Jurkat cell line was cotransfected with an expression vector for either HTLV-I Tax ( BC3.9 Sph ) or HTLV-II Tax ( BC20.2 Sph ) and CAT reporter vectors containing the IL-l1a promoters .
The reporter containing the human IL-1a promoter from -1,437 to +725 ( aH2 ) , gave 55- and 63-fold induction with HTLV-I and HTLV-II Tax , respectively ( Fig 2 ) .

Transactivation of IL-1a CAT promoter constructs by HTLV-I Tax and HTLV-II Tax in Jurkat cells .
Reporter vectors as indicated at the bottom of the figure were cotransfected into Jurkat cells with an HTLV-I Tax ( BC3.9 Sph ) , an HTLV-II Tax ( BC20.2 Sph ) expression plasmid , or a control CMV expression plasmid ( BC12 ) .
Cytoplasmic extracts were obtained after 48 hours from transfected cells as described in the Materials and Methods .
Data show the mean + SEM of three experiments .
The fold induction for each was calculated relative to the value for the promoter construct cotransfected with the control plasmid , BC12 .
was also transactivated by HTLV-I and HTLV-II Tax in Jurkat cells , but only at low levels compared with the high level of activation of aH2 ( Fig 2 ) .
Both IL-la promoter CAT constructs were similarly transactivated by HTLV-I Tax/Rex and HTLV-II Tax/Rex ; thus , the presence of Rex was not required ( data not shown ) .
High level transactivation of the IL-1a promoter in Jurkat cells requires an intact Tax NF-kB pathway .
- Mutant Tax protein ( Tax A984 ) contains a 30 carboxy terminal amino acid deletion . ``
Tax A984 deficient in activation of the NF-kB pathway was used to determine which Tax activation pathway was required for induction of the IL-la promoter in Jurkat cells .
aHI1 or aH2 was cotransfected into Jurkat cells with either the wild-type HTLV-I Tax expression plasmid , BC3.9 Sph , or a plasmid expressing mutant Tax protein , Tax A984 or a control plasmid .
BC3.9 Sph stimulated expression from aH 1 and « H2 sixfold and 41 -fold , respectively ( Fig 3 ) .
Interestingly , the mutant Tax protein was unable to fully transactivate both « H1 and « H2 .
Controls for these experiments showed that Tax A984 did not alter the protein 's ability to transactivate promoters , such as the HTLV-I LTR , whose Tax responsiveness is dependent on a CRE ( Fig 3 ) .
However , Tax A984 failed to transactivate the IL-2R a chain gene promoter whose Tax-responsive region contains NF- From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Provision of exogenous p65/p50 NF- « B in the form of a fusion protein stimulated the IL-2R a chain gene ( Fig 3 ) .
Cotransfection with an NF- « B expression plasmid restored full transactivation of « H1 and « H2 with sixfold and 36-fold induction , respectively ( Fig 3 ) , verifying that the NF- « B pathway is required for high-level activation .
Two promoter NF-kB binding sites specifically bind NF-kB-containing nuclear extracts .
We tested nuclear extracts from IL-1a-producing cells to determine whether they were able to bind to both NF- « B sites in the IL-1a promoter region .
We prepared two synthetic oligonucleotides containing the NF-KB site and used them as probes in EMSA .
We found that nuclear extracts from MT-2 cells bound to the IL-la 3 ' NF- « B ( +641/+660 ) probe and , although less efficiently , also to the IL-l 5° NF- « B ( -1,070/-1,051 ) probe ( Fig 4 , lanes 3 and 11 ) .
In contrast , nuclei from Jurkat cells contained a small amount of protein that bound to the 3 ' NF- « B probe ( Fig 4 , lane 10 ) , but no constitutive binding to the 5° NF- « B oligonucleotide was detected ( Fig 4 , lane 2 ) .
NF- « B specificity was shown by elimination of this bind 3413 ing after the addition of 200-fold excess of either unlabeled IL-1a ( -1,070/-1,051 ) or IL-1a ( +641/+660 ) oligonucleotide ( Fig 4 , lanes 5 , 7 , 13 , and 15 ) , whereas no competition was obtained by an unrelated CRE oligonucleotide ( Fig 4 , lanes 4 and 12 ) .
It should be noted that their binding was also eliminated by the addition of excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide that corresponds to the NF- « B site within the human IL-6 promoter ( Fig 4 , lanes 8 and 16 ) and not by either IL-1a 5 ' « B mut or 3 ' « B mut oligonucleotide with mutations introduced into one of the two NF- « B sites ( Fig 4 , lanes 6 and 14 ) .
Mutant IL-1a 3 ' « kB oligonucleotides shows no complex in EMSA ( Fig 4 , lane 17 ) .
Competition with the unlabeled 5 ' NF- « B oligonucleotide ( Fig 4 , lane 15 ) or 3 ' NF- « B oligonucleotide ( Fig 4 , lane 13 ) suggested that the 3 ' NF-KB site competed for NF- « B binding more efficiently than the 5 NF- « B site .
Thus , NF-kB from MT-2 cells , in which we have shown IL-la promoter activity , recognizes the two IL-la NF- « B sites .
Furthermore , this experiment confirmed that the 3 ' NF- « B site ( +641/+660 ) binds NF- « B more efficiently than the 5° NF- « B site ( -1,070/-1,051 ) .
Both NF- « B sites participate in transactivation by NF-kB or Tax .
- Having shown that both NF-KB sites bind NF-KB , albeit with different efficiencies , we examined the relative importance of the two sites for transactivation of the IL-la promoter by NF- « B or Tax .
Jurkat cells were cotransfected with either NF- « B or HTLV-I Tax expression vector together with a CAT reporter gene linked to one of the follow-ing : the wild-type IL-la promoter ( « H2 , WT ) , the same region containing a deleted 5° NF-KB site ( « H2 A-1,065/ -1,056 ) or a deleted 3 ' NF- « B site ( aH2 A+646/+655 ) .
As shown in Fig 5B , deletion of the 5 NF- « B binding site had a moderate effect on transactivation of IL-la « by NF-kB and Tax , whereas deletion of the 3 ' NF-KB site had a very profound effect , producing an approximately fivefold or sixfold reduction in IL-la CAT activation , respectively .
These results indicate that both NF-KB sites are required for efficient transactivation of IL-1 by NF- « B and Tax .
Finally , the mutant reporter plasmids aH2 A-1,065/ -1,056 or aH2 A+646/+655 were transfected into MT-2 cells ( Fig 6 ) , and the amount of CAT activity driven by the mutant plasmids was compared with that of the wild-type aH2 construct .
Deletion of the 5 NF- « B site in the context of the IL-1a promoter moderately reduced promoter activity in MT-2 cells , whereas deletion of the 3 ' NF-KB site strongly reduced IL-la promoter activity .
These data indicate that both NF-KB sites are important for activation of the -1,437/ +725 IL-la promoter fragment .
DISCUSSION Unlike resting T lymphocytes or HTLV-I-uninfected T-cell lines , HTLV-I-infected T cells can constitutively express IL-1a in the absence of any stimuli . ``
However , very little is known concerning the mechanisms that control IL-la gene expression .
The regulation of production of IL-la is complex .
There are likely to be four levels of control : transcription , mRNA abundance , translation , and , finally , posttranslation modification .

activation .
By analogy with other cellular genes , the involvement of Tax in the expression of IL-1a in cells infected with HTLV-I has been speculated .
We have presented here an analysis of the mechanism of IL-la activation by concentrating on HTLV-I infection as a model system .
IL-la promoter constructs were highly active when transfected into HTLV-I MT-2 cells .
These IL-la promoter-CAT constructs showed no significant activity in Jurkat cells .
Cotransfection of IL-la-CAT constructs with HTLV-I and HTLV-II Tax expression plasmids led to the detection of significant promoter activity in Jurkat cells .
Therefore , it is likely that the Tax proteins are directly responsible for the transcriptional activation of the IL-1a promoter .
Our finding that Tax can transactivate the IL-la promoter is one of the first cases in which the transcriptional activity of the transfected IL-la promoter can be modulated .
The ability of ( 1 ) NF-kB to bind to the IL-la promoter , ( 2 ) a mutated Tax expression vector to abolish the transactivation of the IL-la promoter , and ( 3 ) overexpression of NF-kB to activate IL-la gene expression clearly indicate that transactivation of the IL-la promoter involves the DNA binding factor , NF-kB .
We have examined the effect of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to the p65 subunit of NF-kB on the promoter activity and production of IL-l by MT-2 cells .
Exposure to p65 antisense , but not sense oligodeoxynucleotides resulted in inhibitions of IL- la promoter activity and production of 48 % and 50 % , respectively ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , deletion mutation of either 5 ' or 3 `` NF-KB sites of the IL-1 a promoter decreases promoter activity in MT-2 cells and the ability of Tax to stimulate the transcriptional activity of the gene in Jurkat cells , suggesting that the 5 `` NF-KB ( -1,065 to - 1,056 ) and 3 `` NF-KB ( +646 to +655 ) sites are essential for maximal induction of IL-la transcrip-tion .
This is in contrast to Tax activation of other genes such as IL-2R a chain , IL-6 , and lymphotoxin , which require a single NF-KB site . ``
'' In the IL-1 a gene promoter , two NF-kB sites exert a positive regulatory activity and can function independently , although the 5° NF-KB site was demonstrably less important than the 3 ' NF-KB site .
The activation of IL-la in HTLV-I-infected cells suggests the participation of this cytokine in the pathogenesis of HTLV-I-induced diseases .
Hypercalcemia ( with and without osteolytic bone lesions ) is frequently observed in ATLL patients .
** Several cytokines produced by HTLV-I-infected cells have been suggested to contribute to these symptoms . '
'' `` ° IL-la activates osteoclasts , `` !
induces hypercalcemia in mice , `` and acts synergistically with other osteo-clast-activating factors in bone resorption . ``
It is therefore conceivable that induction of IL-la by HTLV-I in vivo at least partially contributes to the development of the osteolytic bone lesions and hypercalcemia frequently observed in ATLL patients .
IL-1 can also produce neutrophilia , acute inflammatory protein secretion by hepatocytes , and fever in vivo . ``
ATLL patients often exhibit neutrophilia , elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein , and fever .
`` *** It is possible that ATLL cell-derived IL-1 may mediate these responses associated with ATLL .

IL-1a PROMOTER TRANSACTIVATION BY TAX associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis ( HAM/ TSP ) , a nonneoplastic , immunologic disease of the central nervous system ( CNS ) . ``
In this disease , demyelination and inflammation are prominent pathologic features , but viral antigens have not been detected in CNS tissue .
However , HTLV-I has been shown in T cells derived from the HAM/ TSP patient 's cerebrospinal fluid* and is presumably present in T-cell infiltrates in the brain parenchyma . ``
Because T-cell infiltration of the CNS is a prominent pathologic finding in HAM/TSP , based on the present findings it can be postulated that Tax could contribute to the pathogenesis of HAM/ TSP by stimulating T cells infiltrating HAM/TSP lesions to induce cytokine genes including IL-1 , with associated immune reaction and inflammation at the tissue level .
Induction of the IL-ia gene by Tax could also have similar effects in other tissues because HTLV-I infection has been associated with inflammatory conditions such as arthritis , uveitis , and polymyositis . ``
' Extensive clinical studies will be necessary in the future to define the in vivo significance of IL-la activation by HTLV-I Tax and its participation in disease processes during HTLV-I infection .
