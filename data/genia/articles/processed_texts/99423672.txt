To propel itself in infected cells , the pathogen Shigella flexneri subverts the Cdc42-controlled machinery responsible for actin assembly during filopodia formation .
U sing a combination of bacterial motility assays in platelet extracts with Escherichia coli expressing the Shigella IcsA protein and in vitro analysis of reconstituted systems from purified proteins , we show here that the bacterial protein IcsA binds N-WA SP and activates it in a Cdc42-like fashion .
Dramatic stimulation of actin assembly is linked to the formation of a ternary IecsA-N-WA SP-A rp2/3 complex , which nucle-ates actin polymerization .
The Arp2/3 complex is essential in initiation of actin assembly and Shigella movement , as previously observed for L isteria monocy-to genes .
Activation of N-WA SP by IecsA unmasks two domains acting together in insertional actin polymer ization .
The isolated COOH-terminal domain of N-WA SP containing a verprolin-homology region , a cofilin-homology sequence , and an acidic terminal segment ( VCA ) interacts with G-actin in a unique profilin-like functional fashion .
Hence , when N-WA SP is acti-vated , its COOH -terminal domain feeds barbed end growth of filaments and lowers the critical concentration at the bacterial surface .
On the other hand , the NH , -terminal domain of N-WA SP interacts with F-actin , mediating the attachment of the actin tail to the bacterium surface .
VA SP is not involved in Shigella movement , and the function of profilin does not require its binding to proline-rich regions .
Key words : - Shigella flexneri® IcsA « N-WASP ® Arp2/3 complex ® actin stimuli is mediated by a highly integrated signaling cascade that transduces external signals to the actin cytoskeleton to elicit spatially controlled actin polymerization .
Many of the components playing a role in this cascade have been identified .
Among them , Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 , small GTPases of the Rho family , act as molecular regulators of actin assembly and control the formation of focal adhesions , lamellipodia , and filopodia , respectively ( Kozma et al .
, 1995 ; Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) .
On the other hand , the molecular mechanisms connecting Rac and Cdc42 to actin filament assembly during cell locomotion are still unknown .
Intracellular actin-based propulsion of pathogens provides an invaluable tool for the mechanistic analysis of the THE motile response of living cells to extracellular C. Egile and T.P .

Shigella flexneri , Listeria mono-cytogenes , or the vaccinia virus ( Higley and Way , 1997 ) induce polarized constitutive actin assembly at their surface into a reticulated meshwork ( Bernardini et al .
, 1989 ; Pre-vost et al .
, 1992 ; Goldberg et al .
, 1993 ; Nhieu and Sansonetti , 1999 for a recent review ) , and use the resulting propulsive force to move at rates of 1-50 m/min and spread from cell to cell by membrane invagination and ly-sis .
A single bacterial surface protein , ActA on Listeria ( Domann et al .
, 1992 ; Kocks et al .
, 1992 ) , or IcsA ( VirG ) on Shigella ( Bernardini et al .
, 1989 ; Lett et al .
, 1989 ) , is necessary and sufficient ( Goldberg and Theriot , 1995 ; Kocks et al .
, 1995 ) to induce actin-based motility of the bacterium .
The Listeria system has been extensively stud-ied .
The multidomain ActA protein recruits two essential factors in motility .
The NH -terminal domain of ActA interacts with the Arp2/3 complex ( Welch et al .
, 1997 ) and activates its actin nucleating activity ( Welch et al .
, 1998 ) .
The central proline-rich domain of ActA interacts with the The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 146 , Number 6 , September 20 , 1999 1319-1332 http : //www .jcb.org 1319 focal adhesion protein VASP ( Smith et al .
, 1996 ; Niebuhr et al .
, 1997 ) , which links the actin tail to the bacterium surface , allowing directed insertional polymerization ( Laurent et al .
, 1999 ) .
Although the IcsA protein has no sequence similarity to ActA , the physical features of Shigella actin-based movement are identical to L isteria , suggesting that at least some of the key players involved in movement are the same in the two systems .
Two proteins have been reported to interact with IcsA , vinculin ( Suzuki et al .
, 1996 ) and N-W ASP ( Suzuki et al .
, 1998 ) .
Vinculin was postulated to associate with VASP via its ActA -like proline-rich seg-ment , suggesting that VASP would play in Shigella movement the same role as in L isteria ( Laine et al .
, 1997 ) .
However , Shigella moves well in cells that do not express vinculin ( Goldberg , 1997 ) .
N-W ASP is a member of the WASP family of proteins , which thus far includes Las17/ Beel in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Lechler and Li , 1997 ; Li , 1997 ) ; Scarl/WAVE in Dictyostelium discoideum , Cae-norhabditis elegans , Drosophila melanogaster , mouse , and humans ( Bear et al .
, 1998 ; Miki et al .
, 1998a ) ; and WA SP ( Derry et al .
, 1994 ) and its close homologue N-WASP ( Miki et al .
, 1996 ) in humans .
Mutations in the WASP protein result in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ( Ramesh et al .
, 1999 ) .
Among WASP proteins , only WASP and N-W ASP contain a consensus CRIB motif for Cde42 binding .
N-WASP enhances Cdc42-induced formation of filopodia ( Miki et al .
, 1998b ) .
It has been proposed that N-W A SP is activated by the N-W ASP-Cdc42 interaction .
In vitro , Cdc42 drives actin polymerization in acellular extracts ( Ma et al .
, 1998a ; Zigmond et al .
, 1998 ) .
WASP and N-W A SP therefore are thought to link Cde42 to actin polymerization ( Bi and Zigmond , 1999 , for a recent review ) .
Proteins of the WASP family also contain a proline-rich region thought to bind SH3 domains , as well as profilin ( Suetsugu et al .
, 1998 ) , and a COOH-terminal domain containing a verprolin-homology region , a cofilin-homology sequence , and an acidic terminal segment ( VCA ) .
The actin filament severing and depolymerizing activities of the VCA region are thought to be involved in microspike formation ( Miki et al .
, 1998b ) and in actin-based motility of Shigella ( Suzuki et al .
, 1998 ) .
The recent discovery that the acidic extreme COOH-terminal region of Scarl interacts with p21-Arc , a component of the Arp2/3 complex ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ) , and enhances its actin nucleating activity ( Machesky et al .
, 1999 ) was a landmark in the field .
The Arp2/3 complex then was reported to mediate actin polymerization induced by Cdcd42 ( Ma et al .
, 1998b ) .
Recently , activation of Arp2/3 by N-W ASP was found enhanced by Cdc42 ( Ro-hatgi et al .
, 1999 ) .
In yeast , the Arp2/3 complex is activated by the COOH -terminal domain of Beelp ( Winter et al .
, 1999 ) .
However , the molecular mechanism for site-directed actin assembly and production of force and movement remains unknown .
The goal of our work was to understand how the different components of the actin assembly machinery are se 1 .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 146 , 1999 quentially switched on to elicit actin nucleation and insertional polymerization to produce Shigella movement .
To address this issue , we have used a combination of bacterial motility assays using IcsA -expressing Escherichia coli in platelet and brain extracts , immunodepletion and add-back methods , and in vitro steady state and kinetic measurements of actin polymerization in the presence of individual and combined components of the machinery , using purified IcsA , N-WASP , VCA , Arp2/3 complex , Cdc42 , VASP , and wild-type and mutated profilins .
We 've come up with a working model for Shigella movement that provides a general insight into the mechanism of actin-based cellular extensions .

Purification of Arp2/3 Complex from Bovine Brain Bovine Arp2/3 complex was purified from bovine brain extracts by a novel two step method as follows .
100 ml of S , was dialyzed against 50 mM MES , pH 6.8 , containing 1 mM DTT , 1 mM EDTA , and 1 mM MgC ) , ( buffer A ) , and loaded on an SP-Trisacryl column ( 2.5 X 12 ecm ) equilibrated in buffer A .
After a wash step with 30 mM KCIJ , the Arp2/3 complex was eluted with 80 mM KCI in buffer A .
This fraction was equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-C1~ , pH 7.5 , containing 25 mM KCI , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM MgC ) , 0.5 mM EDTA , and 0.1 mM ATP-Tris , pH 7.5 ( buffer B ) , and loaded on a GST-VCA glutathione Sepharose column ( 0.5 X 1 cm ) in buffer B .
Most of the proteins were washed off the column by buffer B , the remaining non-Arp2/3 proteins were eluted by 0.2 M KCI in buffer B , pending a small loss of Arp2/3 activity , and the pure Arp2/3 complex was eluted with 0.2 M MgC ) , in buffer B ( see Fig .

A fter dialysis against buffer B , the protein was concentrated using a Centriprep 30 cartridge ( Amicon ) .
The Arp2/3 complex was supplemented with 0.2 M sucrose and stored at -80°C .
The activity of Arp2/3 along the purification steps was monitored spectrofluorimetrically , using the ability of Arp2/3 to activate the branched polymerization of actin filaments in the presence of VCA .
The assay ( 80 pl ) contained 2.5 uM Mg-G-actin ( 10 % pyrenyl-labeled ) , 0.5 uM VCA , and 10 pl of the tested fraction in 5 mM Tris-C1~ , pH 7.8 buffer , 1 mM DTT , 0.2 mM ATP , 0.1 M KCl , and 1 mM MgC ) .
The time course of increase in pyrenyl-actin fluorescence was followed .
The activity of Arp2/3 was detected by the steep sigmoidal increase in fluorescence , indicative of branched polymerization .
The activity of Arp2/3 was easily observed , even in the S , fraction .
Alter-natively , the activity of Arp2/3 was detected by the video-microscopy bacterial motility assay , using the property of Arp2/3 to initiate the formation of actin clouds at the surface of L isferia incubated in 4 M rhodamine-labeled actin .
The results of the two tests were in good agreement with each other , but the spectrofluorometric assay was more convenient and easily amenable to a quantitative estimate of the amount of Arp2/3 in the tested fractions by comparison with a calibration series of time courses performed with known concentrations of pure Arp2/3 .
The concentration of Arp2/3 complex was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 224,480 M + cm~ ' at 278 nm , derived from the amino acid sequence of the seven polypeptides composing the 223,949-D complex .
A good agreement was obtained between the spectrophotomet-ric measurement and the bicinchoninic acid assay , with BSA as a standard .
Typically , 1.2 nmol ( 0.26 mg ) of pure Arp2/3 complex was obtained from 100 ml brain S ; supernatant .

The G-actin sequestering activity was measured by the shift in critical concentration plots with gelsolin-capped filament barbed ends .

Results Association of N-WASP to IcsA Is Required for Actin-based Motility of E. coli ( IcsA ) in Platelet Extracts A ctin-based motility of £ .
coli ( IcsA ) has been observed in Xenopus egg extracts ( Goldberg and Theriot , 1995 ; Kocks et al .
, 1995 , Suzuki et al .
, 1998 ) .
Motility was observed as well in HeLa cell extracts and murine or bovine brain extracts , but not at all in human platelet extracts , which , in contrast , supports actin-based motility of Listeria .
This puzzling observation suggested that an essential factor for Shigella motility is missing in platelets .
The requirement of N-W ASP for Shigella motility in Xenopus egg extracts has recently been demonstrated ( Suzuki et al .
, 1998 ) .
Immunoblotting using polyclonal NW O11 antibodies that recognize both WASP and N-WASP ( Fig .
1 a ) , showed that N-W ASP was present in brain extracts , but absent in platelets , which , in contrast , contain the lower molecular weight WASP homologous protein mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells ( Fig .
1 a ) , whose mutations result in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ( Ramesh et al .
, 1999 ) .
The endogenous WASP protein , homologue of N-W ASP in platelets , apparently can not bind IcsA .
To check whether the absence of N-W ASP was responsible for the lack of E. coli ( IcsA ) motility in platelet extracts , recombinant human N-W ASP was expressed using the baculovirus system and purified ( Fig .
1 b ) .
The interaction of recombinant N-W ASP with IcsA was verified by successful binding of The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 146 , 1999 N-WASP on glutathione Sepharose beads to which the GST-IcsA fusion protein was attached ( Fig .
1 c ) .
The isolated VCA of N-W ASP , in contrast , did not bind to IcsA ( Fig .
1 c ) .
Actin-based motility of E. coli ( IcsA ) was restored by addition of N-W ASP to platelet extracts .
Specifically , upon addition of 10 nM N-W ASP , actin clouds were observed .
Comets were observed upon addition of 50 nM N-W A SP , optimum movement was seen at 100 nM N-W A SP , and inhibition occurred at 1 wM N-W ASP .
Neither bacterial motility nor actin polymerization were observed under the same conditions with control BUG 968 E. coli bacteria that did not express IcsA ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Consistent with the apparent high affinity of N-W ASP for IcsA , when E. coli ( IcsA ) bacteria were incubated with N-W ASP at concentrations as low as 0.1 mM , washed , and added to platelet extracts , bacterial actin-based motility was readily observed ( Fig .
1 d ) .
Bacteria induced actin polymerization and moved at rates similar to Listeria ( 4 pm/ min , SD = 1 , n = 20 ) .
In contrast , when control BUG 968 E. coli bacteria that did not express IcsA were preincubated with N-WASP , washed , and added to platelet extracts , they failed to induce actin assembly and to move .
Consistent with these results , beads coated with GST-IcsA 53.593 induced actin assembly at their surface in platelet extracts only when they were first preincubated with N-W ASP ( Fig .
1 e ) .
Control GST beads , preincubated in the same N-W ASP solution , and washed , failed to induce actin assembly in platelet extracts .
Neither actin assembly nor movement was observed when bacteria or GST-IcsA beads were preincubated with VCA instead of N-W ASP .
Accordingly , bacterial movement and actin assembly were not inhibited by the presence of a 20-fold molar excess of VCA over N-WASP in the preincubation step .
Hence , VCA does not displace IcsA -bound N-W A SP .
These results demonstrate that interaction of IcsA with ASP is crucial for IcsA -mediated actin polymerization and bacterial motility , and that VCA does not interact with IcsA .
Association of Arp2/3 Complex with N-WASP Bound to IcsA at the Surface of E. coli ( IcsA ) Is Necessary and Sufficient for Initiation of Actin Assembly The N-WASP protein was proposed to initiate actin assembly at the surface of bacteria by interacting with actin via its two verprolin homology regions and/or its cofilin homology sequence ( Miki et al .
, 1998b ; Suzuki et al .

However , when either the £ .
coli ( IcsA ) bacteria or the GST-IcsA beads precoated with N-W ASP were incubated in a solution of rhodamine-labeled F-actin , no initiation of actin assembly was observed at their surface ( data not shown ) , indicating that , in itself , the actin-binding property of N-W ASP is not sufficient for inducing the actin assembly seen in platelet extracts .
Recently , the association of the Arp2/3 complex with Scarl , a member of the WASP family , was demonstrated to enhance the actin nucleation activity of Arp2/3 complex in vitro ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ; Machesky et al .
, 1999 ) .
To investigate the role of Arp2/3 complex in Shigella motility , platelet extracts were at least 80 % depleted in Arp2/3 complex by GST-VCA beads ( Fig .

N-WASP and of Listeria were completely abolished in those Arp2/3-depleted extracts .
Add-back of 0.15 pM pure Arp2/3 from bovine brain to the depleted platelet extracts restored bacterial movement at a rate of 1 + 0.2 pum/ min , i.e .
, 30 % of the speed observed in the mock-depleted extracts .
The N-WASP-coated E. coli ( IcsA ) bacteria , N-W A SP-bound GST-IcsA beads , or Listeria bacteria were then incubated in a solution of rhodamine-labeled F-actin containing pure Arp2/3 from bovine brain ( Fig .
2 b ) .
Formation of actin clouds around the bacteria and the beads was immediately observed ( Fig .
2 c ) .
These results demonstrate that IcsA -bound N-WASP interacts with Arp2/3 complex , and that the IcsA-N-WASP-Arp2/3 complex is able to initiate local actin assembly in a solution of pure actin .
Previously , we have shown , using phalloidin , that Egile et al .
Shigella flexneri Actin-based Motility G-actin , not F-actin , was recruited by Arp2/3 at the L isteria surface ( Marchand et al .
, 1995 ) .
Even though actin was polymerized in the assay , it is the G-actin that coexists at steady state with the filaments that are shuttled onto barbed ends created by Arp2/3 .
To get more insight into the respective roles of N-WASP and Arp2/3 in Shigella movement , immunolocalization of the two proteins in infected cells was carried out .
N-W ASP colocalized with IcsA at the surface of Shigella , whereas the Arp2/3 complex was found in the entire actin tail ( Fig .
3 ) .
In conclusion , Arp2/3 interacts with N-W A SP to initiate actin assembly at the surface of Shigella , but the interaction of Arp2/3 with N-W ASP is not permanent , and the Arp2/3 complex remains incorporated into the assembled filaments .
In contrast , the interaction of N-W ASP with IcsA is probably very strong and in slow equilibrium .

e © # a 4 -| # dm N-WASP Enhances the Actin Nucleation Activity of Arp2/3 in a Cdc42-activated Fashion To understand how the interaction between IcsA -bound N-W ASP with Arp2/3 complex leads to the initiation of actin filament assembly at the surface of Shigella , the biochemical properties of the individual proteins of this complex machinery were examined in in vitro experiments .
The Arp2/3 complex purified from bovine brain was able to induce the branched polymerization of actin filaments ( Ressad et al .
, 1999 ) , like the Acanthamoeba complex ( Mullins et al .
, 1998 ) .
The activity of the Arp2/3 complex appeared enhanced by either the VCA domain of N-W ASP ( Fig .
4 a ) or by the entire N-W ASP protein ( Fig .
4 b ) in the same concentration-dependent manner .
At 2.5 M actin , the optimum activation was observed at 0.5 M VCA or N-W ASP .
The activation decreased at higher concentrations of VCA or N-W ASP ( Fig .
4 c ) .

Arp2/3 complex is essential for actin nucleation at the surface of E. coli ( IcsA ) and Listeria .

extent of activation was fourfold higher with VCA than with N-W ASP .
The effect of N-WASP , but not of VCA , was further stimulated ( about threefold ) by Cdc42-GTPyS , not by Cde42-GDP ( Fig .
4 d ) , in agreement with Rohatgi et al .
( 1999 ) .
In conclusion , in the whole N-W ASP protein , the VCA domain is accessible to Arp2/3 complex and capable of activating Arp2/3 function in actin assembly .
IcsA Mimics Cdc42-induced Activation of N-WASP The recombinant IcsA protein greatly stimulated the N-WASP-Arp2/3-induced polymerization of actin in a concentration-dependent , saturable fashion ( Fig .
4 e ) .
In the presence of 20 nM Arp2/3 complex and 130 nM N-W ASP , 80 % of the maximal polymerization rate was reached upon addition of 30 nM IesA , indicating that maximal activity is associated with the formation of a ternary Arp2/3 1324 N-WASP-IcsA complex in which the equilibrium K , of IcsA is in the nanomolar range .
The activation reached with IcsA was greater than with Cdc42 .
Interestingly , IcsA by itself did not affect the polymerization of actin alone , but at concentrations as low as 0.1 M , it activated the Arp2/3 complex to some extent in the absence of N-W ASP ( control curves in Fig .
4 e ) , which indicates that IcsA interacts with Arp2/3 complex .
In the presence of N-W ASP , IcsA , and Arp2/3 , a true triangular complex is formed between the three proteins at the surface of Shigella , enhancing the stability of the edifice .
The Isolated VCA of N-WASP Binds G-actin and Affects Actin Assembly in a Profilin-like Fashion The VCA of N-W ASP was described as a filament depolymerizing filament severing protein ( Miki et al .
, 1996 , 1998b ; Suzuki et al .
, 1998 ) .
These conclusions do not appear confirmed in the present work .
The interaction of isolated VCA with actin was examined in steady state and kinetic experiments , on the dynamics of pointed and barbed ends separately .
When filament barbed ends are capped by gelsolin , VCA induced a shift in the critical concentration plots ( Fig .
5 a ) .
Addition of increasing amounts of VCA to F-actin at a given concentration caused a linear decrease in F-actin at steady state , leading to eventual complete depolymerization at high concentration of VCA .
The slope of the plot ( Fig .
5 b ) was independent of the actin concentration .
Hence , VCA behaves like a G-actin sequestering protein when barbed ends are capped .
A value of 0.8 + 0.1 wM was derived for the equilibrium K , of the VCA-G-actin complex , from analysis of the data in Fig .
5 , a and b .
When barbed ends were free , the behavior of VCA was different .
No efficient sequestration of actin was observed .

In the presence of 5 M VCA , a modest shift of the critical concentration plots from 0.12 to 0.21 wM unassembled actin was observed , while a 3.5-fold larger shift ( up to 0.7 M unassembled actin ) was expected , using the K , value of 0.8 wM .
These results are reminiscent of the effect of profilin in actin assembly ( Pantaloni and Carlier , 1993 ) and they demonstrate that when barbed ends are free , the concentration of ATP-G-actin at steady state is lowered by VCA , suggesting that VCA-actin complex , like profilin-actin , participates in barbed end assembly .
Specifically , in the experiment shown in Fig .
5 c , the amount of unassembled actin , [ A ] , at steady state is 0.21 M , which distributes into free G-actin , [ A ] , and VCA-actin complex , [ VA ) .
The concentrations of free G-actin and VCA -actin are linked by the law of mass action : ( [ A ] < ( [ V lion [ VA ) ) / [ VA ] = K , ) ; and by the sum : [ A ] ) , = [ A ] + resulting in a quadratic equation that has a single solution : [ A ] = 0.03 wM , [ VA ] = 0.18 mM .
The concentration of free actin , thus , appears fourfold lower than 0.12 M , the value that is measured in the absence of VCA .
Evidence for the participation of VCA-actin complex in barbed end assembly was directly provided by measurements of the rate of filament growth .
The rate of elongation from G-actin at pointed ends , initiated by gelsolin-actin complex , was totally inhibited by VCA ( Fig .
5 c ) , confirming that the VCA-actin complex does not polymerize onto pointed ends .
In contrast , growth of barbed ends initiated by spectrin-actin seeds , was inhibited only by 30 % at saturation by VCA , indicating that the VCA-actin complex associates to barbed ends with a rate constant 30 % lower than G-actin ( Fig .
5 d ) .
Again , this result is strikingly similar to the one obtained with profilin ( Gutsche-Perelroizen et al .
, 1999 ) .
Like profilin , VCA delivers G-actin subunits to growing barbed ends and disso-ciliates from the barbed end after incorporation of actin , in 1325 Fluorescence { cpm/1000 ) _s l= ] Fluorescence ( cpm/1000 ) 5 5 Effect of VCA Effect of N-WASP O i i i i 0 500 1000 00 500 1000 Time , seconds Time , seconds 0.15- - r C 20 } edc42-GTPyS N-WASP a ede42-GDP & + IcsA f= ] o 1 } oom 2 15 ) 0 ede42 - £ a & o 2 8 a 0 o & QC ) 10 } $ 0.05 } 5 3 LL 5 Effect of cdc42 0 T 1 R 0 1 2 o0 500 20 10 Fluorescence ( cpm/1000 ) N-WASP or VCA , uM 15 } ( + N-WASP ) 0 500 1000 Time , seconds Fluorescence ( cpm/1000 ) Time , seconds Effect of N-WASP ( +lcsA ) 500 Time , seconds Figure 4 .

a manner coupled to ATP hydrolysis .
The coupling to ATP hydrolysis was demonstrated to be thermodynami-cally required to account for the decrease in partial critical concentration of actin ( Pantaloni and Carlier , 1993 ) .
Spontaneous polymerization of actin was inhibited by The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 146 , 1999 VCA , exactly as observed with profilin ( data not shown ) .
Hence , VCA-actin complex , like profilin-actin complex , is able to productively associate to barbed ends , but not to nucleate F-actin .
This result accounts for the decrease observed in the activation of Arp2/3 complex at high VCA or 1326 , , Figure 5 .

d , VCA-G-actin does not assemble onto pointed ends , but participates in barbed end assembly with the same kinetic parameters as profilin-actin .
Rates of pointed end assembly from gelsolin-actin ( 0 ) and of barbed end assembly from spectrin-actin seeds ( @ ) were measured at 1 M G-actin and the indicated concentrations of VCA .
N-W ASP concentration ( Fig .
4 , a and b ) , which correlates with the saturation of G-actin by VCA .
At low concentra-tions , VCA -actin interacts with Arp2/3 complex to enhance nucleation , but when all G-actin is bound to VCA , actual inhibition of nucleation occurs .
The NH -terminal Domain of N-WASP Binds and Stabilizes F-Actin in an Ics A-enhanced Fashion Full-length N-W ASP did not display the G-actin sequestering activity of VCA , when barbed ends were capped by gelsolin .
No depolymerization of gelsolin-capped F-actin was measured at steady state , and only weak inhibition in the rate of growth at the pointed ends of gelsolin-capped filaments was detected by addition of N-W ASP .
Instead , N-W ASP bound to F-actin and stabilized the filaments , as shown by the observed decrease in critical concentration ( Fig .
6 a ) .
A slight decrease in the slope of the pyrenyl fluorescence critical concentration plots indicated that the Egile et al .
Shigella flexneri Actin-based Motility fluorescence of F-actin was partially quenched upon binding N-W ASP .
The binding to F-actin and the decrease in critical concentration were also observed in a sedimentation assay ( Fig .
6 a , inset ) .
The NH-terminal fragment of N-W ASP protein ( Nt , residues 1-276 ) stabilized the filaments and affected the slope of the critical concentration plots of gelsolin-capped filaments exactly like the full-length protein ( Fig .
6 a ) , and bound to F-actin in sedimentation assays , which indicates that the Nt contains the F-actin binding site .
The affinity of N-WASP for F-actin was roughly estimated to 2 to 5 10° M~ ' from these data .
The binding to F-actin presumably counteracted and prevented observation of the sequestering activity of the COOH -terminal part of N-W A SP in solutions of F-actin .
When barbed ends are free , the critical concentration is low ( 0.1 M ) , hence , the stabilizing effect of N-W ASP ( de-crease in critical concentration ) was best observed in the presence of a sequestering protein like thymosin B4 .

Note the decrease in actin in the supernatants , and the associated binding of N-W ASP and its NH -terminal fragment to F-actin .
b , N-WASP promotes actin polymerization from a pool of T B4-actin complex when barbed ends are free .
N-W ASP was incubated at the indicated concentrations with 2 wM F-actin ( 9 % pyrenyl-labeled ) in the presence of 30 M TBA .
Pyrenyl fluorescence was measured at steady state , and converted in F-actin concentrations using a critical concentration plot carried out in parallel using the same F-actin solution .
Inset , SDS-PAGE pattern of the pellets ( P ) and supernatants ( S ) of sedimented samples ( marked with an arrow in the main frame ) containing 2 M F-actin , 30 wM TBA4 , and 0 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 146 , 1999 fied by the sequestering effect of thymosin B4 , making any change in critical concentration easily measurable .
The sequestering effect of thymosin B4 was drastically reduced by N-W ASP , as the result of the decrease in critical concentration ( Fig .
6 b ) .
Addition of 30 wM thymosin B4 to 2 M F-actin caused depolymerization of 1.28 M actin into thymosin B4-actin complex , consistent with a value of 0.1 + ( 30 - 1.28 ) / 1.28 = 2.2 wM for the K , of the thymosin B4-actin complex .
Upon addition of N-W ASP to this solution , the concentration of F-actin at steady state increased .
At saturation by N-W ASP , only 0.5 mM actin was unas-sembled , which , by solving the quadratic equation expressing the combination of the laws of mass conservation and mass action , corresponded to 0.47 wM thymosin B4-actin complex and 0.03 wM G-actin .
Hence , the barbed end critical concentration was decreased three- to fourfold by N-W ASP .
Sedimentation assays confirmed the conclusions derived from fluorescence measurements ( Fig .
6 b , inset ) .
In the presence of IcsA , the binding of N-W A SP to F-actin was strengthened ( Fig .
6 c ) , and N-WASP-bound IcsA then cosedimented with F-actin .
In conclusion , binding of IecsA to N-W ASP enhances the affinity of both its COOH terminal domain for Arp2/3 complex and its NH -terminal domain for F-actin .
Removal of VASP Does Not Affect Actin-based Movement of Shigella To test the postulate that the binding of vinculin to IcsA would serve to recruit VASP ( Laine et al .
, 1997 ) , which would have the same function in Shigella and Listeria movement , immunodepletion of VASP in platelet extracts was performed as described ( Laurent et al .
, 1999 ) .
Total depletion of VASP was checked by immunoblotting .
The movement of E. coli ( IcsA ) precoated with N-WASP was not affected by removal of VASP ( Table I ) .
Control samples were prepared in parallel to verify that Listeria , in contrast , did not move at all in VASP-depleted extracts , in agreement with previous observations ( Laurent et al .
, 1999 ) .
In conclusion , the putative vinculin-V ASP interaction is unlikely to play a role in Shigella movement .
Profilin Is Not Required , but Enhances Actin-based Movement of Shigella Via Binding to Actin , Not to Proline-rich Proteins Depletion of profilin from platelet extracts by extensive poly-L-proline chromatography led to a 40 % decrease in the rate of propulsion of both Listeria and E. coli ( IcsA ) .
Add-back of pure bovine spleen profilin ( 1 wM ) restored 80 % of the rate measured in mock-depleted extracts .
It has been postulated ( Suetsugu et al .
, 1998 ; Suzuki et al .
, 1998 ) that binding of profilin to the proline-rich regions of N-W ASP could play a functional role in filopodium ex-tension , which is , like Shigella movement , mediated by ( P , and S , ) , 2.09 mM ( P ; and S ; ) , and 4.65 j_M ( P ; and S , ) N-W ASP , respectively .

, 1997 ) .
We first checked that the mutated profilin bound actin in a functional fashion strictly identical to either the bovine profilin or the recombinant human wild-type profilin .
In brief , H133S profilin sequestered actin when barbed ends were capped , participated in barbed end assembly when they were uncapped , and the H1338 profilin-actin complex associated to barbed ends in a growth assay ( Gutsche-Perelroizen et al .
, 1999 ) at the same rate as the wild-type profilin-actin complex ( data not shown ) .
H 1338 profilin enhanced the rate of bacteria movement in profilin-depleted extracts to the exact same extent as bovine profilin in three reproducible experiments ( Table I ) , demonstrating that , by interacting directly with actin and not with a proline-rich protein , profilin enhances actin-based motility .
Accordingly , we recently showed ( Laurent et al .
, 1999 ) that the function of profilin in Listeria movement is independent of VASP , another proline-rich protein also initially thought to act by recruiting profilin .
Discussion The stimulation of local actin assembly by Arp2/3 complex in response to different stimuli is thought to be pivotal in the generation of a large diversity of cellular extensions ( lamellipodia , filopodia , neural growth cone , etc . )
, suggesting that a variety of connectors must link the different members of the Rho family to the Arp2/3 complex and activate actin polymerization by a common mechanism , with different partners .
Our work shows that lessons can be learned from Shigella to understand the molecular mechanism of Cdc42-induced filopodium extension mediated by actin polymerization .
The IcsA-N-WASP-Arp2/3 Ternary Complex Is Responsible for the Stimulation of Actin Assembly at the Surface of Shigella Recently , Rohatgi et al .
( 1999 ) showed that N-W ASP relays Cdc42 signals and directly activates the Arp2/3 complex in Xenopus egg extracts and in vitro with purified Egile et al .
Shigella flexneri Actin-based Motility N-WASP and Arp2/3 complex .
We extend this work to show that the Shigella IcsA protein mimics Cdc42 , to greatly enhance the affinity of N-W ASP for Arp2/3 complex , thus assembling a tight Ics ternary complex at the bacterial surface , in a conformation that has maximal activity in actin assembly .
N-W ASP activation by IcsA explains why Shigella actin-based motility is independent of the Rho GTPases ( Mounier et al .
, 1999 ) .
Our findings , combined with results from other laboratories ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ; Miki et al .
, 1998b ; Rohatgi et al .
, 1999 ) , can be summarized using a thermodynamic scheme expressing that : both Arp2/3 complex and N-W ASP exist in solution in two conformations , inactive ( X ) and active ( X* ; Scheme 1 ) .
The active form of Arp2/3 complex ( A* ) stimulates actin polymerization .
The active form of N-WASP ( W* ) exposes two functionally active domains involved in actin-based motility , which may be masked in the inactive state by intramolecular interaction ( Miki and Takenawa , 1998 ; Miki et al .
, 1998b ) .
The VCA binds Arp2/3 complex and G-actin , and the NH -terminal domain binds F-actin .
Our data ( Fig .
6 b ) indicate that the F-actin binding site is most likely located in the WH 1 domain , which also interacts with the verprolin homologue WIP .
This formulation accounts for the fact that the Arp2/3 complex by itself has a weak nucleating activity ( Mullins et al .
, 1998 ; Machesky et al .
, 1999 ) and that N-WASP by itself is able to bind F-actin and G-actin IosA N-WASP -- - -- - » N-WASPUlcsA Arp2/3*.N-WASP ¢ o/ .

Binding of IesA ( I ) to N-W ASP shifts the N-WASP equilibrium toward the W* form , exposing the VCA domain and the F-actin binding domain , thus enhancing the affinity of N-W A SP for active Arp2/3 complex ( Fig .
4 e ) and F-actin ( Fig .
6 c ) .
Binding of N-W ASP to Arp2/3 complex shifts the Arp2/3 equilibrium toward the A* form , increasing the amount of nucleating complex .
It is implicit here that to nucleate actin polymerization , Arp2/3 complex binds G-actin .
In the presence of IcsA and N-W ASP , the Arp2/3 complex equilibrium is maximally shifted toward the A * form , in a triangular A*-W*-I complex .
In this complex , pro-tein-protein bonds are formed between the three partners ( A-W , W-I , and A- ) .
Hence , each of the three components increases the stability of the complex .
It is very likely that in vivo the actin-polymerization machinery is highly integrated and works on an all-or-none basis , i.e .
, the Arp2/3 complex switches from an inactive to a fully active form upon interacting with the COOH -terminal region of N-W ASP , which itself is exposed only when Cdc42 has switched to its active conformation by binding GTP .
Separating the components of this machinery by purification may cause structural alterations that partially unmask the protein interfaces normally buried in the inactive state .
Detailed studies of the effect of solution variables on the activity of pure Arp2/3 complex will certainly help to understand the physical-chemical basis of N-W ASP and Arp2/3 activation .
VCA has a high affinity for Arp2/3 complex ( a rough estimate of 10 `` M~ ' can be derived from the polymerization curves ) , allowing easy depletion of Arp2/3 from extracts and a straightforward purification procedure by affinity chromatography .
At variance with a previous report ( Suzuki et al .
, 1998 ) , VCA does not appear to bind to IcsA and elicit actin polymerization at the surface of Shigella .
The reason for the discrepancy with Suzuki et al .
( 1998 ) remains obscure , but may relate to the different methods used to probe the interaction .
We conclude that VCA is not sufficient for IcsA binding and that this interaction probably also requires residues present outside of the VCA domain .
Since WASP and N-W ASP are very similar in sequence , it is surprising that WASP , which is abundant in platelets , does not appear able to bind IcsA .
A possible explanation is that WASP in platelets may be in strong interaction with other ligands , competing with IcsA binding .
It may be noted , in this respect , that while the CRIB domains of WASP and N-W ASP are very similar in sequence , differences exist in the binding of Cdc42-Y40C ( Miki et al .
, 1998b ) .
Whether Cdc42 and IcsA directly compete for the same site to activate N-W ASP is not known , but raises an interesting issue concerning the possible multiple ways of activation of N-W ASP .
The interface of the CRIB domain of N-WASP with GMPPCP-Cdc42 is known from NMR studies ( Abdul-Manan et al .
, 1999 ) .
It is also known that the glycine-rich regions of IcsA are involved in the association with N-W ASP ( Suzuki et al .
, 1998 ) .
The structural aspects of N-W ASP activation await more detailed investi-gation .
Like Shigella , other pathogen model systems may help discover the multiple effectors linking Arp2/3 complex to different signaling pathways .

Working model for actin-based movement of Shigella .

Center , Nucleation : interaction of VCA with G-actin and Arp2/3 complex in a ternary complex in which the G-actin is positioned at the barbed end .
Right , Barbed end growth and movement : the VCA domain of N-W ASP shuttles G-actin subunits to the growing barbed end .
The filament is maintained in close vicinity to the bacterium surface by binding to the NH , -terminal domain of N-W A SP .
The Arp2/3-N-WASP Complex Works with Actin as a Motor at the Surface of Shigella Analysis of the interaction of the COOH-terminal and NH -terminal domains of N-W A SP with actin provides insight in the mechanism by which actin polymerizes at the surface of Shigella .
The two domains of N-W ASP that become exposed upon binding to IcsA fulfill different func-tions .
The COOH-terminal domain binds G-actin and Arp2/3 complex .
The nucleation and filament branching activities of Arp2/3 imply that G-actin binds to Arp2/3 complex , perhaps by interacting with Arp2 or Arp3 ( Pantaloni , D. , manuscript in preparation ) .
We propose , in agreement with Machesky and Insall ( 1998 ) and Rohatgi et al .
( 1999 ) , that the binding of G-actin in the nucleation complex is facilitated by association of the VCA domain to Arp2/3 complex , because in the VCA-actin complex , actin is positioned in the right orientation to interact with Arp2/3 , in the structure of a barbed end nucleus , hence the free energy of G-actin binding to Arp2/3 is lowered .
Second , in the filament elongation step , while the VCA domain functions like profilin in barbed end assembly , shuttling actin subunits onto growing barbed ends , the NH -terminal domain of N-W ASP maintains the filament in the vicinity of Shigella surface .
We propose that the two domains of N-W ASP work together with actin as expected for a motor of insertional polymerization at the surface of Shigella ( Fig .
7 ) .
Note that it is the treadmilling of actin filaments ( which is a dissipative process ) that supports unidirectional filament growth and promotes steady movement .
N-W ASP acts as a molecular ratchet that transduces actin polymerization into force .
N-W ASP is the first protein described thus far that possesses an integrated profilin-like 1330 function and locally lowers the critical concentration of G-actin .
Whether other proteins share the same property in different cellular contexts is an exciting possibility .
The observed localization of Arp2/3 complex in the actin tail of L isteria ( Welch et al .
, 1997 ) and of Shigella ( Fig .
3 in the present work ) correlates with its localization in the lamellipodium ( Bailly et al .
, 1999 ; Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) .
In the present work , the combination of motility assays with the biochemical analysis of the effects of Arp2/3 complex and N-WASP on actin polymerization brings a functional insight into the immunolocalization studies .
While N-W ASP remains bound to IcsA as the bacterium is moving ( Fig .
3 ) , the Arp2/3 complex is activated by interacting with N-W ASP transiently to nucleate and branch the filaments , then Arp2/3 complex remains incorporated in the actin meshwork as it is formed .
We conclude that the Arp2/3 complex present in the actin tail ( and in the lamellipodium ) is no longer activated by N-W ASP .
This view is quite different from the currently expressed one ( Mullins et al .
, 1998 ; Machesky et al .
, 1999 ) .
The Shigella bacterial model , therefore , proves to be a good tool to understand the mechanics of lamellipodium extension .
Comparison of the Listeria and Shigella actin-based motility mechanisms provides interesting information on the different strategies available to induce actin assembly .
Listeria does not harness a cellular activator of Arp2/3 complex .
Instead , the ActA protein itself elicits the two functions of activated N-W ASP .
The central proline-rich domain of ActA binds VASP , which in turn binds F-actin , thus mediating the attachment of the filaments to the bac-terium , as does the NH-terminal domain of N-W ASP in Shigella .
Whether the NH-terminal domain of ActA , which activates nucleation by Arp2/3 complex , acts like VCA by interacting with the p21-Arc subunit of Arp2/3 complex and with G-actin , possibly in a profilin-like fash-ion , is an open issue that may be of general relevance in the stimulation of actin assembly and which deserves in-vestigation .
Remarkably , the NH » -terminal domain of ActA contains the acidic sequence DEWEE homologue of the DEWED in the extreme COOH-terminal region A of VCA , and a sequence KKRRKAIASS similar to the QKRSKAIHSS sequence in the cofilin homology region of VCA , but does not contain the verprolin homology regions present in VCA .
The possibility is raised that Arp2/3 complex is activated in a similar way by different effectors .
VASP Is Not Involved in Shigella Movement Removal of VASP from platelet extracts does not affect the movement of Shigella , while VASP is essential in the propulsion of Listeria .
This result rules out the postulated mechanism according to which VASP would work , in both Shigella and Listeria systems , as a profilin recruiter , to enhance actin assembly in an actin-based motility ( ABM ) complex ( Z eile et al .
, 1998 ) .
Incidentally , the physical relevance of that mechanism was questionable , since diffusion of profilin-actin is very fast and dissociation of profilin from a proline-rich target would introduce a kinetically limiting step in filament assembly .
Overall , our results are in general agreement with the conclusion derived by Goldberg ( 1997 ) that vinculin , hence the vinculin-V ASP interaction , is not required in Shigella motility .
Our Egile et al .
Shigella flexneri Actin-based Motility data further show that the function of profilin in actin-based Shigella movement is mediated by binding actin di-rectly , without interacting with the proline-rich region of N-W ASP .
Similarly , we demonstrated that the function of profilin in Listeria movement is independent of VASP ( Laurent et al .
, 1999 ) .
VASP in Listeria and N-W ASP in Shigella mediate attachment of the actin tail to the bacterial surface .
Hence , the mechanisms of movement of these two pathogens are similar in their physical principles , and some of the operators are the same ( Arp2/3 complex and actin ) , whereas some functions are elicited by different players .
From Actin Polymerization to Movement Although the interaction of IcsA with N-W ASP is essential in generating Shigella motility , N-W A SP -coated bacteria fail to actively move in a solution of F-actin at steady state in the presence of Arp2/3 complex .
As pointed out earlier ( Carlier , 1998 ) , regulatory factors that maintain G-actin at a high steady state concentration , by regulating the dynamics of actin assembly , are important missing ingredients in the reconstitution of movement ( Loisel et al .
, 1999 ) .
