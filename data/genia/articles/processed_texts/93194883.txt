and Jay A. Walters ( Received for publication , July 16 , 1992 ) From the Departments of Radiation Oncology and Microbiology and Immunology and the Massey Cancer Center , Medical College of Virginia , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , Virginia 23298 Protein phosphatases 1 and 2A are important in regulating cellular functions by controlling the phosphorylation state of their substrates .
In human monocytes , the inhibitors of these phosphatases , okadaic acid and calyculin A , were found to increase the mRNA accumulation and cytokine production of interleukin-18 and interleukin-1 « .
The increased mRNA accumulation was found to be primarily because of the increase in the transcription rate of the interleukin-1 genes .
Stimulation of interleukin-1 gene transcription may be caused by the stimulation of transcription factor activities , including those of AP-1 , by these protein phosphatase inhibitors .
Okadaic acid increased the synthesis of the interleukin-1 $ precursor and mature forms and their secretion .
This increased processing and secretion correlated with the stimulation of IL-18 convertase mRNA accumulation .
The stimulation of interleukin-1l1a « production by okadaic acid was more modest than that of interleukin- 183 .
However , the phosphorylation of the precursor interleukin-1a cytokine was increased .
These results show that protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors exert multiple effects on cytokine production in human monocytes and suggest that these two phosphatases play important roles in regulating interleukin-1 production .
Interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) is an important cytokine in inflammation and in the regulation of many immunological and physiological responses such as endotoxic shock , anorexia , endothelium activation , and increased acute-phase protein production ( for review , see Ref .
1 ) .
At the cellular level , IL-1 increases the synthesis of many cytokines , enzymes , serum proteins , oncogenes , and adhesion molecules , presumably by stimulating the activities of transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF- « B .
Hematopoietic cells of the myelomonocytic lineage , keratinocytes , and many other cell types produce IL-1 abundantly .
Of the two forms of IL-1 , IL-1a and IL-1 $ , IL-18 is the predominant form produced by monocytes and macrophages .
Both forms are produced as 31-33-kDa precursor proteins that are processed by specific proteases to the * This work was support in part by National Institutes of Health Grants AI-26928 ( to S. J. S. ) and P30-CA16059 ( to the Massey Cancer Center at the Medical College of Virginia ) .

active 17.5-kDa mature form .
An IL-1 { -specific processing enzyme , the convertase , has recently been characterized and cloned ( 2 , 3 ) .
The secretory pathway for IL-1 is unique among secreted proteins in that IL-1 is produced as a cytosolic protein , processed in the cytosol , and secreted without transit through the conventional rough endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi pathway ( 4 ) .
IL-1 secretion has been shown to be stimulated by Ca®*-ionophores , nigericin , and protein kinase C stimulation ( 5-7 ) .
The precursor form of IL-18 , in addition to its mature form , has been shown to be also secreted by macrophages ( 8 ) .
However , the active secretion of precursor and mature IL-1 by viable macrophages has been disputed ( 9 ) .
IL-1 production is stimulated by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , muramyl dipeptides , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) , and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a ( TNF ) , IL-6 , and IL-1 itself ( 1 ) .
These stimulants increase the transcription of the IL-1 genes .
For primary monocytes , LPS is by far the strongest physiological stimulant .
Besides transcriptional regulation , the production of IL-1 is regulated translationally by cAMP ( 10 , 11 ) and dexamethasone ( 12 ) .
The regulation of IL-1 gene by transcription factors is poorly understood .
Stimulants of IL-1 transcription such as LPS , PMA , TNF , and IL-1 have been shown to increase the binding activities of AP-1 and NF- « B ( 13-16 ) whose binding motifs are present in the promoter region of the IL-1 genes ( 17 , 18 ) .
PMA and LPS have been shown to exert their activating functions by increasing protein kinase C activity ( 16 , 19 ) .
It is therefore likely that phosphorylation regulation is important in IL-1 gene activation .
Besides protein kinases , Ser/Thr protein phosphatases have recently been shown to play important roles in regulating cellular functions by modulating the phosphorylation state of critical phosphoproteins ( 20 , 21 ) .
The phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors okadaic acid ( OA ) and calyculin A are capable of exerting multiple effects on cellular functions , including changes in glucose and fatty acid metabolism and cellular ion balance ( 20 , 21 ) , the stimulation of neurotransmitter release ( 22 ) and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity ( 23 ) , and the activation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator and urokinase receptor genes ( 24 , 25 ) .
More recently , we have shown that these phosphatase inhibitors induce TNF production in human monocytes ( 26 ) .
The stimulation of gene transcription by OA may be a result of the stimulation of the binding activities of the transcription factors AP-1 , AP-2 , NF- « B , and Egr-1 ( 26-29 ) .
In this report , we have examined the effects of these protein phosphatase inhibitors on the production of IL-1a and IL-1 ( 8 .
We found that the production of IL-18 was markedly increased by OA , and the increase was caused by the increased transcription rate of the IL-18 gene .
Increased IL-1 processing and secretion may also be because of the stimulation of the activities of IL-18 convertase whose mRNA accumulation was increased severalfold by LPS and 5802 Okadaic Acid and Calyculin A Stimulation of IL-1 Production OA .
On the other hand , OA induced more modest IL-1a cytokine production and mRNA accumulation , although the phosphorylation of IL-1a protein was increased .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials-OA and calyculin A were from Moana Bioproducts ( Honolulu , HI ) .

RESULTS OA Stimulation of IL-16 and IL-1a mRNA Accumulation in Human Monocytes and Myeloid Cell Lines-We have observed previously that OA and calyculin A stimulated IL-1 mRNA accumulation ( 26 ) .
To examine further the role of protein phosphatases in the regulation of IL-1 production , the optimal OA dose and time course for IL-la and stimulation were analyzed by Northern blot .
OA stimulated the increase in IL-18 mRNA accumulation optimally between 100 and 200 ng/ml ( Fig .
14 ) .
In some experiments , higher doses than 200 ng/ml caused some cells to lose viability after a 4-h incubation .
The inhibition of LPS-induced IL-1 $ 9 , IL-1 @ « , and IL-6 mRNA expression by high calyculin A doses ( 26 ) was not observed with OA .
In contrast to IL-1 $ , IL-1a and IL-6 mRNA accumulation was only slightly stimulated .
Whereas OA and LPS were synergistic in increasing steady-state level of TNF mRNA ( 26 ) , such synergy did not occur with IL-1 , IL-1a , and IL-6 mRNA ( Fig .
1B ) .
The stimulation of IL-18 and TNF mRNA expression by OA was further compared in two myeloid cell lines shown to express high inducible levels of these two mRNA ( 10 , 30 ; Fig .
1 , C and D ) .
In HL-60 , there was some basal IL-18 and no TNF mRNA accumulation in unstimulated cells , LPS has been shown to be a poor stimulant of IL-1 mRNA expression in these cells ( 10 ) .
A suboptimal dose of PMA induced little increase in these mRNAs .
OA and calyculin A increased the accumulation of both messages .
Calyculin A was a better stimulant than OA in increasing IL-1 $ mRNA accumulation , although they have comparable effects on TNF mRNA accumulation .
These results showed the difference in gene-induc-ing effects between OA and calyculin A .
Little synergy was observed for PMA with either OA or calyculin A .
In ML-1 cells , which produce the highest level of IL-18 mRNA in several myelomonocytic cell lines examined ( 10 ) , OA was a relatively poor stimulant of the expression of this message ( Fig .
1D ) .
OA and PMA were not synergistic in stimulating IL-1§ mRNA accumulation in ML-1 cells .
The expression of IL-1a mRNA in these cell lines was weak and was therefore not further examined .
Time Course of IL-1 mRNA Accumulation Stimulated by OA-The time course of IL-18 and IL-1a mRNA accumulation in OA- or OA plus LPS-stimulated monocytes was examined ( Fig .
2 ) .
The levels of both IL-1 mRNA peaked between 2 and 4 h in OA-stimulated cells ( Fig .
24 ) .
IL-6 mRNA increase was slower and was still increasing at 4 h. In cells stimulated with LPS plus OA ( Fig .
2B ) , the IL-18 mRNA level peaked earlier than in OA-stimulated cells and reached plateau level at 1 h. IL-1a and IL-6 mRNA accumulation peaked at about 2 h. No appreciable change in B-actin mRNA ( not shown ) and 28 S rRNA levels was observed during the experiment .
Decay of IL-1 mRNA in the Presence of OA-The stimulation of IL-1 mRNA accumulation may be a result of mRNA stabilization .
This was examined by mRNA decay studies ( Fig .
3 ) .
In contrast to TNF mRNA , which is stabilized by OA ( 26 ) , IL-1 and IL-1a mRNA were not similarly stabilized .
The half-lives of IL-1 mRNA were determined to be between 5804 A B OA < < 3 : l_1_ﬂ a + w - 50 100 200 o a 0 J -| wa | ** we - -- an wo an IL -la - § - wap < = wan IL-6 - .

Stimulation of IL-1 } and IL-1a mRNA accumulation in human peripheral blood monocytes and myeloid cell lines treated with protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors .
In panels A and B , human monocytes at 5 x 10°/ml ( 10 x 10° cells/sample ) were stimulated with the indicated agents for 2 h. In panels C and D , the cell lines were similarly stimulated .
The concentration of reagents were : L ( LPS ) , 100 ng/ml ; OA , 100 ng/ml in panel B and 200 ng/ml in panel C ; calyculin A , 200 ng/ml ; and P ( PMA ) , 1 ng/ml in panel C and 3 ng/ml in panel D. Lane C is the control lane .
The drug concentrations in panels A and D are in ng/ml .
Northern blot of total RNA was performed as described under `` Experimental Procedures `` and detected with the indicated probes as described ( 10 ) .
The whole sample was used in panels A and B , and 10 ug/lane was used in panels C and D. The experiments in panels A and B were performed three times and those of panels C and D twice .
35 and 45 min compared with about 17 min for TNF mRNA in the same experiments .
The mode of IL-1la mRNA decay is of interest .
In repeated experiments , two bands with higher and lower migration than that of the putative IL-l « mRNA were observed ( Fig .
3A ) .
Effects of OA on the Transcription Rate of IL-1 mRNA-The transcription rate stimulation by OA in monocytes was examined by nuclear run-on experiments ( Fig .
4 ) .
No signal was observed with the control plasmid probe .
The signal for IL-13 was 100- 200-fold higher than that of IL-1l1a and IL-6 .
Low basal IL-1a , and IL-6 transcription rates were observed in control cells .
Both OA and LPS stimulated the transcription of the three mRNA .
LPS and OA strongly stimulated IL-1 $ transcription .
This stimulation was weaker for IL-la and IL-6 , especially for OA stimulation , which resulted in only slight transcriptional increases above control .
Stimulation of transcription of all three genes by the combination of LPS and OA was comparable to those by LPS treatment alone .

Nuclear run-on of human monocytes stimulated with OA and LPS .
Nuclear run-on was performed as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
Monocytes ( 30 x 10° cells/sample ; 5 x 10° cells/ml ) were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS ( L ) , 100 ng/ ml OA , or their combination for 2 h followed by the isolation of nuclei for the run-on reaction .
The signals for IL-13 ( panel A ) were from a 4-h exposure , whereas the bands for the other genes were from a 4-day exposure .
The signal intensities for each sample were scanned as described in the legend to Fig .
3 .
The relative absorbance values were the ratio of cytokine signal intensities normalized against that of $ -actin .
They were plotted in panel B .

Stimulation of c-jun and junB mRNA Accumulation by OA and Calyculin A-Increases in AP-1 binding activity during OA stimulation may be important for the enhancement of the transcription rate of IL-1 genes ( 35 ) .
Because OA has been shown to increase AP-1 binding activities ( 26 , 27 ) , and c-jun and junB have opposite effects on gene regulation ( 36 , 37 ) , the stimulation of the expression of the jun-related mRNA species by OA and calyculin A was examined .
Time course studies showed that stimulation of c-jun mRNA expression by OA peaked between 2 and 4 h in human monocytes ( not shown ) .
The dose-response of OA and calyculin A stimulation of jun-related mRNA expression is shown in Fig .
5 .
There was little basal c-jun mRNA expression .
OA and calyculin A markedly increased its accumulation at 100 and 30 ng/ml , respectively .
junD mRNA , although at much lower levels , was similarly induced .
There was an appreciable amount of junB mRNA expression in resting cells .
OA and calyculin A further increased this expression at 100 and 30 ng/ml , respectively , but not at lower drug concentrations .
AP-1 binding proteins are composed of Jun-Jun or Fos-Jun dimers ( 15 ) .

Expression of fos-related mRNA in human monocytes stimulated with OA and calyculin A .
Panels A and B show the dose dependence of OA ( panel A ) and calyculin A ( panel B ) stimulation of c-fos and fosB mRNA accumulation in the presence ( lanes 6-8 ) or absence ( lanes 3-5 ) of 100 ng/ml LPS at the indicated concentrations ( ng/ml ) of phosphatase inhibitors .
fra-1 mRNA signals were too faint to show , but increases were observed at the highest concentrations of drugs used .
Panel C shows the time course of OA stimulation of c-fos , fosB , and fra-1 mRNA expression .
Monocytes were stimulated as in Fig .
5 , and Northern blot analysis was performed as in Fig .
1 .
Experiments in panels A and B were performed three times and that in panel C twice .
binding activities was examined ( Fig .
6 ) .
OA and calyculin A at 100 and 30 ng , respectively , stimulated the accumulation of c-fos mRNA , and no further stimulation was found when LPS was used with these phosphatase inhibitors ( Fig .
6 , A and B ) .
However , it is doubtful that increases in c-fos mRNA accumulation led to the early increase in AP-1 binding activities in OA-stimulated cells because in repeated time course studies , basal c-fos mRNA level was higher than that in OA-treated cells ( Fig .
6C ) .
Despite this high initial mRNA level , cells incubated in culture lost c-fos mRNA rapidly , and OA-stimulated cells incubated for the same time period contained more of this mRNA than control cells .
Both fosB and fra-1 mRNA accumulation were stimulated by OA and calyculin A .
5806 This accumulation peaked at 30 min .
fosB mRNA decreased 30 min after peak time , whereas fra-1 mRNA remained at plateau level for at least an additional 90 min .
OA Stimulation of IL-18 Cytokine Production-Unstimu-lated monocytes produced little IL-18 ( Fig .
7 ) .
LPS induced major cell-associated IL-13 species with apparent molecular weights of 33,000 , 31,000 , 28,500 , 18.800 , 17,500 , 17,000 , and 15,800 ( Fig .
7A ) .
Only the 33,000 and the 17,500 species were secreted .
OA stimulated comparable amounts of cellular IL-18 as LPS .
However , there was slightly more of the 17.5-kDa species in OA-stimulated cells .
The combination of OA and LPS did not further increase the level of the individual species of cell-associated IL-1/3 .
Both LPS and OA induced the selective secretion of the 33- and the 17.5-kDa IL-18 peptides .
This secretion of both the precursor and mature IL-1/3 species was not because of the loss in viability of the treated cells .
In addition to the trypan blue exclusion assay , lactate dehydrogenase assay of both cell lysates and supernatants was performed to estimate cell viabilities ( Fig .
8 ) .

Stimulation of monocyte IL-1 $ and IL-1a cytokine production by OA and LPS .
Monocytes were stimulated in [ *S ] Met-containing medium for 6 h as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
After stimulation , samples were divided into cell pellets ( lanes 1-4 ) and supernatants ( lanes 5-8 ) and immunoprecipitated with anti-IL-13 ( panel A ) or anti-IL-l « ( panel B ) as described ( 10 ) .
The stimulants were : lanes 7 and 5 , no stimulation ; lanes 2 and 6 , 100 ng/ml LPS ; lanes 3 and 7 , 50 ng/ml OA ; and lanes 4 and 8 , 100 ng/ ml LPS plus 50 ng/ml OA .
Immunoprecipitated proteins were fractionated on a 15 % polyacrylamide gel .

cell-associated .
The supernatants of cell treated with LPS , OA , or LPS plus OA contained similar lactate dehydrogenase levels .
In the supernatants of unstimulated monocytes , no secreted IL-13 was detected .
LPS stimulated the secretion of more of the mature 17.5-kDa than the precursor 33-kDa species ( Fig .
7A , lane 7 ) .
OA , despite inducing the same amount of mature 17.5-kDa IL-1 , stimulated the secretion of 5-10-fold more of the 33-kDa species than LPS ( compare Fig .
7A , lanes 2 , 3 , 6 , and 7 ) .
The combination of OA and LPS induced comparable secretory levels of the 33-kDa precursor form but induced much more mature IL-1 $ 3 than OA alone .
The major effects of LPS in this combination seemed to be the stimulation of the processing of the precursor IL-15 into mature IL-13 and the secretion of the mature form .
These effects were further examined in an LPS dose-response experiment ( not shown ) .
Increasing LPS dose from 50 to 2,500 ng/ml had limited effects on the production of cell-associated and secreted IL-1 .
OA in the presence of LPS induced more of the cell-associated 33-kDa and 18.8-kDa forms than LPS alone .
Increasing the LPS concentration in the presence of OA induced only the increase in the secreted 17.5-kDa form and no change in the production of any of the other cell-associated or secreted forms .
These experiments support the notion that LPS increases the processing and secretion of mature IL-193 .
LPS Stimulation of IL-18 Convertase mRNA Accumula-tion-To provide additional support that LPS stimulated the processing of precursor to the mature form , the effects of LPS and OA on IL-18 convertase mRNA accumulation were examined ( Fig .
9 ) .
Unstimulated monocytes expressed primarily the 2.5- and 1.9-kilobase IL-1/3 convertase mRNA species and low levels of the 0.5-kilobase species .
LPS stimulated this accumulation about 2-fold .
Although OA did not affect IL-13 convertase mRNA accumulation , it synergized with LPS to increase this accumulation by about 4-fold .

Stimulation of monocyte convertase mRNA expression by LPS and OA .
Monocytes at 5 x 10° cells/ml ( 10 x 10° cells/sample ) were stimulated with 0.1-2.5 ug/ml LPS ( lanes 2-4 ) , 50-100 ng/ml OA ( lanes 5 and 6 ) , or 0.1-2.5 ug/ml LPS plus 50 ng/ml OA ( lanes 7-9 ) for 2 h followed by Northern blot analysis as in Fig .
1 .
The results are representative of two similar experiments .
Kb , kilobases .
results suggest that a mechanism by which LPS increased mature IL-13 production is increasing IL-18 convertase syn-thesis .
OA Stimulation of IL-1 « Cytokine Production-Resting monocytes produced no IL-1a ( Fig .
7B , lanes 1 and 5 ) .
LPS stimulated the production of a minor 34.5-kDa and a major 33-kDa IL-1 @ cell-associated precursor form and a 17.5-kDa mature form ( Fig .
7B , lane 2 ) .
All of these forms were secreted ( Fig .
7B , lane 6 ) .
Consistent with the Northern blot results ( Fig .
14 ) , OA alone stimulated little IL-1a « production ( Fig .
7B ) .
The combination of OA and LPS stimulated more of the secreted mature 17.5-kDa form .
Interestingly , a series of bands with apparent molecular weights between 47,000 and 31,000 appeared in both pellets and supernatants when cells were treated with either OA alone , or OA with LPS .
Because IL-1a has been shown to be phosphorylated ( 38 ) , the obvious explanation for the appearance of the slower migrating bands is that they are the phosphorylated form of IL-1 @ .
This was tested in labeling experiments with P ; .
TNF and IL-18 were not labeled by *°P ( not shown ) .
All of the major S-labeled cell-associated IL-1a species were labeled by *°P , with the exception of mature IL-1 « ( Fig .
10 , compare lanes 4 in panels A and B ) .
The presence of OA increased the production of the 33 kDa and higher molecular mass forms that were labeled by both P ; and [ *S ] Met ( Fig .
10 , lanes 4 , panels A and B ) .
These results support the notion that OA increases the phosphorylation of IL-1 « and that the phosphorylated forms appear as slower migrating band in denaturing polyacrylamide gels .
Phagocytic and Pinocytic Functions of Monocytes Treated with OA-Because OA was toxic to monocytes incubated for more than 4 h at doses higher than 200 ng/ml , the integrity of the monocyte cellular function represented by endocytic capabilities in OA-containing medium was examined .
Monocytes in culture tend to detach from substrates with incubation time .
Thus , phagocytic and pinocytic functions were examined over a 2-h drug treatment .
As shown in Table I , OA over a dose range of 50-200 ng/m !
either in the presence or absence of LPS did not affect the phagocytosis of IgG-coated erythrocytes .
Furthermore , the pinocytosis of horseradish peroxidase by monocytes in OA-containing medium with or without LPS was not adversely affected by the drugs .
These results indicate that OA does not impair monocyte cellular functions under the experimental conditions studied .
DISCUSSION Ser/Thr protein phosphatase inhibitors have been shown to exert multiple effects on various cellular functions ( 20-29 ) .

In this experiment , 10 x 10° cells were used for each sample .

One of two similar experiments is shown .
The thick arrow identifies an S-labeled band of unknown origin .
The thin arrows indicate the positions of the precursor and mature IL-l « .
OA regulates cell cycle progression and stimulates gene tran-scription , protein secretion , glucose and ion transport , and glucose metabolism .
Its regulation of these processes is a result of the increase in phosphorylation state of crucial regulatory proteins such as mitogen-activated protein kinase , histones , G proteins , ion channels , and transcription factors .
In this report , we found that many of these processes involved in the monocyte production of IL-18 and IL-1a « were affected by OA or calyculin A. OA increased the transcription rate , steady-state mRNA level , and cytokine production of IL-18 and to a lesser extent , those of IL-1a @ .
Steady-state mRNA level of IL-6 , another cytokine produced by monocytes , was not increased appreciably by OA ( Fig .
1 , A and B ) .
Thus , protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors have differential effects on the mRNA accumulation of different cytokines .
Although calyculin A has been shown to be comparable to OA in stimulating monocyte cytokine mRNA accumulation at low concentrations , it was found to inhibit LPS-stimulated cytokine mRNA increase between 30 and 100 ng/ml ( 26 ) , whereas OA up to 200 ng/ml did not ( Fig .
14 ) .
Calyculin A was also more potent in stimulating IL-18 mRNA accumulation in the myeloid cell line HL-60 than OA .
Thus , the actions of the two inhibitors in regulating cytokine mRNA accumulation are not equiva-lent .
Because calyculin A inhibits protein phosphatase 1 10-100-fold better than OA ( 20 ) , the difference in this stimulation between calyculin A and OA may be a result of protein phosphatase 1 inhibition by calyculin A .
Despite these differences in action between OA and calyculin A , there is insufficient information to determine whether protein phosphatase 1 or 2A is responsible for the stimulation of IL-13 and IL-1a transcription and cytokine production in monocytes .
OA stimulated and IL-1a transcription rate .
It has also been shown to stimulate the activities of the binding factors AP-1 , NF- « B , and Egr-1 ( 26-29 ) .
Motifs for AP-1 and NF- « B are present in the promoter region of the two IL-1 genes .
Although the role of NF- « B binding motifs in the regulation of IL-1 transcription is poorly understood , an AP-1 binding site in an enhancer region located 2.9 kilobases upstream of IL-1 $ transcription start site has been implicated to be important for phorbol ester induction of the IL-1 gene 5808 Okadaic Acid and Calyculin A Stimulation of IL-1 Production TABLE I Phagocytosis and pinocytosis of monocytes treated with OA and LPS Monqcytes were plated in 24-well plates as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
After preincubation for 1 h in medium containing Fhe indicated drugs , IgG-coated erythrocytes or horseradish peroxidase was added to the cells .
Phagocytosis was expressed as phagocytic index , the gumber 91 `` IgG-coated erythrocytes ingested by 100 monocytes .
Horseradish peroxidase uptake was measured in duplicate wells and normalized against cell protein as described ( 34 ) .
The results are expressed as ng of horseradish peroxidase/mg of cell protein + S.D .
Each of these experiments is representative of two independent trials .

However , because of the complexity of the regulation of AP-1 activity , it is unclear how OA stimulates AP-1 binding .
AP-1 is composed of dimers of various fos- and jun-related proteins which can regulate gene transcription either positively or negatively ( 15 ) .
c-jun and junD have been found to regulate transcription positively , whereas jun B regulates negatively ( 36 , 37 ) .
We have observed the increase in accumulation of all three jun-related mRNA in monocytes upon OA or calyculin A treatment ( Fig .
5 ) .
How this increase in mRNA levels determines the cellular proportion of different jun-related proteins and what the final net effect these different dimers have on IL-1 gene transcription remain to be determined .
An additional level of complexity of binding factor activity regulation by stimulants such as OA occurs because binding activities are determined by the phosphorylation state of the dimers .
c-Ha-ras and PMA stimulate AP-1 binding activity by increasing and decreasing the phosphorylation state of two different sets of phosphorylation sites , respectively ( 39 , 40 ) .
It is conceivable that OA regulates AP-1 activity by both increasing the synthesis of and modulating the phosphorylation state of jun-related proteins .
In addition , OA can also increase AP-1 binding by increasing either the synthesis of fos-related proteins or by stimulating c-fos phos-phorylation , which also results in AP-1 stimulation ( 15 ) .
We have shown that fosB and fra-1 mRNA is increased by OA and calyculin A ( Fig .
6 ) .
Although c-fos mRNA level did not correlate with AP-1 activities , OA may still increase AP-1 binding by stimulating the phosphorylation of the c-Fos pro-tein .
OA can similarly stimulate NF- « B binding activity by modulating the phosphorylation state of I « B or NF- « B sub-units ( 41 ) .
The regulation of the stability of IL-18 and IL-la mRNA is different from that of TNF mRNA , although all three mRNAs contain the AUUUA motif shown to be crucial for cytokine and oncogene mRNA destabilization ( 42 ) .
TNF mRNA is more stable in monocytes stimulated by OA than by LPS ( 26 ) .
In contrast , the stabilities of IL-18 and IL-1 « mRNA were comparable in cells stimulated by either agent ( Fig .
3 ) .
In fact , IL-1a mRNA was found to be slightly more stable in LPS-stimulated cells .
It should be noted that LPS may also stabilize AUUUA-containing mRNA by stimulating protein kinase C , which stabilizes TNF mRNA ( 16 , 42 ) .
This stabilization may also explain the elevation of IL-1l1a and IL-6 mRNA accumulation in LPS-stimulated monocytes ( Fig .
14 ) , which exhibited only small increases in the transcription rate of these genes ( Fig .
4 ) .
The mechanism of cytokine mRNA stabilization has not been elucidated .
In the AUUUA-containing oncogene mRNA c-fos and c-myc , multiple domains in the mRNA have been shown to confer destabilization ( 43 , 44 ) .
It is possible that IL-1 , IL-1a , and TNF mRNA contain sequences in addition to the AUUUA motifs which determine their stability and are susceptible to different degrees of regulation by various agents .
The conversion of IL-la mRNA into a doublet during its decay may be caused by poly ( A ) addition or trimming .
Trimming of the poly ( A ) tail has been observed for the AUUUA-containing oncogene mRNA c-fos and c-myc ( 43 , 44 ) .
OA stimulated IL-18 cytokine production differently from LPS .
Although LPS stimulated primarily the secretion of mature IL-1 $ 9 , OA stimulated the production of more of the secreted precursor form .
In addition to stimulating the translation of precursor IL-18 , LPS may also stimulate the processing of the precursor IL-18 and secretion of the mature form .
This is supported by our finding that there is less cell-associated mature IL-18 and secreted precursor IL-18 in LPS-than in OA-stimulated cells ( Fig .
7 ) .
Furthermore , increasing the LPS concentration while keeping the OA concentration constant increased only the proportion of mature IL-18 secreted into the medium .
Northern blot analysis for convertase showed that LPS was a better stimulant of the mRNA accumulation of this protease than OA ( Fig .
9 ) .
Although not shown directly by enzyme assays or immunopre-cipitation , this result suggests that LPS increases the synthesis of IL-18 convertase .
The preferential secretion of the IL-18 mature form in LPS-containing medium ( Fig .
7A , lanes 6 and 8 ) may also suggest that the mature form is secreted more efficiently by monocytes than the precursor form .
However , LPS as well as OA may directly stimulate the secretory process in addition to regulating IL-18 # processing .
The stimulation of IL-1a precursor phosphorylation by OA suggests that under normal circumstances , IL-la precursor is phosphorylated by kinases and dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 1 or 2A .
The favored phosphorylation position is Ser-90 , although minor phosphorylation was also found at Ser-92 and Ser-102 ( 38 ) .
None of the phosphorylated positions is in the mature peptide , as has been observed ( Fig .
10 ) .
OA may increase the phosphorylation of all three favored Ser positions , although the phosphorylation of other positions has not been ruled out .
Because of the unique feature of IL-la processing and secretion , the phosphorylation of the precursor Okadaic Acid and Calyculin A Stimulation of IL-1 Production protein may serve some yet unidentified function in these cellular processes .
The results in this report support the view that there is a strong phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle occurring in primary cells ( 20 ) .
This is necessary for rapidly switching cellular functions between stimulated and resting states which involves protein phosphorylation for their interconversion .
In the case of monocyte production of IL-18 and IL-1a , protein phosphatase 1 and 2A may in addition be important in maintaining the resting phosphorylation state of key proteins involved in transcriptional activation and protein processing and secretion .
The elucidation of the role of these protein phosphatases in regulating IL-1 production will be of major future interest in the studies of signal transduction and the regulation of cellular functions .
