NF-KB is composed of distinct subunits ; five independent genes , NFKB1 ( p105 ) , NFKB2 ( p100 ) , RelA ( p65 ) , c-rel and relB , that encode related proteins that bind to « B DNA elements have been isolated .
We have previously found that NFKB2 ( p49/p52 ) acts in concert with RelA ( p65 ) to stimulate the HIV enhancer in Jurkat T-leukemia cells .
Here we examine the biochemical basis for the transcriptional regulation of HIV by NFKB2 .
Using Scatchard analysis , we have determined the dissociation constants of homodimeric p49 and heterodimeric p49/p65 for binding to the HIV B site .
p49 has a ~18-fold-lower affinity for the HIV « B site ( K , , = 69.1 pM ) than does the ~50-kDa protein NFKB1 ( p50 ) derived from p105 ( K , , = 3.9 pM ) .
In contrast , the affinity of heterodimeric NFKB2 ( p49 ) /RelA ( p65 ) for this site is ~-6-fold higher ( K , , = 11.8 pM ) than that of p49 alone .
Consistent with these findings , in vitro transcription was stimulated 18-fold by the addition of preformed , heterodimeric NFKB2 ( p49 ) /ReIlA ( p65 ) protein .
Transcriptional activation of the HIV enhancer was also subject to regulation by recently cloned IxB- « ( MAD-3 ) .
Recombinant IB- « ( MAD-3 ) inhibited the DNA binding activity of p65 , p49/p65 , and p50/p65 but stimulated the binding of NFKB2 ( p49 ) or NFKB1 ( pS50 ) .
Functional activation of an HIV reporter plasmid by p49/p65 in transiently transfected Jurkat T-leukemia cells was also inhibited by coexpression of MAD-3 .
These data suggest that binding of the NFKB2 subunit to the HIV enhancer is facilitated by RelA ( p65 ) and that this NFKB2 ( p49 ) /p65 heterodimeric complex mediates transcriptional activation which is subject to regulation by MAD-3 .
Nuclear factor xB ( NF-KB ) is a family of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins which regulate the transcription of a variety of cellular and viral genes ( 1 , 26 ) .
These transcription factors can be detected in the cytoplasm of many cells ( 3 ) in association with IxB 's , factors which inhibit their DNA-binding activity ( 2 , 47 ) .
The DNA-binding activity of NF-KB can be stimulated by cellular activation with cytokines ( 37 ) or viral trans-activators ( 6 , 28 , 39 ) .
Cellular protein kinases can alter the phosphorylation of IKB 's ( 13 , 29 ) , leading them to dissociate from NF-kB .
This dissociation is likely to serve as an important regulatory step which makes NF- « B available for binding to « B elements in the promoters of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses ( 26 , 27 ) .
In addition to these cellular genes , NF-KB can also activate the transcription of genes encoded by eukaryotic viruses .
Among these , the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) enhancer contains two « B sites which play an important role in inducible activation of viral transcription ( 33 ) .
Biochemical and molecular biological analysis of NF- « B has begun to reveal the complexity of this transcriptional regulatory pathway .
Highly purified NF- « B is composed of two major subunits , with molecular masses of ~50 and ~65 kDa , respectively ( 4 , 20 ) .
Isolation of cDNAs encoding the 50-kDa subunit ( p50 ) suggested that the primary translation product of this subunit is a ~105-kDa protein which requires posttranslational modification to obtain the mature form ( 8 , 14 , 22 , 32 ) .
Sequence comparison of p50 and the gene * Corresponding author .
1315 encoding the 65-kDa subunit ( p65 ) ( 36 , 40 ) revealed a high homology to the c-re/ proto-oncogene ( 9 ) and to the Dros-ophila morphogen dorsal ( 44 ) .
We have recently described another gene , p49/p100 , which can generate an alternative ~50-kDa form of NF- « B ( 7 , 34 , 43 ) .
A ~50-kDa protein can be generated either by posttranslational processing of a ~100-kDa precursor or by the generation of an alternatively spliced form , p49 ; the N termini of p49 and p100 are identical , and p49 appears to be functionally indistinguishable from truncated forms of p100 ( 38 ) .
The gene encoding this product has been designated NFKB2 , in contrast to the p105 subunit , which has been termed NFKB1 ( 30a ) .
A human cDNA clone that encodes a 35- to 37-kDa protein has been isolated .
The protein , MAD-3 , has been shown to have I « B-like properties ( 16 ) .
Purification and primary sequence analysis of rabbit IxB ( 10 ) has revealed its identity to MAD-3 .
The MAD-3/I « B protein contains five repeats of a sequence that was first identified in the erythroid protein ankyrin and is also present in a number of proteins involved in cell cycle control and tissue differentiation ( 35 ) .
The C termini of p100 and p105 also contain ankyrin/cell cycle repeats , and the C terminus of p105 has been shown to have IxB-like activity when expressed in trans ( 17 , 30 ) .
Cotransfection studies with p50 NFKB1 and p49 NFKB2 expression vectors have shown that these two genes , despite their homology , differ in the ability to activate « B-dependent transcription of the HIV enhancer in combination with RelA { ( p65 ) ( 38 , 43 ) .
Here we characterize the biochemical properties of recombinant p49 as well as its interactions with p65 and with MAD-3 ( 16 ) .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids .
Human p50 NFKB2 , a ~50-kDa N-terminal truncated form of p105 , was generated from Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV ) -p105 by using site-directed mutagenesis to create a stop codon at the position corresponding to residue 453 , followed by a BgilI restriction site .
Utilization of the previously created HindIII and Neo !
sites 5 of the Kozak sequence ( 23 ) of RSV-p105 ( 38 ) allowed subcloning into the RSV and pET3D vectors as previously described ( 43 ) .
Human p65 was isolated from a B-cell lymphoma cDNA library probed with a polymerase chain reaction-derived mouse p65 cDNA clone .
The human clone appears to be identical to that described previously ( 40 , 41 ) .
3 ' untrans-lated sequence was removed by digestion with BsaHI , and the 5 ' overhang was filled in with Klenow enzyme .
The Ncol site at the initiation ATG was used to subclone into the modified RSV -globin vector ( 43 ) , thus inserting a consensus Kozak sequence .
The MAD-3 cDNA ( 16 ) was kindly provided by Chiron Inc. and subcloned into the modified RSV vector ( 43 ) by ligation of an Xbel-Klenow-HindIII MAD-3 fragment into the modified RSV B-globin-derived backbone ( 43 ) .
The HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) in vitro transcription template ( pHIV380 ) was prepared by blunt-end ligation of a ~730-bp Xhol-Hindlll Klenow-treated fragment from an HIV-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) construct into the SacI site of the p ( C , AT ) : , G-less cassette vector ( 42 ) , whose 3 ' overhangs had been removed by treatment with T4 polymerase .
The adenovirus major late plasmid , pML200 ( 31 ) , was a kind gift of U. Schibler , University of Geneva .
All other expression vectors and « B reporter plasmids have been described previously ( 33 , 38 ) .
Protein purification and formation of heterodimers .
p49 and p50 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 ( LysE ) and partially purified by Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography as described previously ( 38 ) .
Proteins were affinity purified by oligonucleotide chromatography ( 19 ) , using the H-2 site as the target sequence ( 46 ) .
Proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient in a buffer containing 20 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N ' -2-ethane-sulfonic acid ( HEPES ; pH 7.9 ) , 1 mM EDTA , 0.1 mM ZnCl , , 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 , 10 % glycerol , 0.1 mM phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride , and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , dialyzed against the same buffer with 50 mM NaCl , and stored in aliquots at -70°C .
Proteins were judged to be at least 90 % pure by sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) analysis .
Heterodimers were formed by incubating concentrated proteins in a 3- , l volume for 15 to 40 min at 37°C and then diluting the mixture in the same dialysis buffer containing 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin per ml .

For cross-linking , purified homodimeric and heterodimeric proteins ( 200 to 1,600 ng ) were incubated with 4-ethyl-eneglycol bis ( sulfosuccinimidyl succinate ) ( EGS ; Pierce ) for 15 min at room temperature in a 40-p.l volume in the dilution buffer described above .
The reaction was stopped by the addition of p-lysine ( 25 mM , final concentration ) , and one half of each sample was resolved by electrophoresis on a SDS-6 % polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotting with an anti-p100 polyclonal antibody ( 38a ) followed by a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate ; the reaction was developed by using the ECL Western immunoblotting detection system ( Amersham ) .

RESULTS Dimerization and DNA binding of NFKB2 ( p49 ) .
The DNA-binding properties of recombinant NFKB2 ( p49 ) and NFKB1 ( p50 ) were compared by using the EMSA .
When purified , recombinant p49 protein was combined with recombinant RelA ( p65 ) and incubated with an HIV B site probe , a novel complex with a mobility distinct from that of either subunit alone was detected ( Fig .
1A , lane 2 versus 1 and 5 ) .
A similar complex was also observed with NFKB1 ( p50 ) in combination with RelA ( p65 ) ( Fig .
1A , lane 4 ) , consistent with previous findings that both NFKB2 ( p49 ) and NFKB1 ( p50 ) can form heterodimeric complexes with Re-1A¥ ( p65 ) ( 7 , 36 , 38 ) .
At high protein concentrations of p49 ( Fig .
1B , lanes 6 to 8 ) and p50 ( Fig .
1B , lanes 9 to 11 ) , complexes with lower mobility were observed , suggesting that NFKB2 ( p49 ) and NFKB1 ( p50 ) are able to form higher-order oligomers .
To investigate this observation further , the p49-containing complexes were incubated with the bifunc-tional chemical cross-linking agent EGS , resolved by SDS-PAGE , and detected by immunoblotting with an antiserum specific to p49 .
While native NFKB2 ( p49 ) migrated as predicted by its molecular weight ( Fig .
1C , lane 12 , arrow 1 ) , cross-linked protein migrated predominantly as a ~100-kDa species , while a minor ~200-kDa band was also present ( Fig .
1C , lane 13 , arrows 2 and 4 ) .
These data suggest that NFKB2 exists predominantly in a dimeric form in solution .
Cross-linked heterodimeric NFKB2/ReIA migrated at a position consisten ' with the predicted size of the heterodimer ( Fig .
1C , lane 14 , arrow 3 ) .
To examine the DNA-binding properties of NFKB2 , the dissociation constants of binding to different kB sites were determined .
Oligonucleotides were radiolabeled to high specific activity , and dilutions of probe were incubated with a constant concentration of protein .
Bound and free DNA species were resolved by gel electrophoresis , and dissociation constants were determined by Scatchard analysis .
The affinity of homodimeric NFKB2 ( p49 ) for the HIV « B site was approximately 18 times weaker than that of NFKB1 ( p50 ) ( Fig .
2 ) .
Also , homodimeric p49 showed a higher affinity for the H-2 « kB element than for the HIV « B site ( Fig .
3 ) , consistent with previous studies in which this 1318 DUCKETT ET AL .

Affinity of NFKB2 ( p49 ) and NFKB1 ( p50 ) for the HIV kB site .
To determine dissociation constants of homodimeric NFKB2 ( p49 ) and NFKB1 ( p50 ) for binding to the HIV « B ( GGG GACTTTCC ) site , a constant amount of purified subunit ( ~1 fmol active protein ) was incubated with a range of radiolabeled probe concentrations , in a 10-pl reaction , and analyzed by EMSA as described in Materials and Methods .
Bound ( B ) and free ( F ) probe species were quantitated by using a Betascope analyzer ( Betagen ) , and dissociation constants were determined by Scatchard analysis .
Reactions were performed in triplicate .
difference had not been quantitated ( 7 , 34 , 38 ) .
However , heterodimeric NFKB2 ( p49 ) /ReIA ( p65 ) showed a five- to sixfold-higher affinity for the HIV site than did p49 alone ( Fig .
3A ) .
The association of NFKB2 ( p49 ) with RelA ( p65 ) increased its affinity for the palindromic H-2 xB site less than twofold under the same conditions ( Fig .
3B ) .
NFKB2 ( p49 ) /ReIA ( p65 ) heterodimers stimulate HIV transcription in vitro .
The effect of heterodimeric NFKB2 ( p49 ) / RelA { ( p65 ) protein on the transcriptional control of HIV was examined in vitro by using a reporter plasmid in which the HIV LTR was cloned upstream of the synthetic ( C ; AT ) q cassette ( 42 ) to allow the transcription of a ~380-nucleotide RNA transcript lacking guanosine residues .

Addition of preformed , heterodimeric NFKB2 ( p49 ) / RelA ( p65 ) stimulated transcription of HIV up to 18-fold ( Fig .
4 , lane 4 ) , while addition of a similar quantity of NFKB2 ( p49 ) or RelA ( p65 ) alone stimulated HIV transcription only 1.4-fold ( lane 2 ) or 6.8-fold ( lane 3 ) , respectively , as determined by digital scanning analysis of the autoradiogram shown in Fig .

Transcription of a ~200-bp cassette driven by the adenovirus major late promoter was not significantly affected by the addition of NFKB2 ( p49 ) and RelA ( p65 ) proteins .
Binding of heterodimeric NFKB2 ( p49 ) /ReIA ( p65 ) to DNA is blocked by MAD-3 protein .
The effect of the MAD-3 gene product on the DNA binding of NFKB2 ( p49 ) was next examined .
Recombinant MAD-3 protein , expressed in E. coli and purified as a fusion protein with GST , was incubated with combinations of NF- « B subunits and analyzed by EMSA .
Addition of GST-MAD-3 protein inhibited the DNA binding of RelA ( p65 ) alone ( Fig .
5 , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Recombinant MAD-3 protein had no inhibitory effect on NFKB2 ( p49 ) or NFKBI ( p50 ) binding alone and in fact stimulated the DNA binding of homodimeric p49 and p50 p4 14 Kd=15.7pM [ B ] ( PM ) FIG .

Effects of recombinant MAD-3 on DNA binding of NF- « B proteins .
MAD-3 protein expressed as a fusion protein with GST ( 100 ng ) or a GST control was incubated under standard EMSA conditions with recombinant RelA ( p65 ) ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , NFKB2 ( p49 ) ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , heterodimeric NFKB2 ( p49 ) /ReIA ( p65 ) ( lanes 5 and 6 ) , p50 ( lanes 7 and 8 ) , heterodimeric NFKB1 ( p50 ) / RelA ( p65 ) ( lanes 9 and 10 ) , recombinant Spl ( lanes 11 and 12 ) , or alone ( lanes 13 and 14 ) .
EMSA was performed as described in Materials and Methods .
( Fig .
5 , lanes 3 versus 4 and 7 versus 8 ) .
When GST-MAD-3 , in contrast to GST , was incubated with either NFKB2 ( p49 ) / RelA ( p65 ) or NFKB1l ( p49 ) /ReIA ( p65 ) heterodimers , both DNA-binding activities were strongly inhibited ( Fig .
5 , lanes 5 versus 6 and 9 versus 10 ) , suggesting that neither NFKB1 nor NFKB2 affected the ability of MAD-3 to interact with its target sequence on RelA ( p65 ) .
Addition of MAD-3 to p49/ p65 or p50/p65 heterodimers , while inhibiting the binding of the heterodimeric complex , also stimulated the appearance of nucleoprotein complexes identical in mobility to the respective homodimer , again suggesting that MAD-3 can interact directly with NFKB2 ( p49 ) and NFKB1 ( p50 ) to enhance their DNA-binding properties .
MAD-3 had no effect on the binding of recombinant Spl protein to its cognate site ( Fig .
5 , lanes 11 and 12 ) , confirming that these inhibitory and stimulatory effects were specific .
Transcriptional activation of the HIV enhancer by NFKB2 ( p49 ) /RelA ( p65 ) in transfected Jurkat cells is inhibited by MAD-3 .
To determine whether transcriptional activation by p49/p65 heterodimers could be inhibited by MAD-3 in a T cell , expression vectors encoding different NF- « B subunits and MAD-3 were cotransfected into Jurkat T-lymphoma cells together with reporter plasmids containing the HIV enhancer linked to the CAT gene .
Cotransfection of equal amounts of p49 and p65 plasmids stimulated transcription mediated through the HIV LTR approximately 13-fold .
Consistent with previous reports , this transactivation was more potent with NFKB2 ( p49 ) /ReIA ( p65 ) than with NFKB1 ( p50 ) /ReIA ( p65 ) expression vectors ( 38 , 43 ) .
Co TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION BY NFKB2 AND IkB-a _ 1319 transfection of an expression plasmid encoding MAD-3 almost completely inhibited the stimulation observed with both p49/p65 and p50/p65 ( Fig .
6A ) .
This effect was also seen with a reporter plasmid bearing the heterologous simian virus 40 promoter containing multiple kB sites ( data not shown ) .
MAD-3 had no inhibitory effect on the kB-indepen-dent transcription stimulation of HIV by the cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene product and did not significantly inhibit CAT transcription mediated by the RSV LTR ( Fig .
6B ) .
In addition , this effect was observed in a dose-respon-sive manner ( Fig .
6C ) .
These data demonstrate that MAD-3 exerts its inhibitory effect specifically through NF- « B , most likely through its interaction with RelA ( p65 ) .
DISCUSSION We have examined the biochemical basis for NFKB2 binding to kB and its ability to dimerize and interact functionally with p65 and MAD-3 .
We find that the affinities and specificities of DNA binding by NFKB2 ( p49 ) and NFKB1 ( pS50 ) differ considerably .
Notably , binding of NFKB2 ( p49 ) /ReiA ( p65 ) to « B shows more than fivefold-greater affinity than does binding of NFKB2 ( p49 ) , and this heterodimer stimulates transcription of the HIV enhancer in vitro .
The interaction of heterodimers of NF-KB , NFKB2 ( p49 ) /RelA ( p65 ) and NFKB1 ( p50 ) /RelA ( p65 ) , was inhibited by the MAD-3 IxB , but neither NFKB2 ( p49 ) nor NFKB1 ( p50 ) binding was inhibited by MAD-3 .
The finding that NFKB2 ( p49 ) /ReIA ( p65 ) stimulates transcription of the HIV enhancer in vitro ( Fig .
4 ) documents that NFKB2 ( p49 ) and RelA { ( p65 ) act in concert to stimulate HIV transcription .
Previous studies had shown that overexpression of NFKB2 ( p49 ) .
and RelA ( p65 ) stimulated « B-dependent reporter gene transcription in transfected cells , but the possibility remained that this effect was indirect , ( e.g .
, due to the initiation of a cascade of stimulatory events or an association with endogenous cellular factors ) .
The data reported here suggest that NFKB2 ( p49 ) /RelA ( p65 ) exerts a direct stimulatory effect on transcriptional initiation .
Recent studies have suggested that homodimeric NFKB1 ( p50 ) protein may stimulate « B-dependent transcription independently of RelA ( p65 ) ( 11 , 24 ) ; the in vitro transcription data presented here suggest that this is not the case for NFKB2 ( p49 ) , since transcription of the HIV enhancer was not significantly stimulated by NFKB2 ( p49 ) alone ( Fig .

2 and 3 ) relative to NFKB1 ( p50 ) , as well as its site specificity , highlight significant differences between NFKB2 ( p49 ) and NFKB1 ( p50 ) .
The affinity of recombinant NFKB2 ( p49 ) for the HIV « B site ( K , , = 69.1 pM ) is 17.7 times lower than that of NFKB1 ( p50 ) ( K , , = 3.9 pM ) under the same conditions .
The binding K , , of NFKB1 ( p50 ) for the HIV « B site compares very favorably with results of a previous report ( 11 ; 3.9 pM versus 6.7 pM ) which used nearly identical experimental conditions .
While the affinities of NFKB1 ( p50 ) for the H-2 « B and HIV xB sites are very similar ( 10a , 11 ) , NFKB2 ( p49 ) has a four- to fivefold-higher affinity for the H-2 site ( K , , = 15.7 pM ) than for the HIV « B site ( K , , = 69.1 pM ) .
Heterodimeric NFKB2 ( p49 ) /ReIA ( p65 ) also binds to the HIV « B site with ~6-fold-higher affinity ( K , , = 11.8 pM ) than does NFKB2 ( p49 ) alone .
This difference in affinity is not observed with NFKB1 ( p50 ) , whose affinities for the HIV element as either a homodimer or a NFKB1 ( p50 ) / ( RelA ( p65 ) heterodimer ( 6.7 pM versus 5.7 pm [ 11 ] ) are very similar ( 10a , 24 , 38 ) .

Evidence that stimulation of « B-dependent CAT activity by NFKB2 ( p49 ) and RelA ( p65 ) expression vectors is blocked by coexpression of MAD-3 in vivo .
( A ) Jurkat cells were cotransfected with 5 g of HIV-CAT reporter plasmid , 0.2 ug of an expression vector encoding NFKB2 ( p49 ) , NFKB1 ( p50 ) , or RelA ( p65 ) as indicated , 0.5 ug of RSV-MAD-3 expression vector as indicated ( open bars ) , or 0.5 ug of an RSV-B-galactosidase control ( filled bars ) .
Transfections and CAT assays were performed as described in the text ; CAT activity is shown as percent conversion .
( B ) Effect of MAD-3 on « B-independent CAT transcription .
A 0.5-ug sample of MAD-3 or a promoter control was cotransfected with 2 pg of RSV-CAT ( 15 ) or 5 ug of a « B-mutated HIV-CAT reporter plasmid with a plasmid expressing the cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) immediate-early gene ( 12 ) as indicated .
( C ) Dose-response inhibition of p49/p65-mediated activation by MAD-3 .
NFKB2 ( p49 ) /ReIA ( p65 ) vectors ( 0.2 mg ) with HIV-CAT ( 5 ug ) or RSV-CAT ( 2 ug ) were cotransfected with the indicated amounts of MAD-3 or RSV promoter control and assayed for CAT activity as described in the text .
All data are representative of at least four independent transfections .
affinity of the NFKB2 ( p49 ) /ReIA ( p65 ) complex for « kB may explain why NFKB2 was not identified initially by primary amino acid sequence from affinity-purified NF-kB .
Previous studies have shown that the RelA ( p65 ) subunit can bind to the 3'° ( CTTTCC ) half-site of the HIV « B sequence , although with low affinity ( 45 ) .
It is therefore likely that the binding of NFKB2 ( p49 ) is stabilized by the affinity of RelA ( p65 ) for this half-site .
Although the affinity of NFKB2 ( p49 ) for « kB has been shown to be considerably weaker than that of NFKB1 ( p50 ) , NFKB2 ( p49 ) nonetheless stimulates the < B-directed transcription of several genes more potently than does NFKB1 ( p50 ) when associated with RelA ( p65 ) ( Fig .
6A ) ( 38 ) .
Taken together , these findings suggest that the affinity of binding to DNA is not the only determinant of the specificity of transcriptional activation for the HIV enhancer .
Despite their differences in DNA-binding affinity , the interactions of both NFKB2 ( p49 ) and NFKB1 ( p50 ) with RelA ( p65 ) and MAD-3 were indistinguishable .
In DNA-binding experiments , MAD-3 inhibited the binding of any complex which contained RelA ( p65 ) , regardless of its associated subunit ( Fig .
5 ) .
Surprisingly , the binding of homodimeric NFKB2 ( p49 ) and NFKB1 ( p50 ) was stimulated by MAD-3 .
Although MAD-3 inhibited the binding of heterodimeric NFKB2 ( p49 ) /Rel ( p65 ) and NFKB1 ( p50 ) RelA ( p65 ) to DNA , in the same reaction it was found to stimulate the appearance of homodimeric NFKB2 ( p49 ) and NFKB1 ( p50 ) , respectively .
While MAD-3 may conceivably exert these stimulatory effects by disrupting the heterodimeric complex and sequestering RelA ( p65 ) , allowing newly formed homodimeric NFKB2 ( p49 ) or NFKB1 ( p50 ) to bind , we believe it more likely that MAD-3 can directly stimulate the binding of NFKB2 ( p49 ) and NFKB1 ( p50 ) , since the same effect is observed with homodimeric NFKB2 ( p49 ) and NFKB1 ( p50 ) .
We postulate that our preparations of heterodimeric protein contain a small amount of homodimeric NFKB2 ( p49 ) or NFKB1 ( p50 ) , whose DNA-binding properties are enhanced in the presence of MAD-3 .
MAD-3 had no effect on the binding of the unrelated factor , Spl , for its cognate site , and MAD-3 itself possessed no detectable DNA-binding properties .
This observation suggests that MAD-3 is capable of interacting specifically with Rel-related proteins without necessarily inhibiting their ability to bind DNA .
This possibility is supported by two earlier reports .
The first of these ( 25 ) demonstrated that the ankyrin repeat-containing protein , GABP-B , can enhance the DNA binding of the Ets-related protein , GABP- « , and the second ( 21 ) reported that antibodies raised against IxB could recognize nuclear NF- « B .
However , since overexpression of MAD-3 inhibited « B-dependent transactivation in all cases ( Fig .
6 ) , the stimulatory effect of MAD-3 on NFKB2 ( p49 ) and NFKB1 ( p50 ) binding does not correlate with its functional properties , and so the biological significance of this unexpected effect is unclear .
MAD-3 also prevented functional activation of the HIV enhancer by NF- « B in Jurkat cells .
In the absence of MAD-3 , overexpression of either Vor .
13 , 1993 NFKB2 ( p49 ) , NFKB1 ( p50 ) , or RelA ( p65 ) slightly stimulated HIV-CAT through the « B site , and we have previously postulated that this low-level stimulation may be due to association with endogenous NF-kB subunits ( 38 , 43 ) .
Cotransfection of NFKB2 ( p49 ) or NFKB1 ( p50 ) with RelA ( p65 ) , however , provided greater stimulation , particularly with NFKB2 ( p49 ) .
Cotransfection of a MAD-3 expression vector inhibited NFKB2 ( p49 ) /ReIA ( p65 ) or NFKB1 ( p50 ) / RelA ( p65 ) stimulation by 80 to 90 % in all cases ( Fig .
6A ) .
In summary , these data suggest that the protein encoded by NFKB2 plays an important role in regulation of the HIV enhancer .
The role of this NF- « B subunit in the control of other viral and cellular genes is not yet fully understood .
The recent identification of NFKB2 in association with translocation in a B-cell lymphoma suggests that NFKB2 may also contribute to the regulation of genes involved in cell cycle regulation or oncogenesis .
Despite the considerable structural similarity of NFKB1 and NFKB2 , the data presented here show that these gene products have distinct biochemical properties .
These biochemical differences provide a molecular basis to explain functional differences between NFKB1 and NFKB2 .
These results also demonstrate that despite their similarity , these DNA-binding subunits of NF- « B differ significantly in the ability to stimulate transcription .
The interactions between alternative NF-kB complexes and other cellular transcription factors would thus provide a mechanism to selectively regulate transcriptional activation of the HIV enhancer , and they suggest that the basis for the difference between the ability of NFKB2 ( p49 ) and NFKB1 ( p50 ) to activate transcription is independent of DNA-binding affinity .
