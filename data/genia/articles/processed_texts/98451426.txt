Sha , `` Andrew Grupe , * Gary Peltz , * and Kenneth M. Murphy** Previously , we analyzed the proximal IL-4 promoter in directing Th2-specific activity .
An 800-base pair proximal promoter conferred some Th2-selective expression in transgenic mice .
However , this region directed extremely low reporter mRNA levels relative to endogenous IL-4 mRNA , suggesting that full gene activity requires additional enhancer elements .
Here , we analyzed large genomic IL-4 regions for enhancer activity and interaction with transcription factors .
The proximal IL-4 promoter is only moderately augmented by GATA-3 , but certain genomic regions significantly enhanced GATA-3 promoter transactivation .
Some enhancing regions contained consensus GATA sites that bound Th2-specific complexes .
However , retroviral transduction of GATA-3 into developing T cells induced IL-5 to full Th2 levels , but only partially restored IL-4 production .
Thus , we propose that GATA-3 is permissive , but not sufficient , for full IL-4 enhancement and may act through GATA elements surrounding the IL-13/IL-4 gene locus .

The transcriptional basis for Th2 cytokine expression has been proposed to involve two Th2-specific transcription factors , c-Maf and GATA-3 ( 3 , 4 ) .
GATA-3 is important for embryonic development and T cell development ( 5 ) .
GATA-3 deficiency is embryonically lethal , and GATA-3-defi-cient T cells do not complete normal thymocyte maturation ( 6 ) .

E-mail address : murphy @ immunology.wustl.edu Copyright © 1998 by The American Association of Immunologists recent studies analyzed GATA-3 in Th2 cytokine expression ( 3 , 7 ) .
The first proposed that GATA-3 is necessary and sufficient for IL-4 production by CD4 * T cells ( 3 ) .
The second suggested , however , that GATA-3 acts directly to induce IL-5 promoter activity via a GATA element upstream of the CLEO element ( 7 ) .
While previous studies of IL-4 gene regulation in T cells focused on the proximal 800 base pairs ( 8-15 ) , this promoter region is not sufficient to direct full IL-4 gene activity ( 16 ) .
The 800-bp promoter was able to direct some degree of Th2-selective expression in several transgenic reporter lines .
However , the amount of reporter mRNA was virtually undetectable compared with the levels of endogenous IL-4 mRNA .
Thus , other regulatory elements outside of the 800-bp proximal promoter are required to direct full IL-4 gene activity ( 16 ) .
By scanning the IL-4/IL-13 locus , we identified several genomic regions having enhancer activity that increase IL-4 promoter transactivation by GATA-3 .
GATA elements from these regions bind Th2-specific complexes .
Using retroviral transduction of GATA-3 into naive T cells , we show that GATA-3 induces IL-5 expression M12 cells : 20 ug plasmid Jurkat cells 14 12 ) A B 4 5 10 § os j s < 8 2 T o +4 LL 1 2 0 Sos Sn In , % Sn .

Results and Discussion Dose-dependent regulation of IL-4 promoter by GATA-3 We examined the effects of GATA-3 in both M12 and Jurkat cells for two different IL-4 promoters ( - 157 Luc and -800 Luc report-ers ) .
Using 20 ug of GATA3-RV expression plasmid ( GATA3-RV ) , we observed ~8- to 12-fold augmentation in M12 cells and only 4- to 6-fold in Jurkat cells for both reporters ( Fig .
1 ) .

E , T cells ( 10 ) as described above in B were analyzed by Western blotting using HG3-31 ( 1:3000 ) for GATA-3 expression .
The data presented are from 1 of 11 similar experiments .
200 % 150 % | 100 % IL-4 ( % Control ) 50 % 0 % augmentation ( Fig .
1B ) , because when using 5 pg rather than 20 jg of GATA3-RV , the augmentation was not significant .
The level of augmentation seen in both M12 and Jurkat cells was significantly lower than previously reported for the IL-4 promoter ( 3 ) using the same M12 system .
To determine whether the GATA-3 actions were specific to the IL-4 promoter , we examined four other cytokine reporters , as well as an NF- « B and an NF-AT reporter construct , for activation by GATA-3 ( Fig .
24 ) .
The IL-2 reporter ( 8 ) was unaffected by GATA-3 , while the IFN-B , NF- « B ( 17 ) , and IFN-y reporters were augmented twofold .
As noted above , the L_____J 7.3 ng/ml oa O s 59 ng/m !
0 % me-rrd Th1 _ Th2 Th1 Th2 -800 Luc reporter showed ~6-fold activation by GATA-3 , as did the trimerized NF-AT site reporter construct ( Fig .
24 ) .
A single WGATAR motif resides at -274 to -269 in the IL-4 proximal promoter ( Fig .
34 , probe 4 ) , which binds a Th2-specific complex that is shifted by the anti-GATA3 Ab HG3-31 ( Fig .
3C ) .
To test the role of this element in augmenting the IL-4 promoter , we examined a series of promoter truncations and deletion constructs ( Fig .
2B ) .
Removal of this GATA element , either by 5 ' truncation ( DM3 ) or internal deletion ( ID5 ) , reduced responsiveness to GATA3-RV only slightly ( Fig .
2C ) , suggesting that this 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 3826 single GATA element is not the only element required for enhancement of IL-4 reporter activity .
A sequence between -112 to -107 which was recently suggested ( 7 ) to be a potential GATA site has already been shown by supershift analysis to interact with NF-Y ( 8 ) rather than GATA-3 .
A final GATA sequence is present at +19 to +24 of the 5 ' untranslated IL-4 promoter region .
However , this sequence does not interact with a complex characteristic of GATA-3 , since it is not shifted by HG3-31 and is present in both Th1 and Th2 cells ( Fig .
3C ) .
Also , removal of this GATA element from the context of the -157 Luc reporter only slightly reduced the degree of GATA-3 inducibility ( Fig .
2C ) .
In summary , while we confirm that GATA-3 augments IL-4 reporter activity , we observed substantially lower levels of transactivation than reported earlier .
Our deletion/mutation analysis suggests that the consensus GATA elements present between -741 and +60 of the IL-4 promoter may not represent the relevant or only targets for this transactivation .
In fact , a recent study showed that that GATA-3 and GATA-2 exhibit distinct DNA-binding properties from GATA-1 based on their unique N-terminal zinc finger domains , ( 18 ) , suggesting that perhaps nonconsensus GATA elements may need examination in future studies .
Identification of regions that enhance IL-4 promoter activity Since the 800-bp promoter was insufficient to direct reporter expression in transgenic mice to the levels of endogenous IL-4 ( 16 ) , we searched for enhancer activity within a 45-kb region spanning the IL-13 and IL-4 genes ( Fig .
3A ) .
Several regions directly increased reporter activity of the -800 Luc reporter ( Fig .
3B , open bars ) .
However , more significant increases were seen in response to transactivation by GATA-3 ( Fig .
3B , closed bars ) .
The two most active fragments ( A and B ) contained sequences with consensus WGATAR motifs , both upstream and downstream of the IL-13 gene .
Two other active fragments ( C and D ) however had no GATA motifs , suggesting that other factors might participate in their enhancer activity .
Notably , the least active region was that immediately upstream of the IL-4 promoter ( E ) .
Several predicted GATA motifs from A and B bind Th2-specific complexes in EMSA ( Fig .
3C ) .
Thus , the Th2-specific expression of GATA-3 could potentially influence IL-4/IL-13 gene expression as an enhancer binding factor that augments gene expression from sites at a distance from the promoter rather than acting exclusively within the promoter region .
GATA-3 does not restore IL-4 gene expression We wished to test the role of GATA-3 in the context of normal CD4 * T helper development rather than in transformed cells .
We used retrovirus to direct GATA-3 expression independently of its normal extinction during Thl development ( Fig .
44 ) to allow us to ascertain whether GATA-3 is necessary and sufficient for IL-4 gene expression in normal T cells .
We infected GATA-3-expressing or control retrovirus into T cells and induced either Th1 or Th2 development ( Fig .
4B ) .
GATA-3-transduced or control T cells were analyzed for effects on cytokine expression .
Forced GATA-3 expression in Th2 cells did not increase IL-4 production , but nearly doubled IL-5 production ( Fig .
4 , C and D ) .
However , GATA-3 expression in Th1 cells led to only a 30 % restoration of IL-4 relative to the Th2 control level , but led to a full restoration of IL-5 production .
Western analysis showed that the level of GATA-3 achieved by retroviral expression is equivalent to that of a Th2 control ( Fig .
indicating that lowered cytokine levels of the transduced Th1 cells is not simply a result of lower GATA-3 levels .
Thus , in the context of normally developing Th cells , GATA-3 appears to influence the expression of IL-5 more strongly than that of IL-4 .
GATA-3 appears to be sufficient to induce full IL-5 levels in T cells , even those treated to undergo Th1 development ( by exposure to CUTTING EDGE IL-12 and anti-IL-4 Ab ) .
In contrast , GATA-3 was less potent in restoring IL-4 expression in T cells treated by IL-12 .
We suggest that the IL-4 promoter is weakly transactivated by GATA-3 directly , but in the context of certain regions of the IL-13/IL-4 locus , becomes highly GATA-3 responsive .
This model is similar to the mechanism whereby -globin gene expression is controlled by GATA-1 through actions at hypersensitive site 4 ( 19 ) .
However , GATA-3 is unlikely to act alone in controlling induction of the IL-4/IL-13 locus , since retroviral expression of GATA-3 into already differentiated Th1 cells does not lead to IL-4 expression ( data not shown ) .
Finally , GATA-3 could augment IL-4 expression as an enhancer-binding factor , but our results show that in T cells , GATA-3 alone does not fully restore IL-4 expression .
