9 The Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type 1 Posttranscriptional trans-Activator Rex Contains a Nuclear Export Signal DIANA PALMERTI ' anp MICHAEL H. MALIM®** Graduate Group in Molecular Biology , } Howard Hughes Medical Institute , `` and Departments of Microbiology and Medicine , `` University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19104-6148 Received 22 February 1996/Accepted 16 May 1996 The Rex protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 is required for the nuclear export of unspliced viral mRNA and , therefore , for virus replication .
In this manuscript , we demonstrate that Rex shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and that its activation domain constitutes a nuclear export signal that specifies efficient transport to the cytoplasm .
These findings are consistent with a model for Rex-mediated frans-activation in which Rex-viral mRNA complexes are targeted for nuclear export by the direct action of the activation domain .
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) and HTLV-2 are oncogenic retroviruses that , like all members of the distantly related lentivirus family of retroviruses , an example of which is human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) , encode proteins that posttranscriptionally regulate virus gene expression ( 25 ) .
The principal function of this family of nuclear trans-activator proteins , termed Rex for the HTLVs and Rev for the lentiviruses , is to activate the nuclear export of unspliced viral mRNA ( 5 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 18 , 20 , 22 , 36 ) .
Because these RNAs serve as templates for virion structural protein synthesis ( namely , for Gag , Pol , and Env ) and , in the case of the full-length primary transcript , as the viral genome , their presence in the cytoplasm is absolutely required for virus replication ( 6 , 12 , 14 , 17 , 31 , 33 , 37 ) .
In the absence of Rex or Rev , these intron-containing mRNAs are sequestered by the nucleus and either degraded or spliced to completion ( 7 , 11 , 19 , 20 ) .
The domain organization of the ~27-kDa ( 189-amino-acid ) Rex protein of HTLV-1 is shown in Fig .
1 .
At the amino terminus is a 19-amino-acid arginine-rich region that is required for the nuclear accumulation of Rex ( 16 , 29 , 32 ) and for its direct interaction with its cis-acting RNA target , the Rex response element ( 1 , 3 , 11 , 38 ) .
Toward the center of Rex ( residues 79 to 99 ) there is a second domain that is also essential for biological activity ( 4 , 13 , 39 ) .
Because experiments performed with Rex-Rev chimeric proteins have demonstrated that this 21-amino-acid segment is functionally interchangeable with the well-defined activation ( or effector ) domain of HIV-1 Rev ( Fig .
1 ) , it too has been termed the activation domain ( 13 , 39 ) .
As can be visualized from Fig .
1 , Rex/Rev activation domains are characterized by their possession of a number of bulky hydrophobic residues ( commonly leucine ) that are interspersed with more-hydrophilic residues .
It is widely accepted that Rex/Rev activation domains interact with host cell export factors ( proteins ) such that unspliced viral mRNAs that are bound to Rex or Rev via their RNA response elements can be transported out of the nucleus ( 2 , 9 , 25 , 30 , 35 ) ; a failure to participate in such interactions presumably results in a loss of frans-activation potential .
It has also been found that the Rev activation domains of HIV-1 , visna virus , and equine infectious anemia virus are potent nuclear * Corresponding author .

6442 export signals ( NESs ) and that this attribute correlates precisely with the functionality of this region ( 8 , 24 , 40 ) .
Accord-ingly , it has been noted that Rev , rather than being confined entirely to the nucleus , is constitutively cycling ( shuttling ) between the nucleus and the cytoplasm ( 15 , 23 , 28 ) .
Given the similarities between Rex and Rev ( 25 ) , we wished to determine ( i ) whether the HTLV-1 Rex frans-activator is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein and ( ii ) whether its activation domain can function as a NES .
A number of missense mutations were therefore introduced into the Rex activation domain of the peREX expression vector ( 11 ) .
These substitutions targeted either polar ( glutamine at position 85 and serine at position 91 ) or hydrophobic ( Jeucines at positions 86 and 90 ) residues ( Fig .
1 ) .
The trans-activation potential of each mutant protein was evaluated by a previously described assay in which COS cells are transfected with a genomic version of the HIV-1 tat gene that harbors the Rex response element within its intron ( 11 ) .
In such experi-ments , Rex function is measured by the induced nuclear export of unspliced tat mRNA and the concomitant synthesis of a foreshortened Tat protein comprising 72 amino acids ( 20 ) .
The results obtained with this set of mutant Rex proteins are summarized in Fig .
1 ; specifically , of the four activation domain mutants tested , only that with a glutamine-to-alanine mutation at position 85 ( Q85A¥ ) was able to induce the expression of the truncated Tat protein .
Thus , as has been noted for the activation domain of HIV-1 Rev ( Fig .
1 ) , the leucine residues of the HTLV-1 Rex activation domain are critical for biological activity whereas the identity of the other residues appears to be less important .
However , and in contrast to HIV-1 Rev , the « -helix-breaking amino acid proline is not well tolerated by the Rex activation domain .
To evaluate the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling capabilities of the wild-type and mutant Rex proteins , we utilized an assay whereby the sensitivity of nuclear localization to the transcriptional status of the cell is determined ( 23 , 26 ) .
Here , proteins that shuttle may accumulate in the cytoplasm following the inhibition of transcription whereas proteins that do not cycle remain sequestered in the nucleus .
Although the molecular basis for this effect remains an enigma , it is presumably due to the efficiency of nuclear import being dependent on ongoing transcription .
Duplicate sets of HeLa cell monolayers were therefore transfected with pcREX and the Q85P , Q85A¥ , S91P , and L2+3A mutant expression vectors .
At 48 h , the cultures VoL .

Mutagenesis of the HTLV-1 Rex activation domain .
The region of Rex that harbors the nuclear and nucleolar localization signal ( NLS ) and confers RNA ( Rex response element ) binding is shown as a shaded box , whereas the activation domain is depicted as a solid box .
The primary amino acid sequence of the activation domain core is shown below along with the missense mutations that were introduced ; a dash indicates that no alteration was made at that position .
The biological phenotype of each Rex protein was determined with the pgTAT/RxRE reporter and transiently transfected COS cells ( 11 ) .
The ability to activate viral mRNA export was scored as the induced synthesis of the 72-amino-acid Tat protein ( + , active ; - , inactive ) .
The wild-type sequences of the Rev activation domains of HIV-1 and the nonprimate lentivirus visna virus are also shown ; the mutationally defined three essential leucine residues of the HIV-1 Rev activation domain ( 21 ) are highlighted with shaded boxes .
were transferred to medium supplemented with 50 pg of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide per ml .
After 30 min , 5 ug of actinomycin D per ml was added to one set of cultures while the other set remained in cycloheximide-containing me-dium .
The inclusion of an inhibitor of protein synthesis in these experiments was critical , as it ensured that the Rex proteins being examined were nuclear at the time of actinomycin D addition .
After a further 2.5-h incubation , the subcellular localization of each Rex protein was determined by indirect immunofluorescence using a Rex-specific antiserum ( Fig .
2 ) ( 3 , 23 ) .
Consistent with previous reports , wild-type Rex as well as the four mutants all localized to the nuclei of transcriptionally active HeLa cells ( Fig .
2a , c , e , g , and i ) ( 16 , 29 , 32 ) .
In contrast , both wild-type Rex and the Q85A mutant relocated to the cytoplasm to a significant degree following transcriptional inhibition ( Fig .
2b and f ) .

Subcellular localization of Rex in HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes .
Proliferating HUT102 cells ( a and b ) or cultures that had been treated with cycloheximide for 30 min and then actinomycin D plus cycloheximide for 2.5 h ( c and d ) were adhered to glass coverslips by centrifugation at 400 X g for 5 min with a Cytospin apparatus .
Fixed cells were then subjected to double-label immunofluorescence with primary antibodies specific for Rex ( a and c ) or the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein C1 and C2 proteins ( b and d ) .
these two proteins , both of which activate viral mRNA export ( Fig .
1 ) , are able to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm .
In keeping with the correlation between biological activity and activation domain-determined nuclear export , the nonfunc-tional Q85P , S91P , and L2+3A mutants each remained localized to the nucleus in the presence of actinomycin D ( Fig .
2d , h , and j ) .
Interestingly , whereas these mutants displayed similar nuclear staining patterns in treated and untreated cells ( Fig .
2 ; compare panels c , g , and i with panels d , h , and j ) , the exported wild-type and Q85A proteins became more evenly distributed within the nuclei of cells treated with actinomycin D ( Fig .
2 ; compare panels a and e with panels b and f ) .
To examine whether Rex shuttles in virally infected cells , the effect of transcription inhibition on the subcellular distribution of Rex in the HTLV-1-producing human T-cell line HUT102 was determined ( Fig .
3 ) ( 27 ) .
As a control for nuclear integrity , the cells were also stained with a monoclonal antibody specific for the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle C1 and C2 proteins ( 26 ) .
Rex was visualized as before , with a Texas red-conjugated antibody ( Fig .
3a and c ) , whereas the C1 QB5A S91P L2+3A FIG .

The nuclear export of Rex is dependent on a functional activation domain .
HeLa cells were seeded onto glass coverslips at a density of 2.5 X 10° cells per 35-mm-diameter dish .
Duplicate monolayers were transfected with 5 pg of peREX or each one of the four mutant activation domain derivatives .
At ~48 h , the cultures were incubated in medium containing either 50 ug of cycloheximide per ml ( a , c , e , g , and i ) or cycloheximide plus 5 ug of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D per ml ( b , d , f , h , and j ) .
Following fixation , the subcellular localization patterns of the wild-type and mutant Rex proteins were determined with a Rex-specific antiserum raised in a rabbit and a Texas red-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody .
All samples were viewed by epifluorescence ( 23 ) .

The activation domain of Rex is a potent nuclear export signal .
HeLa cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and injected into the nucleus with mixtures of rabbit IgG and GST-Rex fusion proteins .
Following incubation for 30 min at 37°C , the cells were fixed and subjected to double-label indirect immunofluorescence .
The GST-Rex proteins were visualized in two steps by using a GST -specific monoclonal antibody followed by a Texas red-conjugated anti-mouse antibody ( a , c , ¢ , g , and i ) , whereas the IgG was detected in a single step by using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody ( b , d , f , h , and j ) .
and C2 proteins were detected with a goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate ( Fig .
3b and d ) .
As previously reported , Rex is clearly localized to the nucleus of these infected T cells at the steady state ( Fig .
3a ) ( 16 ) .
In contrast , and consistent with what was observed in HeLa cells , there was a clear redistribution of Rex to the cytoplasm of cells treated with 5 pg of actinomycin D per ml for 2.5 h ( Fig .
3¢ ) .
As an independent verification of its classification as a shuttle protein , we also found that Rex can migrate from one nucleus to another in the context of interspecies heterokaryons ( data not shown ) .
The data to this point imply that the activation domain of Rex can function as a NES .
To test this hypothesis directly , residues 78 to 96 of wild-type Rex and the Q85P , Q85A , S91P , and L2+3A mutants were appended to the carboxy terminus of glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) ( 24 ) .
These five GST -Rex fusion proteins were purified from Escherichia coli by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B , concentrated to ~8 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline , and micro-injected into the nuclei of living HeLa cells .
Importantly , the site of injection was established by supplementing the GST-Rex preparations with rabbit immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) ( 24 , 40 ) .
Following a 30-min incubation at 37°C , the ability of each Rex fusion protein to translocate to the cytoplasm was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence ( Fig .
4 ) .
The GST proteins were detected with a GST -specific monoclonal antibody followed by a Texas red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody ( Fig .
4a , c , e , g , and i ) , while the rabbit IgG was visualized with a goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate ( Fig .
4b , d , f , h , and j ) ( 24 ) .
Strikingly , whereas the IgG always remained nuclear , the GST -Rex wild-type fusion protein had relocated to the cytoplasm to apparent entirety ( Fig .
4a ) .
The only other protein that displayed this phenotype was the one that harbored a functional activation domain , namely GST-Q85A ( Fig .
4e ) .
All three GST fusions that carried inactive activation domains remained confined to the nucleus ( Fig .
4c , g , and i ) .
Thus , not only can the activation domain of Rex act as an autonomous and transferable NES , but it also does so in a manner that correlates with its frans-activation potential .
In this report , we have demonstrated that the Rex trans-activator of HTLV-1 is , like HIV-1 Rev , a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein ( Fig .
2 and 3 ) .
Using mutant Rex proteins that carry disruptions of the activation domain , we found that the capacity of Rex to accumulate in the cytoplasm in response to transcriptional inhibition is always matched with its ability to activate viral mRNA export ( Fig .
1 and 2 ) .
In addition , we have also shown that all biologically active Rex activation domains function as autonomous and transferable NESs whereas inactive variants do not ( Fig .
4 ) .
Given that these same correlations also hold true for the HIV-1 Rev protein , our data therefore lend further support to the notion that Rex and Rev activate viral mRNA transport by a shared mechanism .
Specifically , we propose that the activation domains of these proteins constitute the NESs that target nuclear Rex/Rev-viral mRNA complexes for transport to the cytoplasm .
While these studies were being carried out , it was reported by others that actinomycin D treatment induces a relocaliza-tion of Rex to the cytoplasm of transfected HeLa cells ( 34 ) .
