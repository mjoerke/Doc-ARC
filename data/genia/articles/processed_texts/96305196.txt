Mechanisms of Transactivation by Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells-1 By Chun Luo , Emmanuel Burgeon , and Anjana Rao From the Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Pathology , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 Summary Nuclear factor of activated T cells-family proteins ( NFAT1I/NFATp , NFAT ' c , NFAT3 , and NFATA4/NFATx/NFATc3 ) play a key role in the transcription of cytokine genes and other genes during the immune response .
We have defined the mechanisms of transactivation by NFAT1 .
NFAT1 possesses two transactivation domains whose sequences are not conserved in the other NFAT -family proteins , and a conserved DNA-binding domain that mediates the recruitment of cooperating nuclear transcription factors even when it is expressed in the absence of other regions of the protein .
The activity of the NH-terminal transactivation domain is modulated by an adjacent regulatory region that contains several conserved sequence motifs represented only in the NFAT family .
Our results emphasize the multiple levels at which NFAT -dependent transactivation is regulated , and predict significant differences in the archi- tecture of cooperative transcription complexes containing different NFAT -family proteins .
he nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) !
is a calcium-regulated transcription factor that is a major target for the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 ( 1-3 ) .
The DNA-binding specificity of NFAT is conferred by a novel family of transcription factors , of which four members ( NFAT1/NFATp , NFATc , NFAT3 , and NFATx/NFAT4/NFATc3 , each containing several isoforms ) have so far been described ( 4-9 ) .
NFAT 1 protein is expressed in several classes of immune system cells ( 10-12 ) , consistent with the detection of nuclear NFAT DNA-binding activity in activated T , B , mast , and NK cells ( 13-19 ) .
The distribution of the other NFAT -family proteins has not yet been assessed at the protein level ; however the mRNAs encoding these proteins differ in their cell and tissue distributions and their representation in resting versus activated cells ( 5-7 ) , suggesting that each protein may subserve a different function .
NFATc mRNA is expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle and in activated lymphoid cells , NFATx/ NFAT4 mRNA is predominantly expressed in the thymus , and NFAT3 mRNA is most strongly expressed outside the immune system ( 5-7 ) .
An important component of transactivation by NFAT family proteins is their cooperation in the nucleus with Fos and Jun ( 20 , 21 ) .
This cooperation is mediated by interac- ' Abbreviations used in this paper : CAT , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ; CsA , cyclosporin A ; DBD , DNA-binding domain ; hGH , human growth hormone ; NFAT , nuclear factor of activated T cells ; NHR , NFAT homology region ; TAD , transactivation domain .
tion of the highly conserved DNA-binding domains ( DBDs ) of NFAT -family proteins with Fos-Jun and Jun-Jun dimers ( 6 , 7 , 22 ) ; the bZIP ( basic region-leucine zipper ) regions of Fos and Jun suffice for this interaction ( 21 ) , although an acidic region of Fos has also been implicated ( 23 ) .
Overex-pression of Fos- and Jun-family proteins in T cells greatly augments transcription driven by tandem copies of the IL-2 and IL-4 promoter NFAT sites in activated T cells ( 20 , 24-26 ) .
It has also been suggested that NFAT -family proteins are able to act independently or cooperate with transcription factors of the GATA family ( 18 , 27 ) .
We asked whether NFAT -family proteins contain intrinsic transactivation domains ( TADs ) , or whether they function by recruiting other transcription factors .
Here we define the mechanisms of transactivation by NFAT1 .
We show that NFAT1 contains two intrinsic TADs at its NH , - and COOH-terminal ends that are not represented in the other NFAT -family proteins .
The activity of the NH-terminal TAD is regulated by the adjacent NFAT homology region ( NHR ) , a serine- and proline-rich region that contains several sequence motifs conserved within the NFAT family .
We also show that the conserved DBD of NFAT1 contributes potently to transactivation at composite NFAT sites , since it is capable of recruiting cooperating transcription factors even when expressed independently of the other regions of NFAT 1 .
Our results suggest that NFAT dependent transactivation involves a common mechanism mediated by the conserved DBD , as well as unique mechanisms involving the nonconserved TADs .

- Jurkat cells were transfected with 2-5 jug of expression and reporter plasmids , subdivided equally into identical cultures , incubated for 18-24 h at 37°C , and then stimulated overnight with 1 wM ionomycin , 10 nM PMA , or both in the absence or presence of 1 M CsA ( added 30 min before the stim-uli ) .
Cells were harvested 18-24 h later , and cell extracts were assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) or luciferase activity as described ( 8 ) .
When the percent conversion of CAT assay was either very high or very low , the assay was repeated with an adjusted amount of cell lysate to ensure a linear range .
Transfection efficiencies were determined by measuring human growth hormone ( hGH ) expression from a cotransfected RSV-hGH plasmid ( 0.5 pg ) , and protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay ( Bio-Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) .
GAL4 Plasmids .
- GAL4-NFAT1 ( 1-415 ) was constructed by replacing the E2F fragment of GAL4-E2F ( 28 ) between the BamHI and Xbal sites with the 1,264-bp fragment of human NFAT1 cDNA ( 8 ) , from the BssHII site to the EcoRI site in the polylinker of pBluescript .
It encodes amino acids 1-415 of NFAT 1 in frame with the GAL4 DBD ( amino acids 1-147 ) .
The GAL4-NFAT1 ( 57-415 ) , GAL4-NFAT1 ( 145-415 ) , GAL4-NFAT1 ( 259-415 ) , GAL4-NFAT1IASP1 , GAL4-NFAT1ASP2 , and GAL4-NFAT1ASS plasmids were made by excising appropriate restriction fragments from GAL4-NFAT1 ( 1-~415 ) and religating the plasmids .
The COOH -terminally deleted plasmids , GAL4-NFAT1 ( 1-293 ) , GAL4-NFAT1 ( 1-230 ) , and GAL4-NFAT1 ( 1-171 ) were made by replacing the BamHI-Xbal E2F fragment from GAL4-E2F with the appropriate restriction fragments of NFAT1 .
The chimeras encoded by GAL4-NFAT1 ( 1-415 ) , GAL4-NFAT1 ( 1-293 ) , GAL4-NFAT1 ( 1-230 ) , GAL4-NFAT1 ( 1-171 ) , GAL4-NFAT1IASP1 , GAL4-NFAT1ASP2 , and GAL4-NFATIASS have a linker with the sequence PEFPAGDRIRA between the GAL4 DBD and NFAT1 sequences .
GAL4-NFAT1 ( 57-415 ) has a linker of PEFPA , and the other NH-terminal deletions have a linker of PEFP .
Except for GAL4-NFAT1 ( 1-293 ) , GAL4-NFAT1 ( 1-230 ) , and GAL4-NFAT1 ( 1-171 ) , all other constructs have an extra sequence of PRAEF before the stop codon .
GAL4-NFAT1 ( 727-927 ) was constructed by replacing the NFAT1 ( 1-415 ) fragment between the Smal and Xbal sites in GAL4-hNFAT1 ( 1-415 ) with the Ncol-HindIII fragment from pLGP-mNFATA-C ( 8 ) .
It has a linker of PEFP between the GAL4 DBD and the murine NFAT 1 sequence .
GAL4-BB-E2F was constructed by replacing the BamHI-Xbal fragment of GAL4-NFAT1 ( 57-415 ) with the Xmal-Xbal fragment of E2F of GAL4-E2F .
It has a linker of PGI between NFAT 1 { amino acids 57-318 ) and E2F .
The GAL4-E2F , RSV-GAL4DBD , RSV-CAT , and the reporter CAT plasmid with three GAL4 DNA-binding sites ( 28 ) were gifts from Dr. Erik K. Flemington ( Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , MA ) .
NFAT1 Expression Plasmids .
- The pEFTAG , pLGP-mNFAT1-C , and pEFTAG-mNFAT1-C expression plasmids have been described ( 8 ) .
The pEFTAG-NFAT1 ( 1-415 ) plasmid was made by subcloning the Xmal-Xbal fragment of GAL4-NFAT1 ( 1-415 ) into pEFTAG between the Not1 and Xbal sites .
The pEFTAG-NFATIAN plasmid , which encodes amino acids 399-927 of murine NFAT1-C , was constructed by subcloning the Xhol-Xbal fragment of pEFTAG-mNFAT1-C into pEFTAG between the Not1 and Xbal sites .
The pEFTAG-NFAT1DBD and pEFTAG-NFAT1DBDn expression plasmids , which encode amino acids 398-694 and 398-584 of murine NFAT 1 , respectively , were constructed by subcloning the KpnI-Blpl fragment of NFATpXS ( 1-297 ) and NFATpXS ( 1-187 ) ( 22 ) into the NotI site of pEFTAG .
Reporter Plasmids .
The pBLCAT5S/NFAT3X reporter plas- mid has been described ( 8 ) .
The pBLCAT5/NFAT ( M3 } 3X and pBLCAT5/NFAT ( M4 ) 3X reporter plasmids were made by replacing the trimer of NFAT sites in pBLCAT5/NFAT3X with trimers of NFAT ( M3 ) and NFAT ( M4 ) ( 22 ) , respectively .
The NFAT3X-Luc and 5'IL2-Luc plasmids were kind gifts from Dr. David McKean ( Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN ) .
Results and Discussion We assessed the intrinsic transactivation potential of the NH , - and COOH-terminal regions of NFAT1 , that flank the centrally located DBD , by testing chimeric proteins in which amino acids 1-415 and 727-927 of NFAT1 were fused to the COOH terminus of the heterologous DBD of GAL4 .
Both regions have features resembling TADs : the NH-terminal region is acidic and proline rich , whereas the COOH-terminal region is glutamine and proline rich ( 8 ) .
When expressed in Jurkat T cells , both chimeric proteins were capable of transactivation , provided that the reporter plasmid contained GAL4 binding sites ( Fig .
1 A , compare lane 2 with lane 3 and lane 4 with lane 5 ) .
The GAL4 DBD alone was inactive ( lane 1 ) .
The difference in the activities of GAL4-NFAT1 ( 1-415 ) and GAL4-NFAT1 ( 727-927 ) may be a consequence of differences in the level of expression of the two GAL4 fusion proteins , or may reflect an intrinsic difference in their ability to transactivate in this context .
When cells expressing the GAL4-NFAT1 ( 1-415 ) chimeric protein were stimulated with the calcium ionophore , ionomycin , GAL4-dependent transactivation was reproducibly enhanced ( Fig .
1 B , lanes 1 and 2 ; 2.0 + 0.4-fold , n = 8 ) .
Stimulation with PMA alone had no effect ( lane 3 ; 0.8 + 0.1-fold , x = 3 ) , and stimulation with PMA plus ionomycin did not increase the level of CAT activity over that observed with ionomycin alone ( lane 4 ; 2.5 + 0.9-fold , n = 3 ) .
Notably , CsA completely blocked the ionomycin-induced increase in CAT activity mediated by the GAL4-NFAT1 ( 1-415 ) chimeric protein ( Fig .
1 B ; lanes 5-8 ) .
CsA did not block the basal level of transactivation mediated by this protein in unstimulated Jurkat cells , indicating that CsA does not suppress the transcriptional function of the chimera per se .
Transactivation by the GAL4-NFAT1 ( 727-927 ) chimeric protein was not affected by ionomycin , PMA , or CsA { data not shown ) , indicating that although both the NH ; - and COOH-terminal regions of NFAT1 possessed transactivating function , only the activity of the NH , -terminal region of NFAT1 was capable of being regulated in a calcium- and calcineurin-dependent fashion .
The lack of effect of PMA on the transactivation activities of these chimeras suggests that the intrinsic transactivation activity of NFAT !
1 is not regulated by PMA-stimulated signaling pathways .
The ( 1-415 ) region of NFAT1 contains a unique region ( amino acids 1-~100 ) not represented in the other NFAT family proteins , as well as an adjacent ~300-amino acid NHR ( amino acids ~100-~380 ) that shows a moderate level of sequence conservation within the NFAT family 142 Mechanisms of Transactivation by Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells A _ m far fart e - @ $ $ v- h ant om - Tm - T ar - § B 8s to o 5 } y- r- r- r- < c < R f _ é ; E ; 58 E ; 58 Stimulation - _ | -_ P_ P+ | -P P+ GG zOo zm z0 zm CsA o n eom e f eom : orer me ° h f f iX ARe 797.35 “ : ‘ I 5 6 8 Fold Induction 1.0 25 0.69 2.1 0.94 0.95 0.88 0.76 C | _D/EP | « relative fold mawman - tono CAT activity _ induction - ( ® ° 0.05 + 0.07 1 GAL4DBD “ ti “ $ 1 * + ( @ - - 0.02 + 0.03 .

- The transactivation and regulatory domains of NFAT1 .
( A4 ) NFAT1 has two independent transactivation domains .
Jurkat cells were transfected with 5 pug of RSV-GAL4DBD ( lane 1 ) , GAL4-NFAT1 ( 1-415 ) ( lanes 2 and 3 ) , or GAL4-NFAT1 ( 727-927 ) ( lanes 4 and 5 ) together with 5 jug of reporter plasmid of GAL4-CAT ( lanes 1 , 2 , and 4 ) or BG-CAT ( lanes 3 and 5 ) and assayed for CAT activity 2 d later , as described in Materials and Methods .
( B ) The transactivation activity of the GAL4-hNFAT1 ( 1-415 ) chimera protein is induced by ionomycin stimulation and is sensitive to CsA .
Jurkat cells were transfected with 5 pug of GAL4-hNFAT1 ( 1-415 ) and 5 g of GAL4-CAT plasmids and cultured in eight aliquots .
Cells were left unstimulated { lanes 1 and 5 ) , or stimulated overnight with 1 pM ionomycin ( lanes 2 and 6 ) , 10 nM PMA ( lanes 3 and 7 ) , or both ( lanes 4 and 8 ) , in the absence ( lanes 1-4 ) or presence ( lanes 5-8 ) of 1 M CsA .
Shown is a CAT assay representative of three independent experiments .
( C ) Relative transactivation activity of GAL4 fusion proteins with various NFAT1 NH ; -terminal fragments .
The GAL4 fusion proteins were expressed in Jurkat cells without ( - ) or with ( + ) ionomycin ( fono ) stimulation .
Transfection efficiencies were normalized by measuring hGH expression from a cotransfected RSV-hGH plasmid .
Relative CAT activities ( mean + SD , n = 3 ) shown are CAT activities normalized to that of unstimulated cells transfected with GAL4-hLNFAT1 ( 1-415 ) .
Fold induction is shown where there is significant difference between CAT activities of unstimulated and ionomycin stimulated cells ( P < 0.02 ) .
( 8 ) .
Detailed inspection of the NHR reveals the presence of several strongly conserved sequence motifs ( 8 ) , including three repeats of the SP motifs ( 6 ) ( consensus sequence , SPxxSPxxSPxxxxx [ D/EJ [ D/E ] ) .
To localize the regions within the GAL4-NFATIi ( 1-415 ) protein required for transactivation and regulation by ionomycin , we tested GAL4 chimeric proteins containing NH , - or COOH -terminally deleted derivatives of the NFAT1 ( 1-415 ) fragment ( Fig .
1 C ) .
These proteins were expressed in Jurkat cells with the GAL4-CAT reporter plasmid .
Deletion of as few as 57 residues from the NH , ; terminus of NFAT1 abolished transactivation ( Fig .
1 C , row 3 ) , and further deletions did not restore function ( rows 4 and 5 ) .
In contrast , chimeric proteins containing deletions of up to 185 residues from the COOH terminus of the 1-415 region ( Fig .
1 C , rows 6-10 ) retained the ability to mediate transactivation .
The low basal activities of proteins containing the NH , -terminal half of the NHR ( Fig .
1 C , rows 6-8 ) were likely due to their low level of expression , since increasing the amount of plasmid DNA in transfections led to higher basal activities ( data not shown ) ; however their transactivation activities were clearly augmented in ionomycin-stimulated cells ( row 6-8 ) .
Deletions of most of the NHR ( Fig .
1 C , rows 9 and 10 ) , or the NH ; -terminal half of the NHR ( row 11 ) , resulted in high basal activities that were not further increased by stimulation with ionomycin , even when the amount of plasmid DNA used in the transfection was titrated to yield a lower basal level of CAT activity ( data not shown ) .
These results indicated that the NH , -terminal region of NFAT1 contains a strong TAD encoded within amino acids 1-144 .
However , the activity of this TAD is fully revealed only in the absence of amino acids 145-387 , which constitute essentially all of the NHR .
In the presence of the NHR , moreover , the activity of the NH-terminal TAD of NFAT 1 was regulated in a calcium /calcineurin-dependent manner .
Indeed , we found that the NHR was capable of conferring a small degree of ionomycin responsiveness on an unrelated protein , since transactivation by a chimeric protein ( GAL4-BB-E2F ) , in which amino acids 57-318 of NFAT1 were introduced between the GAL4 DBD and the E2F TAD , was significantly stimulated by ionomycin treatment of Jurkat cells ( 1.65 + # 0.1-fold induction , n = 6 , P < 0.001 ) .
CsA pretreatment reproducibly blocked the ionomycin-mediated stimulation ( 1.02 + 0.32-fold induction , n = 6 ) , but did not affect the basal level of transactivation .
The level of transactivation by the parent GAL4-E2F chimera was unaffected by ionomycin stimulation ( 0.96 + 0.2-fold induction , n = 3 ) .
We compared the transactivation functions of full-length NFAT !
with those of NFAT1 ( 399-927 ) ( here termed NFAT1IAN ) , which lacks the NH-terminal TAD and NHR .
Expression of either protein in Jurkat T cells resulted in increased basal transactivation of a CAT reporter plasmid containing three copies of the NFAT site of the murine IL-2 promoter .
As expected , further induction of CAT activity by full-length recombinant NFAT1 required stimulation with both ionomycin and PMA , and was completely inhib- ited by pretreatment with CsA ( Fig .
2 , leff ) .
In contrast , transactivation by NFATIAN was stimulated by PMA alone and was not inhibited by pretreatment with CsA ( Fig .
2 , right ) .
We have previously shown that full-length is cytoplasmic in resting T cells and translocates into the nucleus upon ionomycin stimulation ( 8 ) , whereas NFAT1AN is diffusely distributed throughout the nucleus and the cytoplasm in both resting and stimulated cells ( 29 ) .
Thus , the results shown in Fig .
2 indicate that nuclearly localized NFAT1 and NFAT1AN require PMA for optimal transactivation , whereas ionomycin is required only for transloca-tion of full-length NFAT1 into the nucleus .
Given that PMA does not stimulate the activity of the intrinsic TADs of NFAT1 ( see above ) , we postulated that the PMA requirement for transactivation most likely reflected the requirement for cooperation of NFAT1 with PMA-stimu-lated transcription factors such as Fos and Jun ( 1 ) .
To evaluate the contribution of cooperating nuclear proteins to NFAT 1-dependent transcription , we tested whether the DBD of NFAT1 ( which is sufficient for cooperation with Fos and Jun proteins ; 22 ) could independently mediate transactivation .
Expression of NFAT1DBD ( amino acids 398-694 of murine NFAT1 ) caused transactivation of a luciferase reporter plasmid containing three tandem NFAT sites ( NFAT3X-Luc ) in unstimulated Jurkat T cells , and stimulation with PMA plus ionomycin greatly increased the level of transactivation ( Fig .
3 A , leff ) .
This effect is probably not due to an intrinsic transactivation function possessed by the DBD , since a longer fragment of NFAT 1 containing the NFAT1IDBD does not show transactivation activity in vitro ( 4 ) .
The effect is striking because isolated DNA-binding fragments of other transcription factors usually inhibit transactivation when overexpressed , most likely by competing for endogenous dimerization partners and/or blocking the relevant sites on DNA ( 30 , 31 ) .

The DBD of NFAT1 causes transcription from NFAT sites and the IL-2 promoter .
( 4 ) Jurkat cells were transfected with 10 jug of pEFTAG ( endog ) , pEFTAGNFATI-C ( FL ) , pEFTAGNFAT1IDBD ( DBD ) , or pEFTAGNFAT1IDBDn ( DBDn ) together with 1 jpg of NFAT-Luc ( NFAT , left ) or 2 pug of 5IL2-Luc ( IL-2 , right ) reporter plasmids .
Luciferase activity ( in light units ) was assayed as described in Materials and Methods .
( B ) Jurkat cells were transfected with 5 jug of the indicated expression plasmids and 1 pg of pBLCAT5/NFAT3X ( WT ) , pBLCAT5/NFAT ( M3 ) 3X ( M3 ) , or pBLCAT5/NFAT ( M4 ) 3X ( M4 ) .
Cells were left unstimulated ( Unstim ) or were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin ( P + 1 ) 1 d after transfection .
CAT activity was assayed 2 d after transfection .
The data shown are representative of at least three independent experiments .
NFAT1IDBD contains the region corresponding to both the NH , -terminal specificity subdomain and the COOH-terminal dimerization domain of p50 NF-KB ( 32 , 33 ) .
However the smallest fragment of NFAT1 capable of DNA binding and cooperative interaction with Fos and Jun is a shorter 187-amino acid fragment ( NFAT1DBDn , amino acids 398-584 of murine NFAT1 ) that corresponds to the NH-terminal specificity subdomain of p50 NF-KB ( 32 , 33 ) .
Strik-ingly , NFAT1DBDn was also able to mediate the inducible transcription of NFAT3X-Luc in Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
3 4 , leff ) .
Moreover , both NFAT1IDBD and NFAT1DBDn increased the transcription of a luciferase reporter gene controlled by the IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
3 A , right ) .
In this case , the increased transcription was apparent in stimulated but not in unstimulated Jurkat T cells , presumably because other inducible transcription factors such as NF-KB are required for IL-2 promoter induction ( 3 ) .
The binding of NFAT1DBD and NFAT1DBDn to the 145 Luo et al .
composite NFAT site of the IL-2 promoter is greatly stabilized in the presence of Fos and Jun ( 20 ) .
To test whether the transcriptional activation observed to be mediated by these fragments was due to AP-1 proteins recruited to the composite site , we used CAT reporter plasmids containing mutated NFAT sites .
The M3 mutation of the NFAT site of the IL-2 promoter abrogates the binding of NFAT proteins and their recruitment of AP-1 proteins , whereas the M4 mutation permits the binding of NFAT proteins but prevents the formation of the NFAT-Fos-Jun complex ( 22 , 34 ) .
Both the M3 and M4 mutations severely compromised transactivation by NFAT1DBD and NFAT1IDBDn ( Fig .
3 B ) .
Western analysis of the epitope-tagged NFAT1IDBD confirmed that it was expressed equivalently in each transfection ( data not shown ) .
These results indicated that transactivation by NFAT1IDBD and NFAT1DBDn required DNA binding by the NFAT1 fragments and recruitment of AP-1 proteins or other cooperating transcription factors to the adjacent AP-1 site , and was unlikely to involve other mechanisms such as squelching or titrating a repressor .
Taken together , these results indicate that transactivation by NFAT-family proteins is regulated at multiple levels .
The strongly conserved DBDs operate even in the absence of intrinsic TADs to mediate transcription via cooperating factors recruited to composite sites .
The minimal 187-amino acid DBD suffices for this effect , emphasizing the remarkable specialization of NFAT -family proteins for cooperative interactions on DNA .
The DBDs of GATA and MyoD1 are sufficient to induce cell differentiation ( 35 , 36 ) , suggesting that the use of DBDs of transcription factors as docking sites for recruiting other transactivating factors may be a general mechanism of transactivation .
NFAT1 also contains two intrinsic TADs that are not conserved within the NFAT family : indeed , the region corresponding to the COOH-terminal TAD of NFAT1 is missing in NFAT ' c and in the shorter isoforms of NFAT4 ( 5-9 ) .
Finally , the conserved NHR appears to repress the activity of the NH , -terminal TAD , since its removal greatly enhances transactivation mediated by the unique NH-terminal region .
Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the NHR of NFAT1 controls the subcellular localization of this protein , which is known to be regulated by a calcium-and calcineurin-dependent pathway ( 10 ) .
Removal of the NHR or the entire NH , -terminal region from NFAT1 abrogates its regulated subcellular localization in resting and stimulated T cells ( 29 ) , and transactivation by the truncated protein NFAT1AN is no longer sensitive to ionomycin or CsA .
Despite the presence of a strong nuclear localization signal in the GAL4 DBD , GAL4 chimeras containing the NHR also show significant responsiveness to ionomycin and CsA .
One hypothesis is that the presence of the NHR alters the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio of these GAL4 chimeric proteins in a calcineurin-dependent manner .
Alter-natively , calcineurin may regulate the ability of the NHR to mask the transactivation properties of the strong NH , -terminal TAD of NFAT1 .
In either case , the NHR is likely to be a major target for calcineurin within NFAT1 , and in fact we have shown that fragments containing the NHRs of both NFAT1 and NFAT ' c bind calcineurin directly ( 29 , 37 ) .
The conserved sequences of the NHRs of NFAT-family proteins suggest that NHR may contribute to the CsA-sensitive response to ionomycin stimulation of all NFAT-family members , and the variation in NHRs of NFAT -family proteins could account for their different behavior in resting cells .
Although there is no clearcut conservation of sequence , the NH-terminal ~100 residues of NFAT1 , NFAT 3 , and NFAT4 are each rich in acidic residues and proline ( 5-8 ) , and contain acid hydrophobic patches characteristic of acidic TADs ( 8 , 38 , 39 ) .
In contrast , the NH ; -terminal region of NFATc ( which is also capable of transactivation ; Luo , C. , unpublished data ) is proline rich but not acidic .
Thus transactivation by the different NFAT -family proteins may be mediated by distinct interactions of the different TADs with coactivators , TATA , binding protein-associated factors ( TAFs ) , and other components of the basal transcription machinery ( 40 ) .
In conjunction with the distinct site preferences of NFAT -family proteins ( 7 , 9 ) and the diverse sequences and arrangements of NFAT sites in inducible promoter/enhancer regions ( 1 ) , such interactions may determine the cell-specific expression of cytokine genes .
