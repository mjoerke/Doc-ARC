8 A Functional T-Cell Receptor Signaling Pathway Is Required for p95 `` ° `` Activity JUN WU , `` SHULAMIT KATZAV , `` anp ARTHUR WEISS* > ** Departments of Microbiology and Immunology `` and Medicine® and Howard Hughes Medical Institute , `` University of California , San Francisco , California 94143 , and Lady Davis Institute , Jewish General Hospital , Montreal , Quebec H3T 1E2 , Canada `` Received 15 March 1995/Returned for modification 28 April 1995/Accepted 12 May 1995 Stimulation of the T-cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) induces activation of multiple tyrosine kinases , resulting in phosphorylation of numerous intracellular substrates .
One substrate is p95 `` `` `` , which is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic and trophoblast cells .
It contains a number of structural motifs , including Sre homology 2 , Src homology 3 , and pleckstrin homology domains and a putative guanine nucleotide exchange domain .
The role of p95 `` * `` in TCR-mediated signaling processes is unclear .
Here , we show that overexpression of p95° `` alone in Jurkat T cells leads to activation of the nuclear factors , including NFAT , involved in interleukin-2 expression .
Furthermore , p95 `` synergizes with TCR stimulation in inducing NFAT- and inter-leukin-2-dependent transcription .
In contrast , NFAT activation by a G-protein-coupled receptor is not modulated by p95° `` `` overexpression , suggesting that the effect is specific to the TCR signaling pathways .
Although removal of the first 67 amino acids of p95 `` activates its transforming potential in NIH 3T3 cells , this region appears to be required for its function in T cells .
We further demonstrate that the p95 `` `` -induced NFAT activation is not mimicked by Ras activation , though its function is dependent upon Ras and Raf .
Furthermore , the activating function of p95 `` `` `` is blocked by FK506 , suggesting that its activity also depends on calcineurin .
To further dissect p95 `` `` `` involvement in TCR signaling , we analyzed various Jurkat mutants deficient in TCR signaling function or TCR expression and showed that an intact TCR signaling pathway is required for p95 `` `` `` to function .
However , overexpression of p95 `` `` `` does not appear to influence TCR-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation or increases in cytoplasmic free calcium .
Taken together , our data suggest that p95 `` `` `` plays an important role at an yet unidentified proximal position in the TCR signaling cascade .
Engagement of the T-cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) by a pep-tide-bound major histocompatibility complex molecule initiates a biochemical cascade involving activation of protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) , resulting in phosphorylation of multiple intracellular proteins , including the TCR { & and CD3 chains , ZAP-70 , and phospholipase C-y1 ( PLC-y1 ) ( 61 ) .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-y1 induces its enzymatic activity ( 45 ) , leading to the generation of the two second messen-gers , diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate , which are responsible for the rapid and sustained intracellular calcium increase and activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) , respectively .
These early biochemical events , through poorly understood processes , lead to a variety of T-cell functions , including transcriptional activation of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins has been shown to be an early and obligatory step in TCR signal transduction ( 33 ) .
Therefore , the identification and understanding the function of these molecules is of considerable interest .
One of these TCR-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins is p95 `` `` `` ( 6 , 42 ) , the product of a proto-oncogene expressed exclusively in hematopoietic and trophoblast cells ( 35 , 65 ) .
It was first identified as a result of its malignant activation during the course of a gene transfer assay ( 35 ) .
Truncation of the amino-terminal leucine-rich region activates its transforming potential when it is expressed in NIH 3T3 cells ( 11 , 34 , 35 ) .

4337 domain for small GTPases of the Rho/Rac family .
A homolo-gous domain is also present in CDC24 and Dbl , two known GEFs for Rho and Rac proteins ( 1 , 2 , 18 ) .
Moreover , p95 `` `` `` also contains a number of structural motifs shared by other signaling molecules , including one Sre homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain , two SH3 domains , a pleckstrin homology domain , and a cysteine-rich domain ( 39 , 44 ) .
Recent studies show that p95 `` `` `` becomes tyrosine phosphorylated following a variety of stimuli , including TCR , B-cell antigen receptor , and IL-2 receptor stimulation ( 5 , 6 , 16 , 42 ) .
When p95 `` is expressed ectopically in fibroblasts , epidermal or platelet-derived growth factor will stimulate its rapid tyrosine phosphorylation .
Activation of epidermal or platelet-derived growth factor receptors also results in association of the receptors with p95¢ `` `` via its SH2 domain ( 6 , 42 ) .
Although p95¢ `` `` so far has not been found to associate with any receptors upon ligand stimulation in hematopoietic cells , its SH2 domain has been shown to interact with a number of signaling molecules , including ZAP-70 and an uncharacter-ized tyrosine-phosphorylated protein , Vap-1 ( 5 , 36 ) .
Taken together , these findings suggest that p95¢ `` `` may play an important role in the receptor-mediated signaling processes in hematopoietic cells .
TCR activation leads to cell progression from resting G , , to G , and the production of IL-2 .
IL-2 is then available for stimulation of the IL-2 receptor in an autocrine or paracrine fash-ion , causing T cells to enter S phase , which ultimately results in cell proliferation .
Therefore , regulation of IL-2 gene transcription is a key step in T-cell activation .
Two critical requirements for IL-2 gene activation upon TCR stimulation are the activation of Ras and calcineurin , a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase ( 10 , 13 , 47 , 51 ) .
It is believed that calcineurin is activated by the increase of intracellular calcium 4338 WU ET AL .
caused by activation of PLC-y1 ( 61 ) .
Two pharmacological agents , FK506 and cyclosporin A , can block TCR-mediated IL-2 gene activation by inhibiting calcineurin function ( 15 , 17 ) .
Ras can be activated by PKC-dependent and PKC-indepen-dent pathways ( 32 ) .
Expression of an activated form of Ras leads to IL-2 gene activation in conjunction with a calcium ionophore or an activated form of calcineurin , whereas a dominant negative form of Ras inhibits TCR signaling ( 51 , 63 ) .
These studies emphasize the critical role of calcineurin and Ras in TCR-mediated signals that regulate IL-2 gene expression .
Although p95¢ `` `` shares homology with the GEFs for Rho/ Rac but not Ras family members , it has been reported to account for most of the receptor-stimulated Ras GDP-GTP exchange activity in both T and B cells ( 23 , 26 ) .
In addition , tyrosine phosphorylation of p95¢ `` `` or binding of DAG to its cysteine-rich domain was shown to be required for this exchange activity ( 23-25 ) .
However , these findings have not been confirmed by other investigators , who demonstrated that neither p95¢ `` `` nor oncogenic vay has any detectable exchange activity for Ras and that the morphology of vav-transformed NIH 3T3 cells is distinct that of from Ras-transformed cells ( 7 , 38 ) .
The DAG or phorbol ester binding activity of the cysteine-rich region in p95¢ `` `` also appears to be controversial , since in vitro assays failed to show any binding of p95 `` `` `` to DAG or phorbol ester ( 37 ) .
Therefore , the functional significance of p95 `` as a Ras exchange factor in lymphocytes remains unclear .
To explore the potential role of p95 `` in TCR-mediated signaling leading to IL-2 gene activation , we overexpressed p95 `` and oncogenic vay in Jurkat T cells and examined their effects on IL-2 promoter elements .
Here , we find that overexpression of p95 `` `` `` alone can activate the IL-2 promoter through mechanisms which depend on both Ras and calcineurin function .
By using various Jurkat mutants deficient in TCR signaling , we demonstrate that this p95 `` `` `` activity requires a functional TCR signaling pathway .

were transiently transfected by electroporation , as previously described ( 10 ) , with 20 ug of the reporter plasmids indicated and 50 ug of a vector containing either no insert ( empty vector ) or a p95 `` , N-terminally truncated vay , or v-H-ras cDNA insert .
Forty hours after transfection , 10° cells were aliquoted into a 96-well plate ( Corning ) and cultured in a final volume of 100 pl of RPMI 1640 growth medium .
Cells were unstimulated or stimulated at 37°C in growth medium containing either 1.0 M ionomycin , a 1:1,000 dilution of C305 ascites , 500 pM carbachol , or 50 ng of phorbol myristate acetate per ml and 1.0 M iono-mycin .
After an 8-h stimulation period , cells were lysed in harvest buffer ( 100 mM KPO , [ pH 7.8 ] , 1.0 mM dithiothreitol , 1 % Triton X-100 ) , and 100 pl of lysate was mixed with 100 pl of assay buffer ( 200 mM KPO , [ pH 7.8 ] , 10 mM ATP , 20 mM MgCl ) followed by 100 pl of 1.0 mM luciferin .

Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis was performed as previously described ( 4 ) .
RESULTS Overexpression of p95° `` `` in Jurkat T cells increases the basal activity of IL-2 promoter elements and further potentiates TCR-mediated signal transduction .
TCR activation contributes to the production of IL-2 .
cis-acting elements in the IL-2 promoter bind nuclear factors , including NFAT and NFIL-ZA ( 14 ) .
Reporter constructs containing multimers of cither element are responsive to TCR-mediated signaling and require activation of both calcineurin and Ras pathways ( 14 , 15 , 63 ) .
To determine the role of p95 `` in T-cell signaling , we transiently overexpressed p95 `` `` `` in SV40 TAg-transfected Jurkat T cells and examined its effect on the NFAT-Luc or NFILZA-Luc reporter construct .
The expression vector used contains an SV40 origin of replication to allow its high-level gene expression in TAg Jurkat cells ( 10 ) .
By cotransfecting truncated CD8 as a surface marker for transfected cells and then enriching the CD8-positive transfectants , we estimated that the level of p95¢ `` `` overexpression is about 5 to 10 times that of the endogenous p95 `` `` `` by Western blotting ( immuno-blotting ) and autoradiography ( Fig .
1A ) .
Overexpression of p95 `` alone resulted in 30- and 15-fold increases in basal activity of the NFAT and NFIL-2A reporter constructs , respectively ( Fig .
1B ) .
In contrast , reporter constructs driven by a constitutively active Rous sarcoma virus promoter or CD4 enhancer promoter produced only a twofold increase of activity in the p95 `` `` `` -overexpressing cells ( data not shown ) .
Overexpression of a truncated form of p95¢ `` `` , lacking the first 67 amino acids in the N terminus , did not lead to increases Vou .

Overexpression of p95 `` in TAg Jurkat cells augments basal and TCR-stimulated IL-2 transcriptional activity .
( A ) TAg Jurkat cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding pCD # /T together with either an empty vector ( lane 1 ) , wild-type ( lane 2 ) , or N-terminally truncated vay ( lane 3 ) .
CD8-positive cells were purified , normalized , and blotted for vay expression .
Sizes are indicated in kilodaltons .
( B ) TAg Jurkat cells were cotransfected with either NFAT-Luc or NFIL2A-Luc together with either an empty vector , wild-type p95 `` , or N-terminally truncated ( N-trunc . )
vay .
Transfected cells were then assayed for luciferase activity .
( C and D ) TAg Jurkat cells were transfected with either NFAT-Luc ( C ) or IL2-Luc ( D ) , along with either an empty vector or wild-type p95 `` .
Cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with an anti-TCR MAb ( C305 ) and then assayed for luciferase activity .
The results are shown as the fold induction of luciferase activity compared with the activity in unstimulated cells cotransfected with pSV 7d empty vector and the reporter construct .
Luciferase activities of the unstimulated cells transfected with the empty vector were approximately 500 AU for NFAT-Luc and 200 AU for either NFIL2A-Luc or IL2-Luc .
Maximal stimulated activities ( by treatment with 50 ng of phorbol myristate acetate per ml and 1.0 wM ionomycin ) were typically about 10° AU for NFAT-Luc and 5 X 10* AU for either NFIL2A-Lue or IL2-Lue .
The results are expressed as the mean of values determined from at least three independent experiments .
Error bars represent standard errors of the means .
in the basal activity of either NFAT or NFIL-2A ( Fig .
1B ) .
The overexpression level of the truncated vay is similar to that of wild type p95¢ `` `` in TAg Jurkat cells ( Fig .
1A ) .
This result was surprising , since the truncated p95 `` `` `` is transforming in fibroblasts , but indicates that the effect observed with the full-length p95¢ `` `` does not simply reflect the overexpression of domains ( such as SH2 and SH3 domains ) shared by other signaling molecules .
Moreover , it implies that the N-terminal region may be required for p95¢ `` `` function in T cells .
Not only did overexpression of p95¢ `` `` lead to NFAT activation without TCR stimulation , it also markedly augmented TCR-stimulated NFAT activity compared with the level in the control vector-transfected cells ( Fig .
1C ) .
A similar 10-fold augmentation was observed on TCR-mediated induction of a reporter construct containing the entire upstream 275 bp of the IL-2 regulatory region ( Fig .
1D ) .
Note that TCR stimulation alone failed to activate the IL-2 promoter in this experiment because costimulation with phorbol ester or CD28 stimulation is required for activation of this promoter construct .
Overexpression of the N-terminal truncated vay failed to enhance TCR-mediated signal transduction ( data not shown ) .
The p95¢ `` -induced NFAT activation is not due to the expression of TAg in Jurkat cells , since we also obtained similar results when we overexpressed p95 `` `` `` in unmodified ( lacking TAg expres-sion ) Jurkat cells by using a different mammalian expression vector , pEF-BOS ( see Fig .
3 and 4 ) .
These data demonstrate that overexpression of p95¢ `` `` has a profound effect on TCR-mediated activation of factors involved in IL-2 gene regulation and allowed us to study further the signaling role of p95 `` `` `` in T cells .

NFAT activation is not mimicked by Ras activation but is dependent on Ras and calcineurin function .
( A ) TAg Jurkat cells were transfected with NFAT-Luc along with either an empty vector alone , p95 `` , or v-H-ras .
Cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with ionomycin or an anti-TCR MAb ( C305 ) and then assayed for luciferase activity .
The results are expressed as the means of values determined from at least three independent experiments .
Error bars represent standard errors of the means .
( B ) Cotransfection of N17ras or DN-Raf impairs the basal and TCR-mediated NFAT activation induced by p95 `` overexpression in TAg Jurkat cells .
A control vector , N17ras , or DN-Raf was cotransfected into TAg Jurkat cells with either a control vector or myc-p95 `` along with NFAT-Luc .
Transfected cells were stimulated and assayed for luciferase activity .
( C ) An aliquot of cells from each transfection in panel B was lysed and blotted for mye epitope .
Lanes 1 through 3 represent myc-p95 `` `` `` plus vector , myc-p95 `` `` `` plus N17ras , and myc-p95 `` `` `` plus DN-Raf , respectively .
( D ) TAg Jurkat cells were transfected with NFAT-Luc along with either a control vector or myc-p95 `` `` , stimulated in the presence or absence of FK506 , and assayed for luciferase activity .
( E ) An aliquot of transfected cells in panel D was lysed and blotted for the myc epitope .
Lane 1 through 3 represent control vector , and myc-p95 `` `` `` in the presence of FK506 , respectively .
All luciferase assay results are shown as the fold induction of luciferase activity compared with the activity in unstimulated cells cotransfected with pSV7d vector and NFAT-Luc .
The data are representative of at least two independent experiments .
Rather than simply activating Ras alone , p95 `` `` `` appears to function upstream of or parallel to Ras and calcineurin .
It has been shown that the minimum requirement for NFAT induction is activation of both Ras and calcineurin ( 63 ) .
Expression of a constitutively activated Ras protein , v-H-ras , generates a signal which can synergize with a calcium signal to induce NFAT ( 51 , 63 ) .
Since a region of p95 `` shares homology with GEF domains for the Rho/Rac family of small GTPases and has been reported to be a Ras GEF in lymphocytes , one possibility is that p95 `` overexpression in T cells directly activates Ras .
It might then be expected to further synergize with a basal calcineurin activity leading to NFAT activation .
Unlike p95 `` `` ** , transfection of v-H-ras into TAg Jurkat cells did not lead to a significant basal stimulation of NFAT activity ( Fig .
2A ) .
More over , ionomycin , a calcium ionophore which activates calcineurin , strongly synergized with v-H-ras but not with p95¢ `` `` in NFAT induction ( Fig .
2A ) .
These results are consistent with the recent report showing that p95¢ `` `` does not directly activate Ras ( 7 ) .
However , Ras could still play a role in the effects of p95Y `` `` overexpression .
Since expression of either a dominant negative Ras ( N17ras ) or a dominant negative Raf ( DN-Raf ) prevents TCR-mediated activation of NFAT and the IL-2 gene ( 48 , 51 ) , we coexpressed N1l7ras or DN-Raf along with p95 `` `` `` in TAg Jurkat cells to examine whether p95¢ `` `` may depend on the Ras pathway to exert its activity on NFAT .
To monitor the level of p95¢ `` `` overexpression , we generated a myc epitope-tagged version of p95 `` `` `` .
Coexpression of either N1l7ras or DN-Raf abol- Vou .
15 , 1995 ished the elevated basal and TCR-mediated NFAT activity induced by p95 `` `` `` overexpression ( Fig .
2B ) but did not suppress the level of transfected p95 `` `` `` ( Fig .
2C ) .
These data suggest that p95¢ `` `` does not simply function to directly activate Ras ; rather , it appears to influence signaling events that depend upon Ras function .
To determine whether the p95 `` `` `` -induced activation of NFAT also requires calcineurin function , we used two immu-nosuppressive agents , FK506 and cyclosporin A , which are known to inhibit calcineurin function and thus impair TCR-mediated NFAT activation ( 15 , 17 ) .
Treatment of Jurkat cells with either FK506 or cyclosporin A completely blocked both the elevation of basal levels and TCR-mediated NFAT activation in p95 `` `` `` -overexpressing cells ( Fig .
2D and data not shown ) .
The drug treatment was not toxic to the cells and did not inhibit p95¢ `` `` overexpression , as shown in Fig .
2E .
These results indicate that the NFAT activation in p95 `` `` `` -overexpressing cells depends on both Ras and calcineurin pathways and suggest that p95 `` may function upstream of or parallel to them in TCR signaling pathways .
The p95 `` `` `` activity appears to be specific to TCR-mediated signaling .
TCR engagement induces PLC activity , which leads to the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and DAG .
These second messengers are responsible for the rapid and sustained intracellular calcium increase and activation of PKC upon TCR stimulation , respectively ( 61 ) .
The calcium increase is believed to be responsible for activation of calcineurin , whereas PKC activation can lead to Ras activation ( 61 ) .
In J.HM1.2.2 , a Jurkat T-cell line expressing the seven-transmem-brane domain heterologous human muscarinic receptor ( HMIR ) , PLC- is believed to be activated by the HMIR via a heterotrimeric G-protein-mediated mechanism ( 12 ) .
Stimulation of the HMIR in Jurkat cells induces increases in intracellular Ca** concentration and Ras activation ( reference 20 and data not shown ) .
We examined the effect of p95 `` `` `` overexpression in J.HM1.2.2 cells , in which stimulation through either TCR or HMIR can cause IL-2 gene activation .
Consistent with previous studies , carbachol stimulation of the HMIR led to a potent induction of NFAT ( Fig .
3 ) ( 12 ) .
Strikingly , overexpression of p95 `` failed to augment the HMIR stimulation , in contrast to its effect on TCR-mediated induction ( Fig .
3 ) .
In addition , overexpression of p95¢ `` `` in Jurkat cells had only minimal effects on the NFAT induction following treatment with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore ( data not shown ) .
These data argue that the p95 `` effect is specific to the TCR-mediated signaling pathways and further implicate p95¢ `` `` function in the proximal signaling events upstream of or parallel to Ras and calcineurin in T cells .
An intact TCR signaling pathway is required for p95 `` to function .
The earliest events occurring after TCR stimulation involve the activation of multiple cytoplasmic PTKs , manifested by the tyrosine phosphorylation of a variety of cellular proteins , including p95¢ `` `` ( 61 ) .
The role of PTK activation is underscored by the effects of PTK inhibitors such as herbimycin A , which markedly impairs TCR signaling ( 22 , 33 ) .
If p95 `` `` `` participates in the TCR-mediated signaling pathway , proximal TCR signaling events may influence the effect of p95 `` `` `` on NFAT activation .
In fact , incubation of p95¢ `` `` -transfected cells with herbimycin A blocked the basal activation of NFAT ( Fig .
4A ) , suggesting that PTKs are required for p95 `` `` `` function .
One of the cytoplasmic PTKs required for proximal TCR signaling is Leck .
A mutant Jurkat cell line , JCaM1.6 , lacking functional Lek fails to mobilize intracellular calcium , to induce tyrosine phosphorylation , or to express activation antigens following TCR stimulation ( 59 ) .

Overexpression of p95 `` in J.HM1.2.2 cells specifically augments the TCR-mediated NFAT activation .
J.HM1.2.2 cells were cotransfected with NFAT-Luc and either the control vector ( pEF-BOS ) or p95® `` `` .
Transfected cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with an anti-TCR MAb ( C305 ) or carbachol and assayed for induced luciferase activity as described in Materials and Methods .
Luciferase activity was determined in either duplicate or triplicate for cach experimental condition .
The results are shown as the fold induction of luciferase activity compared with the activity in unstimulated cells cotransfected with the empty pEF-BOS and NFAT-Luc reporter construct .
Luciferase activities of the unstimulated cells transfected with the empty pEF-BOS vector were typically 500 to 1,000 AU .
Maximal stimulated activities ( by treatment with 50 ng of phorbol myristate acetate per ml and 1.0 wM ionomycin ) were typically about 1 x 10° to 3 X 10° AU .
The data are representative of two independent experiments .
overexpressed in JCaM1.6 , no basal induction of NFAT was observed ( Fig .

Reconstitution of this mutant cell with wild-type murine Leck restored all TCR-mediated function as well as the p95 `` effect on NFAT ( Fig .
4B and C ) ( 59 ) .
In contrast , v-H-ras was still able to activate NFAT in synergy with ionomycin in JCaM1.6 ( Fig .
4D ) , suggesting that p95 `` `` `` , unlike activated Ras , requires proximal signals which depend on Lck to exert its activity .
Another Jurkat mutant cell line , 145.01 , which lacks CD45 membrane protein tyrosine phos-phatase , is defective in TCR-mediated signaling at a very proximal step ( 41 ) .
The block in J45.01 is thought to result from negative regulation of Lek ( 58 ) .
As with JCaM1.6 cells , no NFAT induction was detected when p95 `` `` `` was overexpressed in J45.01 cells ( Fig .
4B and C ) .
These data strongly suggest that a PTK ( Leck ) and a phosphatase ( CD45 ) , which are required for proximal events in TCR signaling , are crucial for p95¢ `` `` function .
Recent studies showed that the signaling function of the TCR complex reside within a common motif ( ITAM ) in CD3 and TCR { chains ( 30 , 55 ) .
Following TCR cross-linking , ITAMs in CD3 and TCR £ chains become tyrosine phosphor-ylated , possibly by Lck , and serve as the binding sites for another cytoplasmic PTK , ZAP-70 ( 9 , 61 ) .
Thus , the TCR ITAMs function as membrane anchors to facilitate the interaction of Leck and ZAP-70 ( 31 ) .
These initial biochemical events then lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream intracellular substrates .
The potential involvement of p95¢ `` `` in the initial events in TCR-mediated signaling pathways was further demonstrated by using a mutant Jurkat cell line , J.RT3-T3.5 , which fails to express a TCR because of TCR B-chain deficiency ( 46 ) .
Overexpression of p95¢ `` `` in J.RT3-T3.5 cells had no effect on basal NFAT activity ( Fig .
5A ) .

The effect of p95 `` `` `` overexpression on NFAT activation requires the proximal tyrosine kinase activity in Jurkat T cells .
( A ) NFAT induction by overexpressing p95 `` is sensitive to herbimycin A treatment .
TAg Jurkat cells were cotransfected with NFAT-Luc and either an empty vector ( pSV7d ) or p95®* `` .
Transfected cells were either untreated or treated with herbimycin A and assayed for luciferase activity .
Western blot analysis showed that herbimycin A treatment does not inhibit p95 `` `` `` overexpression in Jurkat cells ( data not shown ) .
( B ) Overexpression of p95 `` in Jurkat mutants deficient in TCR signaling does not lead to basal NFAT activation .

( D ) v-H-ras , but not p95 `` `` `` , functions in a Lek-deficient Jurkat mutant .
JCaM1.6 cells were transfected with NFAT-Luc along with either an empty vector , p95 `` `` `` , or v-H-ras .
Transfected cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with ionomycin or an anti-TCR MAb ( C305 ) and subsequently assayed for luciferase activity .
The results are shown as the fold induction over that in untreated ( A ) or unstimulated ( B and D ) vector-transfected cells .
The data are representative of two independent experiments .
HM1R-expressing TCR-negative Jurkat cell line , J.HM1.2.1 , also failed to induce NFAT when p95¢ `` `` was overexpressed ( Fig .
5A ) .
The p95¢* `` -induced NFAT activation was restored in two of the TCR- reconstituted Jurkat cells lines , PF-2.8 and PF-2.4 ( Fig .
5A ) ( 46 ) .
Note that the intermediate effect on NFAT activity in PF2.8 cells may reflect the fact that this cell expresses only 15 % of the level of TCR expressed by Jurkat cells ( 22 ) .
Figure 5B shows that p95¢ `` `` was comparably overexpressed in these cells .
In addition , J.HM1.2.1 and Jurkat cells overexpressed similar levels of p95¢ `` `` ( data not shown ) .
Thus , a functional TCR is required for p95 `` `` `` to function .
The proximal TCR signaling events do not appear to be altered in the p95 `` -overexpressing cells .
The data above suggest that p95¢ `` `` may participate in the proximal events in TCR-mediated signal transduction .
One hypothesis is that p95 `` `` `` normally acts as a positive regulator or interacts with negative regulators for a proximal PTK , Lck or ZAP-70 , involved in TCR signaling .
Therefore one might expect that overexpression of p95¢ `` `` may activate these PTKs , resulting in hyperphos-phorylation of the downstream substrates , and lead to NFAT activation .
To study whether p95 `` `` `` overexpression increases the levels of cellular tyrosine phosphorylation , we cotransfected truncated CD8 , using it as a surface marker to purify the p95 `` -transfected cells by using magnetic beads , and analyzed the unstimulated and TCR-stimulated cell lysates .
We have found that when two plasmid constructs are used in such co-transfections , the plasmids are taken up and expressed by the same population of cells .
Similar approaches have also been used by others ( 4 ) .
As shown in Fig .
6 , we found no significant alteration of tyrosine phosphorylation in unstimulated or stim- Vou .

As shown in Fig .

These data suggest that overexpression of p95¢ `` `` in Jurkat T cells does not activate the proximal PTKs involved in TCR signaling .
DISCUSSION Signaling through the TCR results in a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous intracellular proteins , including the proto-oncogene product p95 `` `` `` , and ultimately leads to transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene ( 61 ) .
The detailed molecular mechanism by which the biochemical events initiated by the TCR on the plasma membrane are transmitted to the nucleus is still poorly understood .
However , the induced tyrosine phosphoproteins are likely to play an important role .
In this report , we show that overexpression of p95¢ `` `` , one of these substrates , in Jurkat T cells leads to a marked induction of the basal and TCR-mediated IL-2 promoter activity .
Furthermore , this p95 `` `` `` activity requires the functions of both Ras and calcineurin , as well as a functional TCR complex .
Our data strongly implicate the involvement of p95¢ `` `` in the TCR-mediated signaling pathway .
This finding is consistent with the impaired function of antigen receptors on T and B lymphocytes which fail to express p95 `` `` `` ( 16a , 60 , 64 ) .
It is striking that an intact N-terminal region is required for p95¢ `` `` to exert its activity on NFAT .
Although overexpression of the full-length vay may nonspecifically titrate out a negative inhibitor of TCR signaling pathways , this is unlikely since overexpression of the N-terminal region alone or a truncated form of p95 `` lacking its C-terminal Sre homology domains fails to mimic the effects of the full-length p95 `` in Jurkat cells ( data not shown ) .
The leucine-rich amino-terminal of p95 `` `` `` was initially reported to contain a helix-loop-helix domain followed by a leucine zipper , similar to the carboxy-terminal region of myc proteins and the steroid binding domains of nuclear receptors ( 11 , 34 , 35 ) .
However , when more objective and quantitative criteria were applied in the sequence comparison , none of these similarities was shown to be significant ( 1 , 3 ) .
None-theless , removal of this region can activate p95¢ `` `` transforming potential in NIH 3T3 cells , suggesting a regulatory function of the N-terminal region ( 11 , 34 ) .
It is interesting that this region has some similarity with molecules which interact with actin or other cytoskeletal proteins ( 1 ) .
One possibility is that the N-terminal region allows p95 `` `` `` to bind to certain cytoskeletal components , and deletion of this region may release p95¢ `` `` to interact with other signaling processes and cause transforma-tion .
However , in T cells , this region appears to be critical for p95 `` function , perhaps by anchoring it to an appropriate compartment to exert its physiological function .
The identification of molecules that interact with this region will be informative to understand its function .
p95 `` shares homology with proven or putative Rho/Rac GEF domains found in yeast CDC24 , rodent CDC25Y , and human Dbl ( 2 ) .
Unfortunately , little is known about the functions of these GEFs , largely because of the difficulties in demonstrating their catalytic activities against Rho or Rac .
In fact , only two members of this group , CDC24 and Dbl , have recently been demonstrated to activate Rho or Rac GTPase activity in vitro ( 2 ) .
On the other hand , p95¢ `` `` has been reported to be responsible for antigen receptor-stimulated Ras activation in lymphocytes ( 23 , 26 ) .

Intracellular calcium level in p95 `` `` `` -overexpressing Jurkat cells .
TAg Jurkat cells were transfected with truncated CD8 and p95 `` `` `` .
After 24 h , cells were stained with FITC-CD8 Ab and loaded with Indo-1 as described in the text .
( A ) The top 25 % of the transfected cells ( the CDS-positive cells ) contain the p95 `` `` -overexpressing cells ( Fig .
1A and data not shown ) .
The horizontal axis shows the Indo-1 fluorescence ratio representing the intracellular calcium level .
( B ) Transfected cells were gated as in panel A and were either unstimulated or stimulated with an anti-TCR MAb ( C305 ) for 60 , 120 , 180 , 240 s. The left and right panels shows the calcium levels in gated CD8-positive and CD8-negative populations , respectively .
effect of p95¢ `` `` overexpression is distinct from that of simply activating Ras pathway alone .
Moreover , overexpression of another known Ras GEF , SCD25 , failed to induce NFAT activation in Jurkat cells ( data not shown ) .
These data are consistent with the reports arguing against p95 `` as a GEF for Ras ( 7 , 38 ) .
The exchange activity of p95 `` `` `` is further complicated by the presence in T cells of SOS , a highly conserved Ras GEF in other signaling processes ( 56 ) .
It has been shown that upon TCR ligation , a 36-kDa protein ( pp36 ) and She become tyrosine phosphorylated and associate with Grb2 , an adapter protein for SOS ( 56 , 57 ) .
In T cells , the pp36-Grb2-SOS or a Shc-Grb2-SOS complex , rather than p95 `` `` `` , may serve as the link between the receptor and the downstream Ras pathway ( 50 , 57 ) .
How does overexpression of p95 `` lead to basal activation of NFAT and further synergy with TCR stimulation ?
It is believed that the basal state of the TCR signaling represents a dynamic equilibrium between activating and inhibitory signals and that stimulation through the TCR leads to an alteration of this balance .
One explanation is that p95 `` normally interacts with a negative regulatory protein involved in the proximal TCR signaling pathway .
Overexpression of p95¢ `` `` would titrate out this inhibitory molecule and shift the equilibrium to favor activating signals .
It has been shown that in T and B cells , p95 `` is able to interact with a number of proteins , including some of the proximal PTKs ( 8 , 27 , 29 , 36 ) .
However , p95 `` `` `` does not appear to activate the proximal PTKs , since we found no induction of basal or TCR-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation when analyzing the lysates from p95 `` `` `` -overexpressing cells .
In addition , our data on the intracellular calcium levels in those cells also indicate that some of the known proximal events may not be altered by p95¢ `` `` overexpression .
However , it is possible that the phosphotyrosine assay is not sensitive enough , especially if p95¢ `` `` modulates only a subset of phos-phoproteins .
Also , since we only examined the cells 1 day after transfection , a shift of equilibrium by p95 `` `` `` overexpression may already be compensated for .
More detailed kinetic and biochemical analyses will be important in assessing p95¢ `` `` function .
An alternative explanation is that p95¢ `` `` may be a key limiting mediator in the TCR-mediated signaling cascade .
Overexpression of p95¢ `` `` may amplify the basal TCR signaling and allow it to proceed .
For instance , the requirement for Lek or TCR expression could reflect tyrosine phosphorylation of p95 `` in order to exhibit its functional activity .
In fact , in p95¢ `` `` -overexpressing Jurkat cells , p95¢ `` `` was weakly tyrosine phosphorylated in the basal state , and its tyrosine phosphorylation was further induced upon stimulation ( data not shown ) .
It is interesting that not only do p95¢ `` `` and Dbl contain similar GEF regions for Rho , but their oncogenic forms also share the same transforming phenotypes in NIH 3T3 cells ( 1 , 7 , 38 ) .
Since Dbl has been recently shown to activate Rho and Rac but not Ras ( 28 ) , p95¢ `` `` may act as a Rho/Rac GEF in hematopoictic cells .
One of the earliest responses of cells to many extracellular factors is a rapid reorganization of their actin cytoskeleton .
It has been shown that the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions is dependent on Rho proteins ( 53 ) , whereas membrane ruffling requires Rac proteins ( 54 ) .
Rho and Rac have been implicated in regulating degranulation in mast cells ( 49 ) .
In cytotoxic T cells , TCR stimulation triggers a massive and rapid cytoskeleton rearrangement .
Moreover , expression of RacZ2 , a hematopoietic cell-specific Rac family member , is up-regulated upon T-cell activation ( 52 ) .
Therefore , p95 `` `` -mediated activation of Rho and/or Rac may be an important TCR-mediated signaling event , in combination with the Ras and calcineurin signals , leading to downstream effector functions .
In fact , recent evidence suggest that vay and Ras may mediate distinct but interactive signaling pathways in fibroblasts ( 7 , 35 ) .
Overexpression of p95¢ `` `` in T cells may lead to activation of these small GTPases and further potentiate the basal TCR signals resulting in IL-2 gene activation .
Future mutagenesis study of p95¢ `` `` and identification of its interacting proteins may help us to resolve these alternatives .
