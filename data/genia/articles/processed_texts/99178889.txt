Activation of leukocytes by proinflammatory stimuli selectively initiates intracellular signal transduction via sequential phosphorylation of kinases .
Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation of human neutrophils is known to result in activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPk ) ; however , the upstream activator ( s ) of p38 MAPk is unknown , and consequences of p38 MAPk activation remain largely undefined .
We investigated the MAPK kinase ( MKK ) that activates p38 MAP k in response to LPS , the p38 MAPk isoforms that are activated as part of this pathway , and the functional responses affected by p38 MAPk activation .
Although MKK3 , MKK4 , and MKK6 all activated p38 MAPk in experimental models , only MKK3 was found to activate recombinant p38 MAPk in LPS-treated neutrophils .
Of p38 MAPk isoforms studied , only p38 ( and p388 were detected in neutrophils .
LPS stimulation selectively activated p38 ( .
Specific inhibitors of MAPk blocked LPS-induced adhesion , nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-KB ) activation , and synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-0 ( TNF-Q ) .
Inhibition of MAPk resulted in a transient decrease in TNF-Q mRNA accumulation but persistent loss of TNF- & synthesis .
These findings support a pathway by which LPS stimulation of neutrophils results in activation of MKK3 , which in turn activates p38G MAPk , ultimately regulating adhesion , NF-KB activation , enhanced gene expression of TNF-Q , and regulation of TNF-Q synthesis .

Introduction Stimulation of human neutrophils by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) elicits functional responses that are central to the pathogenesis of a number of human diseases .
However , the intracellular signaling pathways used by neutrophils in response to proinflammatory stimuli have only begun to be elucidated .
The recent delineation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) ; superfamily provides a framework within which the response of neutrophils to LPS can be understood .
MAPks are highly conserved signaling kinases that act to regulate cell growth , differentiation , and stress responses ( 1 ) .
At least three distinct families of MAPks exist in mammalian cells : the p42/44 extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) MAPks , c-Jun kinases ( JNKs ) , and p38 MAPk ( 2-4 ) .
Our group and others ( 5 , 6 ) have reported that p38 MAPk is activated in the neutrophil after LPS binding to CD14 .
In contrast , neither p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPks nor JNKs are activated by LPS stimulation of neutrophils under these conditions ( 5-7 ) Activation of a MAPk is the final step in a three-part intracellular signal transduction cascade in which a MAP/ERK kinase kinase ( MEKK ) or Raf activates ( through phosphorylation ) a MAP/ERK kinase ( MEK or MKK ) , which in turn phosphorylates a specific tyrosine and threonine residue on a MAPk ( 1 ) .
At least three members of the MKK superfamily are capable of activating p38 MAPk .
When overexpressed in cell lines , MKK3 ( also termed MEK3 ) , MKK4 ( JNKK1 ) , and MKK6 ( MEK6 ) can all phosphorylate and activate p38 MAPk ( 8 , 9 ) .
Four distinct isoforms of p38 MAPk have been identified in mammalian cells .
The originally described human homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HOG1 kinase and the mouse p38 MAPk ( 2 ) is now referred to as p38Q .
Subsequently described isoforms include p38 $ B with 74 % amino acid identity to p38 , p38Y ( 60 % identity to p38 ( ) , and p386 ( 57 % identity to p38 ) ( 10 , 11 ) .
All of these isoforms share a common TGY motif in kinase subdomain VIII , where phosphorylation of a specific threonine and tyrosine residues is required for activation .
Once activated , the p38 MAP ks appear capable of further signal transduction through phosphorylation of kinases , as well as by modulating functional responses through phosphorylation of transcription factors .
The Journal of Clinical Investigation | March 1999 | Volume 103 |_ Number 6 851 852 MAPk-associated protein kinase-2 ( MAPKAP-K2 ) and MAPKAP-K3 are activated directly by MAPk , and they in turn can phosphorylate heat shock protein 27 ( HSP27 ) ( 3 , 6 , 12 ) .
Transcription factors directly phosphorylated by p38G MAP k include activated transcription factor-2 ( ATF-2 ) , serum response factor accessory protein-1 , and myocyte enhancer factor 2C ( 13 , 14 ) .
Most of our understanding of signal transduction in eukaryotic cells has risen from elegant transfection studies in cell lines .
However , significant differences exist between the activation of signaling pathways in the neutrophil when compared with monocytes or cell lines ( 13 , 15 ) .
As short-lived , terminally differentiated primary cells , neutrophils use rapid responses independent of transcriptional or translational mechanisms , as well as a limited repertoire of synthetic func-tions .
Rapid responses to LPS include actin assembly and adherence .
As a single stimulus , LPS is ineffective in evoking chemokinesis , chemotaxis , or the release of superoxide anion or granular enzymes .
Functional responses to LPS that depend on de novo protein synthesis primarily consist of the release of cytokines ( 16 ) .
We hypothesize that neutrophils use the p38 MAPk cascade to link proinflammatory stimuli to an array of functional responses .
Additional specificity could occur through selective activation of MKK-family members and p38 MAPk isoforms .
We studied the immediate upstream signaling events leading to activation of p38 MAPk , the relative activation of four p38 MAPk isoforms , and the functional consequences of p38 MAPk activation after stimulation with LPS .
We report here that stimulation of neutrophils with LPS via CD14 initiates a signal that results in the activation of MKK3 , which in turn phosphorylates and activates p38 MAPk .
Stimulation with LPS failed to activate p388 MAPk , and p38B and p38Yy were not detected .
After activation , p38G MAPk regulates at least three distinctly different functions : adhesion , activation of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-KB ) , and the synthesis of TNF- .
Together , these results advance our understanding of an intracellular signaling pathway used by the human neutrophil in response to LPS .

Neutrophils were stimulated with LPS ( 100 ng/ml ! )
for 20 min at 37°C .
( a ) Phosphorylation of MKK3 .
MKK3 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of LPS-stimulated ( L ) or unstimulated ( U ) neutrophils .
Lysates were submitted to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an anti-phosphorylated MKK3 antibody .
A cell-free mixture that did not contain immunoprecipitated MKK3 is shown to control for intrinsic activity of the rthp38 MAPK .
Blot is representative of three experiments .
( b ) Activation of MKK3 .
52P phosphorylation of rhp38 MAPk from blots was quantified by phosphor screen autoradiography .
Lysates in the absence of rhp38 MAPk ( lanes 1 and 2 ) were compared with lysates in the presence of rhp38 MAPk ( lanes 3 and 4 ) and a cell-free control to demonstrate specific activation of MKK3 in response to LPS as determined by 2P phosphorylation of rthp38 MAPk .
( ¢ ) Coupled activation of rhp38 MAPk by activated MKK3 .
The ability of activated MKK3 to activate rhp38 MAPk was determined by the ability of phosphorylated rhp38 MAPk to phosphorylate the substrate ATF-21-110.°°P phosphorylation of ATF-21-110 from blots was quantified by phosphor screen autoradiography .
Lysates in the absence of rhp38 MAPk ( lanes 1 and 2 ) represent baseline phosphorylation of the ATF-21-110 , whereas lysates in the presence of rhp38 MAPk ( lanes 3 and 4 ) demonstrate increased phosphorylation of ATF-21-110 via coupled activation of rthp38 MAPk by activated MKK3 in response to LPS .

Neutrophils were stimulated with LPS ( 100 ng/m ! )
for 20 min at 37°C .
( a ) Phosphorylation of MKK4 .
Under identical conditions to the experiments shown in Fig .
1 , MKK4 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and submitted to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an anti-phosphorylated MKK4 antibody .
Blot is representative of three experiments .
( b ) Activation of MKK4 .
°P phosphorylation of rhp38 MAPk from blots was quantified by phosphor screen autoradiography .
Lysates in the absence of rthp38 MAPk ( lanes 1 and 2 ) were compared with lysates in the presence of rthp38 MAPk ( lanes 3 and 4 ) and a cell-free control to demonstrate the lack of specific activation of MKK4 in response to LPS as determined by *P phosphorylation of rthp38 MAPk .
( e ) Coupled activation of rthp38 MAPk by MKK4 .
The ability of MKK4 to activate rhp38 MAPk was determined by the ability of phosphorylated rhp38 MAPk to phosphorylate the substrate ATF-21-110 .
Lysates in the absence of rhp38 MAPk ( lanes 1 and 2 ) represent baseline phosphorylation of the ATF-21-110 , whereas lysates in the presence of rthp38 MAPk ( lanes 3 and 4 ) demonstrate little increase in phosphorylation of ATF-21-110 via coupled activation of rthp38 MAPk by MKK4 in response to LPS .
The cell-free control quantifies intrinsic activity of the rhp38 MAPk and is equivalent to the unstimulated and LPS-stimulated lysates in lanes 3 and 4 .
Plots depict mean values and SEM from three consecutive experiments expressed in arbitrary units .
The Journal of Clinical Investigation | March 1999 | Volume103 | Number 6 853 immunoblot with an anti-MKK3 antibody confirmed that equal amounts of MKK3 were immunoprecipitated under each condition ( not shown ) .
MKK4 and MKK6 do not mediate p38 MAPk activation in LPS-stimulated neutrophils .
Under identical conditions , MKK4 was immunoprecipitated from untreated and stimulated neutrophils .
A detectable increase in phosphorylation of MKK4 was observed in neutrophils exposed to LPS when compared with unstimulated cells ( Fig .
24 ) .
However , no significant phosphorylation of p38 MAPk by MKK4 occurred , as determined by *°P incorporation into rhp38 MAPk ( Fig .
2b ) .
In turn , no significant increase in rhp38 MAP k activity was seen as determined by *P phosphorylation of ATF-2 ( Fig .
2¢ ) .
MKK6 is also capable of robust p38 MAPK activation ; however , MKK6 ( unlike MKK3 and MKK4 ) appears to have a high degree of cell-type specificity ( 9 , 19 ) .
It has been reported ( 19 ) that in human leukocytes , MKK6 gene expression is undetectable , despite the fact that the cDNA encoding MKK6 was originally isolated from human T cells .
Western blots performed on neutrophil whole-cell lysates using a panel of MKK6-specific antibodies ( see Methods ) failed to detect the protein when compared with myocyte and mono-cyte lysates ( data not shown ) , suggesting that MKK6 is not constitutively expressed in human neutrophils .
LPS stimulation of neutrophils results in activation of p38 , but not p388 , MAPk .
Western blots of neutrophil lysates were probed with antibodies against p38B , p38Y , and p388 .
Immunoblotting with antisera raised against a 19-base peptide of p3868 demonstrated a single band of the appropriate molecular weight .
Identification of this band as p3868 was supported by selective immunodepletion analysis of the neutrophil lysate ( Fig .
34 ) .
In contrast , immunoblotting with antibodies against p38B and p38Yy failed to reveal the presence of these isoforms ( data not Figure 3 LPS stimulation selectively activates p38 @ MAPk , but not p388 MAPk .
( a ) Identification of p388 MAPK in neutrophil whole-cell lysates ( WCL ) by immunodepletion .
Neutrophil lysate were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-peptide p386 antisera ( lane 1 ) .
Confirmation of the identity of the p388 MAPK band was achieved by immunoprecipitating p38 from the lysate using a purified anti-full-length p388 antibody .
A significant decrease in the proposed p386 band is observed after 6 h ( lane 2 ) and 12 h ( lane 3 ) of immunodepletion .
( b ) Immunoprecipitation of p38 @ and p388 MAPk .
Neutrophils stimulated with LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) for 25 min at 37°C ( L ) , H2O2 ( 1 mM ) for 20 min at 37°C ( H ) , or unstimulated ( U ) were lysed , and p38 @ and p388 MAPk were immunoprecipitated and separated by SDS-PAGE .
Western blots were probed with antisera specific for p38 and p388 MAPk to demonstrate equivalent amounts of immunoprecipitation for each condition studied .
( ¢ ) Tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 and p388 MAPk .
Blots from b were reprobed with an anti-phos-photyrosine antibody capable of reacting with phosphorylated tyrosine residues from both p38 ( and p388 MAPk .
( d ) Activation of p38 and p388 MAPk .
Neutrophils subjected to identical conditions as in b and c were lysed , and p38 @ and p388 MAPk was immunoprecipitated and combined with ATF-21-110 in the presence of [ *PJATP .
The peptide was subjected to SDS-PAGE , and the degree of *P phosphorylation of ATF-21-110 was assessed by autoradiography of the blot .
Each panel is representative of three consecutive experiments .
shown ) .
Failure to detect p38B and p38y supports earlier reports of tissue specificity , as expression of and p38Y mRNA is negligible in peripheral leukocytes ( 10 ) .
Activation and phosphorylation of p38 ( and p3868 were assessed simultaneously in lysates from neutrophils stimulated with LPS or H ; 0 ; .
Both p38 and p388 were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates after stimulation and were resolved by SDS-PAGE .
A Western blot probed with antibodies against p38 and p388 demonstrated equivalent amounts of kinase for each condition ( Fig .
3b ) .
The blots were then restained with an antibody capable of detecting tyrosine phosphorylation of both p38 ( @ and p388 ( Fig .
3¢ ) .
As shown previously , stimulation with LPS or H , O ; resulted in significant phosphorylation of p38 & MAPk .
In contrast , LPS failed to phosphorylate p386 MAPk .
H ; O ; , a potent activator of 13388 when transfected into cells lines ( 10 , 11 ) was seen to be capable of inducing phosphorylation of p386 in the neutrophil .
Activation of p380 and p388 was determined by immunoprecipitating each isoform from stimulated and unstimulated cells and combining the kinases with ATF-2 ( a suitable substrate for both ) in the presence of [ P ] ATP .
Corresponding to the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation , stimulation with LPS failed to activate 13388 , whereas H ; O ; was shown to be a potent activator of the isoform ( Fig .
3d ) .
Together , these results suggest that under the conditions studied , p38 alone is activated in response to LPS stimulation of the neutrophil .
Inhibition of p38 MAPR selectively modulates rapid neutrophil responses to LPS .
The pyridinyl imidazoles , SK & F86002 and S $ B203580 , have been demonstrated to inhibit p38 MAPk activity with insignificant effect on other mammalian signaling kinases ( 4 , 11-13 , 17 ) .
$ B203580 is now recognized to inhibit only the & and B isoforms of p38 MAPk ( 11 ) .

Neutrophils suspended in SK & F86002 ( open bars ) or $ B203580 ( filled bars ) over a range of concentrations for 60 min at 37°C were then stimulated with LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) at 37°C .
( a ) Effect of in vivo inhibition of p38 ( MAPk on actin assembly .
The -fold increase in relative fluorescence index ( RF ) of LPS-stimulated neutrophils ( 5 min ) compared with unstimulated cells was plotted for each concentration of $ B203580 .
The plot represents mean activity and SEM for three independent experiments .
The relationship between $ B203580 concentration and inhibition of actin assembly was not statistically significant ( P = 0.55 ) .

The -fold increase in adhesion of LPS-stimulated neutrophils ( 30 min ) compared with unstimulated cells was plotted for each concentration of inhibitor .
The plot represents mean values and SEM for six experiments .
The relationship between the concentrations of SK & F86002 or $ B203580 and inhibition of adhesion is significant ( P < 0.0001 ) .

The quantity of TNF- @ released per 10° neutrophils stimulated with LPS ( 120 min ) was plotted for each concentration of inhibitor .
The plot represents mean values and SEM of three consecutive experiments .
The relationship between the concentrations of SK & F86002 or $ B203580 and inhibition of TNF-Q release is significant ( P < 0.0001 ) .
TNF , tumor necrosis factor .
responses to LPS that depend on p38G MAPk activation , neutrophils were pretreated with SK & F86002 or $ B203580 followed by stimulation with LPS .
The ability of neutrophils to assemble F-actin appears to be largely independent of p38 MAPk activation , with no inhibitor effect noted except at the highest concentration studied ( Fig .
44 ) .
In contrast , pretreatment with the p38 MAPk inhibitors resulted in a signifi-cant , concentration-dependent decrease in neutrophil adhesion in response to LPS ( Fig .
4b ) .
Inhibition of p38Q MAPk activation downregulates TNF- & gene expression and release in LPS-stimulated neutrophils .
Inhibition of p38 MAPk by pyridinyl imidazoles has been shown to reduce TNF-Q release in monocytes and certain cell lines ( 4 ) .
We therefore investigated whether p38G MAPk is a component of the signaling pathway leading to TNF-Q release in neutrophils .
Cells treated with a range of concentrations of either SK & F86002 or SB203580 were then stimulated with LPS , and subsequent quantification of TNF-Q release was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .
Both p38 MAPk inhibitors reduced in a dose-dependent fashion the ability of LPS to elicit the secretion of TNF- @ ( Fig .
4¢ ) .
In view of the fact that the release of cytokines by activated neutrophils is preceded by enhanced de novo protein synthesis and gene expression ( 16 ) , we next investigated the effect of MAPk inhibitors toward mRNA and TNF-Q protein accumulation in LPS-stimulated cells .
To determine whether inhibition of p38 ( MAPk activation might modulate TNF- mRNA steady-state levels in LPS-stimulated neutrophils , the cells were suspended in the presence or absence of $ B203580 and stimulated with LPS for 30 and 60 min-utes .
TNF-G mRNA was quantified by RPA .
Stimulation with LPS elicited a significant increase in TNF- & mRNA , which could be detected as early as 30 minutes after LPS addition .
Pretreatment of the cells with $ B203580 caused a 50 % -60 % inhibition of the LPS-induced TNF-Q mRNA accumulation at the 30-minute time point ( Fig .
5 , a and b ) .
However , this effect of SB203580 on TNF-OQ mRNA was transient : it was no longer observed by 60 minutes ( Fig .
5 , a and b ) or at later times ( not shown ) .
To determine whether inhibition of p38G MAPk resulted in a posttranslational block of processing or release of TNF- , we quantified cell-associated TNF- from LPS-stimulated cells after inhibition of p380 MAPk .
Pretreatment of neutrophils with $ B20580 did not result in an intracellular or membrane-associated accumulation of TNF- ( data not shown ) .
Together these results indicate that inhibition of p38 ( @ MAPk downregulates TNF- release by acting primarily at the level of ( or before ) translation .
Inhibition of p380 MAPk activation prevents NF-KB activation in LPS-stimulated neutrophils .
Stimulation of neutrophils with LPS has been reported to result in NF-xB activation ( 18 ) , and this transcription factor is known to regulate TNF- gene expression in many cell types .
We therefore investigated whether p38 MAPk inhibition might modulate NF-KB activation in neutrophils .
Cells were pretreated with SB203580 and subsequently stimulated with LPS before EMSA analysis of nuclear extracts .
LPS-induced NF-KB activation was almost completely inhibited in neutrophils pretreated with the p38 MAPk inhibitor ( Fig .
62 ) .
The possibility that SB203580 might directly interfere with NF-KB binding to our NF-KB probe was ruled out because incubation of nuclear extracts from LPS-treated cells in the presence of $ B203580 resulted in no difference in DNA-binding activity ( Fig .

Discussion Stimulation of human neutrophils with physiological concentrations of LPS in the presence of LPS-binding protein ( LBP ) is initiated through binding of CD14 .
Our group and others ( 5 , 20 ) have demonstrated that LPS-induced activation of p38 MAPk and subsequent release of TNF-Q can be nearly eliminated by blocking the binding of LPS to CD14 .
After binding of the LPS-LBP complex to CD14 , the signal must pass through the plasma membrane via a companion membrane-spanning protein , because CD14 does not have an intracellular component .
Human homologs of the Toll receptor in Drosophila are transmembrane proteins that appear capable of such a function .
When transfected into cell lines , toll-like receptor ( TLR ) 2 promotes LPS signal transduction , which is enhanced by coexpression of CD14 ( 21 ) .
In the LPS-resistant C3H/HeJ and C57BL/108cCr strains of mice , inability to respond to LPS has been attributed to mutations in the gene expressing TLR4 ( 22 ) .

856 The Journal of Clinical Investigation | March 1999 | Volume103 | Number 6 the LPS-signaling pathway of human neutrophil has yet to be determined .
Although early intracellular signaling events in this pathway remain undefined , they are independent of protein kinase C and do not utilize Ras , Raf , MEKK-1 , or MEK1/MEK2Z ( 5 ) .
Instead , we now show that LPS-induced activation of p38 MAPk occurs via MKK3 ( independent of MKK4 or MKK6 ) .
Only the p38G and p388 MAPk isoforms were detected in the neutrophil , and only p38 was found to be activated in response to LPS .
The activation of p38 MAPk contributes to functional responses including adhesion , NF-KB activation , and the synthesis of TNF- .
The exact role of p38G MAPk in the complex series of events that lead to neutrophil adhesion is not known , but because adhesion occurs independent of protein synthesis , this regulation is likely to involve the phosphorylation of different substrates than the ones affecting the release of TNF- .
A diagram depicting our present understanding of LPS-induced intracellular signaling in the neutrophil is shown in Fig .
7 .
Through use of specific p38 MAPk inhibitors such as SK & F 86002 and S $ B203580 , several functional consequences of p380G MAPk activation have been identi-fied .
These pyridinyl imidazoles have been shown in vitro to inhibit specifically the & and B isoforms of p38 MAP , with negligible effect on other important protein kinases and phosphatases ( 4 , 11 , 12 , 17 ) .
Like-wise , in vivo studies in whole cells demonstrated inhibition of p38 MAPk , with no effect on activation of JNKs and p42 ERK MAPks ( 4 , 12 ) .
At higher concen-trations , inhibition of certain JNK isoforms may occur ; however , these kinases are not activated by LPS in the neutrophil under our experimental conditions ( 13 ) .
In human neutrophils , inhibition of p38 MAPk results in decreased superoxide anion production , reduction in adhesion and chemotaxis in response to fMLP ( 17 , 23 ) , and obstruction of interleukin ( IL ) -8 release in response to LPS ( 23 ) .
Our data suggest that p38G MAPk activation may influence at least two regulatory steps in the synthesis of TNF- @ .
Inhibition of LPS-induced NF-KB may contribute to the transient decrease in TNF-Q mRNA accumulation observed in LPS-stimulated neutrophils after pretreatment with $ B203580 .
Thus , inhibition of transcriptional events might represent one of the mechanisms whereby p380 MAPk inhibitors block TNF-release .
However , it must be emphasized that the decrease in TNF- mRNA levels resulting from p38 MAPk inhibition is only observed during the first hour of LPS stimulation .
This suggests that the sustained inhibition of TNF- & synthesis resulting from p38 ( MAPk blockade must involve additional mechanisms , and it raises the possibility of a posttranscriptional role for p380 MAPk in the context of production .
Consistent with our data , a number of studies have provided evidence for transcriptional and translational effects of p38 MAPk .
In cell lines , p38 MAPk inhibitors have been reported to downregulate the expression of several genes .
In particular , LPS-induced c-Jun mRNA in RAW 264.7 cells ( 14 ) , TNF- & @ -induced IL-6 mRNA in L929 cells ( 24 ) , and IL-1-induced prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2 mRNA in primary monocytes ( 25 ) are reduced by inhibition of p38 MAPk .
It is noteworthy that the genes encoding IL-6 , TNF- , and prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2 all depend on NF-KB ( albeit to varying degrees ) for inducible expression ( 26 ) and that both p38 MAPk and ERK MAPk have been reported to downregulate TNF- « -induced IL-6 gene expression by interfering with NF-KB-dependent transcription in L929 cells ( 27 ) .
Inhibition of LPS-stimulated IL-1 and TNF- production by p38 MAP k inhibitors in THP-1 cells occurs at the translational level ( 4 ) .
In these cells , SK & F86002 had little effect on TNF-Q mRNA levels but instead was found to inhibit TNF- mRNA translation by inducing a shift of TNF-OQ mRNA from polysomes ( actively translated ) to free mRNA ( translationally inactive ) ( 28 ) .
One possible mechanism by which p38 MAPk could regulate translation could be through the activation of MAPk-interacting kinase 1 , which phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF-4E ( 29 ) and is known to play a key role in the regulation of translation in mammalian cells .
Significant differences appear to exist between mono-cytes/macrophages and neutrophils with respect to the role of p38 MAPk in synthesis .
Recent reports in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells have demonstrated a regulatory effect of p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk on TNF- tran ARX NARRARARRRRRRRNARRANAIAARIAARIARIARA iene new iene whan evn e whe w MKK3 p380 .

Binding of CD14 by LPS in the presence of LBP initiates a signal that passes though a transmembrane spanning protein and a series of yet unknown upstream signaling events , leading to activation of the MKK3-p38 @ MAPk cascade .
The activator of MKK3 in this cell ( MEKK-X ) is not known .
Activation of p380 , MAPK then results in rapid responses such as adhesion and activation of NF-KB .
Synthesis of the TNF- @ peptide is also dependent on p38 MAPk activation , in part through activation of NF-KB , but primarily through regulation of translation .

The Journal of Clinical Investigation | March 1999 | Volume 103 |_ Number 6 857 858 scription , and a significant role of the MEKK1/MEKA/JNK cascade on TNF- @ translation ( 30 ) .
In the mast cell line RBL-2H3 , production of TNF-Q is linked to activation of p42 MAPk , but not p38 MAPk ( 31 ) .
However , in human monocytes , a role for p38 MAPk activation in the induction of TNF-0 and IL-1 release has been proposed ( 4 , 32 ) .
In contrast , we and others have shown that the p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk are not activated in human neutrophils in response to LPS ( 5 , 7 ) and that the ability to activate JNKs diminishes as HL-60 promyelocytic cells differentiate into neutrophils ( 15 ) .
These differences support the observation that MAPk cascades may serve a wide range of pur-poses , depending on the cellular context and upstream regulation ( 1 ) .
A growing body of evidence supports the conclusion that regulatory influences of p38 MAPk can occur independent of protein synthesis or at the site ( s ) of transcription and/or translation to varying degrees in a gene-specific manner .
Further specificity is conferred by the ability of different cell types to use the MAPK cascades in distinct manners in response to identical stimuli .
These results underscore the importance of defining signaling pathways under physiological conditions in primary human cells .
