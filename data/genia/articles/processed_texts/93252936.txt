A Chimeric Type II/Type I Interleukin-1 Receptor Can Mediate Interleukin-1 Induction of Gene Expression in T Cells® ( Received for publication , July 20 , 1992 ) Adriana Heguyt , Cosima T. Baldari§ , Stefano Censinit , Paolo Ghiarat , and John L. Telford } !
From the { Immunological Research Institute Siena ( IRIS ) , Via Fiorentina 1 , 53100 Siena , Italy and the §Department of Evolutionary Biology , University of Siena , 53100 Siena , Italy The type I interleukin-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) is capable of transducing a signal resulting in promoter activation in T cells .
This signal transduction is dependent on the cytoplasmic domain , which consists of 213 amino acids .
In contrast to the type I receptor , the type II IL- 1R has a small cytoplasmic tail , and it is not clear whether this receptor is a signal-transducing or a regulatory molecule .
Here we report that the type II IL-1R does not mediate gene activation in Jurkat cells .
However , a hybrid receptor composed of the extracellular and transmembrane regions of the human type II interleukin-1 fused to the cytoplasmic domain of the human type I IL-1R was capable of transducing a signal across the membrane resulting in a pattern of gene activation identical to that mediated by the type I IL-1R .
Our results indicated that the extracellular domain of the type II IL-1 R was capable of functionally interacting with interleukin-1 and transmitting the resulting signal to a heterologous cytoplasmic domain .
The interaction of ligands with cell surface receptors is a key event in extracellularly induced processes leading to cell differentiation and proliferation .
Much attention has been given to the intracellular interactions that occur after receptor activation , such as phosphorylation and interaction with second messengers , but the mechanisms by which ligand binding causes transduction of a signal between an extracellular domain and an intracellular domain separated by the plasma membrane are still poorly understood .
In some cases , it is clear that receptor dimerization upon ligand binding is a key event ( Ullrich and Schlessinger , 1990 ) , suggesting that the physical proximity of two intracellular domains may be necessary for formation of a signaling complex .
Several other receptors , such as the interleukin-2 receptor and hemato-poietic growth factor receptors , have very short intracellular domains and need to interact with a second chain for functional signaling ( Hatekayama et al .
, 1989a , 1989b ; Nicola and Metcalf , 1991 ) .
Ligand binding is not always sufficient to trigger signal transduction .

polypeptides that can bind to the same receptors , but while IL-la and IL-18 elicit essentially identical biological responses , the IL-1lra is a true natural antagonist , blocking IL-la and IL-1 } binding without triggering IL-1R signaling ( for review , see Dinarello and Thompson ( 1991 ) and Dinarello { ( 1991 ) ) .
There are two types of IL-1Rs : the 80-kDa type I IL-1R , found predominantly in T cells and fibroblasts , and the 68-kDa type II or B cell IL-1R , also found in monocytes , neutrophils , and bone marrow cells ( McMahan et al .
, 1991 ) .
Although these two receptors are structurally related in their extracellular domain and they both have a single membrane-spanning region , they belong to different categories on the basis of their cytoplasmic portions ( Sims et al .
, 1988 , 1989 ; McMahan et al .
, 1991 ) .
The type I IL-1R has a large cytoplasmic tail that is essential for signal transduction ( Curtis et al .
, 1989 ; Heguy et al .
, 1991 ) .
Key amino acids involved in type I IL-1R function have been defined by homology with the intracellular domain of the Drosophila morphogen receptor Toll ( Gay and Keith , 1991 ; Schneider et al .
, 1991 ) and mutational analysis of conserved amino acids in the human type I IL-1R cytoplasmic portion ( Heguy et al .
, 1992 ) .
In contrast to the type I receptor , the type II IL-1R has a very short cytoplasmic tail of 29 amino acids ( McMahan et el .
, 1991 ) , and it is highly unlikely that it is capable of transducing a signal in the absence of a second chain .
IL-1 induces biological responses in cell lines that apparently express only the type II IL-1R , suggesting that this receptor must be capable of signaling ( Giri et al .
, 1984 ; Horuk and McCubrey , 1989 ) .
However , the biological relevance of the type II IL-1R is poorly understood .
Although the intracellular domains of the type II and type I IL-1Rs differ , the homology between their extracellular domains suggests that if the type II IL-1R is indeed capable of transmitting the IL-1 signal across the plasma membrane , it will do so by a mechanism similar to that of the type I IL-1R .
To address this question , we constructed a chimeric IL-1R consisting of the type II extracellular and transmembrane domains fused to the cytoplasmic tail of the type I IL-1R .
We assayed this chimeric receptor in a system that we previously used to investigate type I IL-1R signal transduction ( Baldari et al .
, 1991 ; Heguy et al .
, 1991 , 1992 ) .
The results indicated that the type II IL-1R extracellular domain is capable of a functional interaction with IL-1 and of activating the heter-ologous , type I IL-1R intracellular domain .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Reagents-Recombinant human IL-18 from Escherichia coli ( Cas-agli et al .
, 1989 ) was used at 50 pM unless otherwise stated .
The human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist was obtained from British Biotechnology .
Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) ( Sigma ) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 1 mg/ml and used at 10 ng/ml for stimulations .
Phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) ( Wellcome ) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline at 1 mg/ml and used at 2 ug/ml .
Acetyl 10490 Chimeric Interleukin-1 Receptor Signal Transduction coenzyme A from Boehringer Mannheim and [ `` *C ) ] chloramphenicol from Amersham International were used for the CAT assays .
Protein determinations were done using the BCA kit ( Pierce Chemical Co. ) .
Restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim , New England Biolabs , or Promega Corp. and used according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Polymerase chain reactions were carried out using the Gene-Amp kit ( Perkin-Elmer Cetus Instruments ) or vent DNA polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) in a DNA thermal cycler ( Perkin-Elmer Cetus Instruments ) .
Oligonucle-otides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer using cyanoethyl phosphoramidate chemistry .
For nucleotide sequence determinations , we used the Sequenase kit ( U. S. Biochemical Corp. ) .
Plasmids-IL-2 CAT is a derivative of pBluescript SK+ ( Stratagene ) containing 2 kilobase pairs of IL-2 promoter sequences upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene ( Macchia et al .
, 1990 ) .
pSV2-CAT is described in Gorman et al .
( 1982 ) .
NF- « B-CAT was described in Fan and Maniatis ( 1989 ) under the name of PRDIL .
pSVT7 is a mammalian expression vector containing the SV40 early promoter ( Bird et al .
, 1987 ) .
pSVT7/IL-1R is a vector expressing the human type I IL-1R ( Heguy et al .
, 1991 ) .
pSVT7/hIL-1R II is pSVT7 with the human type II IL-1R coding sequences , cloned in the correct orientation in the Sall site of the pSVT7 polylinker .
The human type II IL-1R cDNA was synthesized using the polymerase chain reaction as follows : poly ( A* ) RNA was extracted from Raji cells , subclone 1H7 ( Scapigliati et al .
, 1991 ) , and used as a template for first strand cDNA synthesis and reverse PCR using the cDNA cycle kit ( Invitrogen ) , using a pair of amplimers corresponding to the first 8 codons , and complementary to the last 8 codons ( including the stop codon ) of the human type II IL-1R cDNA ( McMahan et al .
, 1991 ) , respectively .
The resulting cDNA containing only coding sequences plus appropriate restriction sites was cloned into pSVT7 and sequenced .
All plasmids used for transfections were purified using the Qiagen Maxi-kit , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Construction of the Chimeric Type II/Type I IL-1R-A portion of the extracellular region and the transmembrane region of the type II IL-1R were synthesized by PCR using vent DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer 's instructions , using as a 5'-amplimer an oligonucleotide corresponding to the coding sequences around the Smal site at nucleotide position 916 in the cDNA and , as a 3'-amplimer , the oligonucleotide CAAGAA-3 ' , corresponding to sequences complementary to the coding strand at positions 1162-1137 ( McMahan et al .
, 1991 ) , which introduced a Nde !
site by changing the adenine at position 1160 in the cDNA to a cytosine .
This base substitution did not change the amino acid encoded by the triplet .
Then , the entire intracellular region of the type I IL-1R was synthesized by PCR using vent DNA polymerase using as a 5'-amplimer the oligonucleotide TATGATGAAAATCTTCAAGATTGACATTGTG-3 ' , where the first 13 bases represent type II IL-1R sequences ( including the substitution to create an Ndel site ) and the following bases correspond to type I IL-1R coding sequences starting from the first codon ( AAA , Lys ) in the intracellular domain ; the 3'-amplimer used was identical to that described in Heguy et al ( 1991 ) with the exception that the site introduced for cloning purposes was Xbal and not Salil .
The resulting type II and type I amplified fragments were restricted with SmaI/Ndel and Ndel/Xbal , respectively , purified using Geneclean II ( Bio 101 ) , and ligated .
The ligation products were separated on a 1 % agarose gel , and the band corresponding to the expected size of ligated type II and type I IL-1R fragments was cut out , purified with Geneclean II , and , subsequently , ligated to pGEM4Z ( Stratagene ) cut with Smal and Xbal .
This intermediate construct was cut with EcoRI and Smal and used as a vector to subclone a partial EcoRI-complete Smal fragment originated by digestion of pSVT7/hIL-1R II containing the coding sequences of the human type II IL-1R cDNA from the ATG codon to the Smal site .
This complete chimeric receptor was released from pGEM4Z with a partial EcoRI digest and a complete Xbal digest and cloned into pSVT7 between the EcoRI and Xbal sites of its polylinker , originating the expression vector pSVT7/hIL-1R II/I .
This chimeric cDNA was sequenced to confirm its identity with the expected sequences and to exclude PCR-introduced errors .
Cell Culture , Transfections , and CAT Assays-Jurkat cells ( Gillis and Watson , 1980 ) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine , 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7.9 ) , 12.5 aM 2-mercap-toethanol , and 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum ( Seromed ) .
1 x 10 `` cells/sample were cotransfected with 5 ug of IL-1R-expressing plasmids and 5 ag of IL-2-CAT reporter plasmid using the DEAE- 10491 dextran method as previously described ( Macchia et al .
, 1990 ) .
When pSV2-CAT or NF- « B-CAT reporter plasmids were used , the procedure was scaled down to one-tenth .
Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h , split into equal aliquots , and treated as described in Figs .
2-4 for 8-12 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 150 ul of 0.25 M Tris-HCl .
Extracts were prepared by three cycles of freeze-thawing ; CAT enzyme activity was assayed using [ `` C ) chloramphenicol as described by Gorman et al .
( 1982 ) .
Autoradiographs of the thin layer chromatograms were scanned in an Ultrascan XL enhanced laser densitometer .
RESULTS The human lymphoma Jurkat cells do not express detectable amounts of IL-1Rs on the cell surface ( Rosoff et al .
, 1988 ) .
We have previously shown that Jurkat cells transfected with a plasmid expressing either the murine or human type I IL-1R gain responsiveness to IL-1 as defined by induction of IL-2 promoter activity ( Baldari et al .
, 1991 ; Heguy et al .
, 1991 ) .
We have constructed a chimeric cDNA coding for a hybrid IL-1R consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane portions of the human type II IL-1R ( McMahan et al .
, 1991 ) fused to the entire cytoplasmic domain of the human type I IL-1R ( Sims et al .
, 1989 ) ( Fig .
1 ) .
We have transfected this chimeric IL-1R cloned in a mammalian expression vector ( pSVT7/hIL-1R II/I ) and compared its ability to mediate activation of IL-1-responsive promoters with that of the type I or type II IL-1Rs .
A construct carrying the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene under the control of the IL-2 promoter can be activated in Jurkat cells by treatment with PHA and PMA .
In Jurkat cells transfected with this IL-2-CAT construct and a mammalian expression vector carrying the type I IL-1R cDNA ( pSVT7/hIL-1R ) , treatment with PHA plus IL-1 results in CAT activity levels similar to those obtained with PHA plus PMA .
A plasmid expressing the human type II IL-1R cDNA ( pSVT7/hIL-1R II ) failed to confer IL-1-dependent induction of the IL-2 promoter in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
On the other hand , cotransfection of the chimeric type II/type I IL-1R construct ( pSVT7/hIL-1R II/I ) with the IL-2-CAT reporter plasmid resulted in an induction of CAT activity in response to PHA/IL-1 stimulation comparable with that mediated by the wild-type type I IL-1R ( Fig .
2 ) .
Similar results were obtained when the IL-2 reporter plasmid was substituted by a construct coding for CAT under the control of the SV40 early promoter ( pSV2-CAT ) .
Unlike the IL-2 promoter , in Jurkat cells the SV40 promoter responds to a combination of IL-1 with PMA or to PHA plus PMA ( Baldari et al .
, 1991 ; Heguy et al .
, 1991 ) .
IL-1/PMA costimulation resulted in a weak induction of promoter activity in cells transfected with the control vector pSVT7 suggesting that Jurkat cells may have a low number of IL-1Rs on the cell surface that escape detection by binding or IL-2-CAT activity assay .
This result is consistent with previous observations of IL-1-induced release of diacylglycerol from phos-phatidylcholine in Jurkat cells in the absence of detectable IL-1 binding ( Rosoff et al .
, 1988 ) .
Cotransfection of the SV40-CAT reporter gene with the type II IL-1R construct pSVT7/ IL-1R II resulted in a level of CAT activity comparable with the control pSVT7 plasmid .
As shown in Fig .
34 ( control , type II ) , in cells transfected with either of these two plasmids , the CAT activity resulting from IL-1/PMA stimulation was approximately half of that obtained by PHA/PMA stimulation .
In cells transfected with the type I IL-1R expressing construct , the level of IL-1/PMA induction of SV40-CAT activity was equivalent to that obtained with PHA/PMA treatment ( Fig .
34 , type I ) .
IL-1/PMA treatment of cells transfected with the plasmid expressing the chimeric type II/ type I sequences resulted in a level of SV40-driven CAT 10492 aa 1 319 339 ma Chimeric Interleukin-1 Receptor Signal Transduction 552 IL-1R ( type 1 ) IL-1R ( type 11 ) type II / 1 Hybrid FiG .

Analysis of wild-type and hybrid hIL-1R function on IL-2 promoter activation in Jurkat cells .
Thin layer chromatograms of the products of CAT activity in extracts of Jurkat cells transiently transfected with an IL-2-CAT construct , and expression vectors containing type I hIL-1R , type II hIL-1R , hybrid type II/type I IL-1Rs , as indicated , or vector alone ( control ) .
Equal aliquots of a pool of cotransfected cells were stimulated with PHA plus IL-1 ( IL-1-dependent activation ) or PHA plus PMA ( IL-1-independent activation ) as indicated .
activity slightly higher than that induced by PHA/PMA ( Fig .
3A , type II/I ) .
The binding activity of the transcription factor NF- « B can be induced by a number of stimuli including IL-1 ( for review , see Blank et al .
( 1992 ) ) .
We have previously shown that a reporter plasmid coding for CAT under the control of an artificial NF- « B promoter transfected into the murine thy-moma line EL-4 responded to stimulation by IL-1 alone without the need for a costimulus ( Baldari et al .
, 1992a ) .
NF- « B-CAT activity can be induced by IL-1 alone also in Jurkat cells cotransfected with type I IL-1R ( Baldari et al .
, 1992b ) .
As shown in Fig .
3B , IL-1 can induce NF- « B-CAT activity in Jurkat cells transfected with the type II/type I IL-1R .
A low level of NF- « B-CAT activity was induced in cells transfected with the control plasmid pSVT7 or pSVT7 expressing the type II IL-1R ( Fig .
3B , control , type II ) , although this level of CAT activity is about one-fifth of that resulting from PMA treatment , which represents the IL-1-independent signal in this assay .
In cells cotransfected with the NF- « B-CAT reporter plasmid and a vector expressing the type I IL-1R , the level of IL-1-induced CAT activity was essentially the same as that obtained with PMA ( Fig .
3B , type I ) indicating that at least part of the IL-1 signal must be transmitted by its receptor to have an effect on NF- « B transcriptional activity .
Interestingly , the hybrid type II/type I IL-1R consistently resulted in a 1.3-1.5-fold higher induction of CAT activity than the type I IL-1R .
This may be caused by the fact that the type II IL-1R shows a higher binding capacity for IL-1 , which was used in this study , than the type I IL-1R ( Scapigliati et al .
, 1989 ) .
IL-1ra competitively inhibits binding of IL-18 to both the type I and type II receptors ( Hannum et al .
, 1990 ; Eisenberg et al .
, 1990 , 1991 ; Granowitz et al .
, 1991 ; Dripps et al .
, 1991 ) .
We were interested in what effect the IL-1ra would have on IL-1 activation mediated by the chimeric receptor .
Fig .
4 shows the effect of increasing concentrations of IL-1ra on IL-18 activation of the NF- « B promoter mediated by the type I receptor and the chimeric receptor .
For these experiments , we chose a concentration of 3 pM IL-13 , which is approximately 5 times the concentration required for half-maximal activation in this system . ``
IL-1ra was considerably more potent in inhibiting type I IL-1R-mediated than chimer-mediated activation of the NF- « B promoter .
In cells transfected with the type I IL-1R , IL-ira inhibited 50 % of activation of the NF- « B-CAT construct by 3 pM IL-18 at a concentration of approximately 7 nM , whereas a concentration of approximately 60 nM was required to inhibit 50 % of type II/type I-mediated activation .
The difference in potency reflects the relative affinities of IL-18 and IL-lra for the type I and type II receptors ( reviewed in Dinarello and Thompson ( 1991 ) ) .
Thus , although the chimeric type II/type I receptor transduces signals indistinguishable from the type I receptor , it retains relative binding affinities for and IL-1ra similar to the type II receptor .
DISCUSSION The use of chimeric receptors has proven to be an excellent tool to study the mechanisms of signaling of receptors that have not been well characterized .
For instance , experiments with a number of chimeric growth factor receptors belonging to the tyrosine kinase family have shown that these receptors employ an identical mechanism for signal transduction across the plasma membrane ( Riedel et al .
, 1986 ; Lehvaslaiho et al .
, 1989 ; Lee et al .
, 1989 ; Lev et al .
, 1990 ) .
In some other cases , chimeric molecules were constructed between receptors belonging to different classes , and signal transduction was or was not observed , according to the hybrid constructed .
The epidermal growth factor receptor kinase was not stimulated in cells expressing an IL-2R-epidermal growth factor receptor hybrid ( Bernard et al .
, 1987 ) .
In contrast , a chimeric epidermal growth factor receptor-nerve growth factor receptor mediated nuclear signaling in nerve growth factor-responsive cells ( Yan et al .
, 1991 ) .
Here we report that a hybrid molecule of two receptors , which presumably have different intracellular mechanisms of signaling , is capable of signal transduction across the plasma membrane and , furthermore , it can mediate nuclear signaling .
We show that , although the type II IL-1R failed to mediate IL-1 responses , a chimeric IL-1 receptor composed of the > C. T. Baldari and J. L. Telford , unpublished results .

Effect of IL-lra on type I- and chimeric IL-1R-mediated activation of NF- « B-CAT .
Aliquots of a single pool of cells transfected with the NF- « B-CAT construct and either the type I or chimeric IL-1Rs were activated with 3 pM IL-1 in the presence of increasing concentrations of IL-1ra .
CAT activities were normalized relative to the activation in the absence of IL-1ra taken as 100 % .
Each assay was carried out in duplicate , and the error bars show standard deviation , IL-1ra at a concentration of 100 nM had no effect on activation of the NF- « B-CAT construct by PMA .
synergized with PHA in IL-2 promoter activation and with PMA in SV40 promoter activation , and stimulated the NF- « B artificial promoter in the absence of other stimuli .
The failure of the type II receptor to mediate induction of gene expression in Jurkat cells could reflect the lack of a role in IL-1 signal transduction , but it could also be possible that these cells did not express additional proteins , such as second chains , which could be needed for type II IL-1R-mediated signal transduction .
The question of IL-1R activation is inevitably linked to the functional binding of IL-1 .
Two out of three polypeptides ( IL-la and IL-1 ) that have the ability to bind the type I and the type II IL-1Rs are capable of transducing a signal resulting in a biological effect of IL-1 , while the third member of the IL-1 family , the receptor antagonist polypeptide IL-1ra , can bind to both types of IL-1Rs ( Hannum et al .
, 1990 ; Eisenberg et al .
, 1990 , 1991 ; Granowitz et al .
, 1991 ; Dripps et al .
, 1991 ) but does not become internalized , does not elicit cellular responses , and blocks the effects of IL-l « and IL-18 ( for review , see Dinarello and Thompson ( 1991 ) ) .
It has been shown that a single amino acid substitution in the IL-1lra converts it to an agonist ( Ju et al .
, 1991 ) and that a single substitution in IL-1 causes loss of function but not of binding to the type I IL-1R ( Gehrke et al .
, 1990 ) .
These findings indicate that binding per se is not sufficient to trigger the IL-1R and that there are two types of binding , functional and nonfunctional .
The nature of functional binding , capable of triggering signal transduction , remains obscure .
It could be speculated that the formation of a certain structure in the IL-1 ligand-receptor complex is needed for transduction across the plasma membrane .
Our results demonstrate that the extracellular domain of the type II IL-1R has the ability to form both a functional complex with IL-18 and a nonfunctional complex with IL-1ra .
Although the type I IL-1R has been well characterized 10494 functionally , the biological relevance of the type II IL-1R is still poorly understood .
The type I IL-1R is a signaling mol-ecule , and transduction is dependent on functional IL-1 binding and is mediated by its cytolasmic domain ( Curtis et al .
, 1989 ; Heguy et al .
, 1991 , 1992 ) .
There is some controversy as to whether the type II IL-1R is a signaling molecule or a regulatory molecule .
Some studies suggest that it mediates some of the effects of IL-1 on lymphocytes , bone marrow cells , brain , and the development of endotoxin-induced shock . ``
Other studies suggest that the type II IL-1R may not be involved in delivering biological signals in response to IL-1 because a monoclonal antibody to the type II IL-1R does not block IL-1-mediated IL-8 induction in THP or HepG2 cells nor does it block induction of a « l-acid glycoprotein or the activation of NF- « B in HepG2 cells .
On the other hand , all of these responses are blocked by anti-type I IL-1R anti-bodies .
* Our chimeric receptor clearly demonstrates that the extracellular domain of the type II IL-1R is not only capable of functionally binding IL-1 but it can also signal across the membrane to the cytoplasmic domain of the type I IL-1R .
This result does not prove that the type II IL-1R mediates biological responses to IL-1 , but it suggests that such a function is possible , at least in some cell lines .
On the other hand , our results can also be interpreted as an indication that IL-1-mediated gene activation is dependent on the presence and activation of the cytoplasmic domain of the type I IL-1R , independent of the type of extracellular ligand binding por-tion .
Ultimately , the question of IL-1 signal transduction will be resolved once the intermediate intracellular messengers that interact with IL-1Rs are identified .
