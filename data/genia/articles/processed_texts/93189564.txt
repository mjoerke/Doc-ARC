, Inc. , National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center , Frederick , MD 21702-1201 Communicated by Ray D. Owen , December 2 , 1992 ( received for review September 28 , 1992 ) ABSTRACT Optimal activation of T cells requires at least two signals .
One signal can be delivered by the antigen-specific T-cell receptor , and the second signal is provided by the costimulatory molecule ( s ) delivered by the antigen-presenting cell .
CD28 is a T-cell surface molecule and stimulation through this protein plays an important role in delivering the second activation signal .
In this report , we show that in human peripheral blood T cells , CD28-mediated signal transduction involves the rel family proteins-c-Rel , p50 , and p6S .
Treatment of peripheral blood T cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) results in augmentation of nuclear c-Rel , p50 , and p65 , and this augmentation can occur in the presence of the immunosuppres-sant cyclosporin A .
It is also shown in this report that , in response to PMA mAb or anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAb , c-Rel , p50 , and p65 are associated with CD28 -responsive element present in the promoter of the human interleukin 2 gene .
The functional significance of c-Rel involvement in the CD28 -responsive complex is demonstrated by transient transfection analysis , where cotransfection of c-Rel augments the level of expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene linked to the CD28-responsive element .
A key activation pathway in the T-cell-mediated immune response involves the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) -CD3 complex .
Although the specificity of T-cell activation is determined by the TCR , TCR signaling alone is not sufficient for T-cell proliferation and production of lymphokines [ e.g .
, interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , interferon y , etc . ]
( 1 , 2 ) .
Accessory cell-derived costimulatory signals are also required for optimal activation of T cells ( 3 , 4 ) .
In the absence of these costimulatory signals , induction of a state of clonal anergy has been proposed ( 3 , 5-7 ) .
A T-cell surface molecule , CD28 , plays an important role in the costimulation process ( 8 , 9 ) , and it has been shown recently that induction of anergy in T-cell clones can be blocked by the CD28-mediated costimulatory signal ( 10 ) .
Activation of T cells and subsequent production of IL-2 via CD28 cell surface molecule triggering is distinct and different from the TCR-medifated pathway ( 9 , 11 , 12 ) .
A natural ligand of CD28 , B7/BB1 , has recently been identified ( 13 ) , and cellular interaction mediated by CD28 and the B-cell activation antigen B7/BB1 may represent an important functional interaction between T and B lymphocytes ( 14-16 ) .
However , the molecular mechanisms involved in the CD28-mediated signal transduction pathway have yet to be fully characterized .
Recently , a CD28-responsive element ( CD28RE ) in the IL-2 gene promoter has been identified and shown to have enhancer activity ( 17 ) .
The nucleotide sequence of the CD28RE has been found in 5 ' upstream regions of many lymphokine genes ( 17 ) .
CD28-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation has recently been shown by Vandenberghe The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

However , the transcription factor ( s ) involved in the CD28-mediated signal transduction pathway has not been fully characterized .
In this manuscript , we demonstrate that treatment of freshly purified human peripheral blood T cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) results in increased nuclear c-Rel as well as the NF « B p50 and p65 subunits , and this increase in nuclear protein levels is resistant to cyclosporin A ( CsA ) .
Furthermore , we show that in response to PMA/ anti-CD28 mAb or anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAb , c-Rel , p50 , and p65 are all associated with the CD28RE .
Finally , in transient transfection analysis we demonstrate that cotransfection of a c-Rel expression plasmid can upregulate chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) expression 6-fold in a CAT vector containing the CD28RE .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of T-Cell Nuclear Extracts and Western Blot Analysis .
Freshly purified human peripheral blood T cells ( > 95 % CD3+* ) were treated with medium alone ( RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 % fetal calf serum ) , PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) , PMA/anti-CD28 mAb ( 100 ng/ml ) , PMA/anti-CD28 mAb/ CsA ( 100 ng/ml ) , PMA/ionomycin ( 1 ug/ml ) , or PMA/ ionomycin/CsA for 7 hr ( cells were pretreated with CsA for 30 min before other stimuli were added ) .
Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the procedure of D. G. Kelvin , G. White , D. L. Longo , and D. F. Ferris ( personal commu-nication ) .
The extracts were analyzed by SDS/PAGE ( 10 % acrylamide ) followed by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-c-Rel/anti-p50/anti-p65 antibodies .
Immunoreactive bands were visualized by using horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin and the enhanced chemilu-minescence detection system ( Amersham ) .
Antisera .
The antisera used in Western blot and immunoprecipitation experiments are described elsewhere ( 19 ) .
In brief , anti-human c-Rel antiserum 265 was raised against a C-terminal peptide ( amino acids 573-587 ) , anti-human-p50 antiserum 1141 was raised against an N-terminal peptide ( amino acids 2-15 ) , and anti-p65 antiserum 1226 was raised against a C-terminal peptide ( amino acids 537-550 ) .
Each antiserum is specific for its protein and does not cross-react with other rel family members ( 19 ) .
DNA-Binding Assay .
A bacterial expression vector for human c-Rel , pKKrel , was used to express c-Rel protein in Escherichia coli ( 20 ) , and the bacterial lysate was prepared as described ( 21 ) .
Control bacterial lysate was prepared from E. coli containing only the expression vector .

mobility-shift assay ( EMSA ) with bacterial extracts was performed as described ( 22 , 23 ) .
The buffer used in EMSA with T-cell nuclear extracts has also been described ( 17 ) .
Oligonucleotides used in EMSA were as follows : 1 , CD28RE ( -164 to -149 of the IL-2 gene ) , AAAGAAATTC-CAAAGA ; 2 , CD28RE mutant , AAAGAAGCCTCAAAGA ; 3 , IL-2 receptor a « B ( -271 to -257 of the NF « B-binding site of the IL-2 receptor a promoter ) , GATCAGGGGAATC-TCCC ; 4 , Spl ( -80 to -44 of Spl-binding sites of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat ) , GATCGGGAGGCGTGGCCTGGGCGGGACTGGG-GAGTGGCGA .
UV Crosslinking and Immunoprecipitation .
The bromouridine-substituted CD28RE oligonucleotide was synthesized on a DNA synthesizer ( Applied Biosystem , model 392 ) .
UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation were performed according to the procedure described by Kochel and Rice ( 24 ) with the following modification : UV irradiation was performed on the gel after EMSA .
The complex was excised and protein was eluted according to the described procedure ( 25 ) .
After precipitating the proteins with acetone , the crosslinked products were analyzed by SDS/PAGE .
To characterize the crosslinked products by immunoprecipitation , the eluted products from EMSA gel were used as a starting material for immunoprecipitation as described ( 24 ) .
RESULTS It has been demonstrated that the CD28 costimulatory signal can act through the « B element ( 26 ) .
However , the CD28RE of the IL-2 gene has been mapped to a distinct sequence that is different from the previously identified xB site of the IL-2 promoter ( 17 ) .
To determine whether NF « B family proteins ( p50 , p65 , and c-Rel ) are involved in the CD28 signaling pathway , nuclear extracts from purified human peripheral blood T cells were treated with PMA alone , anti-CD28 mAb alone , or PMA plus anti-CD28 mAb and were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-c-Rel antiserum ( Fig .
la ) , anti-p50 antiserum ( Fig .
16 ) , or anti-p65 antiserum ( Fig .
1c ) .
Treatment with medium alone or with anti-CD28 mAb alone had no effect on the level of nuclear c-Rel ( Fig .
1a , lanes 1 and 3 ) , while PMA did upregulate the levels of nuclear c-Rel ( lane 2 ) .
However , maximum induction of nuclear c-Rel was observed after the combined PMA/anti-CD28 mAb treatment ( lane 4 ) .
Similar results were obtained for NF « B p50 and p65 , as maximum inductions were observed after combined PMA /anti-CD28 mAb treatment ( Fig .
1 b and c , lane 4 ) .
To determine whether augmentation of the PMA response is specific to anti-CD28 mAb , the experiment was repeated with PMA with or without anti-CD2 mAb .
Unlike the result with anti-CD28 mAb , anti-CD2 mAb did not augment the PMA response ( data not shown ) .
Thus , the effect is specific to anti-CD28 mAb and is not reproduced with another T-cell reactive antibody .
Induction of T-cell proliferation and IL-2 expression by PMA plus anti-CD28 mAb is resistant to CsA ( 27 ) , whereas the major transcriptional stimulation of IL-2 gene expression mediated through the TCR complex is sensitive to CsA ( 28 ) .
To determine whether the upregulation of nuclear c-Rel , p50 , and p65 was mediated through the CD28-signaling pathway , T cells were treated with PMA/anti-CD28 mAb in the presence and absence of CsA , and nuclear extracts were examined by Western blot analysis .
As shown in Fig .
1 df , the increase in nuclear c-Rel , p50 , and p65 in response to PMA/anti-CD28 mAb was resistant to CsA , consistent with involvement of the CD28-signaling pathway .
In a control experiment , the upregulation of nuclear c-Rel , p50 , and p65 by PMA/calcium ionophore ( ionomycin ) treatment of T cells was found to be sensitive to CsA as expected ( Fig .
1g ; data not shown ) .
Although CsA treatment did not block the Proc .

Upregulation of nuclear c-Rel , p50 , and p65 in peripheral blood T cells .
Nuclear extracts ( 6 ug of protein ) from purified peripheral blood T cells were analyzed by Western blot using anti-c-Rel antiserum 265 ( a ) , anti-p50 antiserum 1141 ( b ) , and anti-p65 antiserum 1226 ( c ) .
Lanes : 1 , extract from cells treated with medium alone ; 2 , extract from PMA-treated cells ; 3 , extract from cells treated with anti-CD28 mAb alone ; 4 , extract from PMA plus anti-CD28 mAb-treated cells .
( d-f ) Effects of CsA on treatments .
Nuclear extracts from T cells treated with medium alone ( lane 1 ) or PMA/anti-CD28 mAb in the absence ( lane 2 ) or presence ( lane 3 ) of CsA were analyzed by Western blot using the same anti-c-Rel ( d ) , anti-p50 ( e ) , and anti-p65 ( f ) antisera .
( g ) Sensitivity of upregulation of nuclear c-Rel by PMA/ionomycin to CsA is shown .
Lane 1 , extract from cells treated with medium alone ; lane 2 , extract after PMA/ionomycin-treated cells ; lane 3 , extract after PMA/ionomycin/CsA treatment .
upregulation of nuclear rel family proteins completely , no IL-2 production was observed after this treatment .
One possible explanation is that the level of rel family proteins that remained after PMA/ionomycin/CsA treatment was not sufficient for gene transcription ( see Discussion ) .
As it has been reported that the CD28RE forms specific protein-DNA complexes after stimulation through the CD28 pathway ( 17 ) , we next sought to determine whether the members of the NF « B family that were upregulated by PMA/anti-CD28 mAb treatment could interact with the CD28RE .
An EMSA of the CD28RE using a bacterial extract containing c-Rel revealed the formation of a DNA-protein complex ( Fig .
2A , lane 3 ) .
The DNA-protein complex was blocked by competition with unlabeled CD28RE ( lanes 4 and 5 ) and an IL-2 receptor a « B oligonucleotide ( lanes 6 and 7 ) , but not by the nonspecific oligonucleotides Spl ( lane 8 ) , tax responsive element ( data not shown ) , or an oligonucleotide corresponding to the silencer region of the interferon y gene ( data not shown ) .
To determine whether the CD28RE is also recognized by NF « B p50 , an EMSA was performed with affinity-purified , bacterially expressed p50 ( a generous gift from R. Roeder , The Rockefeller University ) .
In this assay , labeled IL-2 receptor a « B oligonucleotide was used as a probe while unlabeled CD28RE oligonucleotide was used as a competitor ( Fig .
2B ) .
While the DNA-protein complex was blocked by competition with unlabeled « B oligonucleotide ( lane 2 ) , no competition was observed with the unlabeled CD28RE oligonucleotide ( lane 3 ) .
This result indicates that bacterially expressed NF « B p50 does not recognize the CD28RE sequence .
When an EMSA was performed with NF « B p50 and a labeled CD28RE oligonucleotide , no DNA 1698 Immunology : Ghosh et al .

Recognition of CD28RE by bacterially expressed c-Rel , but not p50 .

A double-stranded *°P-labeled oligonucleotide ( 1 ng ) consisting of the CD28RE site ( AAAGAAATTCCAAAGA ; -164 to -149 ) of the IL-2 gene ( 17 ) was used as a probe .
Competition of the DNA-protein complex was with unlabeled CD28RE oligonucleotide ( lanes 4 and 5 ) , IL-2 receptor a « B site ( GATCAGGGGAATCTCCC ; ref .

protein complex was obtained ( data not shown ) , indicating that the CD28RE can be recognized by bacterial-derived c-Rel but not p50 .
We next characterized the inducible CD28RE-binding protein complex ( CD28RC ) present in nuclear extracts of PMA/ anti-CD28 mAb-treated human peripheral blood T cells ( Fig .
3A , lane 2 ) .
In an EMSA with the CD28RE oligonucleotide , this complex ( CD28RC ) was blocked by competition with unlabeled CD28RE oligonucleotide ( lane 3 ) but not by the mutant oligonucleotide ( lane 4 ) .
This complex was not induced after treatment of cells with anti-CD28 mAb alone , but it was induced ( although to a lesser extent ) by treatment with PMA alone ( data not shown ) .
A similar pattern of induction was observed in T-cell extracts from 10 separate donors .
When a gel-shift analysis was performed with CD28RE using a PMA T-cell nuclear extract , an inducible DNA-protein complex was obtained that was similar to that following PMA treatment alone but in a much reduced level compared to PMA/anti-CD28 mAb treatment ( data not shown ) .
To characterize the inducible protein-DNA complex , UV crosslinking was performed with a bromouridine-substituted Proc .

Three major protein bands were obtained that migrated with molecular masses slightly higher than 85 , 65 , and 50 kDa ( Fig .

To determine whether a physiologically relevant stimulus also can induce these proteins , anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 was used instead of PMA .
A similar result was obtained with a nuclear extract from cells treated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 mAb ( lane 3 ) .
PMA treatment or anti-CD3 mAb treatment alone also induced these proteins , but the level of induction was lower than with PMA/anti-CD28 mAb or anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAb treatment , respectively , just as in EMSA ( data not shown ) .
The effect of anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 mAb treatment of T cells was similar to PMA/anti-CD28 mAb treatment with Immunology : Ghosh et al .

Cotransfection of c-Rel in Jurkat cells augments expression of a CAT plasmid containing four copies of CD28RC-binding site Induction , Constructs -fold pBLCAT2 + pRSVcREL 1 4xCD28RE-CAT + pSRSPA 1 4xCD28RE-CAT + pRSVcREL 6 Jurkat cells were cotransfected by electroporation with 20 ug of reporter plasmid plus 10 ug of expression vector .
Cells were harvested after 48 hr and CAT ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer 's protocol ( Boehringer Mannheim ) .
Results are the average of six different experiments ( range from 4x to 7.2x ) .
Reporter plasmids were 4xCD28RE-CAT , containing four copies of the CD28RE ( one copy , AAAGAAATTCC ) and pBLCAT2 , the parental CAT plasmid ( 20 ) .
Expression plasmids were pRSVcREL , which contains the human REL gene and the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat and pSRSPA , the parental expression vector ( 20 ) .
respect to nuclear translocation of rel family members and induction of CD28RC ( data not shown ) . '
To identify the proteins crosslinked to the CD28RE , the UV-treated samples were boiled in SDS and immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Rel , anti-p65 , and anti-p50 antisera .
The results of this experiment are shown in Fig .
3D .
No protein band was obtained when preimmune serum was used ( lane 2 ) .
The c-Rel antiserum precipitated a protein that migrated slightly slower than c-Rel ( lane 3 ) , consistent with its being bound to the oligonucleotide .
Similarly , p50 ( lane 4 ) and p65 ( lane 5 ) were detected by the anti-p50 and anti-p65 antisera , respectively .
No protein was obtained when an irrelevant antiserum ( HY103 ) was used for immunoprecipitation ( lane 6 ) .
By the same procedure , we also characterized the DNA-protein complex obtained after treatment of T cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAb .
As with the extract from PMA/anti-CD28 mAb-treated cells , c-Rel , p50 , and p65 were present in the CD28RC ( Fig .
3€ , lanes 3-5 ) .
The in vivo significance of the association between CD28RE and c-Rel was tested by cotransfection studies with a c-Rel expression vector and a reporter plasmid containing the CAT gene linked to four copies of CD28RC-binding site .
The core-binding sequence of CD28RE ( -164 to -154 ) was used to construct CD28RE-CAT plasmid .
The result of transient cotransfection into the Jurkat T-cell line is presented in Table 1 .
Cotransfection of c-Rel enhanced reporter gene expression by ~6-fold .
This demonstrates a functional interaction between c-Rel and CD28RE , consistent with the direct interaction observed in UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation experiments .
DISCUSSION These findings strongly suggest that NF « B family proteins are involved in CD28-mediated signaling and play an important role in T-cell gene expression .
We demonstrated that stimulation of normal T cells with a combination of PMA and anti-CD28 mAb results in increased nuclear rel , p65 , and p50 .
Nuclear extracts contained proteins able to bind to the CD28RE , and UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that rel , p65 , and p50 are among these proteins .
Similar results were obtained after stimulation of cells with a combination of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAb .
The functional significance of c-Rel involvement in the CD28RC was demonstrated by transient transfection analysis , where cotransfection of c-rel increased the level of CAT expression through a CD28RE .
These findings confirm an earlier report that signaling via the CD28 molecule is mediated through an NF « B-like element ( 26 , 30 ) .

USA 90 ( 1993 ) 1699 The sequence of the CD28RE , as defined by mutational analysis ( 17 ) , is AAGAAATTCC , which differs at two positions from the consensus « B site GGGRNNYYCC ( 31 ) .
Recently , Kunsch et al .
( 32 ) have used random oligonucleotides and bacterially expressed rel family proteins in binding site selection experiments .
They demonstrated that ho-modimers of rel , p65 , and p50 prefer slightly different binding sites and that rel has the least stringent requirements .
In fact , their consensus rel site NGGNNA/TTTCC differs at only one position from the CD28RE , while the consensus p50 site GGGGATYCCC differs at five positions .
Thus , it is not surprising that our bacterial rel bound CD28RE while purified pS0 did not .
In spite of this lack of p50 binding to the CD28RE , we detected p50 in the CD28RC .
The presence of p50 could be due to a CD28-signaling-specific modification of p50 that allows DNA binding .
Alternatively , p50 may het-erodimerize with rel or p65 and thereby come close enough to the DNA to be crosslinked after UV irradiation .
It should be noted that our experiments do not define which specific homo- or heterodimers bind the CD28RE .
While maximum nuclear translocation and complex induction occurred when PMA was used in conjunction with anti-CD28 mAb , treatment with PMA alone resulted in significant translocation and complex formation .
This is somewhat surprising since PMA alone does not activate T cells .
It is well known , for example , that PMA does not induce IL-2 production .
One possible explanation is that during T-cell purification some of the T cells were preactivated by interaction with B cells containing B7 , the ligand for CD28 .
In these cells , PMA would act as the required second signal and would induce activation .
However , we routinely monitored interferon y , and we found that it was produced when cells were treated with PMA plus anti-CD28 mAb , or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 mAb , but never with PMA alone .
This suggests that nuclear translocation and complex formation in response to PMA alone can not be explained by preactivation of the cells .
There are several other possible explanations .
First , it is possible that nuclear levels of critical proteins do not reach high enough levels in response to PMA and that activation requires the higher levels induced by the second signal .
Such an effect has been documented by Fiering et al .
( 33 ) , who showed that expression controlled by the transcription factor NF-AT requires a certain threshold level of the factor .
A second possibility is that additional , as yet unde-fined , proteins are induced following anti-CD28 mAb treatment and that these proteins are required for active complex formation .
Third , anti-CD28 mAb treatment might result in some type of posttranslational modification of one or all of the CD28RE-binding proteins , resulting in functional complex formation .
A recent report demonstrating CD28-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation supports this hypothesis ( 18 ) .
Recently , Fraser and Weiss ( 34 ) reported that the CD28RC contains three polypeptides of approximately 35 , 36 , and 44 kDa .
There are several differences between our protocol and theirs that could contribute to the different results .
First , they used a T-cell line for their studies , while we used purified peripheral blood T cells .
Second , they stimulated cells for 2 hr , as opposed to 7 hr in our case .
Third , their oligonucleotide was derived from the granulocyte-macrophage/colony-stimulating factor promoter , not the IL-2 promoter , and there are minor differences between them .
Lastly , we , but not they , used a bromouridine-substituted oligonucleotide in the crosslinking studies .
