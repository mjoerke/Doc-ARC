Mitogen Activation of Human Peripheral T Lymphocytes Induces the Formation of New Cyclic AMP Response Element-binding Protein Nuclear Complexes* ( Received for publication , February 9 , 1994 , and in revised form , May 9 , 1994 ) Patrik Wollberg , Henrik Soderqvist , and B .
Dean Nelson } From the Department of Biochemistry , Arrhenius Laboratories , Stockholm University , 8-106 91 Stockholm , Sweden A large body of evidence indicates that experimental agents which raise cellular cAMP levels inhibit T cell growth and division .
By contrast , many studies have reported that mitogen activation of T cells increases cAMP levels , implying a positive physiological role for cAMP in the activation process .
In the present study we demonstrate that mitogen activation of human peripheral T lymphocytes induces nuclear factors that form complexes with cyclic AMP response element-binding protein ( CREB ) .
Four complexes are identified by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay , two of which are induced by mitogen activation .
All four complexes contain CREB and are bound to the cAMP response element ( CRE ) core sequence ( TGACGTCA ) , as indicated by antibody and oligonucleotide competition experiments .
Binding of the four complexes to CRE is prevented by dephosphorylation of nuclear extracts and is restored by rephosphorylation with cAMP-dependent protein kinase or endogenous kinases .
Similar complexes are detected in nuclear extracts of Jurkat cells .
Mitogen induction of the electrophoretic mobility shift assay complexes is not accounted for by protein phosphorylation or by induction of CREB .
Rather , the data indicate that mitogen increases the levels of a nuclear factor ( s ) that dimerizes with CREB .
Induction of new CREB complexes implies a physiological role for cAMP in mitogen activation of T lymphocytes .
The role played by cAMP in the growth and division of T lymphocytes is complex and poorly understood .
A large number of investigations have shown that cyclic AMP analogues , or other experimental agents that elevate intracellular levels of cAMP , inhibit T cell growth and DNA synthesis ( 1-6 ) .
The step in the signal cascade inhibited by cAMP is still disputed .
However , it appears that multiple sites are most likely involved .
Inhibition of early initiation events leading to interleukin-2 production ( 2 , 3 , 8-13 ) , as well as late interleukin-2-dependent events ( 8 , 6 , 7 ) , have been reported .
Recent studies ( 14 , 15 ) implicate cAMP as an inhibitor of the Ras/Rafl growth-activat-ing pathway .
In spite of these many studies demonstrating an inhibitory role of cAMP in T cell growth and division , there is a large body of experimental evidence which shows that mitogen activation induces cellular cAMP levels ( 16-21 ) .
Most of these studies report rapid transitory increases in cAMP upon mitogen stimu-lation , but others report late ( 21 ) , as well as sustained ( 19 ) , increases .
Such findings imply a positive , rather than negative , physiological role for cAMP in cell activation .
They also focus upon the need to differentiate between the potential pharma-cological effects of cAMP and its possible physiological functions in T cell activation .
In the present study we demonstrate that mitogen stimulation of peripheral T lymphocytes induces CRE'-binding complexes not present in non-activated cells .
These complexes all contain CREB but are formed by induction of factors that bind CREB .
Induction of new CREB complexes implies a role for cAMP in the normal physiological regulation of T-lymphocyte activation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture-Human peripheral T-lymphocytes were extracted from the buffy coats of healthy blood donors and purified as previously described ( 22 ) .
Cells ( 2-5 x 10° cells/ml ! )
were grown overnight in RPMI 1640 media containing 15 % fetal calf sera , 60 ug/ml penicillin , 160 ug/ml streptomycin , and 0.3 mg/ml 1-glutamine .
Cells were then cultured an additional 48 h in either the presence or absence of concanava-lin A ( 6 ug/ml ) and the phorbol ester TPA ( 25 ng/ml ) .
Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI media as above .
HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's media containing antibiotics and fetal calf sera as above .
Nuclear Extracts-Nuclear extracts from mitogen-stimulated and non-stimulated peripheral T-lymphocytes were prepared according to Dignam et al .
( 23 ) .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay ( EMSA ) -Nuclear extracts were preincubated on ice for 15 min in 15 mm HEPES , pH 7.9 , 3 mm MgCl , , 4 mm spermidine , 5 % ( v/v ) glycerol , 0.15 mm EDTA , 0.5 ug/ul sheared salmon sperm DNA , 0.1 ug/ul poly ( dI-dC ) , 0.1 ug/ul tRNA , 1 mm dithio-threitol , and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfony ] fluoride .
Double-stranded P-labeled DNA probe ( 30,000-60,000 cpm ) was added alone or together with unlabeled competing oligonucleotides as indicated in the individual figure legends , and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature .
When the experiment included antibody , the antibodies and nuclear extract were incubated on ice for 30 min prior to the addition of olgionucleotide mobility shift probe , DNA binding activity was monitored by the EMSA using 5 % native polyacrylamide gels in 180 mx Tris , pH 8 , 180 my borie acid , 4 mm EDTA , 5 % ( v/v ) glycerol .
Antibodies and Recombinant CREB-Anti-human CREB-1 ( X-12 ) monoclonal antibody ( mouse IgG1 ) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology .
This antibody was raised against a polypeptide encompassing the basic DNA binding domain and part of the dimerization domain ( residues 254-327 ) of the human 43-kDa CREB-1 protein ( 24 ) .
According to the manufacturers , the antibody does not recognize human CREB-2 , ATF1 , ATF2 , ATF3 , or ATFA4 .
Bacterially expressed recombinant rat CREBa ( 25 ) and polyclonal rabbit Ig antibodies against the rat CREBa protein ( 25 ) were kindly provided by Dr. J. Lund , Novum , Huddinge , Sweden .

19719 19720 Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation of Nuclear Extracts-Nuclear extracts were dephosphorylated with potato acid phosphatase ( Boehringer Mannheim ) linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B ( Pharmacia Biotech Inc. ) ( 26 ) .
Equal volumes of sample and gel were incubated in a batch procedure for 1 h at room temperature in 20 mm Tris , pH 7.2 , 1 mm EDTA , 5 % glycerol , and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol .
Aliquots of the supernatants were rephosphorylated upon incubation in the presence or absence of 6 units of the catalytic subunit of porcine cAMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) ( Sigma ) , 10 my Tris , pH 7.5 , 10 mm MgCl , , 1 mm ATP , 1 mu sodium vanadate , 50 mm NaF , and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 30 °C .
Western Blot Analysis of the CREB-1 Protein-10 ug of nuclear extract was separated on 10 % acrylamide by the method of Laemmli ( 27 ) using midget gels .
Blotting was performed using an LKB model 0251 transfer unit .
After blotting , the nitrocellulose filter was stained with Ponceau Red to localize the molecular weight markers .
The membranes were blocked overnight with 0.2 % Tween , 5 % fat-free milk powder , 50 ma phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , and 0.01 % NaN , in PBS .
They were then incubated with monoclonal mouse IgG1 anti human CREB-1 antibodies for 1 h at room temperature , washed four times for 15 min in blocking solution , and incubated for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody ( Dako , Denmark ) .
The bands were visualized using an alkaline phosphatase conjugate substrate kit ( Bio-Rad ) and quantified using a laser densitometer ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
Synthetic Oligonucleotide Probes-The LDHA-CRE oligonucleotide ( 5'-GCTCCCACTCTGACGTCAGCGCGGAGCTT-3 ' ) is from the 5 regulatory region ( nucleotides -59 to -30 ) of the mouse LDHA gene ( 28 ) , and the LDHA control oligonucleotide ( 5'-CCATTTAAGGCCCCGC-CGCGTGCTGCTCT-3 ' ) corresponds to nucleotides -29 to -1 of the mouse LDHA regulatory region .
Other synthetic oligonucleotides contained the AP1 consensus motif ( 5'-CCACTCTGAGTCAGCGCGGAG-3 ' ) , the SP1 consensus motif ( 5'-GCCCGGCCCCGCCCcCcaGcaéGcTCceccC-3 ' ) , the glucocorticoid response element ( 29 ) , the estrogen response element ( 30 ) , or the xenobiotic response element ( 30 ) .
All probes were double-stranded and 5'-end-labeled with [ *PJATP using polynucleotide kinase ( Boehringer Mannheim ) .
RESULTS Nuclear extracts were prepared from peripheral T lymphocytes incubated for 48 h in the presence or absence of mitogen ( concanavalin A and TPA ) .
The extracts were analyzed for CRE-binding proteins by EMSA using an oligonucleotide probe ( LDHA-CRE ) from the 5 ' regulatory region of the mouse LDHA gene ( 28 ) .
LDHA-CRE contains a perfect , palindromic CRE sequence ( 5-TGACGTCA-3 ' ) , which functions within the context of the LDHA gene as a cAMP response element ( 31 , 32 ) .
Two broad bands are formed with LDHA-CRE upon incubation with nuclear extracts from activated T lymphocytes : a low mobility A band and a higher mobility B band .
Both the A and B bands are composed of two separate complexes ( complexes Al and A2 and complexes B1 and B2 , respectively ) , which are not always clearly resolved ( Fig .
1 ) .
Mitogen activation induces complexes A1 and A2 formation .
A weak A2 complex is occasionally observed with nuclear extracts from non-stimulated T cells .
However , the A1 complex is only detected with nuclear lysates from mitogen-activated cells .
To demonstrate that CREB ( see Refs .
33 and 34 for review ) binds to LDHA-CRE , a series of oligonucleotide competition experiments were conducted .
The experiment in Fig .
2 shows that the LDHA-CRE oligonucleotide competes more efficiently ( Fig .
2A ) than the AP1 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
2B ) for binding to the labeled LDHA-CRE probe .
The binding elements in API ( TGAGTCA ) and LDHA-CRE ( TGACGTCA ) differ by a single nucleotide , providing strong evidence that CREB or a CREB-related protein binds LDHA-CRE .
The results in Fig .
2 also indicate that all four complexes contain a core CREB or CREB-related protein bound at the CRE site .
However , more competitor LDHA-CRE is required to inhibit A1 and A2 formation than to inhibit B1 and B2 formation ( Fig .
24 ) .
This data indicates either that A1 and A2 are present in nuclear extracts of activated cells in higher amounts than the B complexes or that the B complexes have a higher affinity for LDHA-CRE .

Mitogen activation of peripheral T lymphocytes induces additional nuclear CRE binding activity .
Peripheral human T lymphocytes were incubated 48 h in the presence ( + ) or absence ( - ) of mitogen ( concanavalin A and TPA ) .
Nuclear lysates were tested for CRE binding activity by EMSA .
A synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide from the mouse gene LDHA-CRE containing a functional cyclie AMP response element ( TGACGTCA ) was used as the probe .
Four complexes , designated A1 , A2 , B1 , and B2 , were formed in mitogen-treated cells .
Only complexes B1 and B2 were present in the nuclear extract from non-stimulated cells .
Gel shift assays were performed as described under `` Materials and Methods . ``
40 ug of protein was loaded in each well .
To further establish the CRE specificity of the DNA-binding protein , the converse EMSA competition experiments were con-ducted , i.e .
the AP1 oligonucleotide was used as the probe .
Nuclear extracts from non-activated T-lymphocytes formed a weak A2 complex with the AP1 oligonucleotide , whereas stronger A1 and A2 complexes were formed with nuclear extracts from mitogen-activated cells ( Fig .
2 , C and D ) .
However , all complexes were competed more efficiently by LDHA-CRE ( Fig .
2C ) than by the AP1 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
2D ) .
B1 and B2 complexes were not detected with the AP1 oligonucleotide as probe .
These experiments support the conclusion that a CREB-related factor participates in formation of all four complexes .
They also confirm published studies indicating that CREB can form weak complexes with the AP1 element ( 35 ) .
Competition experiments were also carried out using competitor oligonucleotides bearing the glucocorticosteroid response element ( 29 ) , the xenobiotic response element ( 30 ) , estrogen receptor element ( 30 ) , a single Sp1 site ( CCGCCC ) , or a control sequence immediately 3 ' of the LDHA-CRE region in the LDH-A gene ( 28 ) .
None of these oligonuceotides competed with LDHA-CRE , even at high molar excess ratios ( 500-fold , not shown ) .
The above oligonucleotides were also used as EMSA probes , and although complexes were formed with T lymphocyte nuclear extracts , none were competed out by unlabeled LDHA-CRE .
To confirm that the A and B complexes contained CREB , we used a monoclonal antibody specific for the human 43-kDa CREB-1 protein that was directed against the DNA binding domain ( residues 254-327 ) .
Fig .
3 shows a titration of lymphocyte nuclear extracts with antibody .
The monoclonal antibody abolished complex formation with nuclear extracts from both non-stimulated and mitogen-stimulated cells .
The same result was obtained with polyclonal antibodies against rat CREBa « ( 25 ) ( Fig .
4 ) .
These results show that the CREB-1 protein is a component of all four EMSA complexes formed on LDHA-CRE .

The T lymphocyte nuclear binding activity is specific for CRE .
Nuclear lysates were prepared from peripheral T lymphocytes incubated 48 h in the absence or presence of mitogen .
EMSA was performed with LDHA-CRE ( A and B ) or AP1 oligonucleotide ( C and D ) as the labeled probe .
Competitor oligonucleotides ( A and C : LDHA-CRE , 5-GCTCCCACTCTGACGTCAGCGCGGAGCTT-3 ' ; B and D : AP1 , 5'-CCACTCT-GAGTCAGCGCGGAG-3 ' ) , were added in molar excess as indicated in the figure .

Human CREB-1 monoclonal antibody inhibits protein binding to LDHA-CRE .
Human CREB-1 monoclonal antibodies ( 0 , 2 , 4 , or 6 ug ) were incubated with nuclear extracts ( 40 ug ) from mitogen-activated and non-activated peripheral T lymphocytes for 30 min prior to adding the LDHA-CRE mobility shift probe .
EMSA was carried out as described under `` Materials and Methods . ``
Furthermore , since the antibody is directed against the DNA binding domain , the experiments provide strong evidence that CREB is the core DNA-binding component of each complex .
The nuclear extracts in the experiments in Figs .
3 and 4 were preincubated with antibody prior to adding the oligonucleotide probe .
Experiments performed the other way around , i.e .
where protein-DNA complexes were formed prior to adding antibody , also resulted in complete inhibition of protein binding to LDHA-CRE .
Thus , the antibody is able to dissociate preformed CRE-protein complexes .
These effects of antibody were not mimicked by preimmune sera ( Fig .
4B ) .
Finally , the idea that CREB in each complex is anchored to CRE is strengthened by the experiment in Fig .
4A .
This experiment shows that recombinant rat CREBa « binds to LDHA-CRE , and as with lymphocyte nuclear extracts , antibodies against rat CREBa prevent binding .
To determine if mitogen induction of the A1 and A2 complexes can be accounted for by an increase in CREB , Western blots were done using the monoclonal human CREB-1 antibody .
Fig .
5 shows a Western analysis of CREB in nuclear extracts of non-stimulated and stimulated peripheral T-lymphocytes .
Laser densitometric analysis revealed a slight increase ( maxi-mum 42 % ) of CREB upon mitogen stimulation .
This increase is surprisingly small when compared to those observed for housekeeping proteins upon induction by mitogen ( 36 ) .
We therefore conclude that CREB is present in relatively constant amounts throughout the lymphocyte cell cycle and probably does not account for formation of the additional A1 and A2 complexes .
Phosphorylation of CREB promotes both homodimerization ( 37 ) and heterodimerization ( 38-42 ) .

CREB was detected by secondary antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase .
Molecular weight markers are shown to the right .
plays a role in the formation of the A1 and A2 complexes , nuclear extracts were dephosphorylated with acid phosphatase .
Fig .
6 shows that phosphatase treatment of nuclear extracts from both non-activated and mitogen-activated cells strongly inhibits all CREB binding to LDHA-CRE .
However , formation of all four complexes was restored upon rephosphorylation of these nuclear extracts with the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase .
Incubation of dephosphorylated nuclear extracts with ATP alone also resulted in a weak restoration of binding activity , presumably due to endogenous kinase activity .
This result shows that formation of all four EMSA complexes on LDHA-CRE requires phosphorylation , presumably of CREB .
It is important to note , however , that complexes A1 and A2 are not induced in nuclear extracts from non-stimulated cells by phosphorylation with either exogenous PKA or endogenous kinases ( Fig .
6 ) .
Induction of complexes A1 and A2 therefore must be due to expression of new nuclear factors that het-erodimerize with CREB , rather than to a phosphorylation-dependent heterodimerization .
To determine if the nuclear CRE-binding factor induced in peripheral lymphocytes is also present in transformed T cells , we prepared nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells .
These extracts form mobility shift complexes with LDHA-CRE , which have - Mitogen + Mitogen [ - 11 1 Phosphatase = + +o + = % : ATP = = +o + = = + PKA = - £ % = = £ i= A-A2 -- B1 -- Ba- Fic .

Rephosphorylation of the extracts with exogenous PKA or endogenous kinases fully or partially restored the individual complexes ( Fig .

Nuclear extracts from HepG2 hepatoma cells also contained CRE binding activity , which was dependent upon phosphorylation ( Fig .
8 ) .
However , the low mobility complex I was barely detectable in HepG2 cells , raising the possibility that the inducible CREB dimerization partner is a lymphoid cell-specific nuclear factor .
DISCUSSION In the present study we demonstrate the induction of nuclear CRE binding activity in mitogen-activated peripheral T lymphocytes .
Four CRE-binding complexes are detected in T cell 19723 nuclear extracts by the mobility retardation assay .
Two of these complexes ( with highest mobilities ) are present in non-activated cells , whereas all four are usually present in mitogen-activated cells .
CRE binding activity similar to that in activated T lymphocytes is also detected in nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells , suggesting a possible relationship to growth activation .
All four gel shift complexes bind specifically to a synthetic oligonucleotide containing a palindromic cAMP response element , TGACGTCA .
Thus , each complex contains a core CRE-binding protein .
A number of CRE-binding proteins have been identified , including CREB ( 43 , 44 ) , CREB-2 ( 45 ) , CREM ( 46 ) , members of the ATF family ( 33 ) , CRE-BP ( 47 ) , and mXBP ( 48 ) .
We do not presently know which of these are present in peripheral T cells .
However , our studies based on antibody experiments suggest that the 43-kDa CREB-1 protein is present in all four complexes .
If so , the four CREB-1-containing complexes can only be formed through heterodimerization ( 35 , 42 , 48 ) , and CREB-1 must be the common component in each complex .
This finding , together with the effects of phosphorylation ( see be-low ) , implies that CREB-1 anchors the multimer complexes to CRE .
However , the possibility must also be considered that some of these complexes are homodimers of new members of the CREB/ATF family which cross-react with the monoclonal antibody .
CREB dimerization ( 37 ) and binding to CRE ( 49 ) are enhanced by CREB phosphorylation .
The present studies support this view .
Dephosphorylation of lymphocyte , Jurkat , and HepG2 cell nuclear extracts abolished formation of gel retardation complexes with LDHA-CRE , and rephosphorylation of the extracts with PKA or with endogenous nuclear protein kinases restored binding .
These results , together with our antibody studies , indicate that all four nuclear complexes in mitogen-activated lymphocytes are either homodimers or heterodimers of CREB that are phosphorylated in vivo .
Strong rephosphorylation of the complexes by PKA suggests that the PKA site on CREB is responsible for re-establishing CRE binding properties .
Although induction of additional gel retardation complexes by mitogen activation might be explained by the phosphorylation of existing transfactors ( 50 ) , our results show that phosphorylation does not account for formation of the A1 and A2 complexes .
Nuclear extracts from non-activated cells do not form these complexes after phosphorylation with PKA or endogenous kinases .
Furthermore , Western blot analysis shows that the CREB is present at relatively constant levels during T cell growth and activation .
Thus , our data strongly imply that mi-togens increase a new nuclear factor ( s ) that dimerizes with CREB .
This factor could be transported from the cytosol upon phosphorylation , or its synthesis could be induced .
With regard to the latter , a number of potential dimer combinations , such as CREB/CREM ( 46 ) and ATF-1/Jun-Fos ( 35 ) , have been demon-strated .
In addition , several T cell-specific CRE-binding proteins have been identified that retain dimerization domains similar to those in CREB , c-Jun , c-Fos , and CRE-BP ( 35 , 46 ) .
Thus , a broad spectrum of potential CRE binding complexes are available in T cells , and the identity of the inducible factor remains to be studied .
The presence of new CREB complexes in activated peripheral T cells and Jurkat cells further implicates cAMP in T cell growth processes , although its exact role is complicated and far from understood .
On one hand , experimental manipulations that raise cellular cAMP levels inhibit interleukin-2 production and DNA synthesis , while , on the other hand , several reports have demonstrated that mitogen activation of T cells is associated with increased cellular levels of cAMP ( see Introduction 19724 for review ) .
A positive role for cAMP in cell growth would not be surprising in view of the large number of housekeeping genes that are regulated through cAMP response elements ( 51 ) .
However , whether the mitogen-induced CREB complexes function in lymphocytes as gene activators , suppressors , or both remains an open question .
Both functions have been assigned to CREB ( 39 ) and other CRE-related proteins ( 45 , 46 ) .
Identification and further characterization of the inducible CREB dimerization partners reported here should provide some insight into the role of cAMP in T cell growth and activation .
Finally , the present demonstration that both human and rat CREB binds specifically to the LDHA-CRE oligonucleotide supports and extends earlier findings that the LDH-A gene contains a functional cAMP response element ( 31 , 32 ) .
