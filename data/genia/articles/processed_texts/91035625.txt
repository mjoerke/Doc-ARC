Adherence is an important initial step in the transition of a circulating monocyte to a tissue macrophage .
This differentiation is accompanied by an augmented capacity to generate growth factors .
We hypothesized that adherence itself might be an important trigger for a sequence of gene activation culminating in cells with increased mRNA encoding profibrotic growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor B subunit ( PDGF { [ B ] ) and transforming growth ( TGF- ) .
After in vitro adherence , human monocytes had a biphasic increase in PDGF ( B ) mRNA with peaks at 6 h and 13 d. No increase in mRNA was observed .
The 6-h increase in PDGF ( B ) mRNA was adherence dependent , and in addition , was abrogated when the cytoskeletal integrity was compromised by cytochalasin D. The 6-h increase in PDGF ( B ) mRNA was unaltered by adherence in the presence of the monocyte stimulus lipopolysaccharide .
Adherence to either fibronectin or collagen-coated plastic had little consistent effect on PDGF ( B ) mRNA accumulation .
The increased PDGF ( B ) mRNA observed in adherent monocytes was accompanied by increases in mRNAs of the early growth response genes c-fos ( maximal at 20 min ) , c-jun , and EGR2 ( maximal at 6-24 h ) .
The increase in c-jun and EGR2 , but not c-fos , mRNA was also abrogated by cytochalasin D. These observations suggest that adherence results in increases of c-fos , c-jun , EGR2 , and PDGF ( B ) mRNA .
In addition , the increases in c-jun , EGR2 , and PDGF ( B ) may depend on cytoskeletal rearrangement .
Modulation of these events at the time of adherence offers a mechanism by which differential priming of the cells may be accomplished .
is a prerequisite for peripheral blood monocyte mi gration into injured tissues .
Here the monocyte undergoes differentiation into a tissue macrophage .
Monocyte adherence results in activation of the genes c-fos , TNF- « x , and CSF-1 , but not HLA-DR-a & ( Haskill et al .
, 1988 ) .
Thus , adherence may initiate a macrophage differentiation pathway by priming macrophages for later cytokine production .
The macrophage is believed to play an important role in orchestrating the fibrotic response as it occurs in wound healing or in the pathological circumstances of pulmonary fibrosis ( Crystal et al .
, 1984 ; Rappolee et al .
, 1988 ) .
For the present studies we have focused on two profibrotic cytokines produced by macrophages : PDGF and transforming growth factor 3 ( Shimokado et al .
, 1985 ; Assoian et al .
, 1987 ) .

PDGF can be a homodimer of A chains or B chains or a heterodimer of A and B chains ; however , fibroblasts appear to have more receptors for molecules containing the B chain ( Hosang et al .
, 1989 ) .
Therefore , molecules containing the B chain are the more potent fibroblast mitogens ( Beckman et al .
, 1988 ) , chemoattractants ( Nister et al .
, 1988 ) , and agonists for fibroblast-mediated contraction of collagen gels ( Clark et al .
, 1989 ) .
Recombinant PDGF ( B ) homodimer has also been shown to promote wound healing in vivo ( Pierce et al .
, 1988 ) .
The B subunit ( PDGF [ B ] ) is encoded by the c-sis pro-tooncogene , and the mRNA is expressed in human alveolar macrophages , in macrophages derived from monocytes cultured in vitro for 10-14 d ( Mornex et al .
, 1986 ) , and after differentiation of human cell lines to macrophage-like cells ( Pantazis et al .
, 1986 ) .
The alveolar macrophage PDGF ( B ) mRNA is elevated in some patients with interstitial lung disease ( Shaw , R. J. , R. A. F. Clark , S. H. Benedict , and T. E. King Jr. , manuscript submitted for publication ) along with an increased PDGF production ( Martinet et al .
, 1987 ) .
Sim-ilarly , in systemic sclerosis , the skin macrophages have increased PDGF ( B ) mRNA ( Olsen and Uitto , 1989 ) and increased cytoplasmic PDGF protein ( Gay et al .
, 1989 ) .
2139 TGF- promotes wound repair in rat model systems ( Sporn et al .
, 1983 ; Lawrence et al .
, 1986 ; Mustoe et al .
, 1987 ) and induces fibrosis when injected into newborn mice ( Roberts et al .
, 1986 ) .
The potential role of TGF- as an en-dogenous mediator of fibroplasia is further supported by in vitro studies showing that the purified growth factor stimulates collagen and fibronectin production in cultures of some mesenchymal cells including dermal ( Roberts et al .
, 1986 ; Ignotz and Massague , 1986 ) and lung ( Fine and Goldstein , 1987 ; Raghu et al .
, 1989 ) fibroblasts .
In previous studies on macrophage differentiation of the human promyelocytic cell HL6O ( Shaw , R. J. , R. A. F. Clark , V. P. Sukhatme , A. G. Ritter , P. A. Campbell , and S. H. Benedict , manuscript submitted for publication ) , we found evidence that HLA-DR- « and PDGF ( B ) genes were not coordinately regulated , and that increases in PDGF ( B ) mRNA were preceded by increases in c-fos , c-jun , and EGR2 mRNAs , which encode proteins that may potentially regulate gene activation ( Benedict and Chan , 1990 ) .
Haskill et al .
( 1988 ) found that adherence increased c-fos but not HLA-DR- « mRNA .
Human monocytes differentiate in vitro in the presence of serum to macrophages ( Musson , 1983 ) , and we used this system to ask whether PDGF ( B ) mRNA accumulation occurred during the early stages of macrophage differentiation , and whether it was associated with increases in c-jun and EGR2 mRNAs as well as c-fos mRNA .
Our results suggest that monocyte to macrophage differentiation involves a series of events including adherence , c-fos gene activation , cytoskeletal rearrangement , and c-jun , EGR2 , and PDGF ( B ) mRNA accumulation .
Materials and Methods Isolation of Monocytes Human peripheral blood monocytes ( > 92 % pure , > 85 % yield ) were isolated by a combination of plasma-Percoll density gradients ( Haslett et al .
, 1985 ) and counterflow centrifugation-cell elutriation in the absence of an adherence step using a J2-21 centrifuge equipped with a stroke rpm JE-6B elutriator rotor ( Beckman Instruments , Inc. , Fullerton , CA ) ( Doherty et al .
, 1987 ) .
This system was sterile and without significant lipopolysaccha-ride ( LPS ) contamination .
It utilized Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer , pH 7.2 , made from salts purchased from Malinckrodt Inc. ( St. Louis , MO ) supplemented with 0.2 % dextrose ( diluted from 0.5 % dextrose in 0.2 % sodium chloride ; Abbott Laboratories , Irving , TX ) .
Cells were suspended in medium 199 ( Gibco Laboratories , Grand Island , NY ) supplemented with 5 % autologous serum , glutamine , penicillin , and streptomycin ( Irvine Scientific , Santa Ana , CA ) , and allowed to adhere at 37°C in 100-mm tissue culture plates ( Becton Dickinson , Lincoln Park , NJ ) .
In some experiments dishes were coated with collagen ( Collagen Corp. , Palo Alto , CA ) or fibronectin ( New York Blood Center , New York ) with nonspecific binding sites blocked by the further addition of LPS-free human serum albumin ( Calbiochem-Behring Corp. , San Diego , CA ) .
LPS from Escherichia coli O111 : B4 ( List Biologicals , CA ) and cytochalasin D ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) were added , as indicated , to the culture at the same time as the cells .
Nonadherent cells were maintained in rotating 50-ml polypro-pylene tubes ( Becton Dickinson ) at 37°C .
Since these studies examined the effects of LPS on gene activation in monocytes , scrupulous attention was paid to avoiding LPS contamination of the cells during preparation and culture .
Accordingly , all reagents were tested by the Limulus Amoebocyte assay kit ( Associates of Cape Cod , Woods Hole , MA ) , and at the concentrations of reagents used in these experiments the final culture and stimulation mixtures contained < 0.01 ng/ml LPS .
Isolation of RNA The adherent cells were lysed by suspension in guanidinium isothiocyanate solution , containing 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate ( Boehringer Mann The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 111 , 1990 heim Biochemicals , Indianapolis , IN ) , 25 mM sodium citrate , pH 7.0 , 17 mM sodium N-laurylsarcosine , 0.14 M 2-mercaptocthanol ( Sigma Chemical Co. ) .
The RNA was separated by centrifugation through a 5.7 M cesium chloride ( Bethesda Research Laboratories , Gaithersburg , MD ) cushion at 35,000 rpm overnight using an L8-80 ultracentrifuge and SW-55 rotor ( Beckman Instruments , Inc. ) ( Glisin et al .
, 1974 ; Chirgwin et al .
, 1979 ) .
The pellet was washed in 70 % ethanol and the RNA suspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate ( Sigma Chemical Co. ) -treated water , further extracted with phenol/chloroform , resuspended in 0.15 M Na acetate , and stored at -20°C in 70 % ethanol .
The RNA was harvested by centrifugation ( 12,000 g ) at 4°C for 30 min .
RNA Gel ( Northern ) Analysis The RNA was suspended in sample buffer ( 65 % deionized formamide , 15 % formaldehyde , 0.05 M 3- [ N-morpholino ] propanesulfonic acid [ Sigma Chemical Co. ] ) .
RNA ( 15 ug/well ) was electrophoresed through an agarose/formaldehyde gel ( Maniatis et al .
, 1982 ) and blotted onto a nylon membrane ( Zeta-Probe ; Bio-Rad Laboratories , Richmond , CA ) , which was then baked at 80°C for 2 h. In all cases , the amounts of RNA loaded were shown to be the same in each experiment by staining the gel with ethidium bromide and photography under UV light .
Before hybridization , the membranes were prehybridized at 42°C for 24 h in 10 % Denhardt 's solution ( 0.2 % Ficoll , 0.2 % polyvinylpyrrolidone , 0.2 % BSA ) , 5x SSC ( 0.75 M sodium chloride , 0.075 M sodium citrate ) , 50 mM Na ; HPO , , 2 % SDS , 45 % formamide , and 0.5 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA .
Blots were then hybridized at 42°C for 24 h , with probes labeled by the random primer procedure using ( « -*P ) dCTP ( Amersham Corp. , Arlington Heights , IL ) ( Feinberg and Vogelstein , 1983 ) .
Specific activities of probes were ~10° cpm/ug DNA .
The membranes were washed four times with 2x SSC , 0.1 % SDS at 22°C , followed by two washes with 0.2 % SSC , 0.1 % SDS at 65°C for 30 min , before autoradiography with exposures of 18 ( c-fos , c-jun , and EGR2 ) and 72 h ( PDGF [ B ] ) .
The relative intensity of the bands was compared by scanning densitometry using a DU-65 spectrophotometer with Gelscan program ( Beckman Instruments , Inc. ) .
To eliminate any effect of differences in cells from different donors or in hybridization efficiency between experiments , all experiments were related to an internal control which was the mRNA abundance 6 h after adherence for all genes except c-fos when the 20-min post-adherence value was chosen .
These points were included in all experiments and ascribed the 100 % value .
DNA Probes The human DNA probes used were a 0.75-kb Eco RI c-sis fragment ( gift of M. Murray , ZymoGenetics , Seattle , WA ) , a 1.65-kb Eco RI TGF-6 fragment ( gift of A. Purchio , Oncogen , Seattle , WA ) , a 1.9-kb Nae I c-fos fragment ( ATCC 41046 ) , a 1.5-kb Hind III-Eco RI c-jun fragment ( gift of M. Karin , University of California , San Diego , CA ) , a 0.6-kb Hind III-Eco RI EGR2 fragment ( gift of V. P. Sukhatme , University of Chicago , Chicago , IL ) , and a 3.1-kb Eco RI HLA-DR a fragment ( gift of S. Weissman , Yale University , New Haven , CT ) .
In all cases , probe specificity was high , with the approximate sizes of the mRNA , as assessed in relation to the 285 ( 4.7-kb ) and 188 ( 1.9-kb ) ribosomal RNA , of 3.8 kb for PDGF ( B ) , 2.4 kb for TGF-8 , 3.5 kb for EGR2 , 3.0 kb for c-jun , 2.2 kb for c-fos , and 0.76 kb for HLA-DR- « .
Results Monocyte Adherence Was Accompanied by an Increase in PDGF ( B ) , but Not TGF- mRNA Fresh peripheral blood monocytes had little or no constitutive PDGF ( B ) mRNA , but upon incubation under adherent conditions had a biphasic increase in PDGF ( B ) mRNA ( Fig .
1 a ) .
Pooled data from multiple experiments were compared and expressed as percent of the 6-h post-adherence values .
The biphasic increase in PDGF ( B ) mRNA commenced at 1 h , was maximal at 6 h , decreased by 24 h , and then gradually increased again to 50 % of the 6-h value by 13 d. Fresh peripheral blood monocytes had a substantial but variable amount of TGF- # mRNA , which tended to decrease when monocytes were cultured on plastic ( Fig .

The inset in the left panel of Fig .
2 shows that the early ( 6-h ) increase in PDGF ( B ) mRNA was dependent on adherence , as it was not observed in cells incubated for 6 h in the same medium but under nonadherent conditions .
Furthermore , when pooled data from six experiments was compared , monocytes incubated under nonadherent conditions had only 21 % of the PDGF ( B ) mRNA of cells cultured under adherent conditions ( Fig .
2 , left ) .
Thus , the first phase of the biphasic increase in PDGF ( B ) mRNA in monocytes undergoing differentiation to macrophages was dependent on adherence .
In contrast , the relative amount of TGF- mRNA observed when isolated monocytes were cultured on plastic was not substantially altered when monocytes were incubated under nonadherent conditions ( Fig .
2 , right ) .
Modulation of the Adherence-dependent Increase in PDGF ( B ) mRNA The adherence-dependent increase in monocyte PDGF ( B ) mRNA was diminished threefold when cytochalasin D ( 2 ug/ ml ) , an inhibitor of cytoskeletal rearrangement , was present during the 6-h culture under adherent conditions ( Fig .
3 , a and b ) .
The cytochalasin D did not alter the number of cells adhering to the plastic ( Table I ) .
Adherence to plastic previously coated with fibronectin ( Fn ) resulted in a small and variable increase of < 50 % in PDGF ( B ) mRNA when compared to adherence to plastic The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 111 , 1990 Collagen Figure 3 .

Adherence to collagen-coated plastic or to noncoated plastic in the presence of 1 ug/ml of LPS did not alter the adherence-dependent increase in PDGF ( B ) mRNA observed at 6 h. Fn and collagen-coated plastic as well as LPS caused a modest increase in the percent of adherent monocytes ( Table ID ) .
mRNAs of Early Growth Response Genes Increase during Monocyte Adherence and Differentiation Many early growth response proteins bind DNA and regulate gene expression .
It was of interest to examine whether certain early growth response mRNAs accumulated in association with adherence stimulated PDGF ( B ) mRNA .
Immediately after elutriation and before culture , there was variable constitutive expression of c-fos and c-jun but not EGR2 mRNA ( data not shown ) .
During monocyte adherence in culture there were initially high levels of c-fos mRNA maxi- Table I.

mal at 20 min , which decreased at 6 h , increased slightly at 24 h , and then declined at 6 and 13 d ( Fig .

There were variable constitutive levels of c-jun mRNA in monocytes .
After adherence in culture there was an increase in c-jun mRNA expression as early as 20 min in some experiments but consistently by 6 h to levels sustained at 24 h. The abundance of c-jun mRNA at 6 and 13 d was also variable but was in general sustained at high levels .
EGR2 mRNA was constitutively present at very low levels in monocytes , but was increased at 6 h with a maximum at 24 h , and declined to levels slightly above background at 6 and 13 d. Dependence of c-fos mRNA Increase on Adherence At the end of the elutriation , when the monocytes were suspended in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer , the cells already contained high levels of c-fos mRNA ( Fig .
5 a , first lane ) .
Shaw et al .
Monocyte Adherence Induces PDGF But Not TGF mRNA When the cells were suspended in culture medium containing autologous serum , and incubated for 20 min , there were high levels of c-fos when cultured under adherent conditions ( Fig .

5 a , third lane ) .
The high levels of c-fos mRNA observed under adherent conditions at 20 min had declined by 60 min ( Fig .
5 a , fourth lane ) .
Thus adherence induced a brief but intense increase in the level of c-fos mRNA .
This was confirmed when cells were incubated under nonadherent conditions for 6 h and then divided such that one aliquot was allowed to adhere for 20 min , while the other aliquot was maintained under nonadherent conditions for an additional 20 min .
In these experiments cells were also found to be capable of an increase in c-fos mRNA in response to adherence .
Cells cultured under continued nonadherent conditions showed no such increase ( Fig .

presence of cytochalasin D diminished the increase of c-jun and EGR2 mRNA by two- and fourfold , respectively .
Relationship of c-jun and EGR2 mRNA Increase to Receptor Stimulation We next determined whether the abundance of c-jun and EGR2 mRNA was modulated by Fn , collagen , or LPS .
When cells adhered to Fn or collagen-coated plastic , the abundance of c-jun was only 60 and 48 % , respectively , of that observed when cells adhered to plastic alone ( Fig .
7 , a and b ) .
EGR2 mRNA in cells adhering to Fn and collagen-coated plates was 22 and 20 % of that observed during adherence to plastic alone ( i.e .
, a four- and fivefold reduction ) .
Adherence in the presence of LPS increased the abundance of c-jun mRNA , but decreased EGR2 mRNA abundance .
Thus c-jun , EGR2 , and PDGF ( B ) genes were apparently not under coordinate control in the early adherence-dependent stages of monocyte differentiation to macrophages .
HLA-DR- « mRNA Was Unaffected by Adherence The abundance of HLA-DR- « mRNA served as a control for the effects of adherence , and similar levels were observed in monocytes cultured for 6 h under adherent conditions alone , in the presence of cytochalasin D , or under nonadherent conditions ( Fig .
8 ) .
Thus , the changes in PDGF ( B ) , c-fos , c-jun , and EGR2 mRNA were not reflected by all other mRNA species .
Discussion Biphasic Increase in PDGF ( B ) mRNA during Differentiation of Monocytes to Macrophages The presence of PDGF ( B ) mRNA is indicative of the cell 's Shaw et al .
Monocyte Adkerence Induces PDGF But Not TGFG mRNA commitment to the first stage of growth factor production .
Accumulation of PDGF ( B ) mRNA renders the cell primed to respond to subsequent triggers by completing translation and secretion of PDGF in a similar manner to that described for TNF- « ( Haskill et al .
, 1988 ) .
Such multiple levels of control are suggested by the observation that PDGF ( B ) mRNA is not directly correlated with the release of PDGF protein ( Durga Rao et al , 1988 ) .
The biphasic increase in PDGF ( B ) mRNA in monocytes as they differentiate to macrophages indicates the complexity of this priming process ( Fig .
1 ) .
To further underscore the complexity of the situa-tion , mRNA is expressed constitutively in circulating monocytes suggesting that monocyte TGF- activity is primarily controlled at the translational or posttranslational level ( Lyons et al .
, 1988 ; Miyazono and Heldin , 1989 ) .
The timing of the biphasic increase in PDGF ( B ) mRNA in differentiating monocytes with maximal increases at 6 h and 13 d , roughly correlates with the increases in fibroblast activity in wounds ( Welch et al .
, 1990 ) .
Fibroblast proliferation and influx , which require fibroblast mitogenic and chemotactic factors such as PDGF ( B ) , occur during the first few days after injury , whereas wound contraction , mediated at least in part by PDGF ( B ) ( Clark et al .
, 1989 ) occurs during the second week after injury .
Our experiments do not distinguish between a biphasic response within all the cells or the possibility of two responding populations .
The present study demonstrated that the initial increase in PDGF ( B ) mRNA was dependent on adherence ( Fig .
2 ) , was inhibited by cytochalasin D ( Fig .
3 ) , and was accompanied by increases in the mRNA of the early growth response genes c-fos , c-jun , and EGR2 ( see Fig .
4 ) .
Cytochalasin D at doses sufficient to disrupt cytoskeletal integrity ( Schliwa , 1982 ) had no effect on the c-fos mRNA accumulation while at the same time c-jun , EGR2 , and PDGF ( B ) mRNA were reduced by as much as 75 % .

ous studies in which c-fos , EGR2 , c-jun , and PDGF ( B ) mRNAs are increased during differentiation of HL6O cells to macrophage-like cells ( Shaw , R. J. , R. A. F. Clark , V. P. Sukhatme , A. G. Ritter , P. A. Campbell , and S. H. Benedict , manuscript submitted for publication ) , lead to the speculation that a specific pattern of gene activation occurs during the early phase of monocyte differentiation .
In this scenario , adherence would be followed by c-fos mRNA accumulation , cytoskeletal rearrangement , and later by increases in c-jun , EGR2 , and PDGF ( B ) mRNA .
Interrelationship between Adherence , Cytoskeletal Integrity , and mRNA Accumulation The sequence of events just described suggests that physical changes to the cell may either initiate gene activation or cause stabilization of preformed mRNAs .
The precedent for adherence-dependent mRNA accumulation in monocytes was established for c-fos , CSF-1 , and TNF-a by Haskill et al .
( 1988 ) .
Dependence of mRNA levels on cytoskeletal integrity has not been previously observed in monocytes but a relationship between the cytoskeleton and mRNA accumulation is recognized in other cell systems ( for reviews see Ben-Ze'ev , 1987 ; Bissel and Barcellas-Hoff , 1987 ) .
The first PDGF ( B ) mRNA increase was maximal at 6 h. This coincided with a time when the cells had completed adherence ( Horsburgh et al .
, 1987 ) , but before spreading of the cells with the development of cytoplasmic protrusions ( our unpublished observations } .
More complete reorganization of the cytoskeleton elements occurs during the transition of The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 111 , 1990 monocytes to macrophages over the course of one week ( Lehto et al .
, 1982 ) .
The role of these later morphological changes in modulating PDGF ( B ) mRNA accumulation is the subject of further study .
It is also possible that PDGF has an autocrine effect altering cytoskeletal elements as occurs in fibroblasts ( Herman and Pledger , 1985 ; Nister et al .
, 1988 ) .
The early ( 6-h ) rise in PDGF ( B ) mRNA was a direct consequence of adherence and dependent on cytoskeletal integrity ( Figs .
2 and 3 ) .
Although the enhancement in the presence of Fn was only modest ( Fig .
3 and Table I ) , Fn has been previously reported to increase monocyte adherence ( Bevilacqua et al .
, 1981 ; Horsburgh et al .
, 1987 ) and to induce collagenase and stromelysin gene expression in fibroblasts ( Werb et al .
, 1989 ) .
It was largely unaffected , however , by concurrent stimulation of the cells by collagen or LPS ( Fig .
3 ) , even though it is known that LPS accelerates monocyte adherence ( Doherty et al .
, 1989 ) .
These factors did , however , modify the amount of mRNA encoding the three early response genes ( Fig .
7 ) .
This mRNA modulation could not be explained by the small increase in the percent of cells which were adherent in the presence of these stimuli ( Table 1 ) , as this did not affect the adherence-dependent increase in PDGF ( B ) mRNA .
Thus , the present study suggests that PDGF ( B ) mRNA and mRNA of the three early growth response genes are not coordinately regulated .
This does not rule out , however , a complex interaction between the early growth response elements and later PDGF ( B ) mRNA accumulation .
Role of Early Growth Response Proteins in Differentiation of Monocytes to Macrophages Fos protein forms a DNA-binding complex with the protein encoded by the jun/API ( c-jun ) gene ( Sassone-Corsi et al .
, 1988a , b ) and may modulate transcription of other genes ( Setoyama et al .
, 1986 ) .
A third gene , EGR2 , encodes a protein with `` zinc finger `` structure , a characteristic suggestive of DNA-binding capability ( Joseph et al .
, 1988 ) .
Activation of c-fos has been implicated in macrophage differentiation as it occurs in human cell lines induced to differentiate to macrophage-like cells ( Muller et al .
, 1984 , 1985 ; Mitchell et al .
, 1985 ) .
In previous studies on the human promyelocytic cell line HLG6O0 , we identified specific sequences of mRNA accumulation during differentiation to macrophage-like cells ( Shaw , R. J. , R. A. F. Clark , V. P. Sukhatme , A. G. Ritter , P. A. Campbell , and S. H. Benedict , manuscript submitted for publication ) .
There were differentiation pathway , specific increases in mRNA encoding c-fos , EGR2 , c-jun , and PDGF ( B ) .
However , only during macrophage-like differentiation were all four of these genes activated .
The present study extends these observations and provides the first demonstration of the involvement of c-jun and EGR2 in monocyte differentiation to macrophages using freshly iso-lated , nontransformed cells .
We also confirmed the work of others ( Haskill et al .
, 1988 ) that there is a brief but marked increase in c-fos 20 min after monocyte adherence and that activation of the monocyte HLA-DR- « gene is not dependent on adherence or cytoskeletal rearrangement .
The importance of adherence in c-jun and EGR2 mRNA accumulation suggests that adherence itself may be the initiating event in the conversion of a circulating monocyte to a tissue macrophage .
The inhibition by cytochalasin D of the increases in c-jun and EGR2 mRNA further implies that 2146 cytoskeletal integrity may be a crucial additional step before the full pattern of differentiation-associated mRNA accumulation .
There was a divergent pattern of ligand-specific modulation of PDGF ( B ) , c-jun , and EGR2 mRNA .
Fn caused a modest increase in PDGF ( B ) mRNA while collagen and LPS had little effect on PDGF ( B ) mRNA .
By contrast , Fn and collagen weakly inhibited the increase in c-jun , whereas LPS tended to increase c-jun mRNA .
Furthermore , all three factors decreased EGR2 mRNA .
There was also a difference in the time course of activation of these three genes in that PDGF ( B ) was maximal at 6 h and decreased by 24 h , whereas c-jun and EGR2 were sustained at high levels at 24 h. Thus , these three genes were not coordinately regulated and the increase in PDGF ( B ) could not be attributed solely to prior activation of c-jun and EGR2 .
The modulation of c-jun and EGR2 by external stimuli as observed during adherence to collagen-coated plates may provide one mechanism by which these stimuli result in differentiation to macrophages with different functional capabilities .
For example , monocyte differentiation on collagen-coated plates results in macrophages with enhanced Fc-and C3-mediated phagocytosis ( Kaplan and Gaudernack , 1982 ) and increased TNF-a gene activation ( Eierman et al .
, 1989 ) .
In murine macrophages , there is an inverse relationship between the ligand-specific changes in c-fos mRNA and mRNA levels of urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( Col-lart et al .
, 1987 ) .
There are similar associations of patterns of increase in early growth response gene mRNA with activation of later genes associated with functional activities in HL60 cells ( Shaw , R. J. , R. A. F. Clark , V. P. Sukhatme , A. G. Ritter , P. A. Campbell , and S. H. Benedict , manuscript submitted for publication ) .
The present study , which found an association between early growth response and PDGF ( B ) mRNA accumulation , and monocyte adherence , lends support to the concept that monocyte adherence may trigger specific sequences of events that lead to divergent macrophage differentiation .
