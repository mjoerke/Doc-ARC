H. Orkin , April 2 , 1992 ABSTRACT The programmed activation /repression of transcription factors in early hematopoietic differentiation has not yet been explored .
The DNA-binding protein GATA-1 is required for normal erythroid development and regulates erythroid-expressed genes in maturing erythroblasts .
We analyzed GATA-1 expression in early human adult hematopoiesis by using an iz vitro system in which `` pure `` early hematopoietic progenitors are induced to gradual and synchronized differentiation selectively along the erythroid or granulocyte , macrophage pathway by differential treatment with hematopoietic growth factors .
The GATA-1 gene , though virtually silent in quiescent progenitors , is activated after entrance into the cell cycle upon stimulation with hematopoietic growth factors .
Subsequently , increasing expression along the erythroid pathway contrasts with an abrupt downregulation in the granulocyte-macrophage lineage .
These results suggest a mi-croenvironment-directed , two-step model for GATA-1 expression in differentiating hematopoietic progenitors that involves ( i ) cycle-dependent initiation and ( i ) lineage-dependent maintenance or suppression .
Hypothetically , on/off switches of lineage-restricted transactivators may underlie the binary fate decisions of hematopoietic progenitors .
Hematopoiesis is sustained by a pool of stem cells , which self-renew and differentiate into progenitors ( 1 ) .
These progenitors are committed to specific lineages and are functionally defined as colony-forming or burst-forming units ( CFU , BFU ) of the erythroid series ( CFU-E , BFU-E ) , the granu-locyte-monocyte lineage ( CFU-GM ) , and multipotent CFU for the GM , erythroid , and megakaryocytic series ( CFU-GEMM ) ( 2 ) .
The progenitors in turn differentiate into mor-phologically recognizable precursors , which mature to terminal forms circulating in peripheral blood .
Proliferation and differentiation of early hematopoietic cells are modulated by specific hematopoietic growth factors ( HGFs ) , termed colony-stimulating factors ( CSFs ) or inter-leukins ( ILs ) , which are released by accessory cells ( T cells , large granular lymphocytes , monocytes-macrophages , and stromal cells ) and exert a multi- or unilineage stimulus ( 3 , 4 ) .
Thus , IL-3 ( 5 ) and GM-CSF ( 6 ) induce differentiation of pluripotent ( CFU-GEMM ) , early erythroid ( BFU-E ) , and GM progenitors ( CFU-GM ) , whereas erythropoietin ( Epo ) ( 7 ) , G-CSF ( 8 ) , and M-CSF ( 9 ) specifically trigger differentiation of late erythroid ( CFU-E ) , granulocytic ( CFU-G ) , and monocytic ( CFU-M ) progenitors , respectively .
Coordinated expression of lineage-specific genes in developing hematopoietic cells is likely to be mediated in part by the programmed activation/suppression and microenviron-ment-directed expression of tissue- and stage-specific tran The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

6353 scription factors .
As a transactivator whose presence in mature hematopoietic cells is limited to the erythroid , mega-karyocytic , and mast lineages ( 10 , 11 ) , GATA-1 is a prime protein for study in this context .
GATA-1 , a 50-kDa finger protein , regulates erythroid-expressed genes through core GATA motifs ( 12 ) and is required for normal erythroid development as revealed by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells ( 13 ) .
Two mechanisms dependent on GATA-1 favor maturation of erythroid precursors : ( ? )
the GATA-1 gene is autoregulated through an upstream GATA element ( 14 ) ; ( ii ) GATA-1 positively regulates the Epo receptor promoter ( 15 ) and hence may forestall apoptosis due to Epo starvation ( 16 ) .
While aspects of GATA-1 regulation in maturing erythroid cells are readily reconciled with its proposed role , less is known regarding expression of GATA-1 in early progenitors .
The IL-3-dependent multipotential cell lines FDCPI1 ( 17 ) and 32D ( 17 , 18 ) have low levels of GATA-1 expression , whereas levels in more mature cell lines [ MEL ( erythroid ) , CHRF-288 ( megakaryocytic ) , MC /9 ( mast ) ] are higher ( 17 ) .
However , it is uncertain whether these observations on immortalized cell lines reflect regulation of GATA-1 during normal he-matopoiesis .
We analyzed GATA-1 expression during normal hematopoiesis by using an in vifro system in which a `` pure `` population of early progenitors ( 19 ) undergoes a gradual , synchronized differentiation selectively along the erythroid or GM pathway in fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) -free liquid suspension culture .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Progenitor Purification .
Human hematopoietic progenitors were purified from normal human peripheral blood by a four-step procedure ( 19 ) ; step I , a Ficoll cut followed by monocyte removal ( plastic adherence and glutamate dimeth-yl ester treatment ) ; step II , a discontinuous Percoll density gradient to separate the low-density cells ; step III , negative selection with immunomagnetic beads and a panel of monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) against T , B , and natural killer lymphocytes and monocytes ; step IV , positive selection with immunomagnetic beads and anti-CD34 mAb .
The procedure was slightly modified : step I , glutamate dimethyl ] ester treatment was omitted ; step II , the cells were purified on a four-step ( rather than three-step ) Percoll gradient ( 3-ml frac- Abbreviations : BFU-E , erythroid burst-forming unit ( s ) ; CFU , colony-forming unit ( s ) ; CSF , colony-stimulating factor ; GM , granulo-cyte-monocyte ; Epo , erythropoietin ; IL , interleukin ; HGF , hematopoietic growth factor ; mAb , monoclonal antibody ; FBS , fetal bovine serum ; RT , reverse transcriptase ; FITC , fluorescein isothio-cyanate ; PE , phycoerythrin .

Cultures were incubated in a fully humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO ; /5 % 0 ; /90 % N ; and were periodically counted , harvested , and analyzed for cell cycling , membrane pheno-type , and morphology .
To analyze the proliferative potential of the progenitors , the cells were periodically plated in FBS-containing methylcellulose cultures , as indicated above ( HGFs including saturating doses of IL-3 , GM-CSF , and Epo ) ; on day 14 the colonies were scored individually , picked up , washed , resuspended , and counted .

Similar results are observed in the liquid GM culture system ( data not shown ) .
midine ( 20 Ci/mmol , New England Nuclear ; 1 Ci = 37 GBq ) , and tube IV contained 200 ug of nonradioactive thymidine ( Serva ) and 20 LCi of PHJthymidine .
After 20 min of incubation in a water bath , cells were washed twice in the presence of thymidine ( 200 and 40 ug/ml ) with IMDM containing 2 % FBS .
There was no significant difference in cell death between tubes II and III or tubes I and IV .
The cells from each tube were plated ( 100 cells per dish ) for assay of progenitors in FBS-containing methylcellulose cultures as indicated above .
The fraction of precursors killed by [ PH ] thymidine was calculated as 1 - T/C ( T , total colonies from dishes II and III ; C , total colonies from dishes I and IV ) .
Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT-PCR ) Analysis , Total RNA extracted by the guanidinium isothiocyanate/CsCl method ( 24 ) from the same number of cells in the presence of 12 ug of Escherichia coli rRNA was quantitated by dot hybridization with a human rRNA probe .
After densitometric analysis the normalized amount of RNA was reverse-transcribed ( Moloney murine leukemia virus RT , BRL ) with oligo ( dT ) as primer .
An aliquot of each RT reaction mixture was incubated in the presence of [ a- > P ] JdCTP tracer and the reverse-transcribed RNA-DNA was normalized accordingly .
Amplification within the linear range was achieved by 20 cycles of PCR consisting of denaturation at 95°C for 1.5 min , annealing at 52°C for 1.5 min , and extension at 72°C for 1.5 min .
Primers for GATA-1 ( 25 ) were 5S-TTAGCCACCTCATGCCTT-3 ' and 5'-ACATCGGTCTTAAGACCT-3 ' and generated a PCR product of 194 base pairs .
PCR was performed in a total volume of 100 Ll , and 10 pl of each sample was electrophoresed in a 2 % agarose gel and transferred to a nylon filter for hybridization with an internal 40-mer GATA-1 probe ( 5'-TACTGTGGTGGCTCCGCTCAGCTCATGAGGCACA- In control experiments , serial dilutions of each sample were amplified ; the dose-response curves showed linearity for all points .
Relative intensities of bands were quantified by scanning with a laser densitometer ( LKB ) .
GATA-1 Gel Shift Assay .
Since this analysis requires a large number of cells , step III progenitors were utilized ( see refs .
19 and 25 ) .
Nuclear extract preparation ( 26 ) and gel shift analysis ( 15 ) were performed with 0.27-1 x 10° cells per time point .
Incubation mixtures ( 20 pl ) contained 2 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) , Epo receptor promoter probe ( 5-10 x 10 } dpm/ng ) ( 15 ) , and 2-6 ug of nuclear extract .
DNA-protein complexes were resolved in 5 % polyacrylamide gels ( 15 ) .
Bands were quantitated with a Phosphorimager ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Phenotype of Purified Progenitors .

Mast cells and megakaryocytes were not observed in either the erythroid or the GM culture system .
These highly undifferentiated progenitors ( CFU-GEMM , BFU-E , CFU-GM ) are largely quiescent , give rise to large colonies in clonogenic culture , and consist of a population that is =~90 % CD34* , 80-90 % HLA-DR + , < 10 % CD45RO* , and < 10 % CD33* ( Fig .
1 ) .
In contrast , marrow progenitors are mostly CD34+*33* : the small CD34+*33~ population includes the earliest progenitors and stem cells ( 27 ) .
Further-more , the purified progenitors comprise a small population of multipotent progenitors with self-renewal capacity-i.e .
, with stem-cell properties ( 19 ) .
Indeed , adult blood mononu-clear or CD34* cells can reconstitute the hematolymphopoi-etic system when transplanted in patients ( 28 , 29 ) or monkeys ( 20 ) , respectively .
Kinetics of Pure Progenitors ' Proliferation and Differentiation .
The pure progenitors , triggered into cycling by HGFs in FBS-free liquid suspension culture , undergo extensive proliferation coupled with a wave of gradual and synchronized differentiation , which takes place selectively along either the GM pathway ( upon treatment with high doses of IL-3 and GM-CSF ) or the erythroid pathway ( upon addition of low amounts of IL-3 and GM-CSF and saturating levels of Epo ) ( representative results in Figs .
2-4 ) .
In the first week of culture the progenitors show both a gradual decrease of their proliferative potential ( as indicated by the progressive decline of the size of the progenitor-generated colonies ; Fig .
2 Bottom ) and a homogeneous shift of their membrane phenotype ( as indicated by double labeling experiments with CD34/33 and CD34/45RO ; Fig .
3 ) .
This indicates that they undergo a wave of gradual and synchronized differentiation .

RT-PCR Analysis of GATA-1 mRNA in Differentiating Pure Progenitors .
We utilized this in vitro model to evaluate the expression of GATA-1 mRNA by RT-PCR analysis in progenitors differentiating along the erythroid or GM pathway ( representative results in Fig .
5 ) .
The GATA-1 gene is barely expressed in the starting population of quiescent progenitor/ stem cells ( Fig .
5 ) .
Addition of IL-3 and GM-CSF induces cell proliferation ( Fig .
2 ) , which is coupled to initiation of GATA-1 expression ( Fig .
54 ) .
Further , the initial level of GATA-1 mRNA ( Fig .
54 ) may be directly related to the cycling activity ( Fig .
2 ) .
In the erythroid differentiation pathway GATA-1 mRNA expression is maintained and gradually enhanced through the terminal stages of maturation ( Fig .
5A ) .
Differentiation along the GM pathway is initially associated with GATA-1 expression , which is then abruptly down-regulated at the level of late progenitors/early differentiated precursors ( Fig .
54 ) .
It must be emphasized that both mast cells and megakaryocytes are absent from the GM culture experiments ( Fig .
4 ) .
Further , a series of controls including dose-response curves ( Fig .
5B ) ensured a semi-quantitative evaluation of GATA-1 mRNA by RT-PCR ( see also Materials and Methods ) .
Gel Shift Analysis of GATA-1 Protein in Differentiating Pure Progenitors .
We performed gel shift assays using a GATA target site derived from the Epo receptor gene promoter ( 15 ) .
Nuclear proteins were prepared from ~30 % purified hematopoietic progenitors , grown in the erythroid or GM culture system .
GATA-1 present in K562 cell extract forms a specific complex on the Epo receptor probe ( ref .
15 ; Fig .
6 Left , lane 12 ) .
This complex is not detected when extract from the purified , quiescent progenitors is used ( Fig .
6 Left , lane 1 ) but is initially detected in the differentiated progenitors after 3 days in erythroid or GM culture ( Fig .
6 Right , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
However , at day 7 of culture , the complex is evident only in the erythroid culture ( Fig .
6 Left , lanes 6 and 7 ) and then progressively increases during erythroid maturation up to day 13 ( Fig .
6 Left , lane 8 ) , with a 30-fold increase throughout erythroid differentiation .
Thus , complex formation in differentiating progenitors correlates with GATA-1 mRNA detected by RT-PCR analysis .
Concluding Remarks .
Our findings reveal that the regulation of the GATA-1 gene in normal hematopoietic progenitors is complex and involves mechanisms that efficiently activate , maintain , and selectively abrogate expression .
Initiation of GATA-1 expression in early progenitor cells is temporally related to the onset of cycling activity triggered by IL-3/GM-CSF .
This suggests that activation of the genetic program underlying proliferation of stem/progenitor cells induces the switching on of GATA-1 transcription and translation .
Maintenance of expression in developing erythroid cells is likely to be mediated in part through positive autoregulation ( 14 ) .
The abrupt down-regulation of GATA-1 expression in GM development implies mechanism ( s ) operating in late GM progenitors to curtail autoregulation or actively extinguish expression .
Though GM progenitors appear to express GATA-1 , their development to terminal cells proceeds in the absence of GATA-1 ( 13 ) .
Hence , the initial domain of GATA-1 expression extends beyond that of the mature lineages in which it is thought to serve as a transcriptional regulator ( 30 ) .
This pattern is reminiscent of the widespread distribution of the myogenic factor MyoD in mesoderm prior to sustained expression in developing muscle ( 31 ) .
Our studies are compatible with a two-step model for the expression of GATA-1 in early hematopoiesis , which involves ( ¢ ) initially a switch on , linked to initiation of stem/ progenitor-cell cycling , and ( i ? )
subsequently , increasing expression along the erythroid differentiation pathway contrasted with abrupt down-regulation in the GM lineage at a relatively advanced stage of differentiation .
