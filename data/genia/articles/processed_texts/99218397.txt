Jian Zhang , `` * Konstantin V. Salojin , `` * Jian-Xin Gao , * Mark J. Cameron , ** Isabelle Bergerot , * and Terry L. Optimal T cell activation requires two signals , one generated by TCR and another by the CD28 costimulatory receptor .
In this study , we investigated the regulation of costimulation-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) activation in primary mouse T cells .
In contrast to that reported for human Jurkat T cells , we found that p38 MAPK , but not Jun NH , , -terminal kinase ( JNK ) , is weakly activated upon stimulation with either anti-CD3 or anti-CD28 in murine thymocytes and splenic T cells .
However , p38 MAPK is activated strongly and synergistically by either CD3/CD28 coligation or PMA/Ca** ionophore stimulation , which mimics TCR-CD3/CD28-mediated signaling .
Activation of p38 MAPK correlates closely with the stimulation of T cell prolifera-tion .
In contrast , PMA-induced JNK activation is inhibited by Ca** ionophore .
T cell proliferation and production of IL-2 , IL-4 , and IFN-y induced by both CD3 and CD3/CD28 ligation and the nuclear expression of the c-Jun and ATF-2 proteins are each blocked by the p38 MAPK inhibitor $ B203580 .
Our findings demonstrate that p38 MAPK 1 ) plays an important role in signal integration during costimulation of primary mouse T cells , 2 ) may be involved in the induction of c-Jun activation and augmen- tation of AP-1 transcriptional activity , and 3 ) regulates whether T cells enter a state of functional unresponsiveness .
of Immunology , 1999 , 162 ; 3819-3829. targets in various cell types is mediated by several protein kinases , including the family of mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) * ( 1-4 ) .
MAPKs are serine/threonine kinases that include extracellular signal-regulated kinases ( ERKs ) , Jun NH-terminal kinases ( JNKs ) , and p38 MAPK ( 2 , 3 ) .
MAPKs are activated by dual phosphorylation in a Thr-Xaa-Tyr motif , in which Xaa corresponds to Glu in ERK , Pro in JNK , and Gly in p38 MAPK ( 2 , 4 ) .
These dual specificity kinases are relatively specific for each MAPK subgroup , allowing for their independent regula-tion .
Thus , MAPK/ERK kinase-1 ( MEK-1 ) and MEK2 selectively phosphorylate and activate ERKs , whereas MAPK kinase-3 ( MKK-3 ) and MKK6 selectively phosphorylate and activate p38 MAPK .
MKK4 does not activate the ERK subgroup , but activates both p38 MAPK and JNK ( 5-9 ) .

Copyright © 1999 by The American Association of Immunologists The Journal ERKs are activated by agonists for tyrosine-encoded receptors and G protein-coupled receptors that induce mitogenesis or cellular differentiation ( 2-4 ) .
ERKs mediate the effects of these agonists by phosphorylating and regulating the activity of several proteins , including cytoplasmic enzymes and nuclear factors ( 1 , 2 ) .
JNKs phosphorylate the NH , -terminal activation domain of c-Jun and activating transcription factor-2 ( ATF-2 ) , increasing their transcriptional activity ( 4 , 10 ) .
JNKs are activated preferentially by cellular stress and inflammatory cytokines , but also by G protein-coupled receptor agonists , growth factors , and cytoplasmic onco-genes ( 4 , 10-16 ) .
Similarly , p38 MAPK is activated by cellular stresses , inflammatory cytokines , LPS ( 14 , 17-19 ) , and G protein-coupled receptors ( 20 ) , and activated p38 MAPK in turn mediates cytokine production , stress responses , and apoptosis ( 21-26 ) .
The p38 MAPK substrates include MAPK-activating protein kinase-2 ( MAPKAP kinase-2 ) , ATFE-2 ( 18 , 19 , 27 , 28 ) , cAMP response element binding protein ( CREB ) , ATF-1 ( 29 ) , Elk-1 ( 25 ) , C/EBP-homologous protein ( CHOP ) ( 30 ) , and myocyte-enhancer factor 2C ( MEFZC ) ( 31 ) .
TCR engagement activates the ERK cascade in T cells ( 32-34 ) .
Analyses of Jurkat human T cells and various activated mouse T cell clones have suggested that JNK activation stimulated by TCR engagement requires CD28 coligation ( 33 , 34 ) .
p38 MAPK may be fully activated in mouse T cell clones by signaling via either CD3 or CD28 , but CD3/CD28 costimulation does not further enhance the amount of p38 MAPK activation ( 35 ) .
In contrast , stimulation of CD28 fails to activate p38 MAPK , but synergizes with CD3 stimulation to fully activate p38 MAPK in preactivated proliferating T cells ( 36 ) .
These results raise the possibility that p38 MAPK may mediate CD28 costimulation in primary naive mouse T cells .
The latter possibility is supported by reports that , in T cells from MKK-4-deficient mice , CD28-mediated IL-2 production and proliferation are impaired and CD28 costimulation and PMA/Ca** ionophore-induced signaling can stimulate proliferation and IL-2 0022-1767/99/ $ 02.00 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q /310° jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 3820 production independently of JNK activation ( 37 ) .
In addition , in human T cells , the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 blocks CD28-dependent proliferation and IL-2 production ( 38 ) .
Thus , the question of whether p38 MAPK is activated upon either TCR or CD28 stimulation or after TCR/CD28 coligation in primary , unstimu-lated , naive mouse T cells merits further investigation .
In this study , we determined whether differential regulation of MAPK activation occurs in primary mouse T cells in response to TCR/CD28 or PMA/Ca®* ionophore costimulation .
We show that p38 MAPK activation mediates both TCR- and CD28-induced signaling in primary mouse T cells .
Ligation of TCR or CD28 results in only modest p38 MAPK activation , whereas TCR and CD28 synergize upon coligation to elicit enhanced p38 MAPK activation .
PMA/Ca®* ionophore costimulation , which mimics TCR/ CD28-mediated signaling , fully activates p38 MAPK in primary mouse T cells .
Our results demonstrate that p38 MAPK is involved in both TCR- and CD28-signaling pathways , and that p38 MAPK , but not JNK , is involved in signal integration during costimulation of naive mouse primary T cells .

Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C , and their protein content was determined by the Bradford assay using BSA as a standard .
Lysates were divided into three replicate samples ; incubated for 1 h at 4°C with either anti-ERK-1 , anti-JNK-1 , or anti-p38 MAPK Abs ; and further reacted with protein G agarose ( Santa Cruz ) or protein A-Sepharose CL-4B ( Pharmacia Biotech , Baie d'Urfe , PQ , Canada ) for an additional 1 h at 4°C .
Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer ( 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7.5 ) , 20 mM MgCl , , 20 mM MnCl , 2 mM DTT , 25 mM B-glycerophosphate , and 100 nM Na , VO , ) .
Kinase assays were performed using MBP , GST-c-Jun , and GST-ATF-2 fusion proteins as substrates for ERK-1 , JNK-1 , and p38 MAPK , respectively .

Solid-phase JNK assays were performed essentially as previously described ( 39 ) .
Whole cell extracts ( 2 X 10 `` cell equivalents ) were prepared and reacted for 4 h at 4°C with a GST-c-Jun ( 1-79 ) fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads to immobilize JNK .
The washed beads were then analyzed for their associated kinase activity by incubation for 30 min at 30°C in kinase buffer containing 20 wCi [ y- `` °P ] JATP .
Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer , samples were boiled , and kinase reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE .
The MAPKAP kinase-2 assay was performed as described ( 35 ) , using murine recombinant hsp25 as a substrate .
Equal loading of precipitated proteins was confirmed by probing the blots with specific Abs , and phosphorylation of the substrates was quantitated using a Molecular Imager System and Molecular Analyst imaging software ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) .

in the presence or absence of the 37.51 anti-CD28 mAb ( 1 pg/ml ) .
Supernatants collected after 48 h were assayed for their cytokine concentrations by ELISA using a double ligand method .
IL-2 concentrations were interpolated from a standard curve using murine rIL-2 captured by the JES6-1A12 mAb and detected by the biotinylated JES6-5H4 mAb .
IL-4 concentrations were measured using recombinant murine IL-4 , the BVD4-1D11 mAb , and biotinylated BVD6-24G2 mAb , while IFN-y concentrations were detected using recombinant murine IFN-y , R4-6A2 mAb , and biotinylated XMG1.2 mAb ( all obtained from PharMingen ) .

MAPK activation is differentially regulated in response to stimulation by CD3 , CD28 , CD3 plus CD28 , PMA , or PMA plus Ca** ionophore .
A , Thymocytes ( 2 X 10 `` /ml ) were either left unstimulated or stimulated for 15 min at 37°C with anti-CD3 ( 10 ug/ml ) , anti-CD28 ( 5 pg/ml ) , anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 , or PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) .
Cell lysates were precleared and immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK-1 , anti-JNK-1 , or anti-p38 MAPK , respectively .
In vitro kinase assays of ERK-1 , JNK-1 , and p38 MAPK activity associated with the immunoprecipitates were performed using MBP , GST-c-Jun , and GST-ATF-2 as substrates .
Lysates were analyzed for protein abundance of ERK-1 , JNK-1 , and p38 MAPK by immunoblotting ( IB ) .
B , Splenic T cells ( 10'/ml ) were stimulated with either anti-CD3 , anti-CD28 , anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 , PMA , or PMA plus A23187 ( 500 ng/ml ) .
In vitro kinase assays of ERK-1 , JNK-1 , and p38 MAPK activity were performed as in A. Lysates were analyzed for protein abundance of ERK-1 , JNK-1 , and p38 MAPK by IB .
C , Thymocytes ( 2 X 10 `` /ml ) were stimulated with anti-CD3 , anti-CD28 , anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 , or PMA , and JNK-2 activity was assayed as in A. Lysates were analyzed for protein abundance of JNK-2 , as above .
Alternatively , cell lysates were reacted for 4 h at 4°C with 10 ug GST-c-Jun precoupled to glutathione-agarose beads , followed by an in vitro kinase reaction ( C , lower panel ) .
Data from one of three reproducible experiments are shown .
Effect of $ B203580 on nuclear expression of c-Fos , c-Jun , and ATF-2 Thymocytes ( 4 X 10'/ml ) were pretreated for 15 min with 10 uM $ B203580 , and were then stimulated for 5 or 15 min with anti-CD3 ( 10 g/m ! )
and anti-CD28 ( 5 ug/ml ) .
Alternatively , thymocytes were stimulated for 4 h at 37°C with either anti-CD3 , anti-CD28 , anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 , or PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) .
The cells were then collected , washed with ice-cold PBS , and lysed for 30 min at 4°C in hypotonic lysis buffer ( 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7.5 ) , 5 mM NaCl , 3 mM MgCl , , 1 mM DTT , 5 % glycerol , 0.4 % Nonidet P-40 , 2.5 mM PMSF , 40 pg/ml aprotinin , 40 ug/ml leupeptin , 2 mM EDTA , 1 mM Na , VO , , and 10 mM NaF ) .
Nuclear extraction was performed as previously reported ( 40 ) .
Extracts were separated on 10 % SDS-PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose membranes , and probed with anti-c-Fos , anti-c-Jun , and anti-ATF-2 mAbs , and the c-Fos , c-Jun , and ATF-2 proteins were detected by chemoluminescence .
Results Coligation of TCR and CD28 synergistically activates p38 MAPK , but neither JNK nor ERK in murine thymocytes and splenic T cells JNK activation requires costimulation by either CD28 or Ca** ionophore in Jurkat T cells , suggesting that JNK is involved in signal integration during T cell costimulation ( 33 ) .
However , it is not known whether activation of JNK and p38 MAPK occurs in primary naive T cells that are not further stimulated in vitro .
To determine whether CD28 regulates MAPK activation following CD3 ligation , murine thymocytes or purified splenic T cells were stimulated for 15 min with anti-CD3 , anti-CD28 , or both mAbs .
Cells were lysed ; ERK-1 , JINK-1 , and p38 MAPK were immunoprecipitated with specific Abs ; and immunoprecipitates were assayed for the activities of associated MAPKs by their ability to phosphorylate the MBP , c-Jun , and ATF-2 substrates , respectively .
Anti-CD3 stimulation activated ERK-1 in thymocytes and splenic T cells , and this level of activation of ERK-1 was not increased after CD3/CD28 costimulation ( Fig .
1 , A and B , upper panels ) , as reported ( 33 , 34 ) .
More significantly , stimulation by anti-CD3 or anti-CD28 either alone or in combination did not activate JNK ( i.e .
, JNK-1 ) in murine thymocytes or splenic T cells ( Fig .
1 , A and B , middle panels ) .
Anti-CD3 or anti-CD28 stimulation induced modest p38 MAPK activity , which was elevated about fivefold after CD3/CD28 coligation ( Fig .
1 , A and B , lower panels ) .
PMA activated ERK-1 , JNK-1 , and p38 MAPK in thymocytes and splenic T cells ( Fig .
1 , A and B ) .
Stimulation of splenic T cells with the Ca** ionophore A23187 did not activate ERK-1 or JNK-1 , but rather stimulated p38 MAPK activity and enhanced the level of p38 MAPK activity induced by PMA alone ( Fig .
1B , lower panel ) .
JINK-2 may bind and phosphorylate c-Jun more efficiently than JNK-1 ( 41 , 42 ) .

The loading of equal amounts of JNK-1 proteins was confirmed by anti-JNK-1 immunoblotting .
Data from one of two reproducible experiments are shown .
exclude the possibility that in primary T cells JINK-2 may be solely responsible for c-Jun phosphorylation , thymocytes were lysed following stimulation with either anti-CD3 , anti-CD28 , anti-CD3 plus CD28 , or PMA .
JNK-2 activity associated with anti-JNK-2 imnmunoprecipitates was examined by c-Jun phosphorylation in an in vitro kinase assay .
As observed for JINK-1 , little or no JNK-2 activity was detected in response to ligation of either CD3 , CD28 , or both ( Fig .
1C , upper panel ) .
JINK-2 was activated , however , by PMA stimulation .
The failure to activate JNK-1 and JNK-2 by coligation of CD3 and CD28 was also observed in BALB/c splenic T cells ( data not shown ) , suggesting that these observations are not mouse strain dependent .
Since several splice variants of JINK-1 and JNK-2 have been found recently ( 43 ) , it is possible that the anti-JNK Abs used may not precipitate all variant forms of JNK .
To eliminate this possibility , GST-c-Jun precoupled to glutathione-agarose beads was used in a solid-phase JNK assay to precipitate all JNK variants .
Similar to the in vitro kinase assay of JNK-1 , c-Jun phosphorylation was not increased upon CD3 , CD28 , or CD3/CD28 ligation , but was induced significantly upon PMA stimulation ( Fig .
1C , lower panel ) .
To further examine the activation of ERK-1 , JNK-1 , and p38 MAPK induced by stimulation of CD3 , CD28 , or CD3 plus CD28 , thymocytes were pretreated with a constant amount ( 10 pg/ml ) of anti-CD3 together with variable amounts of anti-CD28 .
With increasing concentrations of anti-CD28 mAb ( 0.1-20 pg/ml ) , no further augmentation of ERK-1 activation was observed compared IP : anti-JNK-1 anti-CD28 ( 5 ug/m ! )

A similar result was obtained for JNK-1 activity .
However , p38 MAPK was optimally activated by anti-CD28 at concentrations of 1-5 ug/ml ( Fig .
24 , lower panel ) .
To investigate whether the kinetics of ERK-1 and JNK-1 activation differs from that of p38 MAPK , the time courses of activation of ERK-1 , JNK-1 , and p38 MAPK induced by coligation of CD3 and CD28 were determined .
ERK-1 and p38 MAPK activity peaked at 15 and 30 min of stimulation , respectively ( Fig .
2B , upper and lower panels ) , but JNK-1 was not activated throughout the entire time course ( Fig .
2B , middle panel ) .
This effect of CD28 costimulation was also analyzed by pretreating thymocytes with an optimum concentration of anti-CD28 mAb ( 5 ug/ml ) plus variable concentrations of anti-CD3 mAb ( 0.1-20 ug/ml ) .
ERK-1 activation was gradually enhanced by addition of increasing concentrations of anti-CD3 , with maximal activation observed at 10 and 20 ug/ml ( Fig .
2C , upper panel ) .
Similarly , p38 MAPK activity was elevated by increasing concentrations of anti-CD3 and was evident even at very low concentrations ( 0.1 ug/ml ! )
of added anti-CD3 ( Fig .
2C , lower panel ) .
In contrast , JNK-1 was not activated significantly at any concentration of added anti-CD3 ( Fig .
2C , middle panel ) .
The inability to detect JNK-1 activation upon CD3/ CD28 coligation in primary mouse T cells may be due to a lack of reactivity of the 37.51 anti-CD28 mAb with the appropriate CD28 epitope required for JNK-1 activation .
However , the use of another anti-CD28 mAb , PV-1 , which recognizes a different epitope than 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q /310° jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology the 37.51 anti-CD28 mAb as determined by a competitive binding assay ( our unpublished observations ) , did not activate JNK-1 ( Fig .
2D ) .
Note that PMA activated JNK-1 in a positive control sample .
These data indicate that p38 MAPK , but not JNK , is involved in both TCR- and CD28-mediated signaling pathways , and may play an important role in signal integration during CD28 costimulation of primary mouse T cells .
Synergistic activation of p38 MAPK requires costimulation by Ca `` * in primary mouse T cells In Fig .
1B , we showed that the Ca** ionophore A23187 ( 500 ng/ ml ) activates p38 MAPK , synergizes with PMA to further enhance p38 MAPK activation , and inhibits JNK-1 activity induced by PMA .
To analyze the relationship of these findings to the dose of A23187 , splenic T cells were stimulated with PMA ( 50 ng/m ! )
plus a range of concentrations ( 15-1000 ng/m ! )
of A23187 .
ERK-1 activity was not enhanced at any of the concentrations of A23187 used ( Fig .
3A , upper panel ) .
INK-1 activity was inhibited significantly in a dose-dependent manner when A23187 was added to PMA , and concentrations of > 125 ng/ml A23187 abolished virtually all detectable JNK-1 activity ( Fig .
34 , middle panel ) .
Note that this inhibition of JNK by A23187 was not due to different kinetics of JNK activation induced by PMA/A23187 versus PMA alone .
PMA-induced JNK activation was significantly increased in peripheral T cells after stimulation for 15 min , whereas little or no activation of JNK was induced by PMA/A23187 ( Fig .
3B ) .
In contrast , p38 MAPK activity was enhanced upon exposure of the T cells to increasing doses of A23187 and reached a maximum at a concentration of 60 ng/ml ( Fig .
3A , lower panel ) .
Interestingly , the latter findings on induced p38 MAPK activity correlate closely with our observations on the stimulation of proliferation of splenic T cells by PMA and variable amounts of A23187 ( Fig .
3C ) .
The observed inhibition of PMA-induced JNK activation by A23187 suggests that Ca** `` ionophore may activate some JNK-specific MAPK phosphatases that inactivate JNK .
To further analyze the effect of Ca** on p38 MAPK activation , splenic T cells were pretreated with CsA ( 500 ng/ml ) , which is believed to inhibit the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin .
Consistent with our previous observation in Fig .
1C , stimulation with anti-CD3 or anti-CD28 alone resulted in only modest p38 MAPK activation , and p38 MAPK was activated synergistically by either CD3/CD28 coligation or PMA/A23187 treatment ( Fig .
3D , upper panel ) .
These induced p38 MAPK activities were inhibited appreciably by CsA , with the exception that PMA- and CD28-induced p38 MAPK activation was CsA resistant .
Interestingly , inhibition of PMA/Ca®* ionophore-induced p38 MAPK activity by CsA pretreatment occurred in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .
3D , lower panel ) .
JNK activity was induced only by PMA , and this PMA-induced JNK activity was inhibited by Ca** ionophore ( Fig .
3D , upper panel ) .
However , CsA did not further inhibit JNK activity induced by PMA/Ca®* ionophore ( Fig .
3D , lower panel ) .
Thus , optimal activation of p38 MAPK in primary mouse T cells requires two signals , one provided by the TCR/CD3 complex or PMA and another provided by CD28 or Ca** ionophore .
Different requirements for JNK-1 and p38 MAPK activation in Jurkat T cells , proliferating T cells , and primary T cells JNK activation requires two signals generated by the TCR and CD28 or PMA and Ca** ionophore in Jurkat T cells and mouse T cell clones ( 33 , 34 ) .
To determine whether p38 MAPK activation has the same requirements in Jurkat T cells , we compared the activation of ERK-1 , JNK-1 , and p38 MAPK in response to ligation of CD3 , CD28 , CD3 plus CD28 , PMA , and PMA plus Ca** ionophore in Jurkat T cells .

PMA induced modest JNK-1 activation , which was significantly enhanced by PMA/A23187 stimulation ( Fig .
4A , middle panel ) .
Similarly , anti-CD3 or PMA weakly activated p38 MAPK , but full activation of p38 MAPK required CD3/CD28 coligation or PMA/Ca* `` ionophore costimulation ( Fig .
4A , lower panel ) .
Next , we examined the effect of Ca**/calcineurin on the activation of ERK-1 , JNK-1 , and p38 MAPK in Jurkat T cells after a 15-min incubation with CsA ( 500 ng/m1 ) .
CsA did not inhibit ERK-1 activation in response to CD3/CD28 , PMA , or PMA/Ca2 * ionophore stimulation ( Fig .
4B ) .
However , activation of JNK-1 and p38 MAPK induced by either CD3/CD28 coligation or PMA/A23187 was markedly reduced .
Notably , activation of JNK-1 and p38 MAPK induced by PMA was insensitive to CsA pretreatment .
These data are the first to indicate that p38 MAPK activation in Jurkat T cells also requires two signals generated by TCR/CD28 or PMA/Ca** ionophore signaling .
To obtain additional evidence that the requirement for MAPK activation differs between T cells at different stages of the cell cycle , we analyzed the activation of ERK-1 , JNK-1 , and p38 MAPK in response to TCR or CD28 stimulation , or both , in proliferating mouse T cells .
B6 splenic T cells were first stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and IL-2 for 48 h and then expanded in medium containing IL-2 for 4 days ( 36 ) .
Interestingly , we noted that , although the cells were proliferating , about 30-40 % of the T cells were nonviable at the time of harvest .
Viable cells were re-covered , stimulated , lysed , and immunoprecipitated .
Consistent with previous reports for Jurkat T cells and primary mouse T cells , TCR stimulation induced full ERK-1 activation without the requirement of CD28 costimulation ( Fig .
4C , upper panel ) , whereas optimal p38 MAPK activation required TCR/CD28 costimulation ( Fig .
4C , lower panels ) .
In contrast , JINK-1 was modestly activated by anti-CD3 stimulation , but no synergistic activation of JNK-1 occurred upon CD3/CD28 coligation .
JNK-1 was fully activated , however , by CD28 ligation ( Fig .
4C , middle panel ) .
These data suggest that Jurkat human T cells , proliferating mouse T cells , and primary mouse T cells differ in terms of their requirements for ERK-1 , JNK-1 , and p38 MAPK activation .
p38 MAPK activity is required for CD3 or CD3/CD28 ligation-induced T cell proliferation The requirement of p38 MAPK activation for T cell proliferation induced by CD3 or CD3/CD28 ligation was investigated .

The results of triplicate cultures are expressed as the mean values + SD .

Cell death was detected by propidium iodide staining and flow-cytometric analysis .
C , Splenic T cells ( 10'/ml ) were preincubated with $ B203580 ( 1-100 uM ) for 15 min at 37°C , and then stimulated with anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 for an additional 15 min .

$ B203580 inhibited T cell proliferation significantly and blocked T cell proliferation completely at concentrations of 10 and 100 uM , respectively ( Fig .
5A ) .
To exclude the possibility that inhibition of T cell proliferation results from SB203580-induced cell toxicity , the capacity of viable T cells to survive after exposure to $ B203580 was measured .
As evaluated by propidium iodide staining , we found that SB203580 ( 100 uM ) completely inhibited T cell death induced by anti-CD3 stimulation ( Fig .
5B ) .
Consistent with this observation , SB203580 ( 40-100 uM ) also significantly inhibited TCR-induced cell death in the DO11.10 murine T cell hybridoma ( data not shown ) .
This ability of SB203580 to promote T cell survival was not attributable to any nonspecific DMSO solvent effects , as pretreatment of T cells with DMSO alone failed to inhibit p38 MAPK activity ( data not shown ) .
This ability of $ B203580 to block T cell proliferation correlated closely with its capacity to inhibit p38 MAPK activity , as activities of p38 MAPK and its downstream target MAPKAP kinase-2 induced by stimulation with either anti-CD3 and anti-CD3/CD28 were greatly diminished by $ B203580 in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .

Note that since SB203580 reversibly binds to the ATP binding site of p38 MAPK , $ B203580 was present continuously during the kinase assays .

To confirm the specificity of this inhibitor , purified splenic T cells were pretreated with various concentrations of $ B203580 ( 0-100 uM ) , then stimulated with either anti-CD3 , anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 , or PMA , and lysed .
Cell lysates were either reacted with GST-c-Jun precoupled to glutathione-agarose beads or immunoprecipitated with an anti-anti-ERK-1 Ab in the presence of SB203580 .
The immobilized kinases were then incubated with substrates and $ B203580 ( 0-100 M ) for 30 min at 30°C .
ERK-1 and JNK activities remained unaffected in the presence of increasing concentrations of $ B203580 ( Fig .
5D ) .
$ B203580 inhibits cytokine secretions in primary mouse T cells We next investigated whether $ B203580 inhibits cytokine secretions induced by CD3 or CD3/CD28 stimulation of primary mouse T cells .
Splenic T cells were pretreated with either different concentrations of S $ B203580 in DMSO or equivalent amounts of DMSO as control , and then stimulated as described above .
After 48 h , supernatants were collected for quantification of IL-2 , IL-4 , and IFN-y by ELISA .
Interestingly , $ B203580 inhibited T cell secretion of of IL-2 , IL-4 , and IFN-y induced by either CD3 or CD3/CD28 stimulation in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .

treatment with SB203580 induces T cells to become functionally unresponsive .
$ B203580 represses the nuclear expression of c-Jun and ATF-2 Our data suggest that p38 MAPK , but not JNK , is involved in signal integration of TCR- and CD28-mediated signaling pathways in primary mouse T cells .
However , JNK is a major kinase responsible for c-Jun phosphorylation and p38 MAPK can not phosphorylate c-Jun ( 28 , 31 ) .
Indeed , using in vitro kinase assays , we failed to detect c-Jun phosphorylation by p38 MAPK ( data not shown ) .
Since phosphorylation of c-Jun and/or ATF-2 is required for c-Jun gene induction , we analyzed whether blockade of p38 MAPK activity results in the reduced phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF-2 .
Thymocytes were preincubated for 15 min at 37°C with 10 wM SB203580 or an equal amount of DMSO as control , and were then either stimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 for 5 and 15 min , or left unstimulated .
Nuclear extracts were blotted with anti-c-Jun and anti-ATF-2 mAbs , respectively .
Phosphorylation of ATE-2 , as revealed by its reduced mobility , was evident FIGURE 7 .

Nuclear extracts of cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
Immunoblotting was conducted using anti-c-Fos , anti-c-Jun , and anti-ATE-2 mAbs , respectively , and the c-Fos , c-Jun , and ATF-2 proteins were detected by chemoluminescence .
Data from one of three reproducible experiments are shown .
after 5 and 15 min of stimulation , and these mobility shifts were significantly inhibited by SB203580 ( Fig .
7A , upper panel ) .
In contrast , no c-Jun phosphorylation was observed ( Fig .
7A , lower panel ) , consistent with our in vitro data that JNK is not activated upon CD3 or CD3/CD28 ligation .
Note that the failure to detect c-Jun phosphorylation can not be attributed to the anti-c-Jun mAb used because it clearly recognized the phosphorylated form of c-Jun induced by PMA stimulation , as reported ( 45 ) .
SB203580 can block the induction of the c-Fos and c-Jun genes by diverse stimuli ( 45 , 46 ) , indicating that p38 MAPK activity may play a role in the induction of c-Jun gene expression .
This may explain our finding of the nuclear expression of the c-Jun and ATF-2 proteins at later time points following CD3/CD28 coligation .
Interestingly , while SB203580 pretreatment did not alter the nuclear expression of c-Fos after CD3 or CD3/CD28 stimulation ( Fig .
78 , upper panel ) , SB203580 pretreatment significantly reduced the nuclear expression of c-Jun and ATF-2 induced by CD3 or CD3/CD28 ligation ( Fig .
7B , middle and lower panels ) .
The nuclear expression of c-Jun and ATF-2 was enhanced more upon 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q /310° jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology CD3/CD28 coligation than ligation of CD3 alone .
The nuclear expression of c-Fos , c-Jun , and ATF-2 stimulated by PMA was not inhibited by $ B203580 .
To confirm that the increase of c-Jun expression in the nucleus was due to enhancement of de novo c-Jun protein synthesis , the sensitivity of c-Jun nuclear expression to cycloheximide , a protein synthesis inhibitor , was determined .
Although cycloheximide may stimulate JNK activity , pretreatment of thymocytes with 20 uM cycloheximide virtually abolished the increased abundance of c-Jun induced by CD3 and CD3/CD28 ligation ( Fig .
7C ) .
The blockade of c-Jun expression in the nucleus by SB203580 suggests that p38 MAPK activity plays a role in the induction of expression of the c-Jun protein .
Discussion Previous studies of MAPK activation in the Jurkat human T cell line and mouse T cell clones in long-term culture suggested that JNK activation requires costimulatory signals via CD28 or Ca** ionophore to synergize with TCR- or PMA-driven signals ( 33 , 34 ) .
However , the pathways of activation of JNK and p38 MAPK in primary T cells were not studied extensively and are less well understood .
Accordingly , we investigated the regulation of ERK-1 , JNK-1 , and p38 MAPK activation stimulated by TCR/CD28 or PMA/Ca** ionophore-mediated signaling in naive mouse thymocytes and splenic T cells .
Our main findings are : 1 ) CD3 or CD28 stimulation of primary naive thymocytes and T cells activates p38 MAPK , ; 2 ) CD3/CD28 coligation synergistically activates p38 MAPK , but not JNK ; 3 ) activation of p38 MAPK is Ca** depen-dent ; and 4 ) the p38 MAPK inhibitor , SB203580 , blocks CD3 and CD3/CD28 ligation-induced T cell proliferation as well as production of IL-2 , IL-4 , and IFN-y .
These results suggest that p38 MAPK , but not JNK , is involved in signal integration during CD28 costimulation of murine primary T cells and may also play an important role in the induction of T cell anergy .
Recently , it has been shown that CD28 and PMA/Ca `` * iono-phore-triggered signaling stimulate thymocytes and lymph node T cells to proliferate and produce IL-2 independently of JNK activation in MKK-4-deficient mice ( 37 ) , suggesting that other MAPK ( s ) might be involved in primary T cell costimulation .
More importantly , impaired CD28-mediated IL-2 production and proliferation by T cells were observed in these mice ( 37 ) .
Since MKK-4 activates both JNK and p38 MAPK ( 5-9 ) , this impairment might be attributed to defective p38 MAPK activation in MKK-4-deficient mice .
However , p38 MAPK activity was not analyzed in the latter report .
Nonetheless , deficient expression of MKK4 does not affect p38 MAPK activation in embryonic stem cells ( 47 ) , and $ B203580 inhibits CD28-dependent proliferation and IL-2 production in human T cells ( 38 ) .
These two sets of evidence suggest a role for p38 MAPK in the costimulation of primary mouse T cells .
Although T cell proliferation in response to Con A and PMA/ ionomycin stimulation is normal in dominant-negative p38 trans-genic mice , TCR/CD28-mediated T cell proliferation and p38 MAPK activity in response to different stimuli were not investigated in this study ( 48 ) .
Additional studies conducted primarily with previously activated T cells have shown that p38 MAPK activation is inducible by CD3 , CD28 , or CD3/CD28 stimulation ( 35 , 36 ) .
Interestingly , however , we observed that MAPK activation differs between primary naive T cells and proliferating preactivated T cells .
In proliferating T cells , while ERK-1 and p38 MAPK activity are similar to that in primary naive T cells , JNK-1 is weakly activated by CD3 stimulation and is fully activated only upon CD28 stimulation .
It is important to note that a high percentage of proliferating T cells become apoptotic , perhaps due to the 3827 continuous exposure to IL-2 ( 49 ) .
Thus , p38 MAPK and JNK-1 activation in proliferating T cells may result in part from activa-tion-induced apoptosis .
The requirements for p38 MAPK and JNK-1 activation in murine primary T cells were found to differ from those in Jurkat cells , a human T cell line frequently used to identify pathways of T cell signaling .
In Jurkat cells , optimal activation of both p38 MAPK and JNK-1 requires TCR/CD28 coligation or PMA/Ca `` * ionophore costimulation .
In primary mouse T cells , however , stimulation by either CD28 or Ca** ionophore activates p38 MAPK , and p38 MAPK can be activated synergistically by CD3/CD28 coligation or PMA/Ca®* ionophore stimulation .
Whereas high concentrations of Ca** ionophore inhibit JINK-1 activity in primary T cells , these same concentrations of Ca** ionophore augment p38 MAPK activity .
This enhancement of p38 MAPK activity correlates closely with T cell proliferation induced by optimal concentrations of PMA and Ca** ionophore .
Furthermore , CsA inhibited p38 MAPK activation by anti-CD3 , anti-CD3 plus CD28 , or PMA plus Ca** ionophore .
Although the levels of activation of ERK-1 and p38 MAPK in CD3- or CD3/CD28-stimulated proliferating and naive primary mouse T cells are similar , JNK-1 is fully activated by CD28 ligation alone in proliferating T cells .
These data demonstrate that the requirements for full activation of JNK-1 and p38 MAPK differ among primary T cells , Jurkat T cells , and proliferating T cells .
Such differences may arise from the stage of activation of a T cell .
Jurkat T cells are transformed activated cells in continuous growth in culture , and these cells appear to differ somewhat in their signaling pathways from fresh isolated primary T cells that presumably consist mainly of T cells in a resting state .
As JINK-1 activation was not detected after CD3/CD28 costimulation in primary T cells , we further analyzed the reactivity and epitope specificity of the 37.51 anti-CD28 mAb used for T cell stimulation .
Costimulation by a wide concentration range of this mAb plus a single dose of anti-CD3 did not induce JNK-1 activation .
In contrast , optimum conditions of CD3/CD28 costimulation elicited the full activation of p38 MAPK .
While recent studies indicate that JINK-1 may be activated by CD3/CD28 coligation in mouse lymph node T cells , this was achievable only after preac-tivation of the T cells in the presence of plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs for 40 h ( 50 ) .
Replacement of the 37.51 anti-CD28 mAb with the PV-1 anti-CD28 mAb , which differs in its CD28 epitope specificity from the 37.51 mAb , also did not stimulate JNK-1 activation .
Furthermore , the 37.51 anti-CD28 mAb elicited full JINK-1 activation in preactivated proliferating mouse T cells .
Importantly , the results obtained from a solid-phase JNK assay were similar to those observed using in vitro kinase assays of JNK-1 and JNK-2 .
This suggests that the failure to detect JNK activation in response to CD3 and CD28 ligation is not due to the inability of the anti-JNK Abs used to immunoprecipitate all isoforms of JNK .
Note that the gel loading of equivalent amounts of JNK proteins was confirmed by anti-JNK immunoblotting , which excludes the possibility that these observations result from unequal amounts of kinase proteins loaded .
It is evident therefore that the failure to detect JNK activation in response to CD3/CD28 coligation in primary mouse T cells is not due to the use of an inappropriate anti-CD28 mAb .
Thus , JNK does not appear to mediate CD28 costimulatory signaling in primary mouse T cells .
Additional supportive evidence for a role for p38 MAPK in T cell costimulation was derived from the use of $ B203580 , a highly specific pyrinidyl imidazole inhibitor of p38 MAPK ( 17 ) .
$ B203580 effectively blocked T cell proliferation , cytokine ( IL-2 , IL-4 , and IFN-y ) production , and p38 MAPK activation following CD3 or CD3/CD28 stimulation .
These results lend credence to the 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q /310° jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 3828 idea that p38 MAPK plays an important role in TCR/CD28 costimulation of proliferation and cytokine production in primary T cells .
Since inhibition of T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion by S $ B203580 does not result from T cell death or T cell toxicity , $ B203580 treatment appears to induce the functional unrespon-siveness of T cells .
The latter observation supports the notion that p38 MAPK may regulate the entry of T cells into a state of anergy .
Consistent with this observation , SB203580 has been shown to inhibit anti-CD3-induced deletion of CD4 *CD8* thymocytes in fetal thymic organ culture ( 51 ) .
The protein complex that binds to the AP-1 transcriptional activation site of the IL-2 gene promoter region may comprise either a c-Jun-c-Jun homodimer or c-Jun-Fos heterodimer , and formation of the AP-1 complex is critical for the regulation of IL-2 gene expression ( 33 ) .
Decreased binding of the AP-1 protein complex to the IL-2 promoter has been implicated in the molecular basis of T cell anergy ( 52 ) .
Phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser and Ser'* activates c-Jun gene transcription ( 10 , 53 ) , and this phosphorylation is mediated by JNK , but not p38 MAPK ( 28 ) .
We found that CD3/ CD28 or PMA/Ca** ionophore costimulation did not result in appreciable JNK-1 or JNK-2 activation in primary mouse T cells ; rather , PMA/Ca `` * ionophore costimulation inhibited JNK-1 activity in these T cells .
Although we did not detect any c-Jun phosphorylation by p38 MAPK in CD3/CD28-costimulated mouse thy-mocytes , c-Jun protein synthesis induced by CD3 or CD3/CD28 ligation was completely inhibited by $ B203580 .
Consistent with our findings , SB203580 is known to block the induction of the c-Fos and c-Jun genes by various stimuli despite the lack of an effect of $ B203580 on c-Jun and ATF-2 phosphorylation ( 45 , 46 ) .
This raises the possibility that the phosphorylation of other transcription factors by p38 MAPK may be essential for c-Jun gene activation .
We have shown that ATF-2 can be phosphorylated by p38 MAPK in vitro , and phosphorylation of ATF-2 in the nucleus is inhibited by $ B203580 .
ATF-2 may therefore mediate the induction of c-Jun gene activation .
Furthermore , in monocytes that migrate to a site of inflammation , phosphorylation of MEF2C by p38 MAPK increases c-Jun transcription and inhibition of p38 MAPK activity diminishes LPS-induced c-Jun transcription ( 31 ) .
Taken together , our data suggest that p38 MAPK may be the major kinase responsible for the induction of c-Jun activation in primary mouse T cells .
Although JNK-3 has been identified ( 54 ) , JNK-3 is selectively expressed in the nervous system , and it is unlikely that JNK-3 is involved in the phosphorylation and induction of c-Jun gene expression in T cells .
The lack of an effect of $ B203580 on nuclear c-Fos expression may be explained by the fact that CD3 ligation also activates ERK-1 , which is not inhibited by $ B203580 .
In summary , our results suggest that p38 MAPK is involved in both TCR- and CD28-signaling pathways , and that p38 MAPK , but not JNK , plays an important role in signal integration during costimulation of primary mouse T cells .
p38 MAPK activity may be involved in the induction of c-Jun activation , augmentation of AP-1 transcriptional activity , and stimulation of IL-2 , IL-4 , and IFN-y production .
Inhibition of p38 MAPK activity may lead to the induction of T cell anergy .
