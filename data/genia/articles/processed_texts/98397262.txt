CL-01 cells are Ig M *IgD*CD30* and switch to IgG , IgA , and IgE when exposed to CD4O0L and IL-4 .
Switching is hampered by CD30 coengagement , possibly through interference with the CD4O0-mediated NF-xB-dependent transcriptional activation of downstream Cy genes .
The physiological relevance of this phenomenon is emphasized by similar CD30-mediated effects in naive B cells .
Expression of CD30 by these cells is induced by CD4OL but is inhibited by B cell receptor coengagement and/ or exposure to IL-6 and IL-12 .
Our data suggest that CD30 critically regulates the CD4O0-mediated differentiation of non-antigen-selected human B cells .
Introduction Recent findings have suggested that stimulation of B lymphocytes through their antigen receptor ( BCR ) can be effectively modulated by receptor inhibitory membrane-bound molecules , as exemplified by FeyRIIb ( Takai et al .
, 1996 ) .
Binding of antigen ( Ag ) -IgG complexes to FeyRIIb down-regulates BCR-induced B cell activation and would modulate the response of B cells to Ag while in the microenvironment of the germinal center ( GC ) , thereby dampening or terminating a specific antibody ( Ab ) response ( O'Rourke et al .
, 1997 ) .
Integrated inhibitory signaling systems have been identified in T cells .
For instance , CD152 ( CTLA-4 ) down-regulates the responses of CD28-activated T cells by inhibiting their IL-2 production ( Walunas et al .
, 1996 ) .

Page 2 responses is emphasized by the massive lymphoproliferation and multiorgan tissue destruction in CD152-deficient mice ( Tivol et al .
, 1995 ) .
In addition to Ag and cytokines , CD40 ligand ( CD4O0L , CD154 ) provides a potent stimulus for B cells .
CD4OL on T cells engages CD40 on naive B cells to induce proliferation , Ig class switching , and phenotypic differentiation ( Van Kooten and Banchereau , 1996 ) , suggesting that CD40 engagement by CD4OL is critical for B cell maturation to plasma cell and memory B cell in the GC .
The central role played by CD40 in the induction of these processes is exemplified by isotype class switching .
In the absence of other stimuli , CD40 engagement by CD4O0L triggers transcriptional activation of multiple Cy genes and induces abundant B cell secretion of transforming growth factor B and IL-10 , which mediate switch DNA recombination and , eventually , further differentiation ( Jumper et al .
, 1993 ; Cerutti et al .
, 1998 ; Zan et al .
, 1998a ) .
Surface receptors that facilitate or enhance CD40-dependent B cell responses have been identified , including BCR and IL-2 , IL-4 , and IL-10 receptors ( Van Kooten and Banchereau , 1996 ) , but surface molecules or signaling pathways that down-regulate CD40-mediated responses have not been so far described .
Here we have investigated the role of CD30 in the regulation of CD40-dependent Ig class switching .
CD30 is a 120 kDa type I transmembrane glycoprotein with sequence homology to members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) superfamily , including CD27 , CD40 , CD95 ( Fas ) , CD120a ( TNF-R1 ) , CD120b ( TNF-R2 ) , CD134 ( OX40 ) , and CDw137 ( 4-1BB ) ( Smith et al .
, 1994 ) .
Originally identified in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg neoplastic cells ( Stein et al .
, 1982 ) , CD30 subsequently has been shown to be expressed in non-Hodgkin B cell lymphomas as well as in virally transformed B cells ( Schwarting et al .
, 1989 ; Diirkop et al .
, 1992 ) .
While surface CD30 is virtually absent in normal circulating B lymphocytes , it has been detected in a small population of B lymphocytes surrounding the GCs of secondary lymphoid organs ( Stein et al .
, 1985 ; Schwarting et al .
, 1989 ) .
This finding , together with reports showing the expression of CD30L ( CD153 ) by activated T cells ( Smith et al .
, 1993 ) , suggests that CD30 is involved in B : T cell cognate interaction ( Clark and Ledbetter , 1994 ) .
However , the physiological stimuli that would induce CD30 expression in B cells and the role of CD30 in B cell development remain to be defined .
Our choice of CD30 as a possible modulator of CD40-driven B cell responses has been suggested by the finding that CD30 engagement down-regulates the CD40-mediated induction of germline Is-Cs transcripts in a human lymphoblastoid B cell line ( Jumper et al .
, 1995 , 1996 ) and by the demonstration that an element of the CD30 receptor signaling complex inhibits the activation of NF-xB ( Lee et al .
, 1997 ) , a crucial component of the CD40 signaling pathway ( Kehry , 1996 ) .
Finally , CD4O0L is expressed mainly by activated CD4* T cells ( Armitage et al .
, 1992 ) , whereas CD30L is expressed mainly by activated CD8* T cells ( Smith et al .
, 1993 ) , suggesting that these two molecules and their receptors may have antagonistic regulatory roles .
In these studies we show that naive surface ( s ) Ig M* sIgD*CD30- B cells express CD30 upon CD40 engagement by CD4OL and are thereafter susceptible to CD30-dependent inhibition of switching to IgG , IgA , and IgE .
This inhibition results from an interference with the CD40-mediated NF-xB-dependent Cy gene transcriptional activation , as suggested by the functional analysis of the human Cy3 promoter .

Page 3 counteracts the CD4O0-mediated CD30 induction , our findings suggest that CD30 negatively modulates the CD4O0-dependent differentiation of non- Ag-selected human B cells .
Results CD30 Engagement Hampers CD40-Mediated Germline Transcription of Downstream Cp Genes and Switching to IgG , IgA , and IgE in Human sigM+slIgD* B Cells We have recently identified a human monoclonal B cell line , CL-O1 cells , that expresses sIgM and sIgD and , upon exposure to CD4OL and IL-4 , switches to IgG , IgA , and IgE ( Cerutti et al .
, 1998 ) .
CD30 expression by unstimulated CL-O01 cells ( Figure 1A ) enabled us to address the potential role of this molecule in the modulation of CD4O0-induced germline Iy-Cy and productive VgDJy-Cy transcription as well as Ig DNA switch recombination .
To mimic the engagement of CD30 by its natural ligand , the MAb M44 ( IgG1 ) , an agonistic mouse MAb to human CD30 ( Smith et al .
, 1993 ; Gruss et al .
, 1995 ; Del Prete et al .
, 1995 ) , was immobilized onto polystyrene plates at 5 ug/ml .
Immobilized mouse MAb MOPC-21 ( IgG1 ) with irrelevant binding activity was used as control .
In parallel experiments , CD30 was engaged by CD3O0L as presented by CD8*CD30L* T cells .
To induce Ig class switching , CL-O1 cells were incubated with soluble human trimeric CD4O0L/leucin zipper fusion protein ( htCD4O0L ) ( 0.5 ug/ml ) in the presence of IL-4 ( 100 U/ml ) .
CL-O01 cells were cultured in medium only or in medium containing IL-4 alone , htCD4O0L alone , or htCD40L and IL-4 in the presence of either immobilized MOPC-21 or anti-CD30 MAbs .
Ig class switching was assessed by the analysis of germline In-Cy and productive VgDJgu , y1 , y2 , y3 , y4 , al , a2 , and & transcripts , which were amplified from CL-O1 cells cultured for 2 and 5 days , respectively .
CL-01 cells expressed only VgDJy-Cu transcripts ( Figure 1D ) , but failed to express In-Cy and VgDJy-Cy1 , -Cy2 , -Cy3 , -Cy4 , -Cal , -Ca2 , and -Cs transcripts upon incubation with MOPC-21 or anti-CD30 MAbs with or without IL-4 ( Figure 1C ) .
Upon exposure to htCD4O0L , CL-O1 cells expressed Iu-Cy , Iy1-Cy1 , I1y2-Cy2 , 1y3-Cy3 , and Ia1-Cal as well as VgDJy-Cy1 and VgDJy-Cal transcripts .
The addition of IL-4 to htCD40L extended germ-line transcription to 1y4-Cy4 , Ia2-Ca2 , Is-Cs , and productive transcription to VgDJy-Cy2 , -Cy3 , -Cy4 , -Ca2 , and -Cs .
CD30 coengagement by anti-CD30 MAb or CD3O0L on T cells virtually abrogated the expression of both htCD40L~ and htCD4O0L and IL-4-induced and VgDJy-Cy transcripts .
This effect was selective , as VgDJy-Cu transcription was spared ( Figure 1D ) , and was comparably induced by fixed CD8* T cells expressing CD3O0L ( data not shown ) .
Finally , specific extrachromosomal DNA recombination products could be readily detected in CL-O1 cells exposed to htCD4O0L and IL-4 ( Cerutti et al .
, 1998 ) , but not after CD30 coengagement ( data not shown ) .
Thus , in human B cells , CD30 occupancy hampers CD4OL and IL-4-induced Cp gene transcriptional activation and switch DNA recombination .
The CD30-dependent inhibitory effect on CD4O signaling was not related to the down-regulation of CD40 expression by CL-O01 cells , as these cells expressed CD40 at comparable density upon incubation with control MOPC-21 or anti-CD30 MAbs for 2 or 5 days ( Figure 1B ) .
Accordingly , CD30 engagement did not hamper the CD4O0-mediated up-regulation of surface CD23 ( FesRIN ) , CD54 ( ICAM-1 ) , CD80 ( B7.1 ) , or CD95 ( Fas ) ( data not shown ) , Immunity .

Naive B Cells Express CD30 and GC Phenotypic Traits When Exposed to CD40L sIgM *sIgD* CL-01 cells constitutively express CD30 , but only a few GC B cells express this member of the TNFR family in vivo ( Schwarting et al .
, 1989 ) .
We analyzed the ability of sIgM *sIgD* naive B cells to express CD30 mRNA and surface CD30 following CD40 engagement by CD4O0L .
Freshly isolated naive B cells ( not shown ) or naive B cells incubated for 3 days in medium only expressed CD19 ( a pan-B cell marker ) but lacked surface CD30 ( Figure 2A ) .
Upon incubation with htCD4O0L ( 0.5 ug/ml ! )
, about 80 % of B cells expressed surface CD30 and CD30 mRNA as well as the GC markers CD71 ( transferrin receptor ) , CD80 , CD86 ( B7.2 ) , and CD95 ( Fas ) ( Figure 2B ) .
A time course analysis showed that surface CD30 expression occurred as early as 24 hr following CD40 engagement and peaked after 4 days ( data not shown ) .
Naive B cells incubated with IL-1 $ 3 , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-7 , IL-10 , IL-12 , IL-13 , interferon-y ( IFNy ) , IFNa , TGFB1 , TNFa , lymphotoxin-B ( LTB ) , or immobilized anti-x and anti-A chain ( anti-BCR ) MAbs ( 2 ug/ml each ) did not express surface CD30 ( Figure 3 ) or CD30 mRNA ( data not shown ) , unless CD40 was engaged by htCD4O0L .
Thus , naive B cells express CD30 upon exposure to CD40L , but not to other stimuli , including BCR engagement and a variety of cytokines .
CD30 Engagement Hampers IgG , IgA , and IgE Secretion by Naive B Cells Induced by CD40L and Appropriate Cytokines We extended our findings to normal human B cells by assessing IgM , IgG , IgA , and IgE secretion in freshly isolated sIgM *sIgD* B cells cultured in medium only or in medium containing 0.5 ug/ml of htCD40L , 100 U/ml of IL-4 , 200 ng/ml of IL-10 ( this cytokine was added to increase the B cell proliferation ) , and 0.5 ng/ml of TGFBI ( this cytokine was used to optimize the IgA secretion ) in the presence of either control MOPC-21 or agonistic anti-CD30 immobilized MAbs ( 5 ug/ml ) .
Naive B cells were seeded onto MOPC-21 or anti-CD30 MAb coated plates for an 8 day culture after preincubation in medium only or in medium containing htCD4O0L to up-regulate CD30 expression .
Upon exposure to htCD4O0L and cytokines , B cells increased IgM secretion and produced IgG , IgA , and IgE in the presence of MOPC-21 MAb ( Figure 4 ) .
Consistent with our findings in CL-O1 cells , this IgG , IgA , and IgE , but not IgM , secretion was significantly decreased when MOPC-21 MAb was substituted with anti-CD30 MAb .
This CD30-mediated inhibitory effect was not related to a failure of CD4O0L to engage appropriate numbers of CD40 molecules , since CD30-stimulated B cells did not down-regulate the expression of CD40 as compared to unstimulated B cells ( data not shown ) .
As members of the TNFR superfamily can be involved in cell death by apoptosis , we determined the percentage of viable B cells after incubation with MOPC-21 or anti-CD30 MAbs by trypan blue dye exclusion .
These experiments showed that the survival of normal B cells as well as CL-O1 cells is comparable in the presence or in the absence of CD30 ligation ( Figure 4 ) .
Ig class switching has been suggested to be linked to B cell proliferation ( Hodgkin et al .
, 1996 ) .
We verified whether CD30 signaling reduces CD4O0L-induced DNA synthesis in naive B cells cultured for 5 days as above .

Page 5 CD30 MAb incorporated [ H ] thymidine ( TdR ) at similar rates in response to htCD40L and/or cytokines ( Figure 4 ) .
Similar results were obtained in CL-O1 cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , CD30 engagement negatively regulates Ig class switching and secretion , but not proliferation , in normal B cells induced by CD4O0L and appropriate cytokines .
BCR Engagement , IL-6 , and IL-12 Down-Regulate CD40L-Induced Expression of Surface CD30 by Naive B Cells Despite the massive proportion of CD4O0-responsive B cells , only a few B cells express surface CD30 in vivo , suggesting that the CD40-dependent generation of CD30* B cells is tightly regulated .
To identify the stimuli possibly involved in the negative regulation of CD40L-induced CD30 expression , naive B cells were cocultured for 3 days with htCD4OL in the presence of the above reported cytokines and/or immobilized anti-x and anti-A chain ( anti-BCR ) MAbs ( 2 ug/ml each ) as a surrogate of Ag .
Most of these stimuli had no significant effect on the expression of CD30 , but BCR engagement or , to a lesser extent , IL-6 or IL-12 significantly reduced the proportion of CD40L-induced CD30* B cells without affecting the expression of the GC markers CD71 , CD80 , CD86 , and CD95 ( Figures 2C and 3 ) .
The combination of anti-BCR MAbs , IL-6 , and IL-12 reduced by up to 80 % the CD40-dependent CD30 expression ( Figure 3 ) , but not that of the above GC molecules ( not shown ) .
In agreement with this finding , anti-BCR MAbs prevented the CD30-dependent inhibition of Ig class switching in naive B cells cultured with CD4OL and appropriate cytokines ( Figure 4 ) .
Thus , in normal B cells , CD4O0L-induced CD30 expression is negatively regulated by BCR coengagement and exposure to IL-6 and/or IL-12 .
CD30 Engagement Hampers CD40-Mediated Transcriptional Activation of the Human Cy3 Germline Gene Promoter We have shown that the transcriptional activation of the human Cy3 germline gene is regulated by the evolutionary conserved sequence ( ECS ) that lies 5 `` of the corresponding Iy3 region and is synergistically induced by CD4OL and IL-4 ( Schaffer et al .
, 1998 ) .
The CD40-mediated activation of this cis regulatory gene sequence impinges on a responsive element ( RE ) that consists of two tandemly arrayed NF-KB binding sites .
To verify whether the CD30-mediated inhibition of the CD40-dependent Cy3 germline gene transcription ( Figure 1C ) was due to an interference with the Cy3 gene transcriptional activation , CL-01 cells were transfected with an ECS-Iy3-pGL3 luciferase gene reporter vector and then cultured with htCD4O0L ( 0.5 ug/ml ) and/or IL-4 ( 500 U/ml ! )
in the presence of immobilized control MOPC-21 or anti-CD30 MAbs ( 5 ug/ml ) .
After 24 hr , the luciferase activity was measured in these induced CL-O1 cells and expressed as fold induction compared to the basal activity of cells cultured in medium only .
The Cy3 promoter was activated by htCD4O0L or IL-4 , and this activation was synergistically increased by the combination of these stimuli ( Figure 5A ) .
Anti-CD30 , but not MOPC-21 MAbs , reduced by about 50 % the activation induced by htCD4OL alone or htCD4O0L and IL-4 , but not that elicited by IL-4 alone .
This inhibition was also evident when CL-O01 cells were transfected with an isolated ECS-Iy3 CD4ORE included in a SV40-pGL3 minimal promoter plasmid ( Figure 5B ) .
Addition of saturating amounts of neutralizing anti-IFNy ( Figures 5A and 5B ) , anti-IL-6 , anti-IL-10 , or anti- Abs ( data not shown ) did not reverse the above reported Immunity .

CD30 Engagement Hampers CD40-Mediated Binding of p50/p65 , p50/c-Rel , and p50/p50 NF-xB Complexes to the CD40 Responsive Element of the Human Cy3 Germline Gene Promoter To verify whether CD30 coengagement is associated with a decreased binding of NF-xB to the ECS-Iy3 CD4ORE , CL-O01 cells were cultured in medium only or in medium containing htCD40L ( 0.5 ug/ml ! )
in the presence of either control MOPC-21 MAb or anti-CD30 immobilized MAbs ( 5 ug/ml ) .
Parallel experiments were performed using 100 ug/ml of cycloheximide ( CHX ) as inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis .
Nuclear proteins were extracted after 6 hr of culture , incubated ( 3 ug ) with a radiolabeled DNA probe spanning the ECS-Iy3 xBI1 site ( Figure 6A ) , and then fractioned through a 6 % polyacrylamide gel .
Nuclear proteins from CL-O01 cells cultured with control MOPC21 MAb displayed a weak DNA binding activity represented by two shifted bands with slower ( Figure 6B , complex A ) and faster ( Figure 6B , complex B ) mobility ( Figure 6B , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
The binding of both complexes was slightly increased by anti-CD30 MAb ( Figure 6B , lanes 4 and 5 ) , while it was dramatically enhanced by htCD40L ( Figure 6B , lanes 6 and 7 ) .
CD4OL induced also a third complex with the fastest mobility ( Figure 6B , complex C ) .
Shifted bands were specific , as they were cleared by the preincubation of CD4O0L-induced nuclear proteins with an excess of unlabeled wild type ( Figure 6B , competitor 1 , lane 11 ) , but not mutated , xB1 probe ( Figure 6B , competitor 2 , lane 12 ) .
The identity of complexes A , B , and C to NF-xB/Rel family members was demonstrated by the ability of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing a palindromic NF-xB binding sequence from the Ig x promoter to compete with the labeled xB1 probe for binding to CD4O0L-induced nuclear proteins ( Figure 6B , competitor 3 , lane 13 ) .
To identify the composition of complexes A , B , and C , nuclear proteins from htCD40L-induced cells were preincubated for 30 min with a control Ab with irrelevant binding activity or with Abs to human p50 , p52 , p65 ( Rel A ) , c-Rel ( Rel ) , or Rel B proteins .
Anti-p50 , anti-p65 , and anti-c-Rel Abs decreased B1 binding by complexes A , B and C , complex A , and complex B , respectively , whereas control anti-thyreoglobulin , anti-p52 , and anti-Rel B Abs did not ( Figure 6B , lanes 14-19 ) , indicating that complexes A and B corresponded to p50/p65 and p50/c-Rel heterodimers , respectively , and complex C to p50/p50 homodimers .
The addition of anti-CD30 MAb greatly decreased the B1 binding by p50/p65 , p50/c-Rel , and p50/p50 complexes regardless of the presence of CHX ( Figure 6B , compare lanes 8 and 9 with lanes 6 and 7 ) .
The specificity of this inhibition was confirmed by the inability of an immobilized MAb to CD27 , another TNFR superfamily member expressed by activated normal B cells and CL-O1 cells ( data not shown ) , to inhibit the CD4O0L-induced binding ( Figure 6B , lane 10 ) .
A similar CD30-dependent inhibition of binding to the Cy3 CD4O0RE DNA was achieved using nuclear proteins from freshly isolated normal B cells ( data not shown ) .
These data indicate that CD30 signaling inhibits the CD4O0-mediated binding of p50/p65 , p50/c-Rel , and p50/p50 NF-xB complexes to the CD4O0RE of the human Cy3 gene promoter in the absence of de novo protein synthesis .

Page 7 Discussion These studies show that in human B cells CD30 effectively down-regulates Ig class switching to all downstream isotypes by inhibiting targeted DNA recombination to Cy , Ca , , and Cs through interference with the CD40-mediated NF-xB-dependent Cp germline gene transcription .
They also show that CD30 is induced in naive B cells by engagement of CD40 by CD4O0L , and this induction is hampered by BCR engagement and , to a lesser extent , exposure to IL-6 or IL-12 , in a fashion that is consistent with a critical role of CD30 in regulating the CD4O0-dependent GC B cell differentiation .
Effective T and B lymphocyte responses involve the clonal expansion of Ag-specific cells and their differentiation into effector cells .
This critical phase of expansion/ differentiation is driven by signals delivered by the receptor for Ag , costimulatory molecules , and cytokine receptors , and it is finely tuned by the simultaneous activation of inhibitory signaling pathways , which likely play a major role in the self-limitation of the immune response .
In the B cell compartment , CD5 and CD22 coreceptors as well as the FeyRIIb molecule negatively regulate BCR-induced B cell responses ( O'Rourke et al .
, 1997 ) .
Since BCR engagement by Ag provides a major signal for B cell proliferation , the negative modulation of BCR-mediated signals by the above coreceptors may be critical to limit the clonal expansion of Ag-stimulated B cells .
Signals delivered by cytokine receptors may also be tuned by inhibitory pathways .
Recently , cytokine-inducible inhibitors of signaling , such as Janus kinase ( Jak ) -binding proteins , have been found to down-regulate signals emanating from Jak-STAT ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) -coupled cytokine receptors , including IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-4 , and IL-6 receptors ( Endo et al .
, 1997 ; Naka et al .
, 1997 ) .
While BCR engagement by Ag is crucial to trigger Ig somatic hypermutation , CD40 is the major driver of B cell proliferation and differentiation in the GC ( Van Kooten and Banchereau , 1996 ; Zan et al .
, 1998b ) .
Because of the critical role of CD4Q in the GC B cell development , it is conceivable that CD4O0-mediated B cell responses , including proliferation and differentiation , are finely tuned by the activation of signaling pathways that negatively regulate CD4Q signaling .
This negative feedback would be particularly important to limit the proliferation and differentiation of those CD4O-activated B cells that are not positively selected by the Ag .
B cells express CD95 upon CD40 engagement by CD4O0L , and CD95 engagement by CD95L would prevent the CD4O0-mediated proliferation of non-Ag-selected B cells by inducing their apoptosis ( Schattner et al .
, 1995 ) .
Here we show that non-Ag-selected B cells express CD30 upon CD40 engagement by CD4OL and that CD30 engagement by CD30L counteracts CD4O0L : CD4O0-induced B cell differentiation , including Ig class switching .
In CL-O1 B cells , CD40 engagement by CD4OL effectively induces Iu-Cy , Iy1-Cy1 , Iy2-Cy2 , 1y3-Cy3 , and Ia 1-Cal transcription , endogenous TGFB production , and eventually switch DNA recombination to Cy1 and Cal .
The addition of IL-4 extends germline transcription to I1y4-Cy4 , Ia2-Ca2 , and Is-Cs and triggers switch DNA recombination to all remaining downstream isotypes , as indicated by the detection of the corresponding productive Ig transcripts and switch circles ( Cerutti et al .
, 1998 ) .
The present experiments Immunity .

Page 8 show that CD30 signaling inhibits the transcriptional activation of all of the above Cy genes as well as their targeted recombination without interfering with the expression of surface CD40 .
They also show that CD30 coengagement does not interfere with the expression of the VgDJy-Cu transcript , nor does it affect other CD4O0-mediated B cell responses including proliferation , enhancement of Ig M secretion , or CD23 , CD54 , CD80 , CD86 , and CD95 up-regulation ( Ranheim and Kipps , 1993 ; Schattner et al .
, 1995 ; Hanissian and Geha , 1997 ) .
These CD40-dependent processes would entail the induction of a vast array of transcription factors .
It is tempting to speculate that CD30 preferentially interferes with those CD40-emanating signaling pathways that are related to Ig class switching .
The signaling pathway by which CD30 inhibits Ig class switching would ultimately impinge on the cis regulatory elements that lie upstream of the human Cy regions .
As we have shown ( Schaffer et al .
, 1998 ) , engagement of CD40 by CD4OL induces the activation of the Cy3 promoter , and this activation is boosted by IL-4 .
CD30 coengagement reduces the activation of the Cy3 promoter induced by CD4OL alone and CD4O0L and IL-4 , but not IL-4 alone , suggesting that CD30 interferes with the CD40 but not the IL-4 signaling pathway .
The failure of neutralizing Abs to IL-6 , IL-10 , or IFNy to affect the CD30-mediated inhibition of the CD4O0-driven Cy3 germline gene transcriptional activation virtually excludes the possibility that this inhibition is mediated by endogenous IL-6 , IL-10 , TGF $ B , or IFNy ( Gruss et al .
, 1995 ; Yoshimoto et al .
, 1997 ; Cerutti et al .
, 1998 ; Zan et al .
, 1998a ) , which are all known to modulate Cy gene transcriptional activation and/or B cell proliferation ( Stavnezer et al .
, 1996 ; Morse et al .
, 1997 ) .
Rather , our experiments show that CD30 triggering inhibits the CD4O0L-induced germline transcription of Cy3 and , possibly , other Cp genes by hampering the activation of transcription factors binding to the upstream cis regulatory sequences .
CD40 cross-linking induces the activation and nuclear translocation of different NF-xB/Rel family members , including p50 , p65 ( Rel A ) , and c-Rel , which are thought to regulate the CD40-dependent germline transcription of a given Cy gene by binding critical DNA elements located within the corresponding upstream promoter ( Stavnezer , 1996 ) .
Accordingly , the CD40-dependent transcriptional activation of the human Cy3 germline gene promoter relies upon the presence of two tandemly arrayed xB sites , which bind p50/p65 and p50/c-Rel heterodimers as well as p50/p50 homodimers .
By showing that CD30 significantly decreases CD4O0-induced binding of p50/p65 , p50/c-Rel , and p50/p350 NF- « B complexes to this CD4O0RE , our findings indicate that CD30 signaling specifically interferes with the CD4O0-mediated NF-xB dependent transcriptional activation of human Ig Cy genes .
The specificity of this inhibition is suggested by our demonstration that cross-linking of CD27 , another member of the TNFR superfamily expressed by activated B cells , including CL-O1 cells , does not affect the CD4O0L-induced binding to the B1 sequence .
CD40 cross-linking activates NF-xB/Re !

, 1995 ; Kehry , 1996 ) .
Accumulating evidence suggests that CD4O0-mediated B cell responses can be altered by signals able to quantitatively and/or qualitatively modify the TRAF composition of the CD40 receptor complex ( Kuhné et al .

Page 9 of the TRAF-2-mediated NF-KB activation , including I-TRAF/TANK , A20 , TRAF-3 , and TRIP , a TRAF-2 interacting protein that associates with the CD30 cytoplasmic domain , might be associated with the negative regulation of the CD4O0 : TRAF-2 signaling pathway ( Rothe et al .
, 1995 , 1996 ; Song et al .
, 1996 ; Lee et al .
, 1997 ) .
Our experiments suggest that the CD30-dependent inhibition of CD4O0L : CD4O0-induced Ig class switching in human B cells does not rely on CD30-inducible genes , but rather on the modulation of preformed signal transducers .
Triggering of surface CD30 may induce recruitment of TRAF-2 to the CD30 cytoplasmic domain , thereby subtracting TRAF-2 from its association with the CD40 cytoplasmic domain ( Ansieau et al .
, 1996 ) .
The rapid protease-mediated degradation of CD30-bound TRAF-2 might induce depletion of cytosolic TRAF-2 and further desensitization of the CD4O0 receptor complex ( Duckett and Thompson , 1997 ) .
An alternative but not mutually exclusive possibility is that CD30 cross-linking may alter the balance between TRAF-2 and inhibitors of the TRAF-2-dependent NF-KB activation such as I-TRAF , A20 , and TRAF-3 .
Finally , simultaneous CD4O and CD30 multimerization might bring the corresponding cognate signaling complexes in such close proximity that CD30-bound TRIP would associate and inhibit CD40-bound TRAF-2 .
The CD30-induced redistribution , decreased availability , and/or inactivation of TRAF-2 might impair the CD40-mediated TRAF-2-dependent activation of NF-xB-inducing kinase and IB kinase , two compounds that mediate NF-xB activation by inducing IxB phosphorylation ( Régnier et al .
, 1997 ) .
These membrane-proximal and other more distal models of CD30-mediated interference on CD40 signals are currently under study .
The different outcome of CD40-mediated signals in the presence of CD30 engagement by CD30L suggests a key regulatory role of CD30 in the homeostasis of GC B cells and is reminescent of the ability of other TNF receptor : ligand pairs such as €CD27 : CD70 and OX40 : OXAOL to modulate and complement CD4O0L : CD4O0-mediated B cell responses ( Stuber et al .
, 1995 ; Jacquot et al .
, 1997 ) .
We have found that naive B cells express surface CD30 as early as 24 hr after CD40 engagement by CD4O0L , that is , within the same time frame required by activated T cells to express surface CD3O0L ( Smith et al .
, 1993 ) .
CD4OL is expressed by CD4* T cells as early as 4 hr after appropriate stimulation ( Van Kooten and Banchereau , 1996 ) , and CD40 engagement by CD4OL initiates germline transcription of Cy genes in B cells within a few hours ( Stavnezer , 1996 ) .
The differential timing of CD30 , CD30L , and CD4OL expression further supports our contention that CD30 is critical for the regulation of CD4O0-driven Ig class switching in human B cells .
Despite the crucial role played by CD4O0L : CD4O0-mediated T-B cell contact in the development of normal B cell responses ( Aruffo et al .
, 1993 ) , only rare GC B cells express surface CD30 , suggesting that the generation of these elements is tightly regulated in vivo .
By showing that BCR engagement , IL-6 , and IL-12 prevent the CD4O0L-induced expression of CD30 but not that of GC markers , our findings suggest that human B cells express this TNFR-like molecule upon interaction with CD4*CD40L* T cells only in the absence of Ag-presenting cells such as dendritic cells ( Figure 7 ) .
These cells would antagonize the CD30 expression by B cells in two ways : by engaging the BCR through Ag complexes and by secreting IL-6 and IL-12 in response to the engagement of their surface CD40 by T cell CD4OL ( Grewal and Flawell , 1996 ) .
BCR engagement has been suggested to inhibit the CD4O0-mediated up-regulation of another member of the TNFR family , CD95 ( Choe et al .
, 1996 ; Kuhné et al .
, 1997 ) .

Page 10 transitory expression of CD4O0L by T cells and/or the rapid cleavage of CD30 through disintegrin metalloproteinases released by CD4O-activated dendritic cells ( Mueller et al .
, 1997 ) may represent two additional mechanisms limiting the CD30 expression by B cells in vivo .
In conclusion , our findings indicate that the CD30 pathway represents a negative feedback limiting the CD4O0-driven progression of nonAg-selected B cells into isotype-switched B cells .
Defects involving the CD30 pathway and/or the processes leading to the deletion of CD30* B cells might either generate autoreactive B clonotypes secreting IgG , IgA , or IgE with pathogenic potential and/or favor the neoplastic transformation of CD30+* B cells .
Experimental Procedures Cells The human CL-O1 B cell line has been reported ( Cerutti et al .
, 1998 ) .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from healthy subjects and depleted of T cells by sheep red blood cells rosetting .
T cell-depleted cells were first reacted with a mouse MAb to human IgD ( Southern Biotechnology Associates , Birmingham , AL ) , and then with magnetic Microbeads conjugated with goat anti-mouse IgG ( Miltenyi Biotec , Auburn , CA ) .
sIgD* B cells were segregated using a magnetic sorter MACS ( Miltenyi Biotec ) .
CD8*CD30L* T cells were obtained from total T cells after depletion of CD4* T cells with CD4-coated magnetic beads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) and incubation with 1:100 phytohemoagglutinin ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) and 100 U/ml !
of IL-2 ( Genzyme , Cambridge , MA ) for 2 days .
For T-B cell cocultures , CD30L* T cells were fixed in 0.5 % paraformaldehyde and washed twice with PBS .
The inhibitory activity of these cells on Ig class switching was critically CD30L-dependent , as it was prevented by their preincubation with 10 ug/ml of human CD30-1IgG1 Fc chimeric protein ( Immunex , Seattle , WA ) .
Culture Conditions B cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5 % heat-inactivated FBS ( Life Technologies ) , 2 mM L-glutamine , 100 U/mL penicillin , 100 ug/ml !
streptomycin , and 2 % HEPES .
CL-01 cells ( 104 ) or naive B cells ( 10° ) were seeded in 96-well microculture plates with or without htCD40L ( 0.5 ug/ml ! )
( Immunex ) at the final volume of 200 ul .
T cells were used at 2 x 104 or 2 x 10°/well .
MOPC-21 ( Sigma Chemicals , St. Louis , MO ) , anti-CD30 ( Immunex ) , and anti-CD27 ( Immunotech , Westbrook , ME ) MAbs were coated onto polystyrene plates at 5 ug/ml .
BCR triggering was performed using 2 ug/ml of anti- and anti-A chain MAbs ( ICN Pharmaceutical , Costa Mesa , CA ) .
Recombinant human IL-1 , IL-2 , IL-6 , IL-7 , IL-13 , TGFPB1 , TNFa , LTB , IFNy ( Genzyme Co. ) , IL-4 , IL-10 ( Schering-Plough ) , and IL-12 ( a gift from Dr. B. Perussia ) were used at a concentration of 10 ng/ml , 200 U/ml , 200 ng/ml , 100 U/ml , 5 ng/ml , 0.5 ng/ml1 , 2.5 ng/ml , 2.5 ng/ml , 200 U/ml , 100 U/ml , 200 ng/ml , and 1 ng/ml , respectively .
Neutralizing Abs to human IFNy ( a gift from Dr. B. Perussia ) as well as to IL-6 , IL-10 , and TGFB ( Genzyme ) were used at 1:500 and 30 ug/ml , respectively .
Cycloheximide ( Sigma Chemicals ) was used at 100 ug/ml .

Unconjugated mouse M81 MAb to human CD3O0L ( Immunex ) was labeled with FITC-conjugated goat Ab to mouse Ig ( PharMingen ) .
Cells ( 104 ) were acquired using a FACScalibur analyzer and data were processed using a Macintosh CELL-Quest software program ( Becton Dickinson ) .
Proliferation Assays B cells ( 10° ) were seeded in 96-well U-shaped microtiter plates under different conditions and pulsed with 1 uCi of [ °H ] JTdR at day 5 of culture .
After 18 hr , cells were harvested for the measurement of [ °H ] JTdR uptake .
The stimulation index was calculated according to the formula : mean of cpm of triplicates with stimulus/mean of cpm of triplicates without stimulus .
Amplification of CD30 , Iy-CpH , and VyDJp-C » Transcripts RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Total RNA Kit ( Qiagen , Chatsworth , CA ) , and equal amounts ( 3 ug ) were reversed transcribed into cDNA using the SuperScript reverse transcriptase ( Life Technologies ) and an oligo ( dT ) 1 ; _1g primer .
cDNA was measured and utilized in equal amounts as template to PCR amplify ( 20 cycles ) In-Cy and VyDJy-Cy transcripts and B-actin ( Cerutti et al .
, 1998 ) .
To amplify CD30 cDNA , PCRs were performed using 1U of Taq polymerase ( Perkin-Elmer Cetus Corp. , Norwalk , CT ) , and the specific sense 5-CACCGGAGGGCCTGCAGGAAGCGAAT-3 ' and antisense CCCAGGCCTCACTTTCCAGAGGCAGC-3 ' primers .
The following conditions were used : denaturation , 1 min at 94°C ; annealing , 1 min at 60 °C ; and extension , 1 min at 72°C for 30 cycles .
Luciferase Gene Reporter Assays The full length ( -449 to +265 ) ECS-Iy3 region and its CD4O0RE ( -238 to -188 ) were cloned into a pGL3 Basic vector and pGL3 Promoter vector , respectively ( Schaffer et al .

CL-01 cells ( 16 x 105/m1 ) were mixed with 40 ul of plasmid DNA-TE solution containing 20 ug of pGL3 vector and 10 ng of pRL-CMV control vector ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .
Electroporation and measurements were performed as described ( Schaffer et al .
, 1998 ) .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays B cells were cultured for 6 hr , and nuclear proteins were extracted using a modified version of Schreiber 's method ( Schaffer et al .
, 1998 ) .
A double-stranded xB1 oligonucleotide probe encompassing nucleotides -236 to -213 of the Cy3 CD40RE was prepared by annealing the sense primer 5-GTGTCTGGACTCCCCCTCG-3 ' to the antisense primer 5 `` -AGAGGGCGAGGGGGAGTCCAGA-3 ' .
This probe was labeled with [ a- `` P ] dCTP and [ a- `` °P ] dGTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) .
DNA binding reactions and shift assays were performed as described Immunity .

Role of CD30 in the Regulation of Human CD40-Dependent B Cell Differentiation In the upper limb of the scheme , a naive CD30 B cell differentiates into a GC B cell and undergoes switching to IgG , IgA , or IgE upon CD40 engagement by CD4OL expressed by an activated CD4* T cell and exposure to T cell-derived cytokines .
BCR coengagement by Ag as well as IL-6 and IL-12 secreted by an activated dendritic cell inhibit the expression of CD30 by this GC B cell .
In the lower limb , a naive B cell is activated by a CD4*CDA4O0L* T cell in the absence of BCR coengagement by Ag complexes on the surface of a dendritic cell and , therefore , expresses CD30 .
In this non-Ag-selected B cell , CD40L-induced switching to IgG , IgA , or IgE is negatively modulated through CD30 engagement by CD30L expressed on either a CD4¢* or a CD8* T cell .
