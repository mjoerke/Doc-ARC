Critical Cytoplasmic Domains of Human Interleukin-9 Receptor a Chain in Interleukin-9-mediated Cell Proliferation and Signal ( Received for publication , December 9 , 1996 , and in revised form , June 13 , 1997 ) Yuan Xiao Zhu $ § , Hui Bin Sun # § , Monica Lik-Shing Tsang1 , Jon McMahel # , Susan Grigsby $ , Tinggui Yin # § , and Yu-Chung Yang # §|** From the Departments of { Medicine ( Hematology /Oncology ) and ||Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , Indiana University School of Medicine and the §Walther Cancer Institute , Indianapolis , Indiana 46202 and ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , Minnesota 55413-2647 Interleukin-9 receptor ( IL-9R ) complex consists of a ligand-specific « chain and IL-2R y chain .
In this study , two regions in the cytoplasmic domain of human IL-I9Ra « were found to be important for IL-9-mediated cell growth .
A membrane-proximal region that contains the BOX1 consensus sequence is required for IL-9-induced cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinases ( JAKs ) .
Deletion of this region or internal deletion of the BOX1 motif abrogated IL-9-induced cell proliferation and signal transduction .
However , substitution of the Pro-X-Pro in the BOX1 motif with Ala-X-Ala failed to abolish IL-9-induced cell proliferation but decreased IL-9-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases , insulin receptor substrate-2 , and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) and expression of ec-mye and junB .
Another important region is downstream of the BOX1 motif and contains a STAT3 binding motif YLPQ .
Deletion of this region significantly impaired IL-9-induced cell growth , activation of JAK kinases , insulin receptor substrate-2 , and STAT3 and expression of early response genes .
A point mutation changing YLPQ into YLPA greatly reduced IL-9-induced activation of STAT3 and expression of ec-mye but did not affect cell proliferation .
These results suggest that cooperation or cross-talk of signaling molecules associated with different domains of IL-I9Ra « other than STAT3 is essential for IL-9-mediated cell growth .
Interleukin 9 ( IL-9 ) is a T cell-derived multifunctional growth factor that exerts its effects on activated T cells , B cells , mast cells , and hematopoietic progenitors ( 1 , 2 ) .
The in vitro biological functions of IL-9 include its ability to stimulate proliferation of activated T cells , to enhance production of immu-noglobulin in B cells , and to promote proliferation and differentiation of mast cells and hematopoietic progenitors ( 3-7 ) .
The involvement of IL-9 in lymphomagenesis has been suggested by in vivo studies ( 8 ) in which a higher susceptibility to * This work was supported in part by United States Public Health Service Grants RO1HL48819 and RO1DK 50570 ( to Y.-C .

21334 T cell lymphoma was observed in transgenic mice expressing IL-9 constitutively and by in vitro experiments ( 9 ) in which IL-9 has been shown to protect mouse lymphoma cells from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis .
The functions of IL-9 are mediated by the IL-9 receptor ( IL-9R ) , which consists of a ligand-specific a chain and IL-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) y chain .
IL-2R y chain , normally referred to as the common y chain ( 7 , chain ) , is shared by receptors for IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-7 , IL-9 , and IL-15 ( 10-13 ) .
Some of the signaling pathways elicited by these cy-tokines are quite similar , which probably explains in part the functional redundancy of these cytokines .
IL-9R a chain ( IL-9Ra ) is IL-9-specific and is responsible for IL-9 binding .
The cDNAs encoding mouse and human IL-9Ra have been cloned ( 14-15 ) .
IL-9Ra belongs to the hematopoietic receptor superfamily and has no intrinsic tyrosine kinase motif in its cytoplasmic region .
Several homologous sequences , such as the BOX1 consensus sequence and a serine-rich region , which were demonstrated to be important for IL-2R $ function ( 16 ) , are also present in the cytoplasmic region of human IL-9Ra ( hIL-9Ra ) .
Recently , it has been shown that several biochemical events including tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases , activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) proteins , and expression of nuclear proto-oncogenes are involved in IL-9-mediated signal transduction ( 17-19 ) .
In the present study , a series of deletions and point mutations were made in the cytoplasmic region of hIL-9Ra .
These mutants were transfected into a mouse IL-9-dependent T cell line , TS1 , to investigate the functions of different domains of hIL-9Ra in IL-9-induced cell proliferation and activation of JAK/STAT and primary response genes .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmid Construction-The full-length cDNA for hIL-9Ra « was provided by Dr. Ming-Shi Chang at Amgen ( Thousand Oaks , CA ) .
The hIL-9Ra cDNA fragments containing different C-terminal truncations of the cytoplasmic region were generated by polymerase chain reaction .
The full-length and C-terminal-truncated cDNAs for hIL-9Ra were subcloned into blunt-ended Xbal site in pRe/CMV vector ( Invitrogen ) .
Site-directed mutations in the BOX1 and STAT3 binding motifs ( BOXm and STAT3 m ) within the cytoplasmic domain of hIL-9Ra were generated using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis systems ( Promega ) .
Internal deletion of the BOX1L motif ( between amino acids 298 and 815 ) in hIL-9Ra ( BOXd ) was performed using the polymerase chain reaction method as described previously ( 20 ) .
To construct pFlagIL-9R plasmids , an NdeI-Xbal restricted fragment from pFlag-CMV-1 expression vector ( Eastman Kodak Co. ) that contained part of the CMV promoter and the coding sequence for preprotrypsin leader peptide and flag epitope tag was subcloned into various pRe/CMV-IL-9R constructs to replace Ndel-Xbal-restricted DNA fragments .
The resulting plasmids were designated as pFlagIL-9R W , pFlagIL-9R D1 , pFlagIL-9R D2 , pFlagIL-9R D3 , pFlagIL-9R D4 , pFlagIL-9R BOXm , pFlagIL-9R STAT3 m , and This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog IL-9 Receptor a Domains Critical for Signal Transduction 21335 Feo TM _ BOX1 SR IL-9R ox % w 22 w [ , \ , \| % aas D1 C -- E-I _BPH ] aa460 D2 [ F 1 aad22 pRe/CMV D3 C ET IAA ] aa338 BGH poly ( A ) D4 aa295 -_ CMV BOXd I % I BOXm ( PXP - > AXA ) som | rt -- p 1 TAT3m ( YLPQ - > YLPA ) STAT3m [ [ j 7 l % I Fig .

All plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing .
Cell Cultures and Transfection-Murine T cell clone , TS1 , was maintained in Click 's medium ( Irvine Scientific ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and 1 ng/ml mIL-9 ( R & D Systems ) .
For stable expression of hIL-9Ra , TS1 cells in exponential growth phase were suspended at 2 X 10 `` cells/ml in culture medium .
0.3 ml of these cells was transferred into a 0.4-cm cuvette with 30 ug of pFlagIL-9R DNAs .
Following a single 250-V/960-microfarad pulse with Bio-Rad Gene Pulser , each sample was cultured in 5 ml of medium with mIL-9 ( 1 ng/m ! )
at 87 °C .
Stable transfectants were isolated by selection in 1 mg/ml G418 for 3 weeks .
Cells expressing high levels of FlagIL-9R proteins were further enriched by Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter using an anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody ( Kodak ) and goat anti-mouse IgG1-fluorescein isothiocyanate ( Southern Biotechnology Associates , Inc. ) .
Proliferation Assay-Transfectants expressing different forms of hIL-9Ra were washed three times , seeded in triplicates at 5 X 10° cells/200 ul of culture medium/well either without growth factors or supplemented with various concentrations of hIL-9 .
After incubation at 37 °C for 8 days , 1 uCi of [ °HJthymidine ( Amersham Life Science , Inc. , specific activity 5 Ci/mmol ) was added per well and further incubated for 4 h at 87°C before harvest .
The incorporated [ *HIthymidine was determined using a liquid scintillation counter ( Beckman Instruments , LS 60001C ) .
Western Blots and Immunoprecipitation-Cells were starved and stimulated with hIL-9 as described previously ( 18 ) .
Briefly , about 2 X 10 `` cells were starved for 8 h at 37°C in the absence of hIL-9 and serum , then cells were collected and stimulated without or with hIL-9 ( 30 ng/m ! )
for 5 min .
Cells were then lysed in 0.5 ml of 1 % Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing different proteinase inhibitors ( 21 ) .
After cen-trifugation , clear cell lysates were obtained and incubated with anti-JAK1 , anti-JAK8 , anti-IRS2 , or anti-STAT3 antibody ( Upstate Biotech-nology , Inc. ) overnight at 4 °C .
Then protein A-agarose was added , and the mixture was rotated for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and separated by 7.5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membranes and immunoblotted sequentially with anti-phosphotyrosine ( Upstate ) , anti-JAK1 , anti-JAK3 , anti-IRS-2 , and anti-STAT3 antibodies and finally detected with the ECL techniques according to manufacturer instructions .
For detection of FlagIL-9R expression , total cell lysates were prepared from 2 X 10 `` cells and immunoprecipitated with 2 ug of anti-Flag M2 antibody .
The immunoprecipitates were separated by 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , transferred to PVDF membranes , and immunoblotted with anti-hIL-9R antibody ( R & D Systems ) .
Northern Blot Analysis-Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously ( 22 ) .
For detection of primary response gene expression , transfectants expressing different mutant forms of hIL-9Re were starved and stimulated with hIL-9 ( 30 ng/m ! )
for 1 h. Total RNAs were isolated from cells using a guanidinium isothiocyanate method ( 28 ) .
5 ug of total RNA was used for Northern blot and hybridized with *°P -labeled c-myc , junB , c-jun , and c-fos cDNAs .
The mouse glyceralde- hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe was hybridized to the same filters to ensure equal loading in each lane .
The expression of different pFlagIL-9R constructs in TS1 transfectants was determined using the hIL-9Ra cDNA as the probe .
Gel Shift and Gel Supershift Assoys-Nuclear extracts were prepared from unstimulated and stimulated TS1 cells as described previously ( 24 ) .
A *°P-labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to a high affinity dyed symmetrical acute-phase response factor ( APRF ) binding site ( 5'-CCTTCCCGGAATTC-3 ' ) was used as the probe ( 25 ) .
For the gel shift assay , 10 ug of nuclear proteins were incubated with 2 ug of poly [ d ( I-C ) ] before the addition of 2 X 10° cpm of probe .
After incubation at room temperature for 30 min , the reactions were analyzed with a 5 % native polyacrylamide gel .
For the gel supershift assay , nuclear extracts were preincubated with 2 ug of anti-Stat8 antibody or the same amount of preimmune IgG at 4 °C for 2 h and then incubated with the probe for 30 min at room temperature .
In oligonucleotide competition experiments , a 100-fold molar excess of various competitors were preincubated with nuclear extracts for 10 min before the binding reactions .
The sequences of e-sis-inducible element ( SIE ) , AP-1 , and Oct-1 competitors are : SIE , 5'-GTCGACATTTCCCGTAAATCTTGT-3 ' ( 11 , 26 ) , AP-1 , 5-CGCTT-GATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3 ' ( Promega ) ; Oct-1 , 5'-TGTCGAATGCA-AATCACTAGAA-3 ' ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) .
RESULTS Expression of Mutant hIL-I9Ra Proteins-To identify structural elements critical for IL-9-mediated cell proliferation and signal transduction in the cytoplasmic region of hIL-9Ra , a series of mutants with deletions or point mutations in hIL-9Ra were constructed and stably transfected into TS1 cells .
TS1 is a mouse IL-9-dependent T cell line that does not respond to hIL-9 stimulation .
It has been shown previously that transfec-tion of hIL-9Ra cDNA into TS1 cells conferred responsiveness of these cells to hIL-9 ( 14 ) .
A schematic diagram of mutant receptor constructs used in the present study is shown in Fig .
1 .
To determine the expression of different pFlagIL-9R constructs in transfected TS1 cells , Northern blot and immunoprecipitation analysis were performed to detect hIL-9R mRNAs and proteins in different transfectants .
As shown in Fig .
2 , A and B , the parental TS1 cells did not express hIL-9R « transcripts and proteins .
Cells transfected with different pFlagIL-9R constructs expressed various sizes of hIL-9Ra « mRNAs and proteins .
It was noticed that two different sizes of hIL-9Ra proteins were expressed in each transfectant , which may represent different glycosylated forms of hIL-9Ra « .
Cell surface expression of FlagIL-9R proteins was further confirmed by flow cytometric analysis .
As shown in Fig .

Two Regions in the Cytoplasmic Domain of IL-9Ra Play Important Roles in IL-9-induced Cell Growth-To understand the role of different regions of the cytoplasmic domain in hIL- 9Ra for IL-9-mediated cell growth , TS1 cells transfected with different hIL-9Ra cDNAs were tested for their proliferative response to various concentrations of hIL-9 .
As shown in Fig .

3. hIL-9-dependent DNA synthesis of TS1 transfectants expressing hIL-9Ra .
TSl cells stably transfected with different pFlagIL-9R constructs or vector alone were cultured with different concentrations of hIL-9 , and incorporation of into cells was measured .
The data shown here represent the mean values in a typical experiment with triplicates from three independent experiments .
with cell proliferation detected even at a very low concentration of hIL-9 .
This suggests that the FlagIL-9R fusion protein functioned like the natural form of hIL-9Ra in response to hIL-9 stimulation in TS1 cells .
Transfectants harboring pFlagIL-9R D1 and pFlagIL-9R D2 ( D1 and D2 ) showed a proliferative response comparable to wild-type transfectants , suggesting that distal C terminus and the serine-rich region of hIL-9Ra are dispensable for IL-Q9-induced cell proliferation .
This is in part different from IL-2Rf in which the serine-rich region has been shown to be critical for IL-2-induced cell growth ( 27 ) .
Two regions in the cytoplasmic domain of hIL-9Ra were implicated to be critical for IL-9-mediated cell proliferation in the present study .
A membrane-proximal region between amino acids 295 and 338 including a BOX1 consensus sequence , was shown to be essential for IL-9-induced cell proliferation .
The proliferative response to IL-9 was abrogated when this region was further truncated ( D4 ) or if the BOX1 motif in this region was deleted ( BOXd ) , indicating that the BOX1 consensus sequence in hIL-9Ra is required for IL-9-mediated cell growth .
However , unlike other receptor systems , mutation of the Pro-X-Pro motif in BOX1 consensus sequence of hIL-9Ra ( BOXm ) did not abolish but slightly reduced IL-9-mediated cell growth .
The second important region is located downstream of the BOX1 consensus sequence between amino acids 338 and 422 .
This region contains a STAT3 binding site and was found to play a crucial role in promoting IL-9-induced cell proliferation .
When this region was truncated ( D3 ) , cells only proliferated at a higher concentration of hIL-9 ( 1 ng/ml ) .
Since STAT 3 has been shown to be the only STAT protein activated by IL-9 in TS1 cells ( 18 ) , we also mutated STAT3 binding site within the hIL-9Ra to evaluate the role of STAT3 in IL-9-mediated cell growth .
Interestingly , point mutation at the STAT3 binding site from YLPQ to YLPA ( STAT3 m transfectants ) did not significantly affect IL-9-induced cell proliferation , although a similar point mutation ( from YMPQ to YMPA ) has been shown to abolish tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 induced by gp130 family of cyto-kines ( 28 ) .
We also noticed that wild type , D1 , D2 , and STAT3 m transfectants had a higher incidence of becoming factor-independent compared with D3 , D4 , BOXm , and BOXd trans- 21337 fectants , implicating that overexpression of specific domains of IL-9Ra « may result in transformation of TS1 cells .
Deletion of Two Regions in the Cytoplasmic Domain of hIL-Abrogates Tyrosine Phosphorylation of JAK Kinases , IRS-2 , and STAT3 Induced by hIL-9-Accumulated evidence has revealed that molecular cascades involved in cytokine-mediated cell growth are associated with protein tyrosine phos-phorylation .
JAK1 , JAK3 , IRS-2 , and STAT3 have been demonstrated to be activated by IL-9 stimulation through tyrosine phosphorylation in our previous studies ( 17 , 18 ) .
To examine the role of hIL-9Ra in IL-9-induced growth-promoting signals , the status of hIL-9-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases , IRS-2 , or STAT3 in TS1 cells expressing wild-type and mutant hIL-9Ras were tested .
As illustrated in Fig .
4 , tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 , JAK3 , IRS-2 , and STAT3 was comparable in wild-type hIL-9Ra transfectants ( W ) and in parental TS1 cells stimulated with hIL-9 and mIL-9 , respectively , indicating that transfected hIL-9Ra transduces similar signals as its murine counterpart following hIL-9 stimulation .
Deletion of the C terminus and the serine-rich region of hIL-9Ra « ( D1 and D2 ) failed to change hIL-9-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases , IRS-2 , and STAT3 .
The BOX1 consensus sequence in the membrane-proximal region was shown to be absolutely required for IL-9-induced signaling , since truncation ( D4 ) or internal deletion ( BOXd ) of this region completely abolished IL-9-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases , IRS-2 , and STAT3 .
Furthermore , point mutation of Pro-X-Pro motif into Ala-X-Ala ( BOXm ) within the BOX1 consensus sequence also decreased IL-9-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases , IRS-2 , and STAT3 .
It was also found that tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases and IRS-2 was greatly decreased when the BOX1 downstream region of hIL-9Ra was truncated ( D3 ) .
This observation is consistent with a recent report , in which the BOX1 downstream region of hIL-9Ra was found to be absolutely required for IL-9-induced JAK1 activation in BW 5147 cells ( 29 ) .
This region was also found to be indispensable for activation of STAT3 , since truncation of this region eliminated IL-9-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 ( D3 ) .
Point mutation of the STAT3 binding motif from YLPQ to YLPA in this region ( Stat3 m ) greatly decreased IL-9-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 , suggesting activation of STAT3 is most likely through this YLPQ motif .
To further confirm the status of STAT3 activation by hIL-9 in different hIL-9Ra transfectants , gel shift and gel supershift assays were performed to detect specific DNA-protein complexes following hIL-9 stimulation .
As indicated in Fig .
5A , the nuclear extracts from wild-type transfectants stimulated by hIL-9 specifically bind to the APRF sequence that has a high affinity binding site for STAT3 proteins ( 25 ) .
This binding activity was induced within 1 min after hIL-9 stimulation and persisted for at least 15 min .
The competition experiments ( Fig .
5B ) showed that the APRF binding activity induced by IL-9 could be completely blocked with 100-fold excess of cold APRF or SIE competitor but not with 100-fold excess of AP-1 or Oct-1 oligonucleotide .
It was further shown by the gel supershift assay ( Fig .
5B ) that most of the IL-9-induced APRF-protein complexes can be specifically supershifted by anti-STAT3 antibody , indicating that the major proteins in IL-9-induced APREF-protein complexes are STAT3 or STAT3-related mole-cules .
IL-9-induced APRF binding activities were also examined in different hIL-9R transfectants ( Fig .
5C ) ; it was found that the induction of APRF binding activities correlated with STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in these transfectants following IL-9 stimulation .

Tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 , JAK3 , IRS-2 , and STAT3 in TS1 transfectants expressing hIL-9Ra .
Cells were starved in serum-free medium for 8 h. 2 X 10 `` cells were not stimulated or stimulated with hIL-9 ( 30 ng/m ! )
for 5 min and immunoprecipitated with 1.5 ug of anti-JAK1 , JAK83 , or STAT3 or 4 ug of anti-IRS-2 antibody at 4°C overnight .
The immunoprecipitates were separated by 7.5 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel electro-phoresis and transferred to PVDF mem-branes .
The membranes were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine ( P-Tyr ) , anti-JAK1 , anti-JAK8 , anti-IRS-2 , and anti-STAT3 .

hIL-9 has been demonstrated to induce c-Myc and JunB expression in a human megakaryo-cytic leukemia cell line ( 19 ) .
To understand the functional importance of the intracellular domains of hIL-9Ra « in the expression of primary response genes and to correlate expression of these genes with cell growth , we examined expression of c-mye , jun B , c-jun , and c-fos in response to hIL-9 by Northern blot analysis .
It was observed that the expression of c-fos and c-jun mRNA was not affected by hIL-9 treatment ( data not shown ) , whereas the expression of c-mye and junB mRNAs was up-regulated in wild-type , D1 , and D2 transfectants upon stimulation with hIL-9 ( Fig .
6 ) .
In contrast , e-mye and junB were not induced in D4 , D3 , and BOXd transfectants , suggesting the membrane-proximal region and the adjacent downstream region of the cytoplasmic domain of hIL-9Ra are indispensable for the activation of c-myc and junB .
In BOXm transfectants , induction of both e-mye and junB genes by hIL-9 was greatly reduced compared with wild-type transfectants , indicating downstream signaling molecules associated with the Pro-X-Pro motif may affect the expression of c-myc and junB .
Interestingly , in STAT3 m transfectants , induction of e-mye was greatly diminished , whereas the expression of junB was not significantly affected , suggesting that activation of c-myc and junB by hIL-9 is mediated , at least in part , by different mechanisms .
DISCUSSION In the present study , we have demonstrated the importance of the cytoplasmic domain of hIL-9Ra in IL-9-mediated cell proliferation and signal transduction .
We identified two re-gions , a membrane-proximal region containing BOX1 consensus sequence and the adjacent downstream region containing a STAT3 binding site , as required for IL-9-mediated signal transduction .
In our study , the membrane-proximal region including 47 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of hIL-9Ra « ( D3 ) was shown to support IL-9-induced cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases even though the response of this mutant to IL-9 was greatly reduced compared with wild type hIL-9Ra .
This observation is different from a recent report by Demoulin et al .
( 29 ) in which a mouse IL-3-dependent cell line , Ba/F3 , transfected with truncated hIL-9Ra « plasmid encoding 115 amino acids of the cytoplasmic region containing the BOX1 motif no longer responds to hIL-9 .
The difference between the two studies could be due to the difference in the cell types used in each of these experiments .
The function of the membrane-proximal region in hIL-9Ra « is most likely to be mediated by the BOX1 motif , which is also found in the membrane-proximal region of many cytokine receptors and has been demonstrated to be important for JAKIJAK2 activation and cell growth in several cytokine receptor systems ( 30-34 ) .
In our study , truncation or internal deletion of the BOX1 motif in the membrane-proximal region of hIL-9Ra totally abolished hIL-9-induced cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3 , suggesting the BOX1 consensus sequence in hIL-9Ra plays a preeminent role in IL-9-induced activation of JAK kinases and cell growth .
Since mutation of the conserved Pro-X-Pro motif in the BOX1 consensus sequence inactivated the receptor and JAK1 activation in certain receptor systems ( 30 , 35 , 36 ) , we also introduced point mutations ( Pro-X-Pro to Ala-X-Ala ) in the BOX1l consensus sequence of hIL-9Ra ( BOXm ) .
To our surprise , these mutations did not totally abolish IL-9-mediated cell growth , but decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3 .
Although activation of JAK3 has been demonstrated to be mainly associated with IL-2R y chain ( 37 , 38 ) , tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 was shown to be affected by mutations in the membrane-proximal and the BOX1 downstream regions of hIL-9Ra in our study .
Recently , a membrane-proximal region of human IL-2RB was shown to be critical for JAKB3 activation ( 85 ) , raising the possibility that JAK3 may bind to receptor subunits other than IL-2R y chain for its activation .
In this study , we also investigated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 by IL-9 in various transfectants .
It appears that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases , which is consistent with our earlier observation that JAK kinases are responsible for IL-9-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins ( 18 ) .
In agreement with the study by Demoulin et al .
( 29 ) , our data also indicated that the BOX1 downstream region in hIL-9Ra plays an important role in IL-9-mediated cell growth .
Deletion of this region not only greatly reduced hIL-9-stimulated cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases and IRS-2 but also abrogated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 .

Activation of STAT3 by hIL-9 in TS1 transfectants expressing wild-type or mutant hIL-9Ra .
A , nuclear extracts were prepared from wild-type hIL-9R transfectants treated with hIL-9 for the indicated period of time , and the APRF DNA binding activity was analyzed by the gel shift assay .
B , gel shift and gel supershift assays were performed with nuclear extracts from wild-type hIL-9Ra : transfec-tant stimulated by hIL-9 for 5 min in the presence of 100-fold excess of unlabeled competitors or 2 ug of pre-immune IgG or anti-STAT3 antibody .

C , gel shift assays were performed with nuclear extracts from TS1 cells stimulated by mIL-9 for 5 min ( as a positive control ) or from different hIL-9Ra transfectants stimulated by hIL-9 for 5 min .
STAT3 binding site ( YLPQ ) was found within this region .
YXXQ has been shown to be important for tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in gp130 family receptors ( 28 ) , and the important role of the tyrosine residue within YLPQ motif in hIL-9Ra has recently been reported ( 29 ) .
Since the tyrosine residue within this motif was shown to play a key role in IL-9-mediated cell growth and activation of STAT1 « , STAT3 , and STATS5 , STAT factors were suggested to be involved in IL-9-mediated cell proliferation .
However , in our study , a point mutation in this STAT3 binding site from YLPQ to YLPA did not significantly affect IL-9-induced cell proliferation but greatly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 , suggesting that STAT3 may not be the major signaling molecule in IL-9-induced cell growth in TS1 cells .
In the gp130 system , a recent report suggested that STAT3 may be involved in cell differentiation and growth arrest mediated by IL-6 ( 39 ) .
Finally , we also investigated primary response gene expres- 21339 Transfectants : w - D1 D2 D3 D4 BOXm STATm BOXd hIL-9 : - oto - +0 - o+ - +o - + - $ 0 - # 0 - + jun® # 448 88 > ag =~ rod ; 09 Fic .

Induction of early response gene in TS1 transfectants expressing hIL-9Ra .
Cells were starved in serum-free medium for 8 h and were either not stimulated or stimulated with hIL-9 ( 30 ng/m ! )
for 1 h. 5 ug of total RNAs from unstimulated and stimulated cells were prepared and separated through a 1 % formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane .
The same membrane was sequentially hybridized with different *°P-labeled c-Myc , JunB , c-Jun , c-Fos , and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) eDNA probes .

GAPDH sion in hIL-9R-transfected cells .
The importance of primary response genes as potentially critical targets for cytokine-in-duced proliferation has been extensively studied ( 40-42 ) .
Although our previous study has shown that IL-9 could induce activation of jun B and c-myc in a human growth factor-depend-ent cell line ( 19 ) , the correlation between the activation of these two genes and IL-9-mediated cell proliferation has never been demonstrated .
Our present study indicated that activation of e-mye upon stimulation with IL-9 depends on the presence of both the membrane-proximal and the BOX1 downstream regions in the cytoplasmic domain of hIL-9Ra , suggesting that IL-9-induced expression of c-mye may require JAK kinases and signals associated with the BOX1 downstream region .
This is different from IL-2Rf , in which the serine-rich region is important for the activation of e-myc ( 27 ) .
In conjunction with the functional study , c-myc is not likely to play an important role in IL-9-mediated cell proliferation in TS1 cells , since the induction of c-myc by IL-9 was greatly impaired in STAT3 m and BOXm transfectants that can proliferate in response to hIL-9 .
Interestingly , tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 by IL-9 were also decreased in both STAT3 m and BOXm transfectants , suggesting that STAT3 may be involved in IL-9-mediated activation of c-myc .
hIL-9-induced junB activation appears to be attributed to both regions of hIL-9Ra and correlates with IL-9-induced cell proliferation .
Although STAT3 was recently shown to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of the junB promoter through an IL-6 response element ( 43 , 44 ) , the induction of junB by IL-9 was not significantly decreased in STAT3 m transfectants , implicating that additional transcription factors may be induced by IL-9 in the activation of junB .
In conclusion , two important regions in the cytoplasmic domain of hIL-9Ra have been demonstrated to play important roles in IL-9-induced cell growth and signal transduction .
A membrane-proximal region between amino acids 295 and 338 containing the BOX1 motif is absolutely essential for IL-9-induced cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases and a BOX1l downstream sequence between amino acids 338 and 422 including a YLPQ motif is critical for IL-9-induced cell growth , activation of STAT3 , and up-regulation of c-mye and junB gene expression .
Since both of these two regions are important for optimal cellular proliferation induced by IL-9 , we suggest that the reconstitution of a fully functional 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 21340 IL-9 Receptor a Domains Critical for Signal Transduction hIL-9R requires the cooperation or cross-talk between different signaling transducers associated with hIL-9R cytoplasmic do-main , even though activation of distinctive signaling molecules may be mediated by individual cytoplasmic regions of hIL-9R .
