STAT is a family of transcription factors that play a pivotal role in cytokine-induced functions of a various type of cells .
We investigated the involvement of STATs in the transformation of T-cells by HTLV-I .
HTLV-1-transformed - T-cell lines expressed - higher amounts of STATI , STAT3 and STATS RNA and proteins than virus-negative T cells .
The expression of and STATS in a human T-cell line was induced by Tax .
IL-2 induced the DNA binding activity of STAT3 and STATS of a HTLV-1-transformed cell line and then stimulated its proliferation .
In contrast , IL-2 did neither in a cell line lacking STAT3 and STATS .
The expression of STATI , STAT3 and STATS mRNAs were also induced by a T-cell mitogen in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
Our results suggest that the induction of STATI and STATS by Tax enhances cytokine-induced functions of virus-infected T-cells , hence the induction may play a role in IL-2-dependent transformation steps of T-cells by HTLV-1 .
Keywords : HTLV-1 ; Tax ; STAT ; transformation Introduction Adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) is characterized by monoclonal proliferation of CD4 positive T-cells ( Uchiyama et al .
, 1977 ) .
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) is the etiologic agent of ATL ( Hinuma et al .
, 1981 ; Poiesz et al .
, 1980 ) , and it transforms CD4 positive T-cells in vitro ( Miyoshi et al .
, 1981 ; Yamamoto et al .
, 1982 ) .
There are two types of virus-transformed T-cell lines , one is interleukin ( IL ) -2-dependent , while the other is IL-2-independent .
The viral protein Tax plays a critical role at least in the IL-2-dependent transformation process by HTLV-1 , since it can immortalize normal T-cells in the presence of IL-2 in vitro ( Akagi and Shimotohno , 1993 ; Pozzatti et al .
, 1990 ) .
Tax was originally identified as a transacting transcriptional activator of its own promoter in *Correspondence : M Fujii Received 25 June 1998 ; revised 14 December 1998 ; accepted 14 December 1998 HTLV-1 long terminal repeat ( Sodroski et al .
, 1984 ; Cann et al .
, 1985 ; Felber et al .
, 1985 ; Seiki et al .
, 1986 ) .
Since then , Tax has been shown to activate a number of cellular genes , a process thought to be responsible for its transforming activity ( Yoshida et al .
, 1995 ) .
In fact , Tax-inducible genes include the proto-oncogenes ( c-myc , c-fos , c-jun ) , genes encoding transcription factors ( egr-l , egr-2 , fra-l ) , growth promoting-factors ( IL-6 , transforming growth factor B , gp34 , TIMP-1 ) and their receptors ( « -chain of IL-2R ( IL-2Ra « ) , OX40 ) ( Inoue et al .
, 1986 ; Cross et al .
, 1987 ; Maruyama et al .
, 1987 ; Fujii et al .
, 1988 , 1991 ; Nagata et al .
, 1989 ; Kim et al .
, 1990 ; Miura et al .
, 1991 ; Tsuchiya et al .
, 1993 ; Uchijima et al .
, 1994 ; Yamashita et al .
, 1994 ) .
In addition , Tax stimulates the activities of kinases such as CDK-4 ( cyclin-dependent kinase ) and protein kinase C ( Suzuki et al .
, 1996 ; Low et al .
, 1997 ; Schmitt et al .
, 1998 ; Lindholm et al .
, 1996 ) .
These activities may also be essential for the transforming activity of Tax .
IL-2 is a growth factor for T-cells .
IL-2-dependent proliferation of normal T-cells requires periodic stimulation with antigens or mitogens , whereas those of Tax- or HTLV-l-transformed T-cells do not ( Sugamura et al .
, 1986 ) .
Thus , mitogenic stimulation may be replaced by Tax in virus transformed T-cells .
One such replacing function is mediated through a Tax-dependent induction of IL-2Rxa ( Inoue et al .
, 1986 ; Cross et al .
, 1987 ; Maruyama et al .
, 1987 ) , since its expression in normal T-cells is induced by mitogen stimulation .
It is , however , unknown whether induction of IL-2R « by Tax is sufficient for mitogen-independent proliferation of virus transformed T-cells .
STAT ( signal transducer and activator of transcrip-tion ) is a family of transcription factors mediating various cytokine signals ( Darnell , 1996 ) .
Among them , STAT3 and STATS5 are activated in T-cells by stimulation with IL-2 , and may play a role in IL-2-dependent proliferation ( Gouilleux et al .
, 1995 ; Johnston et al .
, 1995 ; Wakao et al .
, 1995b ) .
We show here that HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines expressed more STATI , STAT3 and STATS genes than virus-negative T cells , and Tax was at least in part responsible for the expression of STAT !
and STATS genes in virus-infected T-cell lines .
Moreover , IL-2 stimulated the proliferation of a cell line with STAT3 and STATS protein , but not one without .
We also discuss these findings in the context of mitogen-independent but IL-2-dependent transformation of T-cells by HTLV-1 .
Induction of STAT by Tax N Nakamura et al 2668 Results Enhanced gene expression of STATs in HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines Four HTLV-1-transformed and two virus-negative T-cell lines were used in this series of experiments , and they were all IL-2-independent .
RNA was prepared from these T-cell lines , and the expression of several STAT family members ( STATI , STAT3 , STATS5 , STAT6 ) was measured by Northern blotting analysis .
HTLV-1-transformed cell lines , with the exception of TL-OmI , expressed more RNA encoding STAT !
, STAT3 , STATS than virus-negative T-cell lines , while they equivalently expressed STAT6 ( Figure 1 ) .
Western blotting analysis showed that three HTLV-l-transformed cell lines with high expression of STATI , STAT3 and STATS - RNAs possessed increased amounts of their proteins ( Figure 2 ) .

( a ) RNA was prepared from Jurkat ( lane 1 ) , MOLT-4 ( lane 2 ) , TL-OmI ( lane 3 ) , MT-2 ( lane 4 ) , HUT102 ( lane 5 ) and TL-Su ( Iane 6 ) cell lines .
The expression of STAT1 , STAT3 , STAT53 , STAT6 and GAPDH in these cell lines was measured by Northern blotting analysis ( Figure 2 ) and these two may correspond to STAT1 « and STATIR derived from alternative splicing of STAT1l ( Schindler et al .
, 1992 ) .
Like the RNA , the STAT6 protein was also equivalently expressed in these T-cell lines ( Figure 2 ) .
HTLV-1 Tax is a transcriptional activator of a number of cellular genes ( Yoshida et al .
, 1995 ) .
Thus , we next measured the expression of Tax in these T-cell lines .
Tax protein , with a molecular weight of approximately 40 kD , was detected in MT-2 , TL-Su and HUTIO2 with a high expression of STAT family members , whereas it was not detected in TL-OmI like virus-negative cell lines ( Figure 2 ) .
Thus , the expression of Tax correlated with the augmented expression of STAT1 , STAT3 and STATS in virus-transformed cell lines .
Tax antibody also detected proteins migrating around 68 kD in MT-2 and 36 kD in TL-Su .
These are likely derived from chimerical tax genes with other viral genes as described previously ( Kobayashi et a/ .
, 1984 ) .

Cell lysate prepared from JPX-9 and JPXM cells treated with or without CdCl ; was applied onto SDS-polyacrylamide gel , and then the protein in the gel was transferred to PVDF membrane .
The Tax protein in the membrane was visualized by an antibody against Tax using ECL Western blotting detection system ( Amersham ) .
( b , c ) RNA was extracted from JPX-9 and JPX/M cells treated with or without CdCl ; and the expression of STATI , STAT3 and GAPDH genes ( b ) and STATS5A and GAPDH ( c ) in the extracted RNA was analysed by the Northern and RNase protection analysis , respectively .
In RNase protection analysis , the expected protected fragments for STATS5A and for GAPDH RNA was 438 and 96 nucleotides , respectively Induction of STAT by Tax N Nakamura et al Induction of STAT gene expression by Tax in a T-cell line The data presented above suggested that Tax is involved in the upregulation of STATs gene expression in HTLV-1-transformed cell lines .
To explore this possibility , we used JPX-9 which is a derivative of Jurkat T-cell line and has a tax cDNA under the control of inducible methalothionein promoter ( Ohtani et al .
, 1989 ) .
Tax protein was almost undetectable in JPX-9 before the induction , but became detectable 15 h after the addition of CdCl , to the culture medium , and persisted even on day 6 ( Figure 3a ) .
A mutant Tax protein was also induced in JPX-9/M in a kinetics similar to JPX-9 , but it was inactive for transcriptional activation ( Ohtani et al .
, 1989 ) .
Northern blotting analysis showed that STATI RNA was slightly increased in JPX-9 15 h after the addition of CdCl , and the expression gradually enhanced at day 6 , whereas such induction was not observed in JPX-9/M ( Figure 3b ) .
We next measured STATS RNA expression in JPX-9 cells by RNAase protection method ( Figure 3¢ ) .
There are two STATS related genes STAT5A and STATSB in human ( Lin et al .
, 1996 ) .
At least STAT5SA expression in JPX-9 was induced 4 and 6 days after treatment with CdCl , but it was not in JPX-9/M .
On the other hand , STAT3 gene expression was not increased by CdCl , in JPX-9 ( Figure 3b ) , although it was upregulated in virus-transformed cell lines .
These results indicate that Tax induces the expression of STAT !
and STATS in a T-cell line at RNA level .
We next examined the induction of STAT and STATS proteins by Tax by Western blotting analysis ( Figure 4 ) .

The STAT protein in the membrane was visualized by antibodies against STAT1 or STATS using ECL Western blotting detection system ( Amersham ) 2669 Induction of STAT by Tax N Nakamura et al 2670 days after treatment with CdCl , .
STATS protein was not detected in JPX-9 before the induction , but it was detectable 6 days after the induction ( Figure 4 ) .
The induction of STAT1l and STATS proteins was only observed in JPX-9 , but not in JPX-9/M , indicating that Tax induces the expression of STATS and STATI proteins in a T-cell line .
These results indicate that Tax is , at least in part , responsible for the enhanced expression of STATIl and STATS proteins in the HTLV-1-transformed cell lines .
DNA binding activity of STAT3 and STATS in HTLV-1-transformed cells Among the STAT family members , DNA binding activities of STAT3 and STATS are induced in T-cells by treatment with IL-2 , and may play a role in IL-2-induced functions such as cell proliferation ( Gouilleux et al .
, 1995 ; Johnston et al .
, 1995 ; Wakao et al .
, 1995b ) .
Thus , we analysed the DNA binding activity of STAT3 and STATS in nuclear extracts prepared from T-cell lines characterized above .

MT-2 and HUTI02 possessed a complex specific to PRE ( Figure 5 ) .
The binding activity in HUT1O2 cells was specific to PRE , since it was selectively inhibited by cold homologous PRE oligonucleotide , but not by unrelated one ( TRE ; TPA-responsive element from the collagenase gene ) ( Figure 5 ) .
The addition of an antibody to either STATS or STAT3 protein to the nuclear extract of HUTIO2 induced the slow-migrating ( supershifted ) complex .
Unlike HUT1O2 and MT-2 , TL-Su exhibited little binding activity to PRE despite its high expression of STAT3 and STATS proteins .
We next examined whether IL-2 induces PRE activity in TL-Su with high amount of STAT3 and STATS proteins .
TL-Su as well as TL-OmI without STAT3 and STATS protein in Western analysis were treated with IL-2 , and the binding activity to PRE was examined by EMSA .
A complex specific to PRE was induced in TL-Su 30 min after treatment with IL-2 ( Figure 6a ) .

The binding activity to PRE in nuclear extracts was analysed by the gel mobility shift assay .
Binding reaction was carried out in the absence ( lanes 1-7 , 10 ) or presence of homologous PRE oligonucleotides ( 100 ng , lane 8 ) as competitor or of unrelated TRE ones ( 100 ng , lane 9 ) .
NS indicates a non-specific complex which is inhibited by TRE oligonucleotides as well as PRE ones .

The complex was separated by polyacrylamide gel .
( b ) Nuclear extract was prepared from TL-Su treated with IL-2 for 30 min .
The extract was pretreated without ( lane 1 ) or with normal rabbit serum ( lane 2 ) , antibody against STATS ( lane 3 ) or against STAT3 ( lane 4 ) , and then they were further incubated with PRE probe .
The complex was separated by polyacrylamide gel a supershifted complex ( Figure 6b ) , indicating that IL-2-induced complex in TL-Su contains both STAT3 and STATS proteins .
Thus , STAT3 and STATS proteins in TL-Su are active in binding to PRE when treated with IL-2 .
IL-2 also enhanced the binding activity to PRE in MT-2 cells ( data not shown ) .
Unlike TL-Su , the PRE binding activity in TL-OmI was undetectable even after treatment with IL-2 ( Figure 6a ) .
TL-OmI has a high affinity IL-2 receptor ( Sugamura et al .
, 1986 ) .
Thus , failure of IL-2 to induce PRE binding activity in TL-Om is likely to be due to undetectable amount of STAT3 and STATS proteins .
IL-2-induced proliferation of a HTLV-1-transformed T-cell line expressing STATs DNA binding activity of STAT3 and STATS was induced by IL-2 in TL-Su but not in TL-OmI , and it was constitutive in HUT1O2 ( Figure 6 ) .
These cell lines are , thus , useful to examine the role of these STAT 's in IL-2-induced function .
Since these three cell lines do not require IL-2 for their growth , the proliferation assays were carried out without serum .
IL-2 reproducibly stimulated the proliferation of TL-Su with the expression of STAT3 and STATS proteins , whereas it little that of TL-OmI without STAT3 and STATS proteins ( Figure 7 ) .
Moreover , IL-2-induced proliferation of HUT1O2 with the constitutive activated STAT 's proteins was less than that of TL-Su ( Figure 7 ) .
Thus , IL-2-induced proliferation in these three cell lines correlated with DNA binding activity of STAT3 and STATS proteins .
Mitogen-induced expression of STATs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells To study the regulation of STAT gene expression in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) , PBMC were treated with T-cell mitogen ( PHA ) for indicated time periods , and the amount of STAT RNA in their cell extracts was measured by Northern blotting analysis .
Resting PBMC expressed STATI , STAT3 and STATS genes before stimulation ( Figure 8 ) .
The expression of STATI , STAT3 and STATS increased 4 h after stimulation with PHA .
The amount of STAT !
remained constant till 24 h , while that of STAT3 and STATS became slightly enhanced till 24 h ( Figure 8 ) .
Thus , the expression of these STAT family members was inducible in PBMC .

PBMC were treated with PHA ( 1 ug/ml ! )
at 37°C for indicated time intervals .
RNA was prepared from these cells , and their expression of STATI , STAT3 and STAT3 was measured by Northern blotting analysis Discussion The major finding of the present study was that the expression of STAT 's proteins is upregulated in HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines , and the upregulation is at least in part mediated by Tax ( Figures 3 and 4 ) .
STATs have been implicated in cytokine-induced functions by regulating gene expression in various types of cells .
Therefore , our results suggest that the Tax-induced expression of STAT proteins enhances cytokine-induced gene expression in virus-infected T-cells , thereby augmenting their functions .
STAT 's in particular STATS is thought to play a role in IL-2-induced proliferation of T-cells ( Gouilleux et al .
, 1995 ; Johnston et al .
, 1995 ; Wakao et al .
, 1995b ) .
Thus , STAT 's protein induced by Tax may be involved in IL-2-induced proliferation of T-cells infected with HTLV-1 , thereby IL-2-dependent transformation process by HTLV-1 .
Indeed , the DNA binding activity of STAT3 and STATS induced by IL-2-induced proliferation of three T-cell lines ( Figure 7 ) .
In this context , it is essential to examine whether the introduction of the STATs expression plasmids in TL-OmI can confer IL-2-induced proliferation .
In addition , it should be noted that TL-OmI is derived from leukemic cells of adult T-cell leukemia patients .
Thus , TL-OmI should have the mutations of cellular genes responsible for the leukemic proliferation , which mediate Tax-independent proliferation in vitro .
The treatment of T-cells with IL-2 stimulates the activity of a tyrosine kinase JAK3 , which phosphor-ylate STAT proteins .
Phosphorylated proteins , then , translocate into nucleus , bind to DNA in sequence specific manner , and activate the transcription .
Thus , it is interesting to examine whether Tax also stimulates the activity of JAK3 .
We are currently examining this possibility .
PHA , a T-cell mitogen , induced the gene expression of STATI , STAT3 and STATS in PBMC ( Figure 8 ) .
We also observed that at least STAT3 and STATS proteins are induced in a T-cell line MOLT-4 by mitogen stimulation ( data not shown ) .
Mitogen stimulation is often essential for cytokine function in PBMC .
For instance , normal T-cells require mitogen stimulation for IL-2-induced proliferation .
Thus , mitogen-induced STATs may play a role in cytokine-induced gene expressions via these STAT 's in PBMC , thereby in cytokine-induced functions .
The induction of STAT !
and STATS mRNA by Tax in JPX-9 was delayed relative to other Tax-inducible genes ( Figure 3 ) .
Thus , Tax may not directly interact with the promoter of these STATs .
Tax activates the expression of genes encoding transcription factors such as c-Fos or c-Jun , and various cytokines ( Inoue et a/ .
, 1986 ; Cross et al .
, 1987 ; Maruyama et al .
, 1987 ; Nagata et al .
, 1989 ; Kim et al .
, 1990 ; Fujii et al .
, 1991 ; Tsuchiya et al .
, 1993 ; Yamashita et al .
, 1994 ) .
Thus , the Tax-induced transcription factor ( s ) or cytokine ( s ) may activate these STAT genes .
Analysis of their promoter regions is therefore required to elucidate the mechanism of induction .
The tested HTLV-l-infected T-cell lines expressed the STAT3 gene more than the virus-negative ones , but Tax did not activate gene expression in JPX-9 ( Figure 3 ) .
Thus , the high STAT3 gene expression in HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines may be Tax-independent .
Alternatively , Tax can activate STAT3 gene expression under conditions different from those used in the present study .
For instance , Tax might activate STAT3 gene expression in JPX-9 beyond the time interval used in our experiments .
Thus , further analysis is required to understand the mechanism of enhanced STAT3 gene expression in HTLV-1-transformed cell lines .
There are two stages of T-cell lines transformed by HTLV-1 in vitro ; , one is IL-2-dependent , while the other is IL-2-independent .
Migone et al .
( 1995 ) showed that the DNA binding of STAT3 and STATS is constitutive in IL-2-independent virus-transformed T-cells , whereas it is dependent on IL-2 in IL-2-dependent cells , like normal T-cells Thus , they postulated that the constitutive activation of STAT pathway is an essential step for the conversion into IL-2-independent stage of virus-transformed cell lines .
The present results also suggested that the activation of STATs correlated with proliferation of T-cell lines among three cell lines , and the constitutively activated STATs in HUTIO2 are involved in their IL-2-independent proliferation ( Figure 7 ) .
However , two out of four IL-2-independent HTLV-1-transformed cell lines possessed a constitutive STAT3 and STATS DNA binding activity ( Figure 5 ) .
In addition , three other IL-2-independent HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines tested had little PRE activity ( data not shown ) .
Thus , constitutive activation of these STAT pathways is not obligatory for IL-2-independent proliferation of virus-transformed T-cell lines and other alterations ( s ) can also induce the IL-2-independent proliferation .
Takemoto et al .
( 1997 ) showed that eight out of 12 ATL patients have constitutive DNA binding activity of one or more STAT proteins , and the constitutive binding is associated with the activation of JAK3 .
Thus , the constitutive activation of STAT/JAK pathways may be involved in the aberrant proliferation of the leukemic cells in vivo .
It should be noted that the leukemic cells in vivo generally do not express Tax .
Thus , it is unlikely that Tax and Tax-induced genes including STATs are involved in this late stage of the leukemogenesis by HTLV-1 .
Thus , the present finding ( induction of STATs by Tax ) may play a role in the early phase of the leukemogenesis in vivo , such as immortalization of the virus-infected T-cells .
Cellular transformation by spleen focus-forming virus , v-Abl and v-Sre oncoproteins is associated with activation of the STAT pathway ( Cao et al .
, 1996 ; Danial et al .
, 1995 ; Ohashi et al .
, 1995 ; Yu et al .
, 1995 ) .
There is frequent activation ( at DNA binding level ) of STATs ( including STATS5 ) in PBMC of patients with leukemia ( Gouilleux et a/ .
, 1996 ; Shuai et al .
, 1996 ; Weber et al .
, 1996 ) .
Thus , the induction of STAT proteins and/or activation of their DNA binding activity may be a critical event associated with cellular transformation including HTLV-1 .
Materials and methods Cells and culture conditions Most cell lines used in the present experiments have been characterized previously ( Sugamura et al .
, 1984 ) .
Jurkat and MOLT-4 are virus-negative human T-cell lines .
MT-2 , HUTIO2 , TL-OmI , and TL-Su are HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines .
JPX-9 and JPX-9/M cells are derivatives of a Induction of STAT by Tax N Nakamura et al human T-cell line Jurkat , and have a stably integrated tax ( pMAXneo ) and tax mutant ( pMAXneo/M ) gene , respectively ( Ohtani et al .
, 1989 ) .
pMAXneo is a Tax expression vector in which the Tax gene is regulated by the mouse metallothionein promoter , while pMAXneo/M is a non-functional Tax mutant .
pMAXneo/M gene has a three base insertion at the Mlul site in the coding region , resulting in a mutant with an additional Arg residue between amino acids 62 and 63 .
For the expression of Tax protein , the cells were cultured in the presence of CdCl , ( 10 um ) at 37°C for 0.6-6 days .
They were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10 % FCS and antibiotics .
Northern blotting Cytoplasmic RNA was extracted from T-cell lines according to the Isogen method ( Chomezynski , 1993 ) .
For Northern analysis , 20 ug of cytoplasmic RNA was size-fractionated on 1 % agarose gel in the presence of 2.2 M formaldehyde , transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probe .
After stringent washing , the membrane was exposed to an X-ray film .
DNAs used for probe synthesis included human STATI , STAT3 , STAT6 , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate deyhdrogen-ase ( GAPDH ) , and ovine STATS .
Western blotting Cell lysates prepared from T-cell lines were resolved by electrophoresis on 8 or 10 % polyacrylamide gels , then transferred to PVDF membranes .
The blots were incubated with the appropriate antibodies , then rinsed and incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase .
Proteins recognized by antibodies were visualized using the ECL Western blotting detection system ( Amersham ) .
Anti-STATI and anti-STAT6 antibodies are mouse monoclonal antibodies that recognize the N-terminal portion ( a.a. 1-194 ) of human STAT and N-terminal portion ( a.a. 1-272 ) of STAT6 ( Transduction ) , respectively .
Anti-STAT3 antibody is a rabbit hyper-immune serum against peptides corresponding to amino acids 626-640 of human STAT3 and was kindly provided by Drs S Ruscetti and R Fisher ( Akira et a/ .
, 1994 ) .

RNase protection analysis RNase protection assay was performed using a RPAII Kit ( Ambion ) in accordance with the manufacturer 's direc-tions .
P-labeled antisense riboprobes were synthesized by T7 polymerase with linearized plasmids containing human STAT5SA and GAPDH ( internal control ) cDNA as templates .
These riboprobes were hybridized with cytoplasmic RNA ( 20 ug ) overnight 42°C in hybridization buffer ( 80 % formamide , 100 mm sodium citrate pH 4.0 , 300 mM sodium acetate pH 6.9 , 1 mM EDTA ) .
After digestion with RNaseA and RNaseT1 , the protected fragments were applied to 5 % polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea .
The gel was dried , and autoradiographed with X-ray film .
Primers used for the amplification of 438 base pair ( bp ) STAT5SA template cDNA were 5 ' AAGAGAGGCATCCTCACCCT 3 ' ( sense primer ) , and 5 TAGATGGCTGGGGTGTTGAA 3 ' ( antisense primer ) , and the amplified fragment was cloned into pGEM-T vector ( Promega ) , and its integrity was confirmed by DNA sequencing .
GAPDH template is a commercially available , 2673 Induction of STAT by Tax N Nakamura et al 2674 prelinearized plasmid containing a 96-bp fragment of human GAPDH cDNA ( Pharmingen ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) For the preparation of nuclear extracts , cells ( 1 x 10 `` ) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM Na , VO , , 5 mM NaF .
The cells were then treated with 0.1 % NP40 in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 20 mM NaF , 1 mM Na : , VO , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mm EGTA , 1 M DTT , 0.5 mm PMSF , 1 ug/ml leupeptin and 1 ug/ml aprotinin .
After centrifugation , the pellets were further treated with lysis buffer supplemented with 420 mm NaCl , 20 % glycerol for 4°C for 30 min followed by centrifuga-tion .
The resulting supernatant was used as nuclear extract in EMSA .
Ten ug of nuclear extract was preincubated with 1 ug of poly ( dI : dC ) in 20 ul of binding buffer consisting of 13 mm HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 65 mm NaCl , 0.15 mm EDTA , 8 % glycerol and 1 mm DTT for 15 min on ice .
Approximately 1 ng of radiolabeled oligonucleotide was added to the reaction mixture , and further incubated for 30 min at 25°C .
DNA-protein complexes were separated from the unbound probe by electrophoresis in 5 % polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 x TBE , and 2.5 % glycerol , dried and then the gel was exposed to X-ray film .
A double stranded synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to PRE ( top strand : AGATTTCTAGGAATTCAAT ) from the B-casein gene ( Wakao et al .
, 1995a ) , was labeled with `` P- « -CTP by a Klenow fragment and employed as a probe measuring the STAT3 and STATS binding .

sequence - is Cell proliferation assay T-cell lines were suspended in RPMI1640 with 0.5 % bovine serum albumin without serum , then seeded in 96-well flat bottom plates ( 3 x 10 % cells/well ) .
IL-2 ( 1 nM ) was added to the well , and the cells were cultured at 37°C for 1-2 days .
The cells were then cultured in the presence of WST-8 ( 2- ( 2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl ) -3- ( 4-nitrophenyl ) -5- ( 2,4-disuffo- monosodium salt ) for 3 h ( WST assay ) , followed by measurement of absorbance at 450 nm .
Proliferation ( % ) represented the ratio of absorbance of cells cultured in the presence of IL-2 relative to that in the absence of the cytokine .
