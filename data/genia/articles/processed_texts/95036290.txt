Distinct DNase-I Hypersensitive Sites Are Associated With TAL-1 Transcription in Erythroid and T-Cell Lines By Karen Leroy-Viard , Marie-Antoinette Vinit , Nathalie Lecointe , Daniéle Mathieu-Mahul , and Paul-Henri Roméo The tal-1 gene , frequently activated in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) , is expressed in the erythroid , megakaryocytic , and mast cell lineages during nor-mai hematopoiesis .
To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms that control tal-1 expression , we investigated tal-1 chromatin structure in erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines and in T-cell lines either with or without tal-1 rearrangements .
Tal-1 transcription was shown to be monoallelic in Jurkat , a T-cell line that expresses tal-1 in the absence of apparent genomic alteration of the locus .
Methylation studies indicated that the tal-1 5 ' GC-rich region behaves like a CpG island , hypomethylated in normal cells , and methylated de novo on transcriptionally inactive alleles HE TAL-1 GENE ( also called SCL ) was initially identified because of its involvement in t ( 1 ; 14 ) translocations associated with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) . '
'' The tal-1 protein possesses a basic-helix-loop-helix domain , and therefore belongs to a family of proteins involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation and associated with leukemogenesis .
* `` During normal hemato-poiesis , tal-1 gene expression is restricted to the erythroid , megakaryocytic , and mast cell lineages . ``
In leukemic T cells , its expression is often linked to chromosomal rearrangements .
These rearrangements are the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities associated with T-ALL , since they affect approximately 30 % of patients with childhood T-ALL .
Furthermore , they appear to be highly specific of this disease , since tal-1 rearrangements have not been observed in other types of leukemias or lymphomas , except in one case of B-ALL .
* `` The most common tal-1 rearrangement ( 12 % to 25 % of T-ALL patients ) is a submicroscopic 90-kb deletion ( tal-1 d ) juxtaposing the first exons of the SIL gene to the 5 noncoding part of tal-1 transcription unit .
`` `` `` '* `` An additional 3 % of T-ALL patients present a t ( 1 ; 14 ) ( p32 ; q11 ) translocation . ``
In most of the cases , the recombination implicates 1p32 breakpoints clustered within a 1-kb segment flanking tal-1 exon 3 , and 14q11 breakpoints in the TCR6 locus .
These translocations result in the positioning of the D6 region to the 5 ' side of tal-1 coding region . ``
'' This type of t ( 1 ; 14 ) translocation is associated with a high level of tal1 transcription , presumably initiating within the D6 region . ``
Thus , in rearrangements affecting the 5 `` part of tal-1 locus , the transcription initiation is clearly driven from promoters active in the T-cell lineage and brought in the 5 ' vicinity of tal-1 transcription unit .
This mechanism might also explain the recently reported case of a T-ALL that displayed a translocation t ( 1 ; 3 ) ( p34 ; p21 ) involving a chromosome 1 breakpoint located 10 kb 5 ' of tal-1 first exon , and a novel transcription unit on chromosome 3 , active in the T-cell lineage . ``
In two cases of t ( 1 ; 14 ) translocation that affected the 3 ' proximal region of tal-1 locus and the D6 region , tal1 transcription was shown to be initiated within tal-1 fourth exon . ``
More distal 3 ' breakpoints have been reported in two additional cases of T-ALL .
*** ' Although the consequences of these distal rearrangements on tal- 1 transcription have not Blood , Vol 84 , No 11 ( December 1 ) , 1994 : pp 3819-3827 in established cell lines .
Five major DNase-l hypersensitive sites ( HS ) were mapped in the tal-1 locus .
HS I , IV , and V were exclusively observed in the erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines that express tal-1 from the promoters 1a and 1b .
HS II was weak in hematopoietic cell lines , absent in Hela , and greatly enhanced in Jurkat , suggesting that this region might be implicated in the cis-activation of tal-1 promoter 1b in this cell line .
HS H1 was weak in HEL and Jurkat , and greatly enhanced in DUS528 , a T-cell line that bears a t ( 1 ; 14 ) and initiates tal-1 transcription within exon 4 .
These results suggest that distinct regulatory elements are associated with the use of the different tal-1 promoters .

been explored , they suggest that tal-1 activation might be mediated by long range cis-activating mechanisms .
These 3 ' alterations of tal- 1 locus , either proximal or more distal , raise the question of which DNA regions within the tal-1 locus mediate the transcriptional response to the T-lymphoid regulatory elements translocated on chromosome 1 .
Finally , it has been reported that several established T-cell lines and blasts from T-ALL patients express high levels of tal-1 transcripts in the absence of any apparent tal-1 genomic alter-ation . ``
It is presently unknown whether tal-1 transcription in such leukemic T cells reflects an activation in trans of both alleles or a cis activation of a single allele .
The molecular mechanisms that control tal-1 expression in its germline configuration ( ie , in the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages ) and in T-ALL devoid of 5 alterations of the locus are so far poorly understood .
Two promoters , la and 1b , are located in the 5 ' region of the tal-1 gene , and a third promoter is located within tal-1 fourth exon .
The promoter 1a is active only in cells of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages , whereas the promoter 1b is active both in these cells and in leukemic T cells without evident genomic alterations of tal-1 . '
'' The promoter located in exon 4 is active in leukemic T cells either with or without obvious alterations of the locus , but not in normal bone marrow or in established cell lines of the erythroid/megakaryocytic lineages . ``

3820 no regulatory sequences have been identified in this transcriptionally complex locus .
In a first attempt to define the regulatory elements that control tal-1 expression , we investigated tal-1 chromatin structure ( as probed by its methylation status and hypersensitivity to DNase-I ) in erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines , and in different T-cell lines expressing tal-1 gene with or without any reported structural alteration of the locus .
In this report , we show that tal-1 transcription is monoallelic in Jurkat T-cell line , that tal-1 5° GC rich region behaves like a CpG island , and that the preferential use of the different tal-1 promoters , ie , promoters la and 1b in erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines , promoter 1b in Jurkat , and promoter exon 4 in DU5S28 , is associated with specific DNase-I hypersensitive sites ( HS ) located in the 5 ' region of tal-1 locus .

The genomic probes used are probe 1 ( a 1.5-kb Mbol-Xhol fragment ) , probe 2 ( a 2.2-kb Xhol fragment ) , and probe 3 ( a 1.4-kb BamHI-Kprni fragment ) for the methylation studies ; and probe HX ( a 0.5-kb Xbal-HindIH fragment ) and probe Bg-B ( a 1-kb Bglll-BamHI fragment ) for the DNase-I studies .
The location of these probes within tal-1 locus is indicated in the figures .
RESULTS Expression of the tal-1 gene is monoallelic in the JURKAT T-cell line .
The JURKAT T-cell line , established from a T-ALL , transcribes tal-1 at high levels , although it is not associated with 1p32 chromosomal alteration .
By Southern blot analysis using probes encompassing 50 kb of the tal- I locus , we did not detect any genomic rearrangement ( data not shown ) .
This result , together with the fact that JURKAT transcription of tal-1 was mainly initiated from the promoter 1b , and to a much lesser extent from the promoter located in exon 4 , `` prompted us to determine whether one or both alleles were transcriptionally active .
Direct sequencing of tal-1 exon 6 showed a DNA polymorphism at the nucleotide ( nt ) 1156 ( A or G ) ( according to the numbering used by Bernard et al `` ) in Jurkat genomic DNA ( Fig 1a ) .
To confirm this polymorphism , we cloned PCR products encompassing the beginning of exon 6 and sequenced several clones .
Two types of subclones were obtained : one with nt 1156 = G , as expected from published sequences , and the other with nt 1156 = A ( Fig 1b ) .
PolyA+ RNA was extracted from Jurkat cells , reverse-transcribed , and the cDNA produced directly sequenced after PCR amplification .

CHROMATIN STRUCTURE OF TAL1 GENE from this line displayed greater than 90 % incorporation of dideoxynucleotides corresponding to the normal nt 1156 G on either strands ( Fig 1c ) .
Although these data can not formally rule out a weak transcription of the allele bearing the polymorphic nt 1156 A , they strongly suggest that tal-1 transcription is consecutive to a cis-activating mechanism and most probably monoallelic in the Jurkat cell line .
Methylation status of the tal-1 locus in established cell lines and in normal cells .
DNA methylation on CpG has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression in mammalian cells .
`` * `` `` Since the 5 ' noncoding part of tal-1 transcription unit lies in a highly G + C-rich region , we examined the methylation status of the actively transcribed tal-1 gene in the erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines HEL and K562 , and in T-cell lines with or without any reported genomic alteration of the locus , as well as in T-cell lines in which the locus is silent .
Genomic DNA was digested with Hpall or MspI and analyzed by Southern blotting for methylation of the tal-1 gene using probes located either in the 5 ' region of the transcription unit , or in the exon 4 region , which is also characterized by a high GC content .
Complete digestion by Hpall was attested by hybridizing the same blots with a probe located in the CpG island of the housekeeping gene , uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase ( Uro-D ) .
A detailed map of the tal-1 genomic region , MspI sites , and probes used is shown in Fig 2A , and representative autoradiographs are shown in Fig 2B and C. The 5 ' part of tal- 1 locus is unmethylated in cell lines that express tal-1 from the promoters la and 1b such as HEL or K562 , since hybridization with probe 1 identified one major band of 0.8 kb and probe 2 three bands of 0.74 kb , 0.45 kb , and 0.3 kb in both MspI and Hpall digests .
In T-cell lines that do not express tal-1 , we did not observe these Mspl-like Hpall fragments , but higher molecular weight bands ( 0.96 kb with probe 1 , 1.6 kb with probe 2 in HUT78 , 3 kb and 6 kb fragments with either probes in Peer ) .
Therefore , this part of the locus was mildly methylated in HUT78 cells , and highly methylated in PEER cells .
In JURKAT cells , the probe 1 hybridized simultaneously to a Mspl-like Hpall fragment of 0.8 kb and to higher molecular weight Hpall fragments of 1.2 kb and 3 kb .
The probe 2 identified three Mspl-like Hpall fragments of 0.74 kb , 0.45 kb , and 0.3 kb , but also larger Hpall fragments of 1.6 kb and 3 kb .
Since we showed that tal-1 transcription is most probably monoallelic in JURKAT , these results suggest that the transcriptionally active allele is methylation-free , whereas the inactive allele is not .
A similar pattern of Hpall digestion , characterized by the simultaneous presence of Mspl-like and larger Hpall fragments was also observed in SKW3 and Molt4 , two T-cell lines reported to express tal1 in the absence of local genomic alteration `` ( and our unpublished data ) .
Interestingly , the CEM T-cell line , which bears the SIL-tal d1 type of deletion ( with a tal-1 breakpoint located between exons 1a and 1b ) , exhibited hypomethylation of the rearranged allele in its 5 `` part ( the probe 1 hybridized to a rearranged Mspl-like 1.1-kb Hpall fragment and to Hpall fragments of 1.2 kb , 2.4 kb , and 3 kb ) , whereas the downstream region appeared highly methylated ( the probe 2 hybridized to 1.6-kb , 3-kb , and 6-kb Hpall fragments ) .
The DUS28 cell line is associated with a t ( 1 ; 14 ) affecting 3821 the 3 ' noncoding part of the sixth exon and has been reported to initiate tal-1 transcription exclusively within the tal-1 fourth exon . ``
Analysis of tal-1 methylation status in this cell line showed a high degree of methylation in the 5 ' part of the locus , whereas the fourth exon initiation region is unmethylated ( data not shown ) .
In fact , the exon 4 flanking region was hypomethylated in all the cell lines we tested regardless of tal- 1 expression ( data not shown ) .
The methylation patterns observed in most of the cell lines studied are listed in Table 1 .
Because transcription and absence of methylation seemed to be correlated , we assessed whether methylation could be involved in the repression of tal-1 expression in normal tissues .
We therefore explored the methylation status of the 5° GC-rich region in normal cells that do not express tal-1 , ie , peripheral blood lymphocytes , leukocytes , and fibroblasts .
Figure 2C clearly shows that the tal-1 5 ' region is methylation-free in these three tissues .
Together , our results indicate that the tal-1 5° GC-rich region behaves like a CpG island : it is methylation-free in vivo , whether transcribed or not , and becomes methylated on transcriptionally inactive alleles in established cell lines .
Specific DNase-I HS are associated with the preferential use of the different tal-1 promoters .
- Hypersensitivity of chromatin to DNase-I digestion has been used to identify regulatory elements of several genes .
`` `` * `` To determine which regions of the tal-1 locus might be implicated in the control of its expression , either in cells of the erythroid/ megakaryocytic lineage or in leukemic T-cell lines , we mapped DNase-I HS in 45 kb of genomic DNA encompassing the tal-1 transcription unit .
Figure 3 shows the mapping of DNase HS after HindIII digestion and hybridization with a 3 ' HindlII-Xbal probe in HEL , K562 , JURKAT , PEER , HUT78 , and DUS28 cell lines .
In addition to the germline 20-kb fragment , several additional fragments were detected .
Two fragments of 1.7 and 1.9 kb ( HS Va and b ) and a fragment of 4.8 kb ( HS IV ) were exclusively observed in HEL and K562 .
HS Va and Vb were more intense in K562 , whereas HS IV was more intense in HEL .
The probe hybridized strongly to a 11.6-kb fragment in Jurkat ( HS ID .
This fragment was already present , albeit more faintly , in Jurkat cells that had not been treated with DNase-I ( lane 0 ) , probably because of endogenous DNases activity .
However , the intensity of this fragment augmented with increasing amounts of DNase-I , whereas the intensity of the germline fragment decreased , indicating that this region is highly sensitive to DNase-I in Jurkat .
A very faint band of the same size was also detected in HEL , K562 , DUS28 , HUT78 , and Peer .
An intense band of 7.8 kb ( HS III ) was observed in DU528 .
A fragment of a similar size , but much weaker in intensity , was also observed in HEL , together with a weak 6-kb fragment .
Rehybridization of the blot with a probe located in the sixth exon did not show any HS in the 3 ' part of the locus in HEL , K562 , and Jurkat cell lines ( data not shown ) .
To map these DNase-I HS more precisely , we used the 3 `` BamHI-BgIll probe on BamHI-digested DNAs ( Fig 4 ) .
In addition to the 16.5-kb germline fragment , we observed an intense 2.3 kb ( HS III ) fragment in DUS28 , which was very weak in HEL and Jurkat lines ; an intense 6.1-kb ( HS II ) From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

ting of DNase-I occurred in the HS IV and V regions .
The DNase sensitivity of HEL chromatin as shown by the 6-kb fragment in HindIII digestions could not be further explored with the BamHI digestion , since this potential DNase-I HS mapped in the region of the probe used to hybridize BamHI blots .
DNase-I treatment followed by BgIlI digestions and subsequent hybridization with the 5 `` BgIlI-BamHI probe previously used in the BamHI studies confirmed the presence of HS IV in HEL and indicated a weak DNase-I hypersensitivity in the promoter 1b in JURKAT and in the exon 4 promoter in DU528 , but did not show any other major HS ( data not shown ) .
Figure 5 summarizes the various HS that we have characterized in the different cell lines , and their respective location within the tal-1 locus .
With respect to the initiation of tal-1 transcription in the exon 1a , the different HS identified are the following : HS I ( -10.3 kb ) , HS II ( -7 kb ) , HS III ( -3.1 kb ) , HS IV ( -0.2 kb ) , and HS Va and Vb ( +2.8 kb and +3 kb , respectively ) .
Our results show that different regions of the locus are specifically activated when tal-1 transcription is driven from promoters la and 1b ( HS sites I , IV and V ) in erythroid/megakaryocytic lines ( HEL and K562 ) , from the promoter 1b ( HS II ) in Jurkat cell line , and from the exon 4 promoter ( HS III ) in DUS28 .
Interestingly , HS II and IH are also present , although to a much lesser extent in other cell lines , even if they do not use these tal-1 promoters .
DISCUSSION Several established T-cell lines and blasts from T-ALL patients express high levels of tal-1 mRNA in the absence of apparent alterations of tal-1 locus .
These observations suggest that tal-1 expression in T-ALL could result from an activation in trams of both alleles , possibly reflecting a transitory expression of this gene during T-lymphocyte differentiation that would persist on transformation .
Although thymic tal-1 transcripts have not been detected by Northern blotting analysis , `` `` a transient activation of this gene in particular stages of T-lymphocyte differentiation can not be formally excluded in view of the following observations : ( 1 ) a faint tal-1 transcription has been detected in the thymus by reverse transcriptase PCR analysis ' ; ( 2 ) the presence of sparse fetal and adult mouse thymic cells expressing tal-1 protein has been recently reported `` `` ; ( 3 ) a cryptic tal-1 promoter located within exon 4 has been shown to be exclusively active in leukemic T cells with or without tal-1 genomic alterations `` ; and ( 4 ) since transcriptionally active loci are more likely to be targets for chromosomal rearrangements , the identification of recurrent translocations involving tal-1 and TCR6 loci suggests that both might be active at the same stage in early T-cell development .
As Jurkat cell line is devoid of gross genomic alterations of the locus and expresses a high level of tal-1 mRNA , initiated mostly in the exon 1b and to a much lesser extent in the exon 4 , we investigated the transcriptional activity of both tal-1 alleles in this cell line .
The systematic sequencing of tal-1-transcribed regions allowed us to identify a DNA polymorphism in the coding part of the sixth exon .
Within the sensitivity limits of the method we used , our data strongly suggest that tal-1 transcription occurs uniquely on one allele in Jurkat cells , thus indicating a cis-activating mechanism .
DNA polymorphisms such as the one reported here could be used to appreciate whether transactivation of the locus occurs in other leukemic T cells that do not display obvious structural genomic alteration .
The cis-activating mechanism responsible for the tal-1 monoallelic transcription in Jurkat could be either a point mutation or a long-range cis-activating rearrangement .
We are currently investigating this last hypothesis .
To define the regulatory elements that control tal-1 expression either in its germline configuration or in T-ALL devoid of 5 ' alteration of the locus , we decided to investigate tal-1 methylation status and DNase-I hypersensitivity in erythroid/ megakaryocytic cell lines known to express tal-1 from the promoters 1a and 1b , in Jurkat cells that express tal-1 mainly from the promoter 1b , in DUS28 , a T-cell line bearing a t ( 1 ; 14 ) affecting the 3 ' part of tal-1 transcription unit and initiating transcription within exon 4 , and in PEER and HUT78 ( T-cell lines that do not express tal-1 gene ) .
CpG methylation is known to contribute to the repression of genes located on the inactive X chromosome* and has been proposed to be involved in the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression . ``

Two erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines ( HEL and K562 ) , and four T-cell lines ( JURKAT , DUS528 , HUT78 , PEER ) and a nonhematopoietic cell line ( HELA ) were analyzed .
JURKAT express tal-1 gene in the absence of reported genomic alteration of the locus ; DUS528 bears a t ( 1 ; 14 ) translocation affecting the 3 ' noncoding part of tal-1 transcription unit and express tal-1 gene .
PEER and HUT78 do not express this gene .
The different fragments observed in these cell lines are indicated by arrows .
methylation status in different established cell lines indicated a correlation between active transcription and hypomethyla-tion .
Yet , this correlation was not observed in normal tissues that do not express the tal-1 gene .
These results demonstrate that tal-1 5 `` region behaves like a CpG island , hypomethylated in normal cells regardless of tal-1 expression , and methylated de novo on transcriptionally inactive alleles in established cell lines .
It has been suggested that the methylation of CpG islands that occurs in established cell lines is incompatible with expression of the associated genes .
** `` `` This phenomenon is presumably linked to the alterations in chromatin structure and/or to the inhibition of binding of transcription factors , either directly or via competition with the binding of methyl CpG proteins .
`` `` * `` `` Our data on the methylation status of tal-1 5 ' region in the T cell line CEM clearly showed a hypomethylation in the taldl rearranged region ( encompassing SIL first exon and tal-1 exon 1b ) and a high level of methylation downstream ( in the region of tal-1 exons 3825 2 and 3 ) , even on the transcriptionally active allele .
This observation may be relevant to recent studies indicating that methylation affects the formation of the preinitiation complex rather than the elongation of transcription . ``
Hypomethylation of Bel-2 first exon has recently been proposed to be indicative of trans activation of both alleles in B-chronic lymphocytic leukemias .
* ' The hypomethylation of tal-1 gene in normal T lymphocytes that do not express tal-1 precludes the utilization of this chromatin marker to evaluate tal-1 monoallelic or biallelic transcription in T-ALL devoid of genomic rearrangement , but stil® indicates a potential accessibility of the tal-1 locus to recombination , as recently reported for the immunoglobulin x gene segment . ``
'' DNase-I HS have been associated with a wide range of cis-regulatory sequences and are usually indicative of pro-tein-DNA interactions . ``
Extensive mapping of the DNase-I HS in the chromatin of several cell lines allowed us to identify five major hypersensitive sites in the 5 ' part of tal-1 locus .
These sites were absent in HELA , a carcinoma-derived cell line , suggesting their hematopoietic specificity .
No HS was found in the 3 ' part of the locus .
HS I is located 10.3 kb 5 ' of tal-1 exon la and was only observed in the erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines HEL and K562 .
HS II is located 7 kb 5 ' of tal-1 exon la , in the vicinity of the fourth tal-1 breakpoint reported in SIL-tal-1 deletions ( d4 ) .
`` * This HS was present as a weak band in all the hematopoietic cell lines tested , independently of tal-1 expression , but absent in Hela .
This site might define a particular state of chromatin structure in the vicinity of tal-1 locus that could play a role in the transcriptional competence of tal-1 during hematopoie-sis and could favor recombination events during T-cell matu-ration .
However , this site exhibited a strong DNase-I sensitivity in Jurkat , suggesting that this DNA region might also be implicated in the cis-activation of tal-1 transcription from 103 % +28/ +36 i % T Kb 3.18 42K ?

3826 the promoter 1b in this cell line .
This result , together with the monoallelic expression of tal-1 in Jurkat , infers that this particular region could mediate the transcriptional effects of distant DNA rearrangements , as already reported for other oncogenes such as myc or Evil . ``
HS III was mapped 3.1 kb 5 ' of tal-1 exon la .
This site was major in DUS28 and weak in HEL and Jurkat cell lines .
In DUS28 , the activation of the exon 4 promoter was supposed to be driven by the enhancer of TCR6 , positioned 3 ' of tal-1 transcription unit by the t ( 1 ; 14 ) translocation .
Our results suggest that the molecular mechanisms involved in the deregulation of tal-1 gene expression in DUS28 might be more complex than previously thought , since they might implicate three different regulatory elements : the TCR enhancer , tal-1 HS III , and tal-1 exon 4 promoter .
Such complex molecular interactions ( locus control region/enhancer/promoter ) have already been described in the regulation of genes such as # globin `` * or CD2 . ``
If the monoallelic transcription of tal-1 in Jurkat results from a long-distance recombination event , then the preferential activation of different HS and distinct promoters in Jurkat and DUS28 should be linked either to the respective location of the different regulatory elements on the rearranged allele , or to the nature of the regulatory element brought in the vicinity of the tal-1 locus by the rearrangement .
HS sites IV ( located in promoter la ) and V ( located 2.8 and 3 kb 3 ' of tal-1 exon 1a , in the intervening sequences between exons 2a and 3 ) were observed exclusively in the erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines .
It should be pointed out that HS IV is located in the proximal region of the tissue-specific exon la .
This region contains two GATA motifs and Sp1 consensus binding sites , and we and others have recently shown that it defines the tal-1 minimal promoter in erythroid cells `` ( and Lecointe et al , submitted ) .
Since this promoter has a relatively low activity in transient assays , we postulated that sequences outside of this region are likely to enhance its function .
HS I and V might identify such regions , since they were exclusively observed in cells of the erythroid/megakaryocytic lineage .
Furthermore , the close inspection of HS V sequence shows numerous GATA , Spl , and Ets binding sites within this region , supporting its role as an erythroid/megakaryocytic regulatory sequence . ``
Together , our data demonstrate that the preferential use of the different tal-1 promoters is linked to distinct regulatory elements revealed as strong DNase-I HS .
