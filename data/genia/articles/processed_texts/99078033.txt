Interdomain B in ZAP-70 Regulates but Is Not Required for ZAP-70 Signaling Function in Lymphocytes QIHONG ZHAO , `` BRANDI L. WILLIAMS , `` ROBERT T. ABRAHAM , anp ARTHUR WEISS'* Department of Medicine , Howard Hughes Medical Institute , University of California at San Francisco , San Francisco , California 94143-0795 ; and Department of Immunology , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , Minnesota 55905 Received 7 July 1998/Returned for modification 19 August 1998/Accepted 19 October 1998 The protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 plays an important role in T-cell activation and development .
After T-cell receptor stimulation , ZAP-70 associates with the receptor and is phosphorylated on many tyrosines , including Y292 , Y315 , and Y319 within interdomain B .
Previously , we demonstrated that Y292 negatively regulates ZAP-70 function and that Y315 positively regulates ZAP-70 function by interacting with Vav .
Recent studies have suggested that Y319 also positively regulate ZAP-70 function .
Paradoxically , removal of interdomain B ( to create the construct designated A ) , containing the Y292 , Y315 , and Y319 sites , did not eliminate the ability of ZAP-70 to induce multiple gene reporters in Syk-deficient DT-40 B cells and ZAP-70/Syk-deficient Jurkat cells .
Here we show that A still utilizes the same pathways as wild-type ZAP-70 to mediate NF-AT induction .
This is manifested by the ability of A to restore induction of calcium fluxes and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and by the ability of dominant negative Ras and FK506 to block the induction of NF-AT activity mediated by A. Biochemically we show that the stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav , She , and ZAP-70 itself is diminished , whereas that of Slp-76 is increased in cells reconstituted with A. Deletion of interdomain B did not affect the ability of ZAP-70 to bind to the receptor .
The in vitro kinase activity of ZAP-70 lacking interdomain B was markedly reduced , but the kinase activity was still required for the protein 's in vivo activity .
Based on these data , we concluded that interdomain B regulates but is not required for ZAP-70 signaling function leading to cellular responses .
Stimulation of the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) and B-cell receptor ( BCR ) initiates a cascade of signal transduction events involving the activation of two families of protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) , Src PTKs and Syk/ZAP-70 PTKs ( 2-4 , 20 , 26 ) .
The Sre family PTKs initiate these events by phosphorylating the tyrosine residues within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs ( ITAMs ) after TCR or BCR stimulation .
The Syk/ZAP-70 PTKs are subsequently recruited to the phosphorylated ITAMs , where they become tyrosine phosphorylated and activated .
Activation of these kinases further leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous cellular proteins , including phospholipase C-y isoforms , Vav , She , and Slp-76 .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-y induces its enzymatic activation , resulting in the generation of the two second messengers , inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglye-erol , which are responsible for a rapid and sustained intracellular calcium increase and activation of protein kinase C , respectively ( 32 ) .
These early biochemical events regulate downstream cytokine gene induction and other effector func-tions .
ZAP-70 is a crucial PTK in T-cell activation and develop-ment , as has been demonstrated in both humans and in mice lacking ZAP-70 ( 1 , 8 , 11 , 17 , 33 ) .
Similarly , a critical role for Syk in B-cell activation and development has been shown both in chicken B cells and in mice made deficient in Syk ( 9 , 22 , 24 ) .
Like Syk , ZAP-70 is composed of three easily identifiable do-mains , a tyrosine kinase domain and two tandemly arranged SH2 domains ( N terminal and C terminal ) which mediate the association of ZAP-70 with the TCR after its stimulation ( 7 , 13 , 29 ) .
ZAP-70 possesses rather large regions between the two * Corresponding author .

948 SH2 domains ( interdomain A ) and between the C-terminal SH2 domain and the kinase domain ( interdomain B ) ( Fig .
1 ) .
Interdomain A forms a coiled-coil structure and is likely involved in bringing together the two SH2 domains that bind to receptor ITAMs ( 12 ) .
Although the structure of interdomain B is not available , it contains multiple signaling motifs , including a proline-rich region as well as Y292 , Y315 , and Y319 that are inducibly phosphorylated ( 5 , 10 , 30 ) .
Previously we and others have shown that Y292 negatively regulates ZAP-70 function , likely by interacting with an inhibitor ( 14 , 38 ) .
Recently , it has been reported that Cbl appears to interact , via a novel phos-photyrosine binding domain , with Y292 of ZAP-70 , suggesting that Cbl may mediate the negative regulatory function of Y292 ( 16 ) .
However , the exact biochemical mechanism by which Cbl regulates ZAP-70 function is not clear .
We have also shown that Y315 within interdomain B positively regulates ZAP-70 function by recruiting Vav via its SH2 domain ( 37 ) .
In a heterologous reconstitution system , mutation of Y315 has profound effects on ZAP-70 tyrosine phosphorylation and on BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of other substrates , including Vav , Slp-76 , and Shc , suggesting that Y315 contributes to multiple aspects of ZAP-70 function ( 37 ) .
Y319 also plays a functional role ; mutation of Y319 has been shown to reduce the ability of ZAP-70 to reconstitute NF-AT induction in ZAP-70/Syk-deficient Jurkat cells ( 32a ) , and overexpression of a Y319 mutant also inhibits TCR-induced NF-AT induction in wild-type Jurkat cells in a dominant negative ( DN ) manner , suggesting that Y319 is essential for ZAP-70 function ( 10 ) .
Finally , the proline-rich sequence may also be functionally important .
Mutation of the proline-rich sequence enhanced the ability of ZAP-70 to reconstitute NF-AT induction in Syk-deficient DT-40 cells ( 39 ) .
However , the overlap between this proline-rich sequence and the Y292 site may explain the gain-of-function phenotype of the mutation of prolines in this se-quence .

Schematic representation of WT ZAP-70 and A. aa , amino acid .
Here , we extend our studies and show that ZAP-70 lacking interdomain B ( A ) retained its ability to reconstitute the antigen receptor-mediated induction of multiple nuclear factors including NF-AT , AP1 , and NF-kB .
This is quite surprising since both Y315 and Y319 have been shown to be essential for ZAP-70 function in inducing downstream gene expression .
NF-AT induction in cells reconstituted by A is still dependent on the calcium- and Ras-dependent pathways since A still allows antigen receptor-induced calcium mobilization and mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase activation .
Moreover , both FK506 and a DN Ras construct markedly inhibit NF-AT induction in cells reconstituted by A. Biochemically , we show that deletion of interdomain B reduces the antigen receptor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav , Shc , and ZAP-70 itself , whereas it increases that of Slp-76 .
In addition , deletion of interdomain B does not affect the recruitment of ZAP-70 to the TCR .
Surprisingly , the in vitro kinase activity of A is much lower than that of wild-type ( WT ) ZAP-70 ; however , the kinase activity is still required for its in vivo activity .
Based on all of these results , we conclude that interdomain B regulates but is not absolutely required for ZAP-70 function .

RESULTS A retains its ability to reconstitute gene expression in Syk/ ZAP-70-deficient DT-40 B cells .
Previously we and others have demonstrated that ZAP-70 can compensate for the defect of Syk in the chicken B-cell line DT-40 , as determined by the induction of cellular tyrosine phosphorylation , the mobilization of calcium mobilization , and the induction of gene expression ( 15 , 38 ) .
We used this system to show that in interdomain B , Y292 negatively regulates ZAP-70 function whereas Y315 positively regulate ZAP-70 function ( 37 , 38 ) .
Mutation of Y292 increased the function of ZAP-70 in BCR-induced downstream gene expression , whereas mutation of Y315 or of Y319 decreased downstream signaling ( Fig .
2 ) ( 10 , 32a ) .
Interestingly , and consistent with our previous report ( 38 ) , removal of interdomain B ( Fig .
1 ) encompassing these tyrosines resulted in a form of ZAP-70 which still functions to activate the NF-AT transcription reporter ( Fig .
2A ) .
Here , we extend those studies to show a similar effect on AP1 and NF- « B induction following BCR stimulation in these cells ( Fig .
2B and C ) .
In addition , this deletion mutant allowed BCR induction of the activity of all three reporters to a level similar to that of mutation of Y292 site alone in Syk '~ DT-40 cells .
The levels of protein expression for all of these ZAP-70 mutants were comparable ( Fig .
2D ) , as were the responses to stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) plus ionomycin in cells transfected with different ZAP-70 plasmids ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that interdomain B of ZAP-70 regulates , but is not required for , its functional activity in the pathways leading to activation of all three reporter systems .
BCR-mediated NF-AT induction in cells reconstituted by A is mediated by calcium- and Ras-dependent pathways .
NF-AT induction has been used as an established marker of antigen receptor-mediated activation of T and B cells .
The minimum signaling requirements for NF-AT induction are activation of both the Ras and calcium-dependent-calcineurin pathways ( 34 ) .
As shown in Fig .
2 , A retained the ability to restore BCR induction of NF-AT activity .
To determine whether NF-AT induction reconstituted by this mutant is also mediated by calcium- and Ras-dependent pathways , we established stable Syk-deficient DT-40 cell clones reconstituted with WT ZAP-70 and A .
All of these stable clones have comparable expression of surface BCR and ZAP-70 proteins ( data not shown ) .
First we examined whether BCR stimulation in cells reconstituted with A can induce calcium mobilization and activate MAP kinase .
Note that DT-40 B cells express only Erk-1 MAP ki-nase , and the activated form could be detected with human anti-phospho-MAP kinase antibody .
BCR-mediated calcium responses ( Fig .
3A ) and MAP kinase activation ( Fig .
3B ) were induced to comparable extents in WT ZAP-70- and A-express-ing cells .
To further determine whether calcium- and Ras-dependent pathways are required for NF-AT induction in cells reconstituted with A , we examined whether this NF-AT induc- 950 ZHAO ET AL .

tion can be blocked either by FK506 or by DN Ras ( Ras N17 mutant ) .
NF-AT induction in A-reconstituted cells was blocked by these agents ( Fig .
4 ) .
Collectively , these results indicate that NF-AT induction in A-reconstituted cells is mediated by nor mal signaling pathways , i.e .
, the calcium- and Ras-dependent signaling cascades .
Therefore , it is unlikely that aberrant sig- ] no stimulation naling pathways are activated in cells reconstituted with A to E anti-BCR induce NF-AT activity after BCR stimulation .
Deletion of interdomain B in ZAP-70 markedly decreases the BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav , She , and ZAP-70 itself but increases that of Slp-76 .
To determine whether A has altered ability to phosphorylate downstream substrates , we examined the ability of BCR stimulation to induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation in lysates from Syk '~ cells or from Syk ~~ cell clones stably transfected with WT ZAP-70 or A .
As previously reported , BCR stimulation of Syk-deficient DT-40 cells induced only a few cellular tyrosine plasmids phosphoproteins ( Fig .
5A , lane 1 and 2 ) .
Expression of ZAP-70 in these cells increased the ability of the BCR to 100 induce a number of cellular tyrosine phosphoproteins ( Fig .
5A , lanes 3 to 6 ) .
Expression of A in these cells did not change the gross pattern of BCR-inducible cellular tyrosine phosphopro- teins compared with WT ZAP-70 ( Fig .
5A ; compare lanes 4 ] no stimulation and 6 with lanes 8 and 10 ) .
We examined whether deletion of interdomain B altered the ability of ZAP-70 to contribute to the phosphorylation of individual substrates .
To test whether A affects the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav , we transiently co expressed human Vav with empty vector , WT ZAP-70 , or A into Lyn/Syk-deficient DT-40 cells , in which BCR-induced Vav 25-4 phosphorylation was completely absent ( 23 ) ( Fig .
5B ) .
Coex- pression of Vav with WT ZAP-70 led to tyrosine phosphory- lation of Vav following BCR stimulation .
However , coexpres- o- sion of Vav with A resulted in much reduced phosphorylation of Vav following BCR stimulation .
This result is consistent with our previous studies showing that Y315 within the inter domain B is required for Vav phosphorylation .
We also plasmids showed that glutathione S-transferase-Vav SH2 did not bind to A whereas WT ZAP-70 retains its binding function ( data not C. 425 shown ) , consistent with the notion that deletion of interdomain B does not create a new Vav binding site in ZAP-70 .
To further determine the impact of deletion of interdomain B on ZAP 10 - 70-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of other downstream substrates , we analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation of Slp-76 and She .
Coexpression of WT ZAP-70 with She in Syk-defi- [ ] no stimulation cient DT4O cells resulted in BCR stimulation-dependent ty .
rosine phosphorylation of Shc ( Fig .
5C ) .
However , coexpres- 5- N anti-BCR sion of A with She resulted in marked reduction of She tyrosine phosphorylation .
Interestingly , in contrast to Vav and Shc , coexpression of A with Slp-76 led to an increase in the BCR 2.5 - induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Slp-76 in comparison with that induced in cells reconstituted by WT ZAP-70 ( Fig .
5D ) .
OJ This is consistent with the notion that Slp-76 is a direct sub strate and/or effector of ZAP-70 ( 31 ) .

NF-AT induction mediated by A can be blocked by FK506 and DN Ras .

The transfected cells were stimulated with anti-BCR and assayed for luciferase activity .
Both cell types were transfected with NF-AT-luc , stimulated with anti-BCR in the presence or absence of FK506 , and assayed for luciferase activity .

The data shown are representative of at least three independent experiments .
4285-331 represents the same plasmid as A represents in the other figures .
of ZAP-70 itself , we performed an antiphosphotyrosine blotting analysis of the immunoprecipitates of WT ZAP-70 and A. Deletion of interdomain B markedly decreased the BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 ( Fig .
5E ) .
This is an expected result since it removes multiple tyrosine sites ( Y292 , Y¥315 , and Y319 ) .
However , it is interesting that this form of ZAP-70 , with an increased ability to restore BCR induction of NF-AT activity , was tyrosine phosphorylated to a lesser extent than WT ZAP-70 .
Deletion of interdomain B in ZAP-70 does not affect its binding to the TCR but markedly reduces its in vitro kinase activity .
Following TCR stimulation , ZAP-70 is recruited to the receptor complex via its interaction with ITAMs , a step critical for ZAP-70 activation .
Therefore , one possible mechanism by which interdomain B affects ZAP-70 function is to affect the relative accessibility of ZAP-70 to the receptor .
We examined this possibility by using recently described ZAP-70/ Syk-deficient Jurkat cells ( P116 ) .
We used an antiphosphotyrosine antibody to blot anti-Myc immunoprecipitates from lysates of P116 cells transfected with Myc epitope-tagged WT ZAP-70 or A .
No difference in binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated TCR & chain , either in the basal state or after TCR stimulation , was observed ( Fig .
6A ) .
Consistent with the data shown in Fig .
5A , we detected markedly less tyrosine phosphorylation of A than of WT ZAP-70 in P116 cells transfected with these constructs .
The levels of protein expression of WT ZAP-70 and A were comparable ( lower panel ) .
Note that deletion of interdomain B did not affect the ability of ZAP-70 to associate with pp36-38 following TCR stimulation ( double arrow in upper panel ) .
To examine whether deletion of interdomain B affected the kinase activity of ZAP-70 , Myc epitope-tagged WT ZAP-70 or A was expressed in Syk/Lyn-deficient DT-40 cells , and then the in vitro kinase activity of anti-Myc epitope-tagged immunoprecipitates was measured as both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate , erythrocyte band III .

ZAP-70 proteins because doing so avoided the potential problem of coimmunoprecipitating Src family PTKs in the kinase assays .
As shown in Fig .
6B , compared with WT ZAP-70 , A exhibited a marked reduction in basal kinase activity toward itself and band III .
A also had a great reduction in BCR-induced kinase activity toward itself and band III ( data not shown ) .
These data indicate that deletion of interdomain B greatly reduced autophosphorylation and the kinase activity toward band III in vitro .
To examine whether the kinase activity of ZAP-70 is required for the function of A in vivo , we introduced a point mutation in the ATP binding site of A and transfected this construct into Syk~'~ DT-40 cells to examine the induction of NF-AT activity by this double mutant .
As shown in Fig .
6D , a point mutation in the ATP binding site of A eliminated its ability to reconstitute NF-AT induction in Syk~'~ DT-40 cells .
This result indicates that the kinase activity is still required for the function of A .
A retains the ability to reconstitute NF-AT induction in ZAP-70/Syk-deficient Jurkat cells .
So far , we have analyzed the functional and biochemical consequences of A in Syk/ZAP-70-deficient DT-40 B cells .
To determine whether deletion of interdomain B also manifested similar effects in Jurkat T cells , we used recently described ZAP-70/Syk-deficient Jurkat cells .
Coexpression of WT ZAP-70 or A with the NF-AT reporter demonstrated that A still retains its ability to reconstitute NF-AT induction in a dose-dependent manner following TCR stimulation .
This result indicates that interdomain B is not absolutely required for the function of ZAP-70 in either B- or T-cell antigen receptor systems .
TCR-mediated NF-AT induction in ZAP-70/Syk-deficient Jurkat T cells reconstituted by A is mediated by calcium- and Ras-dependent signaling pathways .
The minimum signaling requirements for NF-AT induction are activation of both the Ras-dependent and calcium-dependent calcineurin pathways .
As shown in Fig .
7 , A retained the ability to restore TCR induction of NF-AT activity in ZAP-70/Syk-deficient Jurkat T cells .
To determine whether calcium- and Ras-dependent pathways are required for NF-AT induction in these cells reconstituted with A , we examined whether this NF-AT induction can be blocked either by FK506 ( inhibiting calcineurin ) or by DN Ras ( Ras N17 mutant ) .
NF-AT induction in A-reconstituted ZAP-70/Syk-deficient Jurkat T cells was blocked by these agents ( Fig .
8 ) , similar to the result for A-reconstituted Syk/ ZAP-70-deficient DT-40 B cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
Taken together , these results indicate that NF-AT induction in both A-reconstituted ZAP-70/Syk-deficient Jurkat T cells and A-reconstituted Syk/ ZAP-70-deficient DT-40 B cells is mediated by normal signal is reduced in cells transfected with A. Syk-deficient DT-40 B cells , or Syk-deficient DT-40 B cells stably expressing WT ZAP-70 or A , were transfected with She cDNA .
Cells were stimulated and lysed as described for panel A .
The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-She MAb , and the immune complex was blotted with 4G10 ( top ) .
The blot was then stripped and reblotted with polyclonal anti-She antibody ( bottom ) .
Anti-ZAP-70 Western blotting showed equivalent expression between WT ZAP-70 and A ( not shown ) .

Syk-deficient cells , or Syk-deficient cells stably expressing WT ZAP-70 or A , were transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged human Slp-76 .
Cells were stimulated and lysed as described for panel A .
The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG epitope antibody M2 , and the immune complex were blotted with 4G10 ( top ) .

Therefore , it is unlikely that aberrant signaling pathways are activated to induce NF-AT activity following TCR or BCR stimulation in cells reconstituted with A .
DISCUSSION Previously , we demonstrated that Y292 within interdomain B plays a negative role in regulating ZAP-70 function ( 38 ) , whereas Y315 plays a positive role in regulating its function ( 37 ) .
Recently it has been shown that Y319 within interdomain B also has an important positive regulatory function ( 10 , 322 ) .

induction of multiple downstream transcription reporters including NF-AT , AP1 , and NF- « B .
In addition , this mutant allowed BCR induction of the activity of all three reporters to a level similar to that of cells reconstituted with ZAP-70 containing mutation of Y292 site alone in Syk ~~ DT-40 cells .
We further demonstrated that this mutant ( A ) participated in the same pathways as WT ZAP-70 to activate NF-AT ( Fig .
3 , 4 , and 8 ) , arguing against the possibility that some aberrant pathways had been unmasked by A. Biochemically we showed that A mediated reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav , She , and itself while it increased that of Slp-76 , suggesting that interdomain B plays a complex role in regulating ZAP-70 function .
In addition , deletion of interdomain B did not affect the accessibility of ZAP-70 to the TCR , although it markedly reduced the in vitro kinase activity of ZAP-70 toward itself ( autophosphor-ylation ) and toward exogenous substrate band III .
All of these results suggest that interdomain B regulates but is not required for ZAP-70 function .
One current model for ZAP-70 activation in T-cell lines and clones is that TCR stimulation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor ITAMs which is mediated by the Lek Sre family PTK ( 32 ) .
ZAP-70 is activated after its recruitment to the phosphorylated ITAMs and its subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation .
The association of ZAP-70 with the tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAMs is critical but not sufficient for activating ZAP-70 ( 15 , 25 , 28 ) .
TCR stimulation induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 and its activation via an Lck-de-pendent mechanism .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 may serve two purposes .
First , tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 may provide one mechanism for its catalytic activation .
Phosphorylation of Y493 and Y492 within the kinase domain has been shown to positively and negatively , respectively , regulate its catalytic activity ( 5 , 27 ) .
These residues are predicted to be in the activation loop of the ZAP-70 kinase domain .
Second , tyrosine-phosphorylated tyrosine residues in ZAP-70 may serve as binding sites for the recruitment of other regulators and effectors ( 18 ) .
Multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites ( Y292 , Y315 , and Y¥319 ) within interdomain B regulate ZAP-70 function ( 5 , 10 , 30 ) .
We and others have previously demonstrated that mutation of Y292 to phenylalanine or glutamic acid enhances ZAP-70 function in BCR or TCR induction of NF-AT activity in either Syk/ZAP-70-deficient DT-40 B cells or TAg-Jurkat cells ( 14 , 38 ) .
Mutation of Y292 does not affect the kinase activity of ZAP-70 or its ability to bind to the TCR .
These results suggest that Y292 may recruit a negative regulator to downregulate ZAP-70 function .
Recently , Lupher et al .
have used a heterologous system to show that the Cbl-ZAP-70 interaction can be disrupted by mutation of Y292 to phenylal-anine , which suggests that Cbl may mediate the negative regulatory function of Y¥292 ( 16 ) .
Indeed , an N-terminal phospho-tyrosine binding domain was shown to be able to interact in vitro with Y292 in ZAP-70 .
However , the exact mechanism by which Cbl functions to regulate ZAP-70 function remains to be defined .
We have also shown that Y315 has a positive regulatory function in ZAP-70 .
Mutation of Y315 significantly reduced the ability of ZAP-70 to reconstitute BCR-induced NF-AT induction in Syk-deficient DT-40 B cells .
This mutation also eliminated binding of the Vav SH2 domain to ZAP-70 and markedly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav .
In addition , mutation of Y315 reduced BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav , Slp-76 , Shc , and ZAP-70 itself , suggesting that Y315 mutation affects multiple aspects of ZAP-70 signaling ( 37 ) .
Our studies with A are consistent with the effects of Y315F on tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav and Shc .
Recently , it was shown that Y319 is also essential for ZAP-70 function ; Mor .
CELL .
BioL .
mutation of Y319 significantly reduces the ability of ZAP-70 to reconstitute Syk/ZAP-70-deficient Jurkat cells and functions as a DN mutation when overexpressed in wild-type Jurkat cells ( 10 , 32a ) .
All of these data indicate that within interdomain B , multiple tyrosines play different roles , presumably by interacting with different proteins , to regulate ZAP-70 function .
Paradoxically , ZAP-70 lacking interdomain B encompassing Y¥292 , Y315 , and Y319 still retained the ability of ZAP-70 to reconstitute BCR or TCR induction of multiple transcriptional reporters in Syk-deficient DT-40 cells and in ZAP-70/Syk-deficient Jurkat cells .
This is an intriguing result considering this deletion removes one negative regulatory site ( Y292 ) and two positive regulatory sites ( Y315 and Y319 ) .
The minimum signaling requirements for NF-AT induction are activation of the Ras pathway leading to MAP kinase activation and mobilization of calcium leading to calcineurin activation .
To determine whether these signaling pathways are still used by A to mediate the antigen receptor induction of NF-AT , we conducted two types of experiments .
First , we showed that cells transfected with A still mobilize calcium and activate MAP kinase as well as WT ZAP-70 ( Fig .
3 ) .
Second , we showed that NF-AT induction mediated by A can be blocked by a pharmacological inhibitor of calcineurin ( FK506 ) and by a DN mutant of Ras ( inhibiting Ras activation ) ( Fig .
4 and 8 ) .
Therefore , it is unlikely that aberrant signaling pathways have been unmasked by A to activate NF-AT following TCR or BCR stimulation .
Like the Y315F mutant we previously reported , A mediated reduced phosphorylation of Vav and Shc , consistent with the notion that Y315 within the interdomain B is required for Vav recruitment and phosphorylation .
In contrast , we consistently detected an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Slp-76 by A , compared with WT , consistent with the notion that Slp-76 is a direct substrate/effector of ZAP-70 ( 31 ) .
Although it has been shown that Slp-76 can associate with Vav , it appears that Vav-Slp-76 complex formation is independent of Vav-ZAP-70 complex formation ( 35 ) .
It is therefore likely that Slp-76 is tyrosine phosphorylated by ZAP-70 through mechanisms that do not depend on Y315 or any other residues within interdomain B .
A enhances the ability of ZAP-70 to reconstitute BCR stimulation-dependent NF-AT induction in Syk-deficient DT-40 cells .
However , it is not more active than WT ZAP-70 in Syk/ZAP-70-deficient Jurkat cells in its ability to reconstitute NF-AT induction in these cells .
The difference in the effect of A in these two cell types is not clear .
The cell context difference observed might be due to the relative abundance levels of other signaling molecules .
One possible mechanism by which interdomain B could function to regulate ZAP-70 is by affecting the interaction of ZAP-70 with the TCR .
We provided evidence to argue against this possibility by showing that WT ZAP-70 and A have comparable abilities to bind to the TCR { chain in the basal state or after TCR stimulation ( Fig .
6A ) .
Another possibility is that interdomain B affects the kinase activity of ZAP-70 .
As shown in Fig .
6B , we detected a much lower in vitro kinase activity of A than of WT ZAP-70 in the basal state or following BCR stimulation ( data not shown ) .
This is surprising , especially considering that A has the ability , comparable to that of WT ZAP-70 , to induce expression of multiple downstream reporters following TCR and BCR stimulation ( Fig .
2 and 7 ) .
To determine whether the kinase activity of ZAP-70 is required for the function of A , we tested the function of a double mutant combining A and K369A , in which the ATP binding site was mutated .
As shown in Fig .
6C , introduction of a point mutation of ATP binding site into A eliminated the ability of A to reconstitute NF-AT induction in Syk~'~ DT-40 cells , indicat- Vor .
19 , 1999 ing that the kinase activity is still required for the function of A .
Thus , the reduction of in vitro kinase activity does not reflect the kinase-dependent functions of A in vivo .
We propose at least two models to explain how interdomain B functions to regulate ZAP-70 function .
First , individual tyrosines ( Y¥292 , Y315 , and Y319 ) within interdomain B interact with proteins which mediate either negative or positive regulatory function of ZAP-70 .
These sites may serve to fine-tune ZAP-70 function .
Y292 may interact with Cbl to negatively regulate NF-AT induction .
Y315 and Y319 may interact with Vav and other proteins to positively regulate NF-AT induction .
Perturbing these tyrosines by mutation of either the negative or positive regulatory site results in the delivery of too much or too little signal .
However , deleting the entire interdomain B removes both the positive and negative tyrosine sites and renders ZAP-70 capable of participating in antigen receptor signaling function .
The elaboration of ZAP-70 signaling by the addition of positive and negative elements may provide an important mechanism whereby the delivery of the signal to trigger T-cell activation can be modulated in a more precise manner .
This level of precision may not be appreciated in the conditions used in other studies .
As an alternative model , interdomain B may interact with other parts of ZAP-70 in a conformation that inhibits its function .
Antigen receptor stimulation may serve to open up the molecule ( or suppress the inhibited conformation ) , leading to activation of ZAP-70 .
Thus , deletion of interdomain B keeps ZAP-70 in an uninhibited conformation to potentiate its function .
This might lead to an increased ability of ZAP-70 to induce activation of downstream signaling events .
This is especially true in Syk '~ DT-40 cells .
These two models are not mutually exclusive .
The binding of proteins to the tyrosines within the interdomain region following antigen receptor stimulation could contribute to uninhibited conformation of ZAP-70 .
Needless to say , further definition of the function of interdomain B in ZAP-70 awaits structural studies of the intact molecule .
