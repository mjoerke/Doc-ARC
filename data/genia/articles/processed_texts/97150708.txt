A Novel Transcription Factor Regulates Expression of the Vacuolar H*-ATPase B2 Subunit through AP-2 Sites during Monocytic ( Received for publication , August 6 , 1996 , and in revised form , October 21 , 1996 ) Beth S. Lee # § , Irina Krits } , Monica K. Crane-Zelkovict , and Stephen L. Gluck # ] From the { Department of Medicine/ Renal Division , ( Department of Cell Biology and Physiology , and the { George M. O'Brien Center for Kidney and Urological Diseases , Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis , Missouri 63110 During monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation , the cellular content of vacuolar H*-ATPase ( V-ATPase ) increases more than 4-fold .
We have shown previously that amplified expression of the B2 subunit of the V-ATPase occurs solely by increased transcription , and that the -untranslated region of the B2 gene , containing multiple consensus binding sites for the transcription factors AP-2 and Sp1 , is required for this expression .
The present study demonstrates that AP-2 binding sequences are essential for increased transcription from the B2 promoter during monocyte-macrophage differentiation and that AP-2 , expressed exogenously in THP-1 and other cells , activates transcription from the B2 promoter .
In mobility shift assays , a nuclear factor from THP-1 and U-937 cells was identified that binds to several AP-2 response elements within the B2 promoter , but does not react with AP-2 antibodies , and has a DNA sequence binding affinity profile that differs from AP-2 .
These findings suggest that a novel AP-2-like transcription factor is responsible for V-ATPase B subunit amplification during monocyte differentiation .
The mammalian vacuolar H*ATPase , or V-ATPase , `` is a multisubunit complex that transports protons electrogenically across the membranes of intracellular endocytic and secretory compartments in all eukaryotic cells and the plasma membrane in certain specialized cell types .
Its role in acidifying organelles is required for protein transport , processing , and degradation .
In the plasma membrane , the V-ATPase participates in transcellular transport of H* and other ions and in defending cytosolic pH .
The V-ATPase is similar in structure to the FoF , -ATPases ( 1 , 2 ) and is composed of two distinct macrodomains .
The trans-membrane domain ( V , , ) is composed of proteolipids and other integral membrane proteins and transmits protons through the lipid bilayer ( 3-7 ) .
The cytosolic domain of the enyzme ( V ; ) is composed of three copies each of the `` A `` subunit ( 70 kDa ) and the `` B `` subunit ( 56-58 kDa ) , as well as a single copy of the `` C `` ( 42 kDa ) , `` D `` ( 83 kDa ) , `` E `` ( 31 kDa ) , and `` F `` ( 14 kDa ) subunits * This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health Grants AR32087 , DK38848 , DK09976 , and DK45181 and by a research grant from the Arthritis Foundation ( to B.

The A subunit contains the site of catalytic ATP-binding site ( 9 , 10 ) , although the B subunit likely participates in catalysis ( 11 ) and may have a regulatory role ( 12 , 13 ) .
Two isoforms of the B subunit have been identified in mammals ( 14-16 ) .
They are encoded by different genes and differ in amino acid sequence at the amino and carboxyl termini , although no functional differences have yet been identified .
Expression of the B1 isoform is restricted to only a few tissues ; it is found at highest levels in kidney and placenta .
The B2 isoform is ubiquitously expressed and is most abundant in kidney and brain . ``
Cells of the monocytic lineage , including monocytes , macrophages , and osteoclasts , express V-ATPase with a B2 subunit both in intracellular compartments and on their plasma membranes ( 18 ) .
Macrophages express the V-ATPase on their plasma membranes to aid in intracellular pH regulation when exposed to acidic environments such as abscessed tissue ( 19 , 20 ) ; osteoclasts employ the V-ATPase in the ruffled membrane to generate an acidic microenvironment required for bone resorption ( 21 ) .
In prior studies , we showed that during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation the cellular content of V-ATPase subunits increases by as much as 5-fold in native monocytes and by 3-4-fold in the monocytic cell line THP-1 ( 18 ) .
Both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms of amplification were observed among the different V-ATPase subunits examined ( 18 ) .
The increased expression of the B2 subunit ( approx-imately 3.5-fold ) occurred solely by transcriptional activation .
We isolated and characterized the proximal promoter region of the B2 gene and found that the DNA in the 5'-untranslated region of the gene was required for transcriptional activation during monocyte differentiation and that this region contained multiple binding sites for transcription factors Spl and AP-2 .
AP-2 was first identified as a M , = 52,000 transcription factor ( 22 , 23 ) that had unique patterns of expression in different tissues during embryonic development ( 24 ) .
Isoforms of AP-2 were later identified that were products of alternative splicing of RNA from a single gene ( 25 , 26 ) .
Subsequently , Moser et al .
( 27 ) isolated murine genomic and cDNA clones for a homologue of AP-2 , designated AP-2 $ , encoded by a second gene .
cDNAs from the two genes share an overall identity of 76 % at the amino acid level , with the strongest homology in the carboxyl-terminal DNA binding/dimerization domain ( 85 % identity , 92 % similarity ) .
Both AP-28 and the original AP-2 isolate ( now designated AP-2 « ) bind to the DNA consensus sequence although many variants of this sequence have been identified ( 28 ) .
The functional significance of the isoforms is unclear ; both AP-28B and AP-2 « activate transcription to an equal extent , and the patterns of expression * R. D. Nelson , D. M. Underhill , S. P. Hmiel , S. Bae , and S. L. Gluck , submitted for publication .

In this report , we show that AP-2 binding sites in the promoter of the V-ATPase B2 gene are functional in vivo and are required for regulation of B2 expression during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation .
We identify a nuclear factor from human monocytic cell lines that binds to AP-2 consensus binding sites but is distinct from AP-2 « and AP-2 $ as determined by DNA binding affinity and immunological reactivity .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials-Unless specified otherwise , all reagents were obtained from Sigma and were reagent grade .
Isolation and Culture of Cells-THP-1 and U-987 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection , Rockville , MD , and were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Hyclone ; Logan , UT ) , 2 mM L-glutamine , and 50 ug/ml gentamicin in a 5 % CO , incuba-tor .
THP-1 cells were induced to differentiate by addition of 160 nM tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) as described previously ( 18 , 29 ) .
DNase I Footprinting-DNase I footprinting was performed essentially as described ( 18 ) , with the exception that the noncoding strand of probe -338 to +84 was radiolabeled .
Promoter Constructs-The isolation and sequence of the B2 gene proximal promoter was described previously ( 18 ) .
B2 promoter fragments were inserted at the 5 ' end of the luciferase reporter gene in the vector pGL8 ( Promega ) , with the exception of B2 fragment -817 to -52 , which was subcloned into the vector pGL2 ( Promega ) .
The -817 to -124 site 1 mutant was created by using restriction enzymes to excise a portion of the wild-type promoter containing binding site 1 and then ligating in synthetic oligonucleotides containing the mutant site .
In this manner , the core AP-2 binding sequence of site 1 was changed from 5-GGTCTGGCC-3 ' to 5'-AATATAAAA-3 ' .
Recombinant human AP-2 « was expressed from an SV40-derived promoter in the vector pSAP2 ( a kind gift of M. Tainsky , University of Texas M.D .
Anderson Cancer Center ) .
Transfection of Cells-Transfections of THP-1 cells were performed as described previously ( 18 , 30 ) .
For AP-2 « co-transfection experiments , 5 ug of B2 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid plus 2 ug of pRSVeat , a vector for expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) used to normalize luciferase activity for transfection efficiency , were co-transfected with 0-2 ug of pSAP2 .
Cloning vector pGEM-5Z was added to the DNA mixtures as needed to equalize the DNA concentration among transfections .
Forty-eight hours after transfection , cells were harvested and prepared for luciferase and CAT assays .
The experiments using transfection and subsequent differentiation of THP-1 cells were performed as described previously ( 18 ) .
Luciferase and CAT assays were performed as described previously ( 18 , 82 ) .
Isolation of AP-2 « cDNAs from THP-1 Cells-THP-1 cells were induced with TPA for 24 h as described above .
mRNA was isolated using the FastTrack messenger RNA isolation kit ( Invitrogen ; San Diego , CA ) , following the manufacturer 's instructions .
cDNA synthesis and subcloning into the A vector Uni-ZAP were performed using a commercially available cDNA synthesis kit ( Stratagene ; La Jolla , CA ) .
For screening of this library , 1 X 10° plaques on nitrocellulose filters ( Schleicher & Schuell ) were probed with a *°P-labeled 361-base pair Pstl cDNA fragment corresponding to a region within the DNA-binding domain of human AP-2 « ( spanning amino acid residues 278-399 ; EMBL/GenBank accession number Y00229 ) .
Following hybridization of the probe , filters were washed under final conditions of 42EC in 2 X SSPE and 0.1 % SDS .
Plaques were purified through multiple rounds of screening , and pBluescript plasmids containing the inserts of interest were excised from the Uni-ZAP vector using ExAssist interference-resistant helper phage ( Stratagene ) .
Nuclear Extracts and Gel Mobility Shift Assays-Nuclear extracts from dividing or differentiated THP-1 cells were prepared by the method of Dignam et al .
( 83 ) , except nuclear proteins were further purified by precipitation with 55 % saturated ammonium sulfate prior to dialysis .
Nuclear extracts from other cell types were prepared by a modification of the method of Lee et al .
( 34 ) for small cell numbers .
For gel mobility shift assays , double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [ y-* `` PIATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase .
The oligonucleotide pair containing the AP-2 binding sequence 5'-GATCGAACT-GACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3 ' ( core binding site underlined ) from the human metallothionein IIa distal basal level element was purchased from Promega .
The B2 promoter site 1 oligonucleotide was composed of the sequence 5'-CAAGCAGGTCTGGCCCCAGCGGCGCG-3 ' corresponding to -173 to -148 with respect to the start of translation .
The site 5 oligonucleotide was composed of the sequences 5'-GCCTCGGC-CGCGGGCCGCCTT-3 ' corresponding to -78 to -58 .
The oligonucleotide containing the Spl consensus binding sequence 5'-ATTC-GATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3 ' was purchased from Promega .
Purified recombinant Spl and AP-2 « were obtained from Promega .
Approximately 30 fmol of end-labeled oligonucleotides ( 5 X 10* Cerenkov counts ) were mixed with 1-6 ug of nuclear extract in a buffer containing ( final concentration ) 50 mM NaCl , 10 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 , 1 mm MgCl , , 0.5 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , 4 % glycerol , and 0.05 mg/ml poly ( dI-dC ) « ( dI-dC ) .
Following a 20-min incubation at room tem-perature , DNA-protein complexes were separated in a 4 % nondenatur-ing acrylamide gel , which was then dried and exposed to x-ray film .
Supershift assays were performed by incubating 1-5 ug of antibody against AP-2 « ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; Santa Cruz , CA ) with nuclear extract mixtures for 2 h at 4 °C prior to addition of radiolabeled probe and gel electrophoresis .
Oligonucleotide competition reactions were performed by preincubating the nuclear extract with unlabeled oligonucleotides for 10 min at room temperature prior to addition of the radioactive probe .
Statistical Analysis-Data on promoter activity are presented as mean + S.E .
and were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using SigmaStat ( Jandel Scientific ; San Rafael , CA ) .
A p value of 0.05 was used as the threshold criterion for statistical significance .
RESULTS The 5'-Untranslated Region of the B2 Promoter Contains Multiple AP-2 Binding Sites-In previous DNase I footprinting studies in which the coding strand of the B2 promoter was labeled ( 18 ) , we found that the 5'-untranslated region and proximal coding region of the B2 promoter contained five sequences capable of binding purified AP-2 « in vitro .
In the present study , we performed footprinting experiments in which the non-coding strand was labeled .
We identified three additional potential AP-2 binding sites ( Figs .
1 and 2 ) .
The five AP-2 binding sites noted previously are designated sites 2 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 .
Of the three newly identified AP-2 binding sequences , two ( sites 3 and 4 ) , composed of the sequence 5'-GC-CGRRGCC-3 ' ( where R indicates purine ) , were found embedded within Spl binding sites .
The most proximal site ( site 1 ) contained a near-perfect palindromic sequence 5-GGTCTG-GCC-3 ' .
Purified AP-2 « also bound at the G + C-rich region of transcriptional initiation , although this site would not be expected to be active in vivo due to interference from the basal transcription complex .
Promoter deletion studies ( Fig .
3 , discussed below ) show that this site does not mediate AP-2-en-hanced transcription in vivo .
Expression of Exogenous AP-2 Increases Expression from B2 Gene Promoters-To determine whether AP-2 can bind to the B2 promoter in vivo and mediate induction of gene expression , we co-transfected into undifferentiated THP-1 cells up to 2 ug of the plasmid pSAP2 , for exogenous expression of human AP-2a « ( 85 ) , with a plasmid containing one of several B2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs .
Five promoter constructs were used .
1 ) A fragment spanning from -317 to +30 containing AP-2 binding sites 1-8 ; 2 ) fragment -317 to -52 containing AP-2 binding sites 1-5 ; 3 ) fragment -317 to -124 containing site 1 only ; 4 ) -317 to -199 , containing no AP-2 binding sites except the sequence at the transcriptional start site ; and 5 ) -817 to -124mut , containing a mutated AP-2 binding site 1 .
The results are shown in Fig .
3 .
Co-transfection of pSAP2 with the promoter constructs in THP-1 cells resulted in up to 4A-fold greater luciferase activity than in cells transfected with control plasmid .
The presence of at least one AP-2 binding site was required for this activation , since deletion or mutation of all sites abolished the effect of exogenous AP-2 .
Site 1 alone was sufficient to mediate an increase in transcriptional activity , although the magnitude of this increase was less than those mediated by longer constructs .
For all constructs , luciferase activity increased with the concentration of pSAP2 in the range of 0-2 ug .
With higher amounts , however , luciferase activity 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 176 AP-2 Binding Sites Regulate V-ATPase B2 Subunit Expression Sp1 I ME !

DNase I footprint analysis of the 5 ' -untranslated region of the B2 gene .
A DNA probe spanning the entire 5'-untranslated region ( -207 to -1 ) was incubated with purified Spl ( lane 1 ) or AP-2 @ « ( lane 3 ) , digested with DNase I , and separated by electrophoresis as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``

Expression of exogenous AP-2 « in the cell lines LLC-PK , ( a porcine kidney proximal tubule line ) , 293 ( a human embryonic kidney fibroblast line ) , and HepG2 ( a human hepa-toma line ) also resulted in increased activity of the B2 promoter , but higher concentrations of pSAP-2 plasmid were required for promoter activation in 293 and HepG2 cells ( data not shown ) .
These results demonstrate that AP-2 « is capable of activating transcription from the V-ATPase B2 promoter in multiple cell lines .

The constructs were co-transfected into THP-1 monocytes with varying amounts of the AP-2 « expression vector pSAP2 as shown , and with the plasmid pRSVcat as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``

To delineate further the segment of the gene required for transcriptional activation , we performed an analysis of additional deletions in this region .
A luciferase construct was created with promoter sequences from -274 to -124 ( containing only AP-2 site 1 ) and tested for the ability to enhance transcription during monocyte-macrophage differentiation ( Fig .

Mobility shift analysis of THP-1 nuclear extracts probed with B2 promoter AP-2 site 1 oligonucleotide .
A , nuclear extracts from control THP-1 cells ( monocytes , Zanes 2-5 ) or TPA-treated cells ( macrophages , lanes 6-9 ) analyzed for protein-DNA complex formation using labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to AP-2 binding site 1 of the B2 promoter .
Unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides ( 50-fold excess over labeled probe ) were added to mixtures to determine specificity of binding : lanes 3 and 7 , competition with unlabeled site 1 probe ; Zanes 4 and 8 competition with the AP-2 binding site of the human metallothionein IIa basal level element ; lanes 5 and 9 , competition with an Spl binding site probe ( GC box ) , demonstrating lack of competitive binding to the THP-1 cell nuclear factor .
B , nuclear extracts from THP-1 monocytes ( Zanes 2 and 3 ) and macrophages ( Zanes those mediated by longer constructs , a result similar to that obtained by coexpression of exogenous AP-2 with this promoter fragment ( see Fig .
3 ) .
These results suggest that site 1 , or surrounding sequences , accounts for at least part of the transcriptional response to a differentiation stimulus .
To determine whether deletion of site 1 abolished transcriptional activation during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation , we examined the ability of construct -317 to -124mut , containing a mutation in site 1 ( see Fig .
3 and `` Experimental Procedures `` ) , to enhance transcription during monocyte-macrophage differentiation .
In THP-1 monocytes transfected with this construct , no increase in luciferase activity was observed following phorbol ester treatment ( Fig .
4 ) .
This indicates that AP-2 binding sites have an essential role in induction of B2 expression during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation .
A Monocytic Nuclear Protein Binds to AP-2 Consensus Se-quences-To identify monocytic nuclear proteins capable of binding AP-2 binding sites , we performed gel mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from undifferentiated or differentiated THP-1 cells .
Nuclear extracts from both THP-1 monocytes and THP-1 macrophages contained a protein that bound to radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing AP-2 binding site 1 from the B2 promoter ( Fig .
5A ) .
Binding specificity was demonstrated by addition of either unlabeled probe or an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing a different AP-2 binding site ( from the human metallothionein IIa basal level element ( 28 ) ) , which abolished binding of the nuclear proteins to the labeled probe ; addition of an irrelevant oligonucleotide , however ( in this case , the binding sequence for Spl , another G + C-rich sequence ) , did not abolish binding of the proteins to the labeled probe .
The amount of site 1 oligonucleotide bound by nuclear extract was increased in THP-1 macrophages compared with THP-1 monocytes ( Fig .
5A ) .
To determine if the apparent increase in the AP-2-like factor in THP-1 macrophages was due to a more efficient extract preparation , we assayed the same extracts for Spl binding proteins .
Studies in U-937 cells , another human monocytic leukemia cell line , have shown that the Spl content of monocytes does not change significantly during TPA-induced differentiation into macrophages ( 36 ) .
We found that the Spl content of THP-1 cell nuclear extract preparations exhibited a minor decrease during differentiation to macrophages ( Fig .
5B ) , suggesting that greater recovery of transcription factors was not the reason for the increase in AP-2-like factor binding .
The basis for the slight decrease in the Spl content of THP-1 cell nuclear extract is unclear but may have caused underestima-tion of the increase in AP-2-like factor binding .
We next incubated THP-1 nuclear extracts , or purified AP-2a , with oligonucleotides containing different AP-2 binding sequences to determine whether any differences in binding affinity existed among several sequences of DNA capable of binding AP-2 « ( Fig .
6 ) .
The oligonucleotide probes included the following : 1 ) a commercially available AP-2 binding sequence ( Promega ) from the human metallothionein IIa distal basal level element ( hMtlla BLE ; ( 28 ) ) ; 2 ) the B2 promoter AP-2 binding site 1 ; and 3 ) the B2 promoter AP-2 binding site 5 .
Fig .

First , the mobility of the THP-1 factor was consistently greater than that of AP-2 « under the assay conditions .
Second , the THP-1 factor and recombinant 4 and 5 ) were analyzed for binding to a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing an Spl binding site .
Lanes 3 and 5 , competition with unlabeled probe ; Zane 6 , binding of probe to recombinant Spl .
The nuclear extracts ( lames 2-5 ) produced protein-DNA complexes with different mobilities , most likely due to different post-translation modifications of Spl as described previously ( 17 ) .t 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 178 AP-2 Binding Sites Regulate V-ATPase B2 Subunit Expression LANES 1 2 3 4 § 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 THP-1 -TPA : ++— -- ++ -- -++ -- -THP-1 +TPA : - - < - - -of f 4 - - fp f Recomb .

AP-2 and the THP-1 nuclear factor exhibit differences in affinity among several AP-2 binding site oligonucleotides .
Nuclear extracts from THP-1 monocytes or macrophages were probed with double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to AP-2 binding sites from the human metallothionein IIa basal level element or to the indicated B2 promoter AP-2 binding sites .
For each probe , the lanes were as follows : lane 1 , THP-1 monocyte extract ; lane 2 , THP-1 monocyte extract with 50-fold excess of unlabeled probe as competitor ; lane 3 , THP-1 macrophage extract ; lame 4 , THP-1 macrophage extract with unlabeled probe as competitor ; and Zane 5 , recombinant AP-2 « ( 40 nM ) .
The arrow indicates the position of the protein-DNA complex from THP-1 cell extracts .
Separate experiments , using less recombinant AP-2 @ , confirmed that only a single protein-DNA complex was formed with the hMtlla probe , with the same mobility as the complex in lane 5 ( data not shown ) .
AP-2a « exhibited different relative affinities for the probes tested .
The hMtlla BLE site oligonucleotide bound strongly to recombinant AP-2 « @ , forming a single protein-DNA complex .
When incubated with THP-1 extracts , the hMtlla BLE site oligonucleotide formed multiple protein-DNA complexes .
In contrast , the B2 site 1 and 5 oligonucleotide probes formed a single predominant protein-DNA complex in THP-1 nuclear extracts and bound to recombinant AP-2 « weakly in comparison to the hMtlla probe .
Quantitation of the THP-1 factor ( see Fig .
7 , below ) showed the concentration of this DNA-binding protein to be several hundred-fold less than that of AP-2 « in the reactions .
A second protein-DNA complex that migrated slightly ahead of the predominant complex was found occasionally in THP-1 extract preparations in some experiments ( see site 1 probe , lane 3 ) .
This protein-DNA complex was not observed reproducibly and may represent a degradation product of the intact transcription factor .
Although we found that site 1 bound to purified AP-2 « in DNase I footprinting assays ( Fig .
1 ) , we were unable , in repeated experiments , to detect any protein-DNA complex formation between site 1 and purified AP-2 « in the gel mobility shift assays .
We were able , however , to inhibit completely binding of recombinant AP-2 « to the hMtlla BLE site by preincubating the factor with a > 5000-fold excess of unlabeled site 1 oligonucleotide ( data not shown ) .
To compare the concentration of the THP-1 factor in these assays with that of AP-2 « , we determined the concentration of the THP-1 factor using the gel mobility shift assay .

Determination of the concentration of the THP-1 factor by mobility shift assay .
A , increasing amounts of radiolabeled site 5 probe were allowed to bind with 1 ul of THP-1 monocyte extract in a 10-pl reaction until saturation of the THP-1 factor was reached ( Zanes marked by asterisks ) .
The intensity of the factor-DNA complex at saturation was compared with a standard curve of free site 5 probe at a known specific activity ( B ) .
The amount of probe bound in the saturated factor-DNA complexes was calculated at 0.12 nM .
The position of the THP-1 factor of interest is marked with an arrow .
amount of THP-1 monocyte extract was incubated with increasing amounts of radiolabeled site 5 probe , and the amount of protein-DNA complex formed was assayed , allowing the number of moles of probe bound to be determined when all of the available THP-1 factor was complexed ( Fig .
7A ) .
The intensity of the factor-DNA complex at saturation was compared with a standard curve of free probe of known specific activity ( Fig .
7B ) .
Assuming a 1:1 molar ratio of factor to DNA in the complex , we estimated the concentration of THP-1 monocyte factor in our standard DNA-binding reactions ( Fe .
Fig .
6 ) to be 0.12 nm .
In contrast , the concentration of recombinant AP-2 « in the reactions shown in Fig .
6 was 40 nm .
Thus , even at a concentration 330-fold greater than the THP-1 factor , AP-2 « bound to the site 1 and 5 probes only weakly .
Both the difference in the affinity of AP-2 « and the THP-1 factor for different probes , and the differences in mobility of the protein-DNA complexes formed , strongly suggest that the two proteins are distinct .
As an additional and independent method for determining whether the THP-1 nuclear factor was different from AP-2 « , we analyzed the protein-DNA complexes using the antibody `` su-pershift `` method ( 37 ) to determine whether the factor is im-munologically similar to AP-2 ( Fig .
8 ) .
Antibody to the carboxyl terminus of human AP-2 « ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , incubated with nuclear proteins prior to probe addition and elec-trophoresis , did not produce a mobility supershift of protein-DNA complexes from THP-1 cells ( from either the monocytic or macrophage-like forms ) , but the antibody shifted the mobility of the entire AP-2 « -oligonucleotide complex .
Although the antibody was not tested directly in supershift assays for binding to AP-2 $ , it does detect on immunoblots and should have caused a mobility supershift if the THP-1 factor were AP-28B ( 27 ) .

Supershift analysis of THP-1 and U-987 nuclear proteins .
Mobility shift and antibody supershift analyses were performed on nuclear extracts from THP-1 monocytes ( Zanes 2 and 3 ) , THP-1 macrophages ( Zanes 4 and 5 ) , U-987 promonocytes ( Zanes 6 and 7 ) , and on purified recombinant AP-2 « ( Zanes 8 and 9 ) using a labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to AP-2 binding site 5 of the B2 promoter .
Addition of anti-AP-2 antibody shifted the mobility of the AP-2 « protein-DNA complex ( lane 9 ) , whereas the mobility of complexes from the THP-1 and U-987 nuclear extracts ( indicated by the arrow ) was unaffected by the antibody .
( The slight reduction in signal between lanes 4 and 5 was not seen consistently and most likely is an artifact of uneven gel loading . )
the factor in THP-1 cells , we performed mobility shift and supershift assays with nuclear extracts from the promonocytic cell line U-987 ( Fig .
8 ) .
Like THP-1 cells , U-987 nuclear extracts contained a protein that formed complexes with AP-2 consensus binding sequences , but showed a higher mobility than AP-2 « in gel mobility shift assays , and did not exhibit a mobility supershift with the anti-AP-2 « antibody .
The protein-DNA complexes from the THP-1 and U-937 nuclear extracts failed to show any mobility supershift with addition of as much as 5 ug of anti-AP-2 antibody ( not shown ) .
Because AP-2-like factors have not been well studied in monocytic cell lines , we examined the possibility that THP-1 cells express novel proteins with homology to AP-2 DNA-binding domains .
A THP-1 macrophage library was created and screened at low stringency using a cDNA probe corresponding to the DNA-binding domain of AP-2 « .
Three plaques were isolated from approximately 1 X 10° screened plaques that exhibited a positive signal through three rounds of screening .
All three recombinant phage plaques contained the same in-sert , which encoded portions of the DNA binding domain and 3'-untranslated region of AP-2 « ( nucleotides 1184-2103 relative to the start of transcription ) .
Thus , THP-1 cells express AP-2 « , even though the predominant DNA-binding protein in the mobility shift assays appeared to be a distinct factor .
To address the possibility that the monocytic factor was indeed AP-2 @ , but was exhibiting altered mobility and immu-noreactivity due to effects of the nuclear extract , we performed experiments in which recombinant AP-2 « was added to THP-1 nuclear extracts , and the mixture was used to perform mobility LANE 1__2 3 4 5 6 THP-1 extract : = oop oop o- -of Recomb .

Mobility shift analysis of purified AP-2 mixed with THP-1 nuclear extracts .
Mobility shift and antibody supershift analyses were performed on THP-1 monocyte nuclear extract ( Zanes 2 and 3 ) , recombinant AP-2 « ( Zanes 4 and 5 ) , and a mixture of THP-1 extract and AP-2 « ( lanes 6 and 7 ) using a labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to AP-2 binding site 5 of the B2 promoter .
The presence of THP-1 nuclear extract in the assay mixture did not affect the ability of the anti-AP-2 antibody to shift the mobility of the AP-2 @ protein-DNA complex ( Zanes 6 and 7 ) .
shift and supershift assays ( Fig .
9 ) .
When incubated with THP-1 nuclear extracts , AP-2 « retained its original mobility and ability to react with the anti-AP-2 « antibody , whereas the monocytic factor was unaffected ( Fig .
9 ) .
These data , along with those shown in Figs .
6-8 , indicate that the predominant factor in THP-1 nuclei that binds to AP-2 binding sites in the B2 promoter is distinct from AP-2 .
DISCUSSION Leukemic cell lines of the myeloid lineage , such as THP-1 , have served as excellent tools in studies of the terminal differentiation processes of hematopoietic cells ( 38 ) .
In this report , we have demonstrated that AP-2 binding sites are essential for amplification of V-ATPase B2 subunit transcription during macrophage differentiation .
We have identified a nuclear factor in THP-1 cells that bind to these sites and whose binding activity increases following differentiation of THP-1 cells into macrophages .
Our results therefore suggest that a factor related to the AP-2 family of factors is involved in gene regulation during macrophage differentiation .
The predominant protein from THP-1 cell nuclear extracts forming protein-DNA complexes with AP-2 binding sites , however , is a novel factor distinct from AP-2 .
Recent studies have implicated transcription factors from multiple gene families as critical for terminal differentiation of macrophages .
These factors include members of the STAT ( 89 ) and C/EBP ( 40 ) families ; Pu.1 , a member of the ets family ( 41 ) ; and Egr-1 , a zinc finger transcription factor ( 42 ) , among others .
Although the role of transcription factor AP-2 in terminal differentiation has been elucidated in other cell types , including neuroectodermal and epidermal cells ( 43 , 44 ) , the role of AP-2 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 180 AP-2 Binding Sites Regulate V-ATPase B2 Subunit Expression in monocytic differentiation and gene expression has been addressed in only a few studies that have used the U-937 cell model .
AP-2 binding sites were found to be required for tumor necrosis factor a expression induced by granulocyte-macro-phage colony-stimulating factor but not by phorbol ester ( 45 ) .
AP-2 binding sequences were also found not to have any enhancer activity for transcription of downstream reporters during phorbol ester-induced differentiation of U-9837 cells ( 46 ) .
Although these findings appear to conflict with our results , we have shown that THP-1 cells closely mimic primary blood monocytes in their ability to express V-ATPase during differentiation , whereas U-937 cells do not ( 18 ) . ``
The mechanisms that cause increased transcription of the B2 subunit in primary blood monocytes and phorbol ester-induced THP-1 cells therefore may not be functional in phorbol ester-treated U-937 cells .
In support of this possibility , we found that the AP-2 site-binding activity was lower in nuclear extracts from phorbol ester-treated U-937 cells than from control U-937 promonocytes ( data not shown ) .
The promoter of the V-ATPase B2 subunit contains eight functional AP-2 binding sites , and at least one of these sites is necessary for increased expression from the B2 promoter during macrophage differentiation .
We have not determined if site 1 is the only active site in the B2 promoter nor if other downstream sequences are active in vivo .
Promoters containing site 1 alone ( -317 to -124 ) showed transcriptional activity somewhat less than those containing additional AP-2 binding sites and an Spl site ( -317 to -96 ; Figs .
3 and 4 ) , but these differences did not reach statistical significance .
Four of the AP-2 binding sites ( sites 2-5 ) are in such close proximity to Spl-binding sites that interference , due to binding of Spl , is likely to occur .
We have tested this by performing gel mobility shift assays with an oligonucleotide probe that contains AP-2 binding sites 4 and 5 and the overlapping Spl-binding site .
When incubated with THP-1 monocyte or macrophage nuclear extracts , the only detectable protein-DNA complexes formed were with Spl ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that Spl in the nuclear extracts interferes with the binding of the THP-1 factor to AP-2 sites 4 and 5 .
Competition by transcription factors for adjacent and overlapping binding sites has been noted previously for several promoters and is a mechanism by which the action of factors can be regulated ( 47-49 ) .
DNase I footprinting of promoter using the nuclear extracts will be required , however , for a direct assessment of protein-DNA interactions in the B2 subunit promoter .
The identity of the factor from THP-1 and U-937 cell nuclei identified here is unknown .
A probe containing the conserved DNA binding domain of AP-2 « that was used to screen a THP-1 cell cDNA library at low stringency hybridized only to a single gene product , AP-2 « itself .
Since AP-2 « is expressed in these cells , it is unclear why it was not detected in the mobility shift assays .
The most likely explanation is that the THP-1 factor binds AP-2 consensus sequences in the B2 promoter with a higher affinity than AP-2 « , as shown in Fig .
6 .
When mobility shift assays were performed on THP-1 nuclear extracts using an oligonucleotide probe that binds strongly to purified AP-2 « ( the hMtlla BLE site ) , several protein-DNA complexes were formed , one of which was nearly identical in size to the complex formed with recombinant AP-2 « .
In experiments using the site 1 or site 5 probes , a barely detectable protein-DNA complex was occasionally present with the same mobility as the AP-2ochMtlla BLE complex , but it was not observed reproducibly enough to allow determination of its identity .
Although these studies have not excluded the possibility that * B. S. Lee and S. L. Gluck , unpublished results .
AP-2a has a role in B2 transcription in vivo , our experiments suggest that the THP-1 factor identified here is the predominant activator of the B2 promoter in cells of the monocytic lineage .
Preliminary studies indicate that a factor similar to the one described here is present in differentiated bone marrow and spleen cell cultures enriched for osteoclasts ( data not shown ) .
Efforts to purify this factor and determine its identity are in progress .
The B2 isoform of the vacuolar H*-ATPase appears to be a `` housekeeping `` gene product , residing in the V-ATPases that acidify the intracellular membranes of vertebrate cells ( 8 , 16 , 50 ) .
Many housekeeping genes contain G + C-rich TATA-less promoters , similar to the B2 subunit promoter .
In contrast to most housekeeping genes , however , the V-ATPase B2 subunit is highly expressed in a small population of cells that are specialized for proton secretion , such as macrophages , osteoclasts , and the renal proximal tubule , in cells that maintain high rates of endocytosis and exocytosis , including macrophages and proximal tubule cells , and in cells that require V-ATPase activity for solute transport , such as neurons .
AP-2-like proteins may provide a mechanism by which amplified expression of the V-ATPase may occur in specific cell types .
It is perhaps not coincidental that the kidney and brain , which express high levels of B2 mRNA , also express very high levels of AP-2 proteins during development and in adulthood .
Our studies may have identified a unique transcription factor , binding to AP-2 sites , that confers the capacity for cells to maintain high levels of B2 expression .
