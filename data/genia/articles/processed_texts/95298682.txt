Summary - Immunosuppression has been often associated with the course of malignant diseases .
In the present study , the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) in response to mitogenic stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin ( PHA ) was assessed prospectively in 90 patients with stage I-III breast cancer .
Whereas PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs derived from patients with breast cancer preoperatively was significantly decreased when compared with data obtained in healthy control individuals ( P < 0.001 ) .
the degree of the defect in PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs depended upon the tumour burden as manifested by tumour size and axillary lymph node involvement ( 2 < 0.003 in each case ) .
PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs dropped significantly in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide .
methotrexate and fluorouracil ( CMF ) after an observation period of 6 months ( P < 0.01 ) .
but not in patients under adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen only .
After an additional 6 months ( i.e .
12 months after surgery ) .
PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs was similar in patients after adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF and in those receiving continued adjuvant tamoxifen treatment ( P > 0.1 ) .
but in all patients still significantly decreased as compared with healthy controls ( P < 0.001 ) .
When data obtained preoperatively and after 12 months were compared .
it was found that out of 23 patients whose PBMCs had experienced a drop in their PHA-induced proliferation .
14 ( 61 % ) had developed metastatic disease within the subsequent 24 months ( ie .
36 months after surgery ) .
In contrast .
out of 59 patients whose PBMCs showed an increase in their PHA-induced proliferation within the first 12 months after surgery .
only one ( 2 % ) presented with disease progression .
We thus conclude that PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs derived from patients with breast cancer depends upon the tumour load and is a good clinical predictor for the further course of the disease .
Keywords : breast cancer .
lymphocyte proliferation : prognosis Several studies have demonstrated that patients with cancer as well as experimental animals with transplanted tumours show a decrease in delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) reactions and experience cutaneous anergy ( Stein et al.. 1976 ; Broder and Waldmann .
1978 ; Giuliano et al.. 1979 ) .
This fact was attributed to an induction of suppressor cells ( Kirchner .
1978 : Yu er al.. 1977 ; North and Bursuker .
1984 ) .
the emergence of soluble suppressive factors ( Whittaker et a/.. 1971 ; Nimberg et al.. 1975 ; North ert al.. 1984 ) or to a lack of lymphokines ( Fearon er al.. 1990 ) associated with the development of neoplasms .
Consequently .
impressive results were achieved by the induction of lytic effector T-cell function by interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) .
leading to the establishment of lymphokine-activated killer cell therapy in patients with various malignancies .
Established prognostic markers in breast cancer include mainly tumour-associated characteristics such as the number of involved axillary lymph nodes .
tumour size .
oestrogen receptor status and oncogene overexpression ( Clark and McGuire .
1988 ; Contesso et al.. 1989 ) .
but no immunological characteristics of tumour or host .
A series of studies have been performed to investigate the latter aspect ( Penn .
1982 .
1988 : Zielinski et a/.. 1989a ; Knogler er al.. 1992 ) .
The majority of these studies have dealt .
however .
with certain functions of the immune system assessed at single time points during the course of the disease and are thus of limited value .
as both .
chemo- and radiotherapy can exert considerable influence upon the parameters measured ( Whittaker er a/..

Moreover .
many of the studies on immune function in patients with breast cancer have utilised sophisticated methods which are not available within the routine clinical setting .
Based on these considera-tions .
we have decided to study prospectively and longitudinally proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin ( PHA ) , which is an easily applicable .
widely used and accepted assay giving reproducible and easily quantifiable data .
Results from these experiments were correlated with tumour status and the course of the disease .
We report that the initial proliferation of PBMCs in response to PHA depended upon the tumour load and that .
furthermore .
the longitudinal assessment of PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs constituted a good prognostic marker for the development of metastatic disease .
Materials and methods Patients and clinical variables Ninety female patients ( mean age 54 + 2.3 years ) were included in this study .
The patients were all diagnosed as having stage I ( eight patients ) .
II ( 53 patients ) or III ( 29 patients ) breast cancer between October 1988 and December 1991 .
Patients with metastatic ( ie .
stage IV ) disease were excluded from the study .
After surgery .
all patients with stage II and III disease were included consecutively in a clinical treatment protocol of adjuvant therapy randomising between treatment with either cyclophosphamide .
methotrexate and fluoruracil ( CMF : Bonadonna et al.. 1977 ) for 6 months .
endocrine treatment with tamoxifen ( 20 mg daily : Mik ] et al .
, 1990 ; EBCTCG , 1992 ) for 2 years or combined chemotherapeutic plus endocrine ( i.e .
tamoxifen ) treatment .
Only patients > 70 years were excluded from the treatment protocol with all others being treated according to the protocol .
Adjuvant treatment started within 3 weeks after surgery .
Although all patients with stage I-III disease received radiotherapy to the operated breast , patients with stage I disease did not receive any further adjuvant treatment with either CMF or tamoxifen .
Collection of blood samples Blood samples were collected by venous puncture into tubes containing preservative-free heparin before surgery and 3 and 12 months after surgery or follow-up .
The time point of 12 months after surgery equalled 6 months after termination of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients who had received CMF .
For the collection of sera , blood was drawn into tubes which did not contain any addition .
Controls PBMCs from 60 and sera from six healthy age-matched females ( mean age 55 + 3.2 years ) served as controls .
Pathological and biochemical analysis of tissue samples Pathological diagnosis was made on paraffin-embedded specimens of tissue obtained during surgery using routine methods .
Hormone receptor status was assessed by biochemical means , as described previously ( Zielinski et a/ .
, 19894 ) .
Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) PBMCs were gained by centrifugation of whole heparinised venous blood over a Ficoll-Hypaque ( Ficoll-Paque , Phar-macia , Uppsala , Sweden ) density gradient and subsequently resuspended in RPMI-1640 ( Gibco ) supplemented with 100 IU of penicillin and 100 ug ml- ' streptomycin and adjusted to 1 x 10° PBMCs ml- ' .
Mitogenic stimulation with PHA Cell cultures were performed as described previously ( White et al .
, 1982 ) .
Briefly , 1 x 10° PBMCs suspended in 100 ul of RPMI-1640 were pipetted into microtitre plates and PHA added to final concentrations of 10 ug ml~ ' , 50 ug ml~ ' and 100 ug ml~ ' respectively .
All assays were performed in triplicate for each patient and for each PHA concentration .
Healthy age-matched females served as controls to circumvent a possible influence of steroids through changes in the pool size of radioactivity .
The cultures were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % carbon dioxide for a total of 96 h. Sixteen hours before the end of the incubation period , 100 ul of supplemented medium containing 20 ul of [ 'HJthymidine ( 185 GBq mmol~ ' ; Amersham , UK ) was added .
The cells were harvested with an automatic harvester , and the resulting radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation in a beta counter .
In order to analyse the influence of sera of patients with breast cancer upon lymphocyte proliferation , PBMCs derived from healthy individuals were preincubated with sera diluted 1:10 or 1:100 ( v/v ) , respectively , at 37°C for 3 h and submitted subsequently to PHA assays as above .
Characterisation of suppressive factors in sera Sera were obtained from ( i ) six healthy controls and ( ii ) from nine patients with metastatic breast cancer following surgery .
Sera were diluted 1:2 in phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to ultrafiltration through Amicon CF 25 Centriflow cones ( Amicon , Danvers , MA , USA ) for 15 min at 800g ( mol .
wt cut-off point 25 kDa ) at room temperature .
PBMCs were isolated as described previously and resuspended to a concentration of 1 x 10° lymphocytes per ml of supplemented RPMI-1640 .
Approximately 10° PBMCs per well were cultured with 100 pul of either unseparated sera or their low or high molecular weight fractions in final dilutions of 1:10 or 1:100 for 1 h at 37°C .
Subsequently , PBMCs were stimulated with 20 ul of PHA ( HA 15 , Murex ) and incubated for 4 days at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % carbon dioxide .
Statistical methods If not specified otherwise , data are presented as mean + s.d .
Statistics were done by X `` and Student 's r-test for paired data .
Results Mitogenic stimulation with PHA in patients with breast cancer Table I1 shows the results of assays evaluating PHA stimulation of PBMCs derived from patients with stage I-III breast cancer at the time of their diagnosis .
In general , PBMCs derived from patients with breast cancer had a significantly lower proliferative rate in response to PHA than those from healthy control individuals ( P < 0.001 ) .
Moreover , this decrease in mitogenic stimulation depended on the stage of the disease , i.e .
a clear correlation between the stage of the disease and the level of proliferation of PBMCs in response to PHA was found ( P < 0.001 between all stages of the disease , Table I ) .
Correlation of mitogenic stimulation of PBMC with other clinical parameters in breast cancer Table II shows that a clear correlation of the PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs derived from patients with breast cancer was found with tumour size ( P < 0.0035 ) and the number of involved lymph nodes ( P < 0.003 ) , but not with Table I _ PHA-stimulation in patients with stage I-III breast cancer at the time of diagnosis and in healthy controls n c.p.m .

Influence of adjuvant therapy upon mitogenic stimulation of PBMCs As shown in Figure 1 , adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF reduced mitogenic stimulation in patients with stage I-III breast cancer significantly .
While PBMCs derived from all patients who received adjuvant CMF treatment showed a further decrease in their proliferation in response to PHA after 6 months of therapy as compared with pretreatment levels ( P < 0.001 ) , neither patients under endocrine treatment nor patients who did not receive any adjuvant drug treatment ( ie .
patients with stage I disease ) presented with similar data ( P > 0.1 ) .
When patients who received adjuvant CMF treatment were studied further for the proliferative rate of their PBMCs in response to PHA , the decrease seen after 6 months had vanished after an additional 6 months ( Figure 1 ) .
Thus , 12 months after surgery , ie .
6 months after termination of adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF , PBMCs from patients who had received either adjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant endocrine treatment or no adjuvant treatment at all presented with similar mean proliferative responses in response to PHA .
Prognostic value of PBMC proliferation 12 months post-operatively in patients with breast cancer In a further analysis , the course of proliferation of PBMCs in response to PHA before the initiation of treatment and after 12 months was analysed prospectively and put into context with disease status after a total of 36 months .
Twelve months after surgery , 82 patients had remained without evidence of disease , as assessed by clinical means .
Of these patients , 15 showed progressive disease after 36 months , whereas 67 patients had remained disease free .
Owing to a great variability between the patients , the absolute mitogenic stimulation of PBMCs assessed neither preoperatively nor after 12 months showed significant prognostic relevance .
Nevertheless , when the change in lymphocyte proliferation after this mitogenic stimulation was compared with the clinical outcome after 3 years , a significant correlation was seen .
Patients who were to remain in complete remission for 36 months showed an increase in the proliferative responses of their PBMCs in response to PHA after 12 months of 15.9 + 24.7 % , whereas patients with future progressive disease showed a further decline from their initial level of proliferation by 26.5 £ 14.1 % ( P < 0.001 ) .
This pattern was found in patients with various initial stages of breast cancer ( Table III ) and was independent of the kind of adjuvant treatment ( i.e .
chemotherapy , endocrine therapy or both ) .

Influence of patients ' sera upon PBMC proliferation In order to evaluate the possibility of a soluble factor secreted by the tumour or other soluble factors present in the sera of patients with metastatic breast cancer , PBMC proliferation assays were performed in the presence of sera derived from patients with untreated metastatic breast cancer .
Although there was a tendency in data from which one could suspect a suppressive influence of the diluting agent itself , there was no significant difference between PHA stimulation of PBMCs with or without control sera in different dilutions .
In contrast , sera derived from patients with untreated metastatic breast cancer in contrast significantly inhibited the proliferation of control PBMCs in a dilution-dependent manner ( serum dilution 1:10 , P < 0.001 ; 1:100 , P > 0.1 ) .
Table IV shows the results of two representative experiments out of the performed six assays .
Table V shows the successful enrichment by ultracentrifugation of the factor ( s ) responsible for the suppression of PBMC proliferation in the protein fraction below 25 kDa .
This serum preparation resulted in the most effective suppression of PHA stimulation which could not be reversed by dilution ( Table v ) .

of 59 patients who presented with an increase in the proliferative ability of their PBMCs to PHA when preoperative data and values obtained after 12 months were compared .
58 ( 98 % ) remained in complete remission for a total of 3 years .
In contrast .
of 23 patients with a decrease in the proliferation of their PBMCs in response to PHA within 12 months .
only nine ( 39 % : P < 0.0001 ) remained in complete remission for 3 years , whereas the remaining 14 patients ( 61 % ) developed metastatic disease .
As shown in Table III the correlation remains significant when adjusted to disease stage ( stage II .
P=0.0027 : stage III .
P < 0.001 ) .
These data result in an overall sensitivity of 93.3 % and an overall specificity of 86.7 % .
Adjusting for stage did not alter estimates .
Thus .
PHA stimulation studied longitudinally constituted an important new parameter .
Discussion The present study was performed in order to analyse prospectively and longitudinally the course of PHA-induced stimulation of PBMCs derived from patients with breast cancer during and after adjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine treatment .
Moreover .
we studied whether the results from assays investigating PHA-induced stimulation of PBMC had a prognostic and predictive value for the further course of breast cancer .
In following these aims , blood samples were obtained from each patient before surgery and 6 as well as 12 months thereafter .
Independent of the current investigational protocol .
patients had been randomised after surgery to receive either adjuvant chemotherapy according to the CMF protocol or tamoxifen or both ( EBCTCG , 1992 ) .
It was found tht PHA-induced stimulation of PBMCs derived from patients with breast cancer before surgery was significantly lower than in PBMCs from healthy control individuals and correlated with the stage of the disease .
including tumour size and lymph node status .
i.e .
the tumour burden .
Although a transient drop in PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs derived from patients undergoing CMF treatment was noted .
12 months after surgery the mean results of PBMC proliferation assays were similar in all patient groups ( i.e .
those 6 months after termination of CMF treatment or during tamoxifen therapy or both ) .
However .
also at this point of time .
data obtained in patients with breast cancer were significantly lower than those from healthy controls .
as reported previously by other authors ( Whittaker et al .
, 1971 ; Stein et al.. 1976 ) .
Our data demonstrated .
finally that , irrespective of the kind of adjuvant treatment .
two-thirds of patients whose PBMCs showed a drop in their PHA-induced proliferation within 1 year experienced rapid recurrence of disease .
This fact was further corroborated by the observation that breast cancer did not recur within the observation period in patients whose PBMCs showed an increase in PHA-induced proliferation .
The results presented in the current report pose a series of questions .
Thus , the persistent decrease in PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs derived from patients with breast cancer has to be explained .
Considering our data there could be several reasons for this finding .
The initial decrease in lymphocyte proliferation could be due to the presence of the tumour and its influence upon the immune system .
Such assumptions can be made on the basis of data obtained in humans with cancer as well as in experimental animals which demonstrated decreased DTH and a defect in lymphocyte proliferation in the presence of neoplastic tissue ( Stein et a/.. 1976 ; Broder et al.. 1978 ; Giuliano er al.. 1979 ) .
Several reasons have been discussed for these findings .
including defective lymphokine production and an increase in the production of suppressor factors by the tumour ( Whittaker er a/.. PHA-stimulation in breast cancer Ch Wiltschke et al 1971 ; Nimberg et al.. 1975 ; North er al .
, 1984 ; Mizoguchi et al.. 1992 ) .
Previous studies by other investigators ( Whittaker et al.. 1971 ; Nimberg et al.. 1975 ; Giuliano et al.. 1979 ; North et al .
, 1984 ; Mizoguchi et al.. 1992 ) as well as our data would favour the second possibility .
as the exogenous addition of recombinant interleukin 2 to cultures of lymphocytes derived from patients who had presented with defective proliferation previously in our experiments did not have any enhancing influence upon lymphocyte function ( data not shown ) .
In contrast .
the addition of sera derived from patients with metastatic breast cancer to lymphocytes derived from healthy control individuals produced a significant decrease in PHA-induced proliferation , thus suggesting the presence of one or more suppressive factors of a molecular weight below 25 kDa .
Although this explanation could be also considered for the finding of a decrease in lymphocyte proliferation in patients who were to develop metastatic disease within the subsequent 2 years , additional variables , including the induction of suppressor cells by the emerging tumour ( Yu et a/.. 1977 ; North et al .
, 1984 ) or an alteration in signal transduction molecules ( Mizoguchi et al .
, 1992 ) , must be considered .
The problem could be further aggravated by the fact that adjuvant cytostatic treatment with CMF has previously been demonstrated in studies in this laboratory to lead to a prolonged defect in the production of a primary immune response following vaccination ( Zielinski er al .
, 1986 ) and lymphocyte proliferation ( Knogler et al .
, 1992 ) as well as lymphokine production ( Zielinski er al.. 1986 , 1989b ) .
The latter aspects also constitute the most likely explanations for the decrease in PHA-induced lymphocyte proliferation under immediate CMF therapy seen in the present study .
Clinically , the decrease in lymphocyte proliferation in two-thirds of patients who were to develop metastases within the relatively near future clearly constitutes a new prognostic tool for the prediction of the development of early metastatic disease .
Nevertheless , owing to the relatively small number of patients and short follow-up times .
the ultimate prognostic value of this phenomenon has to be proven in a larger study .
which is ongoing in our institute .
Although previous studies on a similar question have failed to find such a prognostic value for PHA stimulation ( Stein er al .
, 1976 ; Nordman et al.. 1985 ) in solid tumours .
it is an accepted predictive parameter in Hodgkin 's disease ( Bjorkholm er al.. 1982 ; Wedelin er al.. 1982 ) .
However .
the lack of such a finding in patients with solid tumours may be due to the heterogeneity of studied patients so far .
Nevertheless , the fact is surprising , as immunological variables have not been used until now as either prognostic tools or for the design of adjuvant trials .
However , several studies have demonstrated a clear association of lytic effector lymphocyte function and such established prognostic variables as tumour load ( Contesso et a/.. 1989 ) .
oestrogen receptor status ( Clark er al.. 1988 ) and amplification of the HER-2neu oncogene ( Zeillinger et al.. 1989 ) .
Although further studies and the use of more sophisticated stimulants of lymphocyte proliferation than the widely available PHA assay including the use of anti-CD3 antibodies will have to corroborate and extend our results .
the results presented in the current report could lead to such clinical consequences as lymphokine treatment or the repeated use of a series of adjuvant cytostatic therapies in expanded time intervals or in selected patients who fulfil the appropriate immunological criteria .
