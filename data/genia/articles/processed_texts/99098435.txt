Research Paper Tar physiological role of the pro-myelocytic leukaemia ( PML ) gene product is poorly defined .
Among other functions , PML is involved in haematopoietic differentiation and in control of cell growth and tumorigenesis .
We investigated the regulation of human PML expression by interferons ( IFNs ) and IL-1 in various human haematopoietic lines ( U937 , THP1 , HIL60 , NB4 ) , in human diploid fibroblasts and in human peripheral blood leukocytes .
Cytokine-induced modulation of PML expression was assessed by Northern blot analyses , flow cytometry studies and in situ immunolabelling .
Our data show that IFNs and IL-1 upregulate PML transcript and protein expression in a time and dose-dependent manner .
In situ immunolabelling revealed that upregulation of protein expression by IFN- @ is a consequence of a marked increase in both the number and the intensity of the staining of so-called PML nuclear bodies .
Our data suggest that stimulation of PML expression by interferons and IL-1 may account for upregulation of PML proteins observed in inflammatory tissues and in proliferative states .

PML proteins belong to a heterogeneous family of DNA-binding proteins characterized by the C ; HC , zinc binding ring finger .
PML protein expression features a typical speckled nuclear pattern which is the consequence of the localization of the protein in nuclear compartments named nuclear bodies . ``
The function of the PML nuclear bodies is still unknown .
Recently it has been shown that PML participates in regulation of haematopoietic differentiation and in control of cell grow th and turnorigmlesis.6 In addition , there is evidence that PML protein is aberrantly expressed in a variety of pathological conditions including malig-nancies . ``
The level of PML expression is upregulated in inflammatory tissues and in benign or malignant prolife rative states . ``
'' Cytokines , especially interferons ( IFNs ) , are likely to represent some of the mediators that may be involved in overexpression of PML under these Interferons are polypeptides that mediate pleiotropic effects on sensitive cells ( reviewed in Sen and hngyello ) .
Major activities of IFNs include immunomodulating activ- 0962-9351/98/050319-07 $ 9.00 © 1998 Carfax Publishing Ltd circumstances .
ities , antiviral effects and inhibition of cellular growth .
Two families of IFNs can be distinguished : type I IFNs ( IFN @ /B and IFN ) and type II IFN ( y ) .
Type I IFNs are encoded by a family of over 20 genes , whereas type II IFN is structurally unrelated and encoded by a single gene.10An important function of IFNs is regulation of cellular growth of normal and malignant cells .
The molecular mechanisms involved in grow th inhibition are pootly understood .
Here , we investigated modulation of PML expression by interferons , TNF and IL-1 .
We present evidence that PML gene expression is enhanced by type I and type II interferons and by IL-1 .
We analysed cytokine induced up-regulation of PML transcript and protein expression in human haematopoietic cell lines , in human diploid fibroblasts and in human peripheral blood leukocytes .
Modulation of PML protein expression by IFN and IL-1 was assessed with immunofluorescence flow cytometry .
Immunofluorescence fr site analysis of PML nuclear bodies revealed that IFN treatment resulted in up-regulation of both the intensity and the number of these nuclear structures .

`` ° When human foreskin fibroblasts were grown in the absence or or in the presence of saturating concentrations of IL-1 , a nearly twofold increase of PML protein expression was detected by flow cytometry analysis ( Table 1 ) .
A similar result was obtained upon incubation with IFN ( 100 IU/ml ) .
The combination of IL-1 and IFN stimulated PML protein expression to about three times the level observed in untreated controls ( Table 1 ) .
Analysis of PML nuclear bodies Since it has been show n that PML proteins are located within subnuclear structures from active sites of transcription and splicing , the so-called PML nuclear bodies were monitored during IFN treatment using indirect immunofluorescence staining .
PMLspecific immunofluotrescence varied in intensity between the cell lines tested .
In all cell lines tested ( NB4 , HL6O0 , U937 ) and in peripheral blood leukocytes the con-stitutive levels of endogenous proteins were detectable ( Figs 8 and 9 ) .
Peripheral blood leukocytes revealed specific immunolabelling of PML nuclear bodies in neutrophils and monocytes ( Fig .
8 ) .
When HL6O0 and U937 cells were incubated for 15h with and without IFNG ( 1000 U/ml ! )
a marked enhancement of the immunolabelling was observed in treated cells .
Both the intensity of the staining and the number of the labelled PML nuclear bodies was increased significantly ( Fig .
9 and data not shown ) .
Discussion Our data confirm and extend previous studies demonstrating that cytokines are involved in modulation of PML gene expression.15 ’ 16 We show that PML transcripts rapidly accumulate upon treatment with interferons in a variety of haematopoietic cell lines and in primary diploid cells .
However , our experiments demonstrate a marked difference in the time course of PML-mRNA induction between IFN®G and IFN .
Induction of PML in response to IFN was shown to be independent from de novo protein synthesis and actinomycin sensitive indicating that PML mRNA levels are transcriptionally regulated by IENs . ``
'' Recently , evidence has been provided that the PML gene is transcriptionally upregulated by IFNs through activation and binding of STATs to an ISRE and a GAS element in the untranslated first exon . ``
IENs activate STATS through tyrosine phosphorylation by members of the JAK tyrosine kinase family.19 Our results demonstrating inhibition of IFN-induced upregulation of PML transcripts by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein are consistent with these findings .
Flow cytometry analyses using a specific monoclonal anti-PML antibody recognizing the aminoterminal domain clearly demonstrate that IFNs induce PML ( A ) ( B ) FIG .

Recently , it has been shown that PML protein expression has a speckled nuclear pattern.15This is due to localization of the protein in pootly defined nuclear organelles named nuclear bodies .
The functions of the nuclear bodies are unknown except for the coiled bodies which act as storage compartments for splicing factors . ``
'' To analyse expression of PML proteins within nuclear bodies we performed indirect in site immunofluorescence studies .
/n site immunolabelling of PML protein expression revealed an IFNinduced increase in number and intensity of so-called PML nuclear bodies .
To the best of our knowledge induction of PML by IL-1 has not been described so far .
Here we show that IL-1G rapidly induces PML mRNA expression in fibroblasts .
Since IL-1 is a potent inducer of IFN and IFN—B21 it could be argued that the observed induction of PML mRNA ex pression is a consequence of IL-1 induced autocrine production of interferon- .
We addressed this issue by employing the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein .
Genistein was show n to strongly inhibit IFN signalling.17 Our experiments clearly show that in fibroblasts genistein is not able to suppress the IL-1 induced upregulation of PML 324 Mediators of Inflammation - Vol 7 - 1998 transcripts , whereas IFNinduced enhancement of PMLspecific transcripts was strongly inhibited .
Thus , indirect regulation of PML by IL-1 induced autocrine production of appears unlikely .
Flow cytometry analysis revealed that IL-1 and IFN- act synergistically in induction of PML proteins .
This regulation could be involved in the observed upregulation of PML proteins in inflammation .
In contrast to normal tissues , in inflammatory tissues the level of PML proteins is upregulatecl.7 ’ 8 Local production of IL-1 has been demonstrated in inflammatory and autoimmune disease and this may contribute to tissue damage and repainﬂ ’ 22 In fibroblasts , IL-1 mediates tissue repair after inflammation and injury by regulating key proteins necessary for formation of the extracellular matrix . ``
The data presented here suggest that IL-1 induced PML expression may represent the molecular basis for the observed upregulation of PML proteins during inflammation .
IFNs , as part of the cytokine netw ork are indirectly induced by regulators such as tumour necrosis factor during immune responses and inflammation .
This may contribute to upregulation of PML in inflammatory tissues by synergistic action of IEN and IL-1 in enhancing PML protein expression in fibroblasts .
