6 Activation of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Enhancer Is Not Dependent on NFAT-1 DAVID M. MARKOVITZ , ' MARK C. HANNIBAL , *2 > MICHAEL J. SMITH , !
RONALD COSSMAN , * anp GARY J. NABEL2** Howard Hughes Medical Institute® and Departments of Internal Medicine® and Biological Chemistry , `` University of Michigan Medical Center , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109-0650 Received 28 May 1991/Accepted 25 February 1992 The function of a putative NFAT-1 site in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer has been analyzed .
Activation by the T-cell antigen receptor is minimal in Jurkat cells and is mediated by the iB sites .
The putative NFAT-1 region is not required for the response to anti-CD3 or to mitogens in T-cell , B-cell , or monocyte/macrophage leukemia lines , nor is it a cis-acting negative regulatory element .
Transcription of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) in T lymphocytes is regulated by specific cellular activation pathways stimulated by triggering of distinct cell surface receptors .
kB regulatory elements of the HIV-1 enhancer are required for transcriptional activation after mitogen or cytokine stimulation ( 21 , 22 ) .
At least two cis-acting regulatory elements respond to stimulation of the T-cell antigen receptor , the site which binds the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT-1 ) in the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene ( 3 , 27 ) , and the CD3-responsive site ( 20 ) of HIV-2 .
The NFAT-1 site in the IL-2 enhancer resembles a binding site for the ets proto-oncogene and is recognized by ets family members ( 29 , 33 ) .
The function of these cis-acting enhancer elements in their respective enhancers has been demonstrated ( 3 , 20 , 27 ) , but their role in HIV-1 gene regulation , if any , has not been precisely defined .
The putative NFAT-1 binding site in HIV-1 was originally identified when a factor in stimulated Jurkat T-cell extracts , and later partially purified NFAT-1 , was shown to bind the enhancer between positions -216 and -254 by DNase footprinting ( 1 , 27 ) ( Fig .
1A , NFp and NF ' p ) .
However , the region showing DNase protection is adjacent to but does not overlap the purine-rich region of sequence homology that is shared by HIV-1 and the NFAT-1 binding site of the IL-2 enhancer ( PuB , Fig .
1A ) ( 6 , 27 , 33 ) .
Despite this discrepancy and the lack of functional data on specific mutations of this site , NFAT-1 has been assumed to play a role in the response of the HIV-1 enhancer to T-cell stimulation ( 10 , 27 , 32 ) .
Our previous data ( 20 , 21 ) demonstrated that mutation of the « B sites ( Fig .
1A ) of the HIV-1 enhancer abolishes enhancer activation in stimulated T cells , but the data did not exclude the possibility that HIV-1 activation was also dependent on an intact NFAT-like element .
Therefore , to elucidate the function of the putative NFAT-1 site of HIV-1 and to examine the role of the T-cell receptor signal trans-duction pathway in HIV-1 stimulation , we have investigated the role of this element in regulation of the HIV-1 enhancer after T-cell activation .
Stimulation of T cells by phorbol esters or certain cyto-kines results in increased expression of HIV-1 ( 21 , 22 ) .
In contrast to the HIV-2 enhancer , treatment of Jurkat cells with antibodies to the T-cell receptor does not stimulate the HIV-1 enhancer ( 20 ) , but activation with antibodies to the * Corresponding author .
3961 T-cell receptor which have been cross-linked induces a small but measurable stimulation ( 13 , 31 ) .
To determine whether the region with NFAT-1 homology ( PuB ) or the region of nuclear factor protection ( NFp ) mediates changes in gene expression following T-cell activation , we performed a mutational analysis of the HIV-1 enhancer .
Site-specific mutations ( 21 ) were introduced into plasmids containing the HIV-1 enhancer linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltrans-ferase ( CAT ) gene ( HIV-1-CAT ; Fig .
1A ) ( 25 ) , and these plasmids ( 5 ug ) were transfected into 10 `` Jurkat T leukemia cells by using DEAE-dextran ( 24 ) .
At 20 h following trans-fection , cells were incubated with phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ; 16 nM ) and phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ; 2 pg/ml ! )
for an additional 20 h. This treatment increased CAT activity 11-fold ( Fig .
1B ) .
Mutation of either the PuB or protected sites did not significantly alter the response to PMA and PHA , although slightly lower basal activity was observed in the NF , mutant ( Fig .
1B ) .
Recently , a second site in the 3 ' portion of the NFAT-1 footprint has been shown to bind partially purified NFAT-1 ( 4 ) .
A mutation was introduced into this site ( NF ' p , Fig .
1A ) , and in separate experiments , the response of the mutant plasmid to PMA and PHA was compared with that of the wild type in Jurkat cells .
No significant effect of this mutation was seen on either basal or induced activity ( Fig .
1C ) .
In contrast , mutation of the two « B sites eliminated stimulation by PMA and PHA ( Fig .
1B ) , consistent with previous studies ( 21 ) .
When cells transfected with the HIV-1 enhancer were stimulated by cross-linking of antibodies to the T-cell receptor , minimal activation ( ca .
threefold ) was seen , and this limited effect was abolished when the KB sites were mutated ( Fig .
1D ) .
Mutation of the PuB or NF » element did not affect CAT activity ( Fig .
1D ) .
In contrast , similar stimulation of cells transfected with the HIV-2 enhancer resulted in ~30-fold induction , highlighting the differential responsiveness of these two viral enhancers .
Similar results were observed for HIV-1 and these mutants following activation of Jurkat cells by PMA or PHA alone or in the mouse T-cell line ELA ( data not shown ) ( 20 , 21 ) .
In the experiments with ELA cells , 25- to 100-fold induction of the IL-2 enhancer was seen , and site-specific mutation of the NFAT-1 site in the IL-2 enhancer reduced stimulation 10- to 25-fold ( 12 ) .
These results show that functionally active NFAT-1 was made in these cells but did not stimulate the HIV-1 enhancer .
Cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage are also an important reservoir for HIV infection in vivo ( 5 , 7 , 8 , 16 ) .

Site-specific mutations of the HIV-1 LTR and their effect on expression in stimulated Jurkat cells .
( A ) Schematic representation of the relevant enhancer region of HIV-1 .
Altered bases within the mutant plasmids used in this study are shown below the wild-type sequence .
The region of homology to the IL-2 enhancer ( 6 ) , PuB , and the sites of DNase protection ( NFp and NF ' p [ 27 ] ) are indicated .
( B ) The roles of PuB , NFp , and « B sites in the HIV-1 enhancer were determined by transfection of the indicated wild-type and mutant plasmids into Jurkat T cells .
Cell extracts were prepared , and CAT activity was determined by standard methods ( 9 ) .
Transfection efficiencies were normalized to protein concentration .

Effect of site-specific HIV-1 enhancer mutations on expression in ( A ) the THP-1 macrophage leukemia line and ( B ) the clone 13 Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell line .
The mature monocyte line THP-1 was transfected with the indicated plasmid as described by Griffin et al .

Clone 13 , an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell line ( 14 ) , was transfected with HIV-1-CAT or mutant plasmids as described above .

mutant plasmid ( Fig .
3 ) .
Similarly , no increase in CAT activity was detected in unstimulated or mitogen-activated Jurkat cells ( Fig .
1B , C , and D ) , suggesting that neither site functioned as a negative regulatory element .
Because functional activation of the HIV-1 enhancer in Jurkat cells by PMA , PHA , or immobilized antibodies to the T-cell receptor was mediated by the two « B sites in each case , we examined whether these stimulants induced NF-kB binding activity in electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
Both PMA and PHA induced binding activity which was demonstrated in competition experiments to be specific for NF- « B ( not shown ) .
As reported previously ( 26 ) , cyclosporin A reduced induction of the kB complex by PHA but not PMA ( Fig .
4A ) .
This effect was specific , because cyclosporin A had no effect on binding to an unrelated octamer probe ( Fig .
4B ) .
Although a nonspecific band was noted with cross-linking , no increase in NF-kB binding was detected when cells were treated with cross-linked anti-CD3 for 2 h ( Fig .
4A ) or for 0.5 , 1 , 4 , 24 , 48 , or 72 h ( not shown ) .

HTLV-I fax stimulation of the HIV-1 enhancer and potential NFAT-1 site-specific mutants .
Jurkat cells were transfected with 5 ug of HIV-1 or the indicated mutant enhancer plasmids and 1 pug of a plasmid expressing fax , ( + ) or an inactive fax ; frameshift mutant ( - ) ( 17 ) .
CAT assay results are representative of three independent transfections .
inability to detect an increase in NF- « B binding with this method is consistent with the very weak induction of the HIV-1 enhancer seen with treatment by anti-CD3 .
We have examined a region of the HIV-1 enhancer postulated to mediate induction in activated T cells through binding of an NFAT-like factor ( 18 , 19 , 27 ) .
This consideration was based primarily on sequence homology and binding of partially purified protein to DNA .
The regions of IL-2 homology and sites protected by partially purified NFAT-1 differ .
Because these sites , NFp and NF ' p , lack homology to the NFAT-1 region of the IL-2 enhancer , this binding may be due to contaminants other than NFAT-1 , further suggesting that NFAT -1 is not involved in HIV-1 enhancer function .
Lu et al .
( 18 , 19 ) have previously introduced a broad deletion ( between -253 and -213 ) into an HIV-1 long terminal repeat { ( LTR ) /CAT construct as well as an infectious proviral clone and tested these mutant plasmids in Jurkat T cells .

Effect of PMA , PHA , and anti-CD3 , with and without cyclosporin A , on NF- « B binding .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes containing either the « B site ( A ) or two copies of the IL-2 octamer ( B ) as described before ( 17 ) .
Nuclear extracts ( 2 ) were prepared from unstimulated ( - ) Jurkat cells or Jurkat cells incubated for 2 h with the indicated combination of anti-CD3 ( OKT3 ; see Fig .
1 legend ) , PMA ( 16 nM ) , or PHA ( 1 pg/ml ) with cyclosporin A ( 1 ug/ml ) as described previously ( 20 , 21 ) .
Arrows denote specific complexes .
3964 NOTES PMA and a ca .
fivefold increase in viral replication .
Although these authors suggested that these effects could be mediated by NFAT-1 , this deletion eliminated other potential binding sites and disrupted the spatial organization of the LTR .
In addition , because T-cell activation generally increases NFAT-1 binding activity and also stimulates HIV-1 replication , the data from these mutant viruses would ascribe a previously undetected activity to NFAT-1 .
Using site-specific mutagenesis , we now show that neither the region of IL-2 homology in the HIV-1 LTR nor the region which binds NFAT-1 mediates stimulation through the T-cell antigen receptor and that mutation of these sites does not significantly affect basal or induced levels of HIV-1 expression in several cell types .
These observations are consistent with our previous data ( 20 , 21 ) and with data from linker-scanning mutants ( 34 ) , chimeric promoter-enhancer constructs ( 30 ) , and deletion mutants ( 28 ) .
Taken together , it appears unlikely that NFAT-1 plays a direct role in induction of the HIV-1 enhancer or that the purine-rich region of IL-2 homology regulates HIV-1 expression in monocytes or lymphocytes .
Although it remains possible that stimulation of the T-cell antigen receptor may indirectly activate T-cell gene products , for example , tumor necrosis factor alpha , which activate the HIV-1 enhancer through NF-kB , these data suggest that CD3-mediated activation plays no direct role in activating HIV-1 gene expression through a site recognized by the NFAT-1 transcription factor .
