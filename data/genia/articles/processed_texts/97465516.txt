Interleukin-7 Upregulates the Interleukin-2-Gene Expression in Activated Human T Lymphocytes at the Transcriptional Level by Enhancing the DNA Binding Activities of Both Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells and Activator Protein-1 By Sonja I. Gringhuis , Lou F.M.H .
de Leij , Emmy W. Verschuren , Peter Borger , and Edo Vellenga In the present report , we studied the role of the stromal-derived cytokine interleukin-7 ( IL-7 ) in the IL-2-gene regulation in activated T lymphocytes .
Production of IL-2 requires the formation of transcription factors involved in the IL-2-gene regulation .
T-cell receptor ( TCR ) /CD3 engagement results in the activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) , and nuclear factor « B ( NFB ) , whereas the CD28 responsive complex ( CD28RC ) is activated in response to the CD28 signal .
Costimulation of phytohemagglutinin/anti-CD28 activated T lymphocytes with IL-7 induces a fivefold enhanced IL-2-mRNA accumulation and a 2.5-fold enhanced protein secretion .
The IL-2 HE EXPRESSION OF the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level .
The transcription of the IL-2 gene is controlled by a 300-base pair ( bp ) region in front of the transcription initiation site . ``
Within this promoter several binding sites for transcription factors have been identified that act as positive regulatory elements .
Both ubiquitous and T-cell specific proteins have been implicated in the regulation of the IL-2-gene transcription ( reviewed in ref .
2 ) .
The promoter includes two binding sites ( proximal and distal ) for nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , a proximal- and distal-binding site for activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) , `` a single-binding site for NFB , `` a binding site for the CsA sensitive Oct-1/0AP `` `` complex , `` and the CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) , `` `` `` which is a target for CD28RC ( CD28 responsive complex ) and for other transcription factors such as nuclear factor of mitogen-activated T cells ( NFE-MAT ) and TxRE-binding factor ( TxREF ) that are not necessarily induced by the CD28 signal . ``
The T-cell specific transcription factor NFAT is a multi-protein complex consisting of NFAT 1 and AP-1 . ``
The phos-phoprotein NFAT1 is constitutively present in the cytoplasm of resting T cells .
On TCR stimulation , NFAT1 becomes dephosphorylated directly by the Ca**/calmodulin-depen-dent phosphatase calcineurin and translocates into the nu-cleus .
The dephosphorylation by calcineurin is highly sensitive to cyclosporin A . ``
'' In the nucleus , NFAT1 associates with AP-1 to form the functional transcription factor NFAT , which will then bind to the IL-2 promoter .
AP-1 , which is a heterodimer composed of fos and jun family members , can From the Divisions of Hematology , Clinical Immunology , and Allergology , Department of Internal Medicine , University of Groningen , Groningen , The Netherlands .

0006-4971/97/9007-0029 $ 3.00/0 2690 gene transcription rate is increased 3.4-fold , indicating that the effect of IL-7 is in part mediated at the transcriptional level .
The molecular mechanisms underlying the IL-7 effect involve the upregulation of the DNA binding activity of NFAT ( 60 % ) and AP-1 ( 120 % ) , without affecting the activities of NFB and CD28RC , which was confirmed by transfection assays .
We also show that the IL-7-induced enhancement of the AP-1-DNA binding activity is not cyclosporin A-sensi-tive .
Since AP-1 is part of the NFAT complex , we conclude that the IL-7-signaling pathway is involved in the activation of the fos and jun proteins of which AP-1 consists .

also bind to the IL-2 promoter on its own .
The AP-1 activity is regulated both at the level of fos and jun gene transcription and by posttranslational modifications of the fos and jun proteins . ``
Recently it has been shown that the stromal-derived cytokine IL-7 plays a prominent role in the T-cell development in the thymus . ``
In addition it has been demonstrated that IL-7 enhances the expression of cytokine genes in activated T and natural killer ( NK ) cells . ``
IL-7 stimulates cells through its interaction with a high-affinity receptor complex composed of the IL-7Ra and IL-2Ry chains . ``
The increased expression of Th1-cytokines induced by IL-7 seems in part to be regulated at the transcriptional level . ``
'' However , limited data are available whether IL-7 also modulates the IL-2-gene expression , at which level IL-7 exerts its effects , and what signal transduction routes are involved in IL-7 signaling .
Here , we provide the first evidence that IL-7 upregulates the IL-2 expression in activated T cells through a significant increase of the IL-2-gene transcription rate by inducing enhanced DNA binding activities of transcription factors involved in the regulation of the IL-2 gene .
Both AP-1 and NFAT , which also contains AP-1 , show increased DNA binding on costimulation of T lymphocytes with IL-7 .
This effect was specific since the DNA binding activities of NFB and CD28RC were not affected by IL-7 .
These data suggest that IL-7 acts on the signaling pathways activating the AP-1 proteins .

Both the empty pCAT3-enhancer plasmid and the pCAT3-control reporter plasmid ( Promega ) served as controls in the transfection assays .
Transfection .
- Resting primary T cells are refractory to conventional transfection methods .
Subsequently it was necessary to use a prestimulation method . ``
'' Purified human T lymphocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % FCS , 2 mmol/L L-glutamine , and antibiotics , supplemented with PHA at 1 pg/mL , and recombinant human IL-2 ( Cetus , Emoryville , CA ) at 100 U/mL .
After 2 days of culture , the nonadherent cells were harvested , washed once with PBS , and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % FCS , 2 mmol/L L-glutamine , and antibiotics , supplemented with only recombinant human IL-2 at 100 U/mL .
The T cells were incubated for 2 more days , washed with PBS , and used for transient transfection assays .
15 X 10° T lymphocytes were resuspended in 400 gL RPMI 1640 containing 10 % FCS , 2 mmol/L L-glutamine , antibiotics , and 100 U/mL IL-2 , and 20 ug ( 1 ug/uL . )
reporter plasmid DNA was added .
After a 10- minute incubation on ice , cells were electroporated using a BioRad Gene Pulser ( BioRad Laboratories , Richmond , CA ) at 400 V , 960 uF .
After an additional 10 minute incubation period on ice , cells were transferred to RPMI 1640 containing 10 % FCS , 2 mmol/L L-glutamine , antibiotics , and 100 U/ mL IL-2 .
One hour after electroporation , cells were divided into four groups and left unstimulated or stimulated with either IL-7 alone , PHA alone or PHA plus IL-7 .
After 24 hours , cells were harvested and resuspended in 150 gL 250 mmol/L Tris-HCl [ pH 7.8 ] .
Total cell extracts were prepared by 4 repeated freeze/thaw cycli .
Transfection of Jurkat cells was performed as described for the prestimulated T lymphocytes , except that no IL-2 was added to the medium and the electroporation was performed at 300 V , 960 uF .
CAT ELISA .
- CAT concentrations in total cell extracts were measured by the CAT ELISA kit ( Boehringer Mannheim ) as recom- GRINGHUIS ET AL mended by the manufacturer .
The protein concentration of the cell extracts was determined by the Bradford assay , `` and results from the CAT ELISA were normalized by calculating the CAT concentration per pg protein in the total cell extract .
Statistical analysis .
- Statistical analyses were performed on the secretion and transfection data using the Student 's t-test for paired observations .
Statistical significance of the data was set at P < .05 .
RESULTS IL-7 enhances the IL-2-protein secretion by activated T lymphocytes .
- To determine whether IL-7 has an effect on the IL-2 secretion by activated human T lymphocytes , purified T cells were stimulated with PHA or PHA plus anti-CD28 in the presence or absence of IL-7 .
Cell free supernatants were harvested after 12 and 24 hours .
As depicted in Figure 1A , unstimulated T lymphocytes secreted only very low levels of IL-2 protein , 10 + 0.18 pg/mL ( mean + SEM ; n = 4 ) .
T lymphocytes stimulated with PHA alone secreted 281 + 87 pg/mL IL-2 ( mean + SEM ; n = 4 ) after 24 hours of stimulation .
Costimulation with PHA plus IL-7 increased the IL-2 secretion slightly to 520 + 174 pg/mL ( mean + SEM ; n = 4 ; P = .07 ) .
Stimulation with PHA and anti-CD28 resulted in a significant increase of the IL-2 secretion : 8,023 + 1,312 pg/mL ( mean + SEM ; n = 4 ; P = .008 ) .
The combined treatment of PHA plus anti-CD28 plus IL-7 resulted in an almost 2.5-fold increase of the IL-2 secretion to 19,955 + 2,497 pg/mL ( mean + SEM ; n = 4 ; P = .004 ) .
The observations after 12 hours of stimulation resembled the observations after 24 hours but at a smaller scale ( data not shown ) .
In addition , the amount of secreted IFN-y was measured in the supernatants , since it is known that IL-7 upregulates the IFN-y expression in anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulated T lymphocytes . ``
Unstimulated T lymphocytes did not secrete any detectable IFN-y ( Fig 1B ) .
Stimulation with PHA resulted in an IFN-y secretion of 699 + 162 pg/mL ( mean + SEM ; n = 4 ) after 24 hours of stimulation .
IL-7 enhanced the secretion of IFN-y to a level of 1,441 + 210 pg/mL ( mean + SEM ; n = 4 ; P = .011 ) .
T lymphocytes costimu-lated with PHA and anti-CD28 secreted 2,270 + 513 pg/mL IFN-y ( mean + SEM ; n = 4 ; P = .033 ) .
Costimulation with PHA and anti-CD28 plus IL-7 resulted in an approximately twofold increase in the IFN-y secretion : 4,977 + 919 pg/ mL ( mean + SEM ; n = 4 ; P = .024 ) .
IL-7 increases the IL-2 mRNA accumulation in activated T lymphocytes .
- To examine whether the effects of IL-7 on the IL-2 mRNA accumulation in activated T lymphocytes corresponds with the data obtained at the protein level , total RNA was isolated from cells stimulated for 3 or 6 hours with PHA or PHA in combination with anti-CD28 in the presence or absence of IL-7 .
After 3 hours of activation hardly any IL-2 mRNA could be detected ( data not shown ) .
As shown in Fig 2A , after 6 hours of activation a faint expression of IL-2 transcript was observed in T lymphocytes stimulated with either PHA alone or PHA in the presence of IL-7 .
Costimulation with PHA plus anti-CD28 resulted in a significant accumulation of IL-2 mRNA .
The addition of IL-7 resulted in a fivefold enhanced IL-2 mRNA expression ( n = 4 ; Fig 2B ) .

IL-7 upregulates the IL-2 and IFN-y secretion of activated human T lymphocytes .
T cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with PHA or PHA plus anti-CD28 ( aCD28 ) in the presence or absence of IL-7 .
Cell free supernatants were harvested after 12 and 24 hours and analyzed for secreted ( A ) IL-2 protein and ( B ) IFN-y protein with ELISAs .
The mean values for the IL-2 and IFN-y secretion found in four independent experiments are shown .
Rehybridization with an IFN-y cDNA probe showed that IFN-y mRNA accumulated in a similar fashion as IL-2 mRNA , but in a much smaller degree ( Fig 2A ) .
IL-7 induced an almost fold increase ( n = 4 ) in IFN-y mRNA accumulation after 6 hours of stimulation compared with the combination of PHA and anti-CD28 alone ( Fig 2B ) .
IL-7 increases the IL-2-gene transcription rate in activated T lymphocytes .
- To examine whether the effect of the IL-7 signal on the IL-2 gene expression is mediated at the transcriptional level , we performed a nuclear run-on transcription assay to measure the transcription rate of the IL-2 gene .
Hardly any IL-2 mRNA was transcribed in T lymphocytes that were left unstimulated .
The transcription of the IL-2 gene was induced by stimulation of the T lymphocytes with PHA and anti-CD28 ( Fig 3A ) .
The addition of IL-7 upregulated this IL-2-transcription rate with a factor 3.4 ( n = 4 ; Fig 3B ) , indicating that IL-7 regulates the IL-2-gene expression at least in part at the transcriptional level .
IL-7 enhances the binding activities of NFAT and AP-1 to the IL-2 promoter , but not the binding activities of NFkB or CD28RC .
_ To study the molecular basis of the IL-7 induced increase of the IL-2 gene transcription rate , we ana-lysed the binding activities of NFAT , AP-1 , NFB , and CD28RC to their binding sites in the human IL-2 promoter .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from unstimulated T lymphocytes or T lymphocytes stimulated for 2 hours with PHA or PHA in combination with anti-CD28 in the presence or absence of IL-7 .
As shown in Fig 4 , no NFAT , AP-1 , NFxB , and CD28RC DNA binding activity was observed in unstimulated T lymphocytes , but was inducible upon stimulation .
T lymphocytes stimulated with PHA alone showed DNA binding activity for all four nuclear factors .
The NFAT , AP-1 , NFxB , and CD28RC complexes bound specifically since they were competed for by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the same respective sites , and not by negative controls ( data not shown ) .
Costimulation of PHA plus IL-7 resulted in enhanced DNA binding activities for NFAT ( Fig 4A ) and AP-1 ( Fig 4B ) .
The NFAT DNA binding acitivity was enhanced by 60 + 9 % ( mean + SEM ; n = 4 ) upon costimulation of PHA with IL-7 compared to stimulation with PHA alone .
The DNA binding activity of AP-1 increased with almost 120 + 2 % ( mean + SEM ; n = 4 ) .
The addition of IL-7 had no effect on the DNA binding activities of NFB ( Fig 4C ) and CD28RC ( Fig 4D ) .
In T lymphocytes stimulated with PHA plus anti-CD28 only the CD28RC DNA binding was enhanced compared with T lymphocytes stimulated with PHA alone ( Fig 4D ) .
Again , costimulation with IL-7 resulted in enhanced NFAT and AP-1 DNA binding activities ( Fig 4A and 4B ) , whereas no effect was observed on the NFB and CD28RC DNA binding .
The NFAT DNA binding activity was increased with 60 + 8 % ( mean + SEM ; n = 4 ) , and the AP-1 DNA binding was increased with 130 + 10 % ( mean + SEM ; n = 4 ) .
Stimulation of 4 h with IL-7 resulted in a persisting enhancement in NFAT and AP-1 DNA binding activities ( data not shown ) .
IL-7 enhances the transcriptional activities of both NFAT and AP-1 .
To examine whether the IL-7 induced enhanced NFAT and AP-1 DNA binding activities could account for the observed enhanced transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter , transient transfection experiments were performed .
To this end , we used the CAT reporter plasmids pCAT3e-3 X NFAT/IL-2 , in which the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene is driven by three copies of the distal NFAT binding site of the human IL-2 promoter linked to the minimal IL-2 promoter , and pCAT-3 X AP-1/IL-2 , in which the CAT gene is driven by three copies of the AP-1 site of the IL-2 promoter linked to a minimal SV40 promoter .
Since resting primary T lymphocytes are refractory to conventional transfection methods , it was necessary to use a prestimulation method as described by J.-H. Park et al . ``

Total RNA was isolated after 6 hours of stimulation .
( A ) Northern hybridizations with IL-i 2 , IFN-y , and 285 cDNA probes were performed .
( B ) O mRNA levels were quantified using a PhosphorIm-IEN gamma aging system , and IL-2 and IFN-y mRNA levels were ence of IL-2 alone .
The prestimulated T lymphocytes were then transfected with either pCAT3e-3 X NFAT/IL-2 , pCAT-3 % AP-1/IL-2 , or the empty pCAT3-enhancer plasmid as a negative control .
No CAT protein could be detected in cells transfected with the empty pCAT3-enhancer plasmid .
As depicted in Fig 5 , no CAT expression was detected in transfected T cells stimulated with IL-7 alone .
Stimulation with PHA induced CAT expression in T cells that were transfected with either pCAT3e-3 X NFAT/IL-2 or pCAT-3 X AP-1/IL-2 .
The CAT expression driven by the three NFAT binding sites was increased by 44 + 7 % ( mean + SEM ; n = 6 ; P = .002 ) by the addition of IL-7 ( Fig 5A ) .
Similar results were obtained when Jurkat cells were transfected with pCAT3e-3 X NFAT/IL-2 .
The CAT expression normalized with respect to the 28S signal .
in Jurkat cells was increased by 32 + 5 % ( mean + SEM ; n = 3 ; P = .021 ) in the presence of IL-7 compared with stimulation with PHA alone ( Fig 5A ) .
The effect of costimulation with IL-7 on the AP-1 driven CAT expression in transfected T cells was even more pronounced : the CAT expression was increased with 79 + 4 % ( mean + SEM ; n = 3 ; P = .002 ; Fig 5B ) .
Thus , the addition of IL-7 resulted in enhanced transcriptional activities of NFAT and AP-1 .
Together with the results of the EMSA experiments which showed that the NFAT and AP-1 DNA binding activities were enhanced by IL-7 ( Fig 4A and 4B ) , these results suggest that IL-7 increases the IL-2 transcription ( Fig 2A ) by enhancing the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of AP-1 and NFAT .

IL-7 increases the IL-2-gene transcription rate in activated human T lymphocytes .
Nuclei were isolated from unstimulated T cells or T cells stimulated for 3 hours with PHA plus anti-CD28 ( aCD28 ) in the presence or absence of IL-7 , and the transcription was allowed to proceed for another 20 minutes in the presence of P-labeled UTP .
( A ) Nuclear RNA was isolated and hybridized to a membrane containing linearized cDNAs for IL-2 and GAPDH .
The pCAT3-enhancer plasmid was included as a negative control .
( B ) Transcription rates were quantified using a PhosphorImaging system , and IL-2 transcription rates were normalized with respect to the GAPDH signal , as described in the Materials and Methods section .
The results are expressed as relative transcription rate compared to the PHA/anti-CD28-induced IL-2 transcription rate , which was set at 1 .
Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) has no effect on the increased binding of AP-1 induced by IL-7 , while partly inhibiting the NFAT binding .
CsA is an immuno-suppressive drug that acts by inhibiting the phosphatase activity of calcineurin .
The cytoplasmic component of NFAT , NFAT1 needs to be dephosphorylated by calcineurin before it can translocate 2695 into the nucleus , and form a DNA-binding complex with AP-1 .
Subsequently , CsA treatment of activated T cells will partly inhibit the IL-2 expression . ``
'' Since IL-7 enhances both the AP-1 and NFAT DNA binding to the IL-2 promoter , we were interested whether CsA could block these IL-7-induced enhancements .
To address this question , nuclear extracts were prepared from T lymphocytes stimulated for 2 hours with PHA plus anti-CD28 in the presence or absence of IL-7 , with or without the addition of CsA .
The nuclear extracts were analyzed for DNA binding factors by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) .
At the same time , T lymphocytes were stimulated for 24 hours , and the supernatants were analyzed for secreted IL-2 .
As shown in Fig 6A , the PHA/anti-CD28 induced DNA binding of NFAT and AP-1 was again increased with , respectively , 70 + 11 % ( mean + SEM ; n = 4 ) and 110 + 9 % ( mean + SEM ; n = 4 ) by IL-7 .
The addition of CsA partly inhibited the DNA binding of NFAT , both in the presence and absence of IL-7 ; only a basal NFAT DNA binding activity could be detected in the presence of CsA .
This result is reflected at the protein level .
In the presence of CsA , the IL-2 secretion is reduced to a basal expression level : PHA/anti-CD28 activated T lymphocytes secreted 12,358 + 1,094 pg/mL versus 6,881 + 737 pg/mL IL-2 ( mean + SEM ; n = 4 ) in the presence of CsA , and PHA/anti-CD28 plus IL-7-activated T lymphocytes secreted 22,955 + 364 pg/mL versus 9,016 + 318 pg/mL IL-2 ( mean + SEM ; n = 4 ) in the presence of CsA ( Fig 6B ) .
The IL-7 induced enhancement of the AP-1 DNA binding activity was not affected by CsA ( Fig 6A ) .
The addition of CsA had also no effect on the NFB and CD28RC DNA binding activities ( data not shown ) .
These results show that the enhanced AP-1 DNA binding activity induced by IL-7 is not mediated through the Ca**- and cal-modulin-dependent signal which activates NFAT1 .
DISCUSSION In this study , we have examined the involvement of the stromal-derived cytokine IL-7 in the regulation of the IL-2-gene expression in activated human T lymphocytes .
The expression of the IL-2 gene is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level through a 300-bp promoter containing several binding sites for both ubiquitous and T-cell specific transcription factors .
We demonstrate that IL-7 enhances the expression of IL-2 at the mRNA and protein levels most pronounced in PHA plus anti-CD28 activated T lymphocytes .
The accumulation of IL-2 mRNA in PHA/anti-CD28 activated T lymphocytes after 6 hours of stimulation is about fivefold increased in the presence of IL-7 .
Previously it has been reported that the expression of another Thl-cytokine , IFN-y is also enhanced by the addition of IL-7 .
`` ° Indeed , we observe a fourfold upregulation of the IFN-y mRNA expression by PHA/anti-CD28 stimulated T lymphocytes in the presence of IL-7 .
The effect that IL-7 exerts on the IL-2-gene expression is in part mediated at the transcriptional level .
The addition of IL-7 leads to a 3.4-fold upregulation of the IL-2-gene transcription rate compared with the transcription rate induced in T lymphocytes stimulated with PHA plus anti-CD28 .

DNA binding activities of NFAT and AP-1 , but not NFB and CD28RC , are enhanced by IL-7 in activated human T lymphocytes .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from unstimulated T cells and T cells stimulated for 2 hours with PHA or PHA plus anti-CD28 ( aCD28 ) in the presence or absence of IL-7 .
EMSAs were performed with probes comprising ( A ) the distal NFAT site , ( B ) the proximal AP-1 site , ( C ) the NFB site , and ( D ) the CD28 response element in the human IL-2 promoter .
DNA binding activities were quantified using a PhosphorImaging system .
The lower graphs show the mean + SEM found for the DNA binding activities of NFAT , AP-1 , NFB , and CD28RE in four independent experiments .
The results are expressed as relative DNA binding compared to the PHA-induced DNA binding , which was set at 1. scription rate has previously been reported : the IFN-y transcription rate in anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated T lymphocytes was increased with a factor 2 in the presence of IL-7 . ``
The enhanced accumulation of IL-2 and IFN-y mRNA in PHA/anti-CD28 and PHA/anti-CD28 plus IL-7-stimulated T lymphocytes is also in part mediated at the post-transcriptional level .
It has been reported that signaling via CD28 results in the stabilization of IL-2 and IFN-y mRNA . ``
In addition it has been shown that IL-7 stabilizes the mRNAs of IL-4 , IFN-y , IL-3 , and granulocyte macro-phage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) . ``
The observation that IL-7 has limited effects on the IL-2-mRNA accu- mulation in PHA-stimulated T_ lymphocytes , while stimulation with PHA plus anti-CD28 results in a significant IL-2-mRNA expression , suggests that IL-7 is unable to substitute the requirement for CD28 stimulation where the IL-2 gene is concerned .
These data indicate that the downstream targets for the CD28 and IL-7-signaling pathways are differ-ent .
The electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that IL-7 exerts its effects on the regulation of the IL-2-gene expression through the transcription factors NFAT and AP-1 .

Transfected cells were left alone for 1 hour , divided in four groups and subsequently left unstimulated or stimulated with IL-7 alone , PHA alone or PHA plus IL-7 for 24 hours .
CAT expression was measured as described in Materials and Methods .
The results are expressed as the relative CAT expression compared to the PHA-induced CAT expression , which was set at 1 .

activated T lymphocytes .
The NFAT DNA binding activity is enhanced with a factor 1.6 , while the AP-1 DNA binding activity is more than twofold enhanced .
The effects of IL-7 are specific since the DNA binding activities of CD28RC and NFB are not affected by the addition of IL-7 .
However , the enhanced binding of NFAT and AP-1 to the IL-2 promoter induced by IL-7 in PHA/IL-7-stimulated T lymphocytes has limited effects at mRNA and protein level .
Coacti-vation with anti-CD28 is required for a significant increase in the IL-2-mRNA accumulation and protein secretion .
In T lymphocytes stimulated with PHA alone or PHA plus IL-7 , a DNA binding activity to the CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) is observed .
Several reports have presented evidence that binding to CD28RE might occur in response to TCR sig- A Fig 6 .
The enhanced DNA binding activity of AP-1 induced by IL-7 in activated human T lymphocytes is CsA-resistant , while the NFAT DNA binding activity is CsA-sensitive .

Recently a 35-KD inducible protein was identified and called NF-MAT . ``
This factor is most likely responsible for the observed binding to the CD28RE .
After costimulation with anti-CD28 , the CD28 signal induces the binding of the CD28 responsive complex ( CD28RC ) to the CD28RE , which initiates the IL-2 production by the activated T lymphocytes .
This result is consistent with the observations that T lymphocytes need the costimulatory CD28 signal to produce IL-2 , and suggests that the increase in DNA binding to CD28RE is most relevant for the ongoing transactivation . ``
The results obtained with the mobility shift assays , indicating that IL-7 affects the regulation of the IL-2 gene through the DNA binding activities of NFAT and AP-1 , could be confirmed by transfection studies .

2698 Since AP-1 forms a part of the NFAT complex that binds to the human IL-2 promoter , `` the results strongly suggest that the IL-7 induced NFAT DNA binding activity is regulated through the AP-1 component of the NFAT complex .
This implicates that the IL-7-signaling pathway leads to the activation of the AP-1 proteins fos and jun . ``
Only limited data are available about the signaling pathways of IL-7 .
JAK1 , JAK3 , and STATS have been demonstrated to be involved in IL-7 signaling and so have the protein tyrosine kinases p56 `` and p59 `` , and PI 3-kinase . ``
' `` `` The activation of MAPK by IL-7 has been reported once . ``
'' The signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of fos and jun proteins are better known .
The kinase p21 `` ( Ras ) plays a central role in the activation of the AP-1 proteins through the induction of at least two kinase cascades , which are both critical to NFAT activation and T-cell activation . ``
Firstly , Ras activates the Raf-1/MEK/ERK ( extracellular signal regulated kinase ) cascade , resulting in the transcriptional activation of the c-fos promoter .
The production of c-fos contributes directly to the induction of the DNA binding activity of AP-1 , since fos/jun heterodimers are much more efficient in binding to DNA than jun/jun homodimers . ``
The second pathway induced by Ras involves the MEKK/SEK/JNK ( c-jun NH ; -terminal kinase ) cascade which results both in the transcriptional activation of the c-jun promoter as also in the stimulation of the transcriptional activity of c-jun . '
'' `` ** `` The IL-7 induced signaling pathway can activate either one of the signaling proteins involved in the ERK and JNK pathways .
We speculate that Raf-1 is not a target for the IL-7 signal , since Raf-1 is involved in the activation of NFKB/ Rel proteins .
Activated Raf-1 induces the degradation of IB proteins which sequester NFB proteins in the cytoplasm . ``
The activation of Raf-1 by IL-7 either direct or via Ras , would subsequently result in an upregulation of the DNA binding activity of NFB .
Our results show that the NFB DNA binding activity is not affected by IL-7 .
However , this does not exclude the possibility that proteins downstream of Raf-1 are involved in the IL-7-signaling pathway .
Further experiments are necessary to gain insight in which signaling proteins are involved in the IL-7-induced activation of fos and jun proteins .
The immunosuppressive drug CsA does not block the IL-7 induced , enhanced DNA binding of AP-1 , indicating that the IL-7-signaling pathway is not a CsA-sensitive pathway .
This is consistent with a role for the ERK pathway in the signal transduction route of IL-7 , since this pathway is not inhibited by CsA . ``
Activation of JNK has been shown to be partially sensitive to CsA . ``
Some jun family members , distinct from AP-1 activity , are activated by a calcium-regulated , CsA-sensitive signaling pathway . ``
IL-7 seems not to use this pathway to activate jun proteins .
IL-7 might also regulate the expression of c-fos through activation of a JAK/STAT pathway .
Recently a role for STATS5 has been proposed in the transcriptional activation of the c-fos promoter .
Evidence was presented showing that both Ras-mediated and STATS signals are necessary for the full expression of c-fos . ``
Since IL-7 has been shown to induce the activation of JAK3 and STAT5 , * `` it seems possible that IL-7 upregulates the c-fos expression through activation of STATS .
GRINGHUIS ET AL Thus , we conclude that IL-7 upregulates the IL-2-gene expression by enhancing the DNA binding activities of both NFAT and AP-1 to the IL-2 promoter .
We speculate that the IL-7-signaling pathways cross-talk with other signaling pathways that activate the fos and jun proteins , since both proteins are part of the NFAT and AP-1-transcription factors .
