M. ] Abstract We studied the role of the immediate early gene c-jun in cell proliferation and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) -induced differentiation in U937 human monoblastic cells , using c-jun-specific antisense ( AS ) phosphorothioate oligonucleotides .
In selecting the most specific and potent oligonucleotide sequence , we performed extensive analyses for the binding specificity between all candidates of c-jun AS oligonucleotides and the whole sequences in GenBank database , using a computer program .
Among the 20 selected oligonucleotides , two potent 15-mer AS oligonucleotides ( C-JUN AS oligonucleotides ) exhibited significant inhibition of cell growth in a dose-dependent manner between 2 and 10 um .
Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated that 10 um of C-JUN AS oligonucleotides reduced c-jun expression at both the mRNA and protein levels .
More importantly , C-JUN AS oligonucleotides showed distinct effects on two markers of PMA-induced differentiation ; the C-JUN AS oligonucleotides inhibited cell adhesion , whereas they did not affect another marker of differentiation , respiratory burst ( measured by nitro blue tetrazolium reduction assay ) .
These results suggest a critical role of c-jun in both cell proliferation and PMA-induced cell adhesion but not in PMA-induced respiratory burst in U937 cells .

forming the nuclear complex AP-1 ( 1 , 2 ) .
The AP-1 complex can function as a transcription factor through binding to a DNA consensus sequence ( termed 12-O-tetradecanoylphor-bot-13-acetate-responsive elements ) that is contained within the promoter region of many cellular genes such as colla-genase , stromelysin , as well as c-jun itself ( 3-5 ) .
It has been reported previously that c-jun transcription is rapidly and transiently activated in cells in response to a wide variety of stimuli such as serum ( 6 , 7 ) , growth factors ( 8-12 ) , or phorbol esters ( 13 ) .
The profile of this gene expression has been characterized as IEGs , ° including c-fos and c-myc ( 14-17 ) .
The induction of IEG expression does not require intervening protein syn-thesis , thus IEGs are thought to be the first genes activated after mitogenic stimuli , implicating that these genes should hold the key to the signal transduction pathway of complex cellular proliferation and differentiation cascades .
Furthermore , inhibition of c-fos expression prevents 3T3 cell proliferation in both quiescent and logarithmically growing conditions ( 18-20 ) , suggesting the essential role of c-fos in cell proliferation .
Recent studies have also shown that c-myc AS transcripts or AS oligonucleotides inhibit cell proliferation but induce differentiation in F-MEL and HL6O cells ( 21 , 22 ) .
These findings suggest that c-myc is a positive regulator of cell proliferation but a negative one for differentiation .
Although accumulating results also indicate that c-jun is important in producing cell proliferation ( 23 , 24 ) , little is known about the role of c-jun in cell differentiation .
U937 human monoblastic cells ( 25 ) provide a model system for the study of c-jun in proliferation and differentiation .
U937 cells can be differentiated into macrophage-like cells by PMA ( 26 , 27 ) .
Within 24-72 h after PMA stimulation , cellular characteristics are switched from proliferation to differentiation status , and macrophage-like functions , such as cellular adherence to plastic plates and phagocyte respiratory burst , are clearly induced .
Numerous reports have shown that these functional maturations with proliferation arrest were preceded by a rapid increase in c-Jun protein levels ( 27-30 ) , however , it is somewhat paradoxical because a similar up-regulation of c-Jun is noted to be associated with U937 cell proliferation ( 31 ) .
Therefore , the fundamental question of whether PMA-induced c-jun expression is a ° The abbreviations used are : IEG , immediate early gene ; AS , antisense ; NBT , nitro blue tetrazolium ; PMA , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ; Tm , melting temperature ; ATF ; activating transcription factor ; MAP , mitogen-activated protein ; RT-PCR , reverse transcription-PCR ; FBS , fetal bovine serum ; TBS , Tris-buffered saline .

mainspring or a byproduct during differentiation of U937 cells remains to be elucidated .
In the present study , we designed a series of c-jun-specific AS phosphorothioate oligonucleotides and then evaluated their effects on U937 cell proliferation .
Using the most specific and potent c-jun AS oligonucleotides , we examined the possible effect of the oligonucleotides on PMA-induced functional maturation .
The present study demonstrates that the inhibition of c-Jun protein expression significantly reduces cell proliferation and PMA-induced adherent activity but not PMA-induced respiratory burst measured by NBT reduction activity .
These results indicate a critical role of c-jun in cell proliferation and PMA-induced cell adhesion but not in PMA-induced respiratory burst in U937 cells .
Results Sequence of Oligonucleotides .
The sequence , length , and nearest neighbor calculations of the Tm of each oligonucleotide are summarized in Table 1 .
In designing the AS sequence , we first assigned the Tm of oligonucleotides as 35 , 40 , 45 , 50 , and 55°C .
All possible sequences that would have the given Tms were extracted from every position of the c-jun mRNA , then the specificity ( the degree of cross-hybridization against the whole sequences in the GenBank database ) of each oligonucleotide , and the possibility of forming a secondary structure in both oligonucleotides and the target mRNA was analyzed by a computer program ( 32 , 33 ) .
Twenty candidates of sequences were chosen from four different sites on the c-jun mRNA such as : ( a ) 5'-untranslated region ( position 1022-1047 ) ; ( b ) AUG translation initiation codon ( position 1261-1263 ) ; ( c ) coding - region - ( position 2194-2215 ) , and ( d ) 3'-untranslated region ( position 3205-3228 ) .

Effect of c-jun AS oligonucleotides on U937 cell profiferation .
U937 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2500 cells/well in 100 pl of RPMI 1640 with 0.5 % FBS , and 10 um of oligonucleotide were added .
After a 24-h incubation in the absence ( U , untreated ) or presence of either control ( C ) or c-jun AS oligonucleotides ( 7-20 ) , serum concentration was adjusted to 10 % , and culture was continued for an additional 2 days without removing the oligonucleotides .
Cells were exposed to 0.5 uCi/well of PH|thymidine for the last 6 h , then cellular uptake of midine was counted .

c-jun AS oligonucleotides were targeted for 5'-untransiated region ( 7-5 ) , AUG translation initiation region ( 6-10 ) , coding region ( 17-75 ) , and 3'-untranslated region ( 16-20 ) .
The Tm of each oligonucleotide was approximately 35°C ( 1 , 6 , 11 , and 16 ) , 40°C ( 2 , 7 , 12 , and 17 ) , 45°C ( 3 , 8 , 13 , and 18 ) , 50°C ( 4 , 9 , 14 , and 19 ) , or 55°C ( 5 , 10 , 15 , and 20 ) .

Effect of c-jun AS Oligonucleotides on U937 Cell Proliferation .
We examined the effects of 20 c-jun AS oligonucleotides on U937 cell proliferation .
Cells were treated with 10 um of each oligonucleotide , and the cell proliferation rate was determined by [ ®H ] thymidine pulse assay .
The results obtained at 48 h after oligonucleotide treatment are shown in Fig .
1 .
The 20 c-jun AS oligonucleotides ( 1-20 ) revealed several degrees of inhibitory effects on U937 cell proliferation compared to untreated cells ( U ) .
Three of the four oligonucleotides with Tm 35°C ( 6 , 11 , and 16 ) revealed higher inhibition ( ranging between 76 and 83 % ) , whereas four oligonucleotides with Tm 55°C ( 5 , 10 , 15 , and 20 ) showed less inhibition ( ranging between 24 and 27 % ) , similar to that shown by the control oligonucleotide ( C ; 28 % ) .
The inhibitory rates of other oligonucleotides with Tms 40 , 45 , and 50°C ranged between 22 % and 63 % .
Similar results were consistently observed with three different batches of each oligonu-cleotide .

Oligonucleotides AS-1 ( 6 ) and AS-2 ( 11 ) were used for subsequent analyses .
Cells were treated with different concentrations of either AS-1 or control oligonucleotide , and the cell proliferation rate was determined every 24 h by [ °HJthymidine uptake .

- Dose-dependent effect of c-jun AS oligonucleotides on U937 cell profiferation .
U937 cells ( 2 , 500 cells/well ) were treated without ( 0 ) or with 10 um of control oligonucleotide ( @ ) or various concentrations ( 2 ( 0 ) , 5 ( @ or 10 ( A ) uw ) of c-jun AS oligonucteotide AS-1 , and cellular uptake of PHIthymidine was counted daily as described in the legend to Fig .

Values are the mean + SD of triplicate wells .
whereas AS-1 consistently inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner between 2 and 10 um ( Fig .
2 ) .
Although 2 um of AS-1 revealed sufficient inhibition of cell proliferation for up to 2 days , cells started to proliferate after day 2 .
In contrast , 10 um of AS-1 induced stronger inhibition , and its effect lasted for at least 3 days after treatment ( Fig .
2 ) .
The inhibitory effects of AS oligonucleotides on U937 cell growth were further confirmed by counting the number of cells , in which 10 um of AS-1 consistently and significantly inhibited cell growth for at least 4 days after treatment , whereas the number of untreated cells and control oligonucleotide-treated cells increased within this period of time { Fig .
3 ) .
Cell viability was routinely confirmed by trypan blue dye exclusion , and it was always more than 90 % throughout the experiments .
Unlike the previous report by Holt et a/ .
( 22 ) , in which c-myc AS oligonucleotides inhibited cell growth and induced cellular differentiation , the inhibition of cell growth by c-jun AS oligonucleotides AS-1 and AS-2 was not accompanied by terminal differentiation in U937 cells ( data not shown ) .
Kinetics of PMA-induced c-Jun Protein Expression in U937 Cells .
U937 cells can be differentiated along with the monocyte-macrophage pathway by PMA stimulation , and this phenotypic alteration is preceded by c-jun up-regulation ( 27 ) .
Therefore , we examined the kinetics of c-Jun protein expression after exposure to PMA .
Total cellular protein was extracted before and after treatment with PMA and was subjected to Western blot analysis .
The results ( shown in Fig .
4 ) demonstrated that lower levels of c-Jun protein were expressed in U937 cells while in an unstimulated condition , but a rapid increase ( 12-fold ) in c-Jun protein expression was induced within 1 h after PMA treatment .
However , this induction was transient and decreased by half at 3 h after PMA treatment .

Effect of c-jun AS Oligonucleotides on PMA-induced Functional Maturation .
To assess the role of c-jun on U937 cell differentiation , cells initially treated with or without either control or c-jun AS oligonucleotides were exposed to PMA , and the two markers of functional maturation ( cellular adhesion and NBT reduction activity ) were evaluated .

Pretreatment of c-jun AS oligonucleotides resulted in a significant and marked decrease in PMA-induced cell adhesion , whereas the induction of NBT reduction activity was not affected by c-jun AS oligonucleotides ( Fig .
78 ) .
To clarify whether the c-jun AS oligonucleotides selectively suppress PMA-induced cell adhesion , we counted the absolute cell number of NBT-positive or -negative cells in adherent and floating cell fractions separately .
As shown in Fig .
8 , neither the number of total viable cells nor the number of NBT-positive cells ( hatched boxes ) was different between untreated- and AS-treated cells ; however , the number of adherent cells ( gray boxes ) was significantly reduced by AS Cell Growth & Differentiation 20 é 15- « i : e V a a # s 0 AS 1 _ AS 2 Fig .

Effect of c-jun AS oligonucleotides on PMA-induced functional maturation in U937 cells .

untreated control treatment .
Furthermore , although most NBT-positive cells were found in adherent cell fractions in untreated or control oligonucleotide-treated cells ( hatched boxes were found only in gray box in untreated and control columns ) , a number of NBT-positive cells were found even in the floating cell fractions if the cells had been treated with c-jun AS oligonucleotides ( hatched boxes were found in both gray and white boxes in AS-1 and AS-2 columns ) .
These data suggest that c-jun AS oligonucleotides suppress only cell adhesion , without exhibiting any effect on NBT reduction activity .
Discussion The c-jun proto-oncogene is characterized as an IEG and is thought to play a central role in U937 cell differentiation .
However , most of the previous reports describing the functional link between c-jun expression and U937 cell differentiation are based on the change in c-jun expression level during the induction of differentiation , and few reports show evidence for a correlation between c-jun and cell differentiation .
Because PMA is known to stimulate c-jun expression ( 13 ) , the answer to the fundamental question of whether c-jun expression is a mainspring or a byproduct during PMA-induced differentiation of U937 cells remains unclear .
The present study using AS oligonucleotides provided significant insight into this inquiry .
The results demonstrated that the suppression of c-jun expression inhibited PMA-induced cell adhesion but not PMA-induced NBT reduction activity .
These findings suggest that the immediate early response of c-jun expression relates to cellular adherence but does not relate to NBT reduction activity during PMA-induced differentiation of U937 cells .
Two lines of evidence support this conclusion : ( a ) PMA-induced cell adhesion was significantly suppressed at both 24 h and 72 h after stimu- lation , whereas NBT reduction activity was never affected by c-jun AS treatment , although these two markers of differentiation were measured in identical cells of culture ; and ( b ) under normal conditions , NBT reduction activity was usually found in the cells that showed adherent activity .
After c-jun AS treatment , however , NBT reduction activity was seen even in cells that could not show adherent activity ( Fig .
7 ) .
In these cells , the acquisition of cellular adherence was selectively inhibited , whereas NBT reduction activity remained unchanged .
Although recent AS technologies provide an opportunity to inhibit target gene expression ( 34 ) , one of the most critical steps in oligonucleotide-based AS research is to distinguish sequence-specific activities from sequence-nonspecific ef-fects .
In this study , in designing specific oligonucleotide sequences , we have conducted extensive analysis for : ( a ) the sequence similarity of oligonucleotides ; ( b ) optimal Tm in intracellular physiological condition ; ( c ) optimal length of oligonucleotides ; ( d ) hybridization sites on the target mRNA ; and ( e ) the possibility of forming a secondary structure of both oligonucieotides and target genes , by using our newly developed computer program ( 32 , 33 ) .
Through the analysis , we selected 20 different oligonucleotides with a variety of Tms and lengths and identified at least two active oligonucleotides in different areas of the target c-jun ( AS-1 , AUG starting codon ; AS-2 , other coding sequence region ) .
RT-PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated that the oligonucleotides revealed significant reduction of c-jun expression at both the mRNA and protein levels but showed unchanged levels of B-actin control .
In addition , each sequence was carefully analyzed for its sequence similarity/ dissimilarity and hybridizability against other published gene sequences to show sequence specificity .
Hybridizability is based on the nearest neighbor calculation of the free hybridization energy between the AS sequences and all other published gene sequences in the GenBank primate database .
Based on these analyses , both oligonucleotides AS-1 and AS-2 were highly specific to c-jun but not to all other published sequences , including the members of the IEG family , such as jun B , jun D , c-fos , fra-1 , fra-2 , and c-myc ( as summarized in Table 2 ) .
Therefore , the effects of AS-1 and AS-2 are more likely to be involved in c-jun activities but not in simple sequence-nonspecific activity .
The protein products of c-jun gene dimerize with c-Fos protein , forming the nuclear complex AP-1 ( 1 , 2 ) .
It has been reported that other members of the Jun/Fos family ( .e .
, junB , junD , fosB , fra-1 , and fra-2 ) and the members of ATF/cyclic AMP response element binding protein family such as ATF2 can form homo- or heterodimers that show DNA binding activity ( 35-38 ) , suggesting that after AS inhibition of c-jun expression , these genes might compensate for c-jun gene function by showing transcription activity .
However , it seems less likely that this would occur in only the process of NBT reduction activity but not in the process of cellular adher-ence .
In addition , it has also been reported that c-Jun/Fos heterodimers reveal enhanced DNA binding activity compared to other dimers ( 39 ) , implicating that c-Jun/Fos heterodimers could not neutralize c-jun suppression com-pletely .
Furthermore , the differences in biological response 1009 1010 _ Role of c-jun in Hematopoietic Cell Differentiation Table 2 - Specificity of oligonucleotide sequences Genes Locus Position AG `` Sequence ( sense ) `` AS-1 15.36 - ACTGTTCTATGACTG c-jun HUMJUNA 1253 15.36 - -- -- -- -_-_ -- © jun B HSJUNB 1744 4.63 - TT -- -- T-TTA-T jun D HSJUND 1516 4.63 - TT -- -- G-TTGT c-fos HSCFOS 1173 8.55 - TT -- -- G -- -- T fra-1 HSFRA1M 432 3.61 TGCAGG-GGA -- -fra-2 HSFRAZM 655 2.80 - G- -- AG-GGTGAAA c-mye _ HSMYC1 585 4.94 _ CAG-AA -- -- - -CT AS-2 16.37 - ATGAACCACGTTAAC c-jun -_ HUMJUNA __ 2197 _ 16.37 -- -- -- -- -- -jun B __ HSJUNB 698 - 12.30 -- -- -- - G-CA jun D _ HSJUND 855 7.46 - C-C-G -- -- C -- -c-fos - HSCFOS 279 5.50 - -ACCG -- -A-G-T fra-1 HSFRA1TM bes 5.24 - T -- -- TGAGGC -- fra-2 HSFRAZM 83s 6.08 - TC -- -T -- CTT- c-mye _ HSMYC1 1453 _ 693 -G-TG -- -- CTC-Control 17.33 - CTCATGCCACTICAG c-jun __ HUMJUNA _ 876 _ 8.56 GG-CG -- -- G -- jun B __ HSJUNB 1237 _ 6.36 -ATGAC -- -G -- -jun D _ HSJUND 854 _ 7.48 -CTCA -- -G -- A c-fos _ HSCFOS 2964 _ 8.77 -CAG -- A -- -- -frail __ HSFRATIM |_ 873 _ 715 -AG -- -- CCT -- _ HSFRAZM __ 317 4.37 -CAT -- G -- CA-C-c-myc _ HSMYC1 1452 _ 748 GaG @ -- -G-TC * Calculated maximum AG with nearest neighbor model .

between the members of the jun gene family has been reported previously .
For example , junB and junD differ from c-jun in their ability to induce oncogenic transformation of fibroblasts ( 40-43 ) and in their ability to inhibit steroid hormone receptor ( 44 , 45 ) or muscle differentiation factor ( 46 ) .
Recently , it was reported that constitutive c-Jun expression induced the acquisition of phagocytic activity but did not develop cellular adherence using c-jun-transfected U937 cells ( 47 ) .
These results imply that c-Jun expression relates to phagocytic activity but not to cellular adherence during PMA-induced differentiation of U937 cells .
Although these findings are in contrast to those presented here , the constitutive expression of c-Jun protein may induce additional gene expression followed by some phenotypic modulation , and therefore it is not associated with physiological condition in U937 cells .
Because c-Jun protein is transiently expressed as an immediate early event only after appropriate stimulation in U937 cells , we think the AS approach , which can selectively inhibit target gene expression , is an appropriate way to examine the distinct role of such an IEG as c-jun .
Recent studies concerning cell growth and differentiation control have focused on delineating signal transduction pathways , especially the MAP kinase pathway .
Many receptor tyrosine kinases or cytokine receptors have been shown to activate MAP kinase cascades , which involve the small GTP-binding protein p21 `` * ( 48 , 49 ) .
The activated Ras protein contributes to the activation of MAPK kinase ( MAPKK , also known as MEK ) , which in turn activates MAP kinases , extracellular signal-regulated kinase , and c-Jun N-terminal kinase .
Once activated , extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase translocate to the nucleus , where they phosphorylate transcription factors ( f.e .
, Elk-1 , c-Jun , and ATF2 ) leading to IEG induction ( 50-52 ) .
Because MAP kinase activation is associeted with both cell proliferation and differentiation ( 53 ) , the mechanisms that determine whether a stimulus elicits proliferation or differentiation have yet to be elucidated .
Further experiments modulating the expression of these proliferation/differentiation-related genes as well as examining the composition of AP-1 complex in PMA-stimulated cells will help elucidate the complex signal transduction cascade in hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation .

After cleavage from the column and deprotecting in ammonium hydroxide at 55°C for 10 h , the oligomers were dissolved in water and were purified by two rounds of ethanol precipitation .
The length and purity of each oligonucleotide was analyzed by a 15 % PAGE , stained with ethidium bromide .
The purity of full-length material was more than 95 % .
All oligonucleotides were freshly dissolved in Dulbecco 's PBS ( Hyclone Laboratories , Logan , UT ) for working solution .
Cells and Culture Condition .
Human monobiastic cell line U937 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD ) and was maintained in suspension culture in RPMI 1640 ( Hyclone Laboratories ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Hyclone Laboratories ) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO ; , /95 % air .
Passage was performed every 3-4 days and was seeded at an initial concentration of 2 x 10° cells/ml .
For the treatment of cells with oligonucleotides , after two rounds of passage the cells were washed twice with PBS , were resuspended in 100 l of RPMI 1640 containing 0.5 % FBS , and were seeded in 96-well plates ( Costar Corp. , Cambridge , MA ) at the density of 2500 cells/well .
Cells were incubated with various concentrations of oligonucleotides for 24 h , and serum was added to reach a final concentration of 10 % .
Then , culture was continued for an additional 1-3 days .
For the induction of cellular differentiation , cells were seeded in 24-well plates in 1 ml of 10 % FBS/RPMI 1640 at the cell density of 2 x 10° cells/ml and were incubated with 160 nm PMA ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) .
PH ] JThymidine Uptake of Cells .
Celis were pulsed with 0.5 mCi PHJthymidine/well for the final 6 h of culture , then they were harvested onto glass fiber filters ( Cambridge Technology , Watertown , MA ) using a semiautomated PHD model 290 cell harvester ( Cambridge Technology } .
The amount of incorporated tritium was measured by a liquid scintillation counter ( LS6000 ic ; Beckman Instruments , Fullerton , CA ) .
Western Blot Analysis .
Cells were pelleted by centrifugation , were washed twice with ice-cold PBS , and were lysed on ice in 100 Ll of standard radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [ 0.15 m NaCl , 50 mm Tris-HCI ( pH8.0 ) , 0.1 % SDS , and 1 % NP4O0 ] containing 100 ug/ml phe-nylmethyisulfonyifluoride and 1 ug/ml !
each of aprotinin , pepstatin , and leupeptin .
Lysates were then sonicated briefly to reduce viscosity and were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C .
Twenty ug of total protein were electrophoresed on 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels and were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) .
Membranes were blocked in 3 % gelatin/TBS [ 20 mm Tris-HCI ( pH 7.6 ) and 0.9 % NaCI ] for 10 h at room temperature , then were incubated with rabbit anti-human c-Jun antibody ( Oncogene Science , Uniondale , NY ) diluted 1:10 in 1 % gelatin/TBS for 2 h , followed by goat anti-rabbit 1gG-alkaline-phosphatase conjugate ( Sigma ) diluted 1:10 in 1 % gelatin/ Cell Growth & Differentiation TBS for 1 h. Color development was performed by alkaline-phosphatase conjugate substrate kit ( Bio-Rad ) , according to manufacturer 's instructions .
RT-PCR .
Total cellular RNA was extracted from 1 x 10° cells by a procedure using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-pheno !
chloroform method .
Total mRNA was captured by biotinylated oligo-deoxythymidine and was purified by streptavidine paramagnetic particles ( Promega , Mad-ison , WI ) .
Randomly primed cDNA was prepared from isolated mRNA by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase ( Life Technologies , Inc. , Gaithersburg , MD ) after PCR amplification by thermal cycler ( Perkin Elmer Cetus , Norwalk , CT ) .
The sequences of the primer pairs used were as follows : c-jun sense primer , 5'-GTGACCGCGACTTTTCAAAGC-3 ' ; AS primer , 5'-CGTTGCGGGACTGGATTATCAG-3 ' ; B-actin sense primer , 5'-CTTCGCGGG CGACGATGC-3 ' ; and AS primer , 5'-CGTACATGGCT-GGGGTGTTG-3 ' .
PCR amplification was carmied out with 35 cycles for c-jun and 25 cycles for B-actin under the following conditions : denatured at 94°C for 1 min ; annealed at 55°C for 1.5 min ; and extended at 72°C for 4 min .
The PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.2 % agarose gel followed by staining with ethidium bromide .
To confirm that amplified DNA was derived from the appropriate cDNA , the PCR products were sub-cloned , and the nucleotide sequences were determined by direct se-quencing .
Cell Adhesion Assay .
Floating cells were collected by simple aspira-tion , then were washed three times with 100 Ll of RPMI 1640 .
The number of viable floating cells was counted by trypan blue dye exclusion , using a hemocytometer .
Adherent cells were disaggregated by a 15-min incubation with 50 l trypsin-EDTA ( Sigma ) and were harvested thoroughly .
Large clumps of adherent cells were dispersed by vortex and/or repeated passage through pipette before counting on a hemocytometer .
Cells in small clumps were counted as separate cells .
Using the hemocytometer , cells in four comer squares ( total 64 small squares ) were counted , and the number of total cells was calculated .
The percentage of adhesion was defined as follows : Adherent cells Viable floating cells + adherent cells x 100 % of adhesion = NBT Reduction Assay .
Cells were incubated with 0.1 % NBT ( Sigma ) for the final 120 min of culture , then the floating and adherent cells were harvested separately and were resuspended in RPMI 1640 .
Cells were smeared on glass slides and were fixed with ice-cold 1 % paraformalde-hyde , and the percentage of cells containing intracellular blue-black formazon deposits was counted under a microscope for a minimum of 200 cells .
