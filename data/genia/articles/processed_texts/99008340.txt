'Service d'Hématologie Biologique , Hopital Avicenne ; and URA 625 , Hopital Pitié-Salpétriére , France In order to understand the role of NF-xB in EBV transformation we have established stably transfected IxBx into lymphoblastoid cells .
Two clones were obtained in which the loss of NF-xB binding activity correlated with the constitutive expression of the transgenic Protein latency expression was determined by immunocytochemistry .
Expression of surface markers , intracytoplasmic content of cytokines cell cycle analysis after BrdU incorporation and DNA staining with propidium iodide were studied by flow cytometry .
Percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by in-situ labelling of DNA strand breaks .
No significative changes in EBV latency nor in cell surface marker expression was found .
In contrast , intracytoplasmic TNFx levels were strongly reduced in transfected clones .
Furthermore , 30 % of IxBa transfected cells were apoptotic after 8 h of TNF « treatment .
This correlated with a strong reduction of BrdU incorporation after 24 h of TNF treatment .
No effect was seen with non transfected cells or with cells transfected with a control plasmid .
Our results suggest that the TNFx gene could be one of the targets of NF-xB in EBV infected cells and that NF-xB protects EBV-infected cells from apoptosis induced by TNF & , which may favour the proliferative effect of this cytokine .
Keywords : NF-xB ; IxB & ; EBV ; TNFa Introduction The Epstein Barr Virus ( EBV ) is able to infect and transform non tumoral B-cells in vitro and is associated with several human malignancies , such as lymphopro-liferative diseases in immunocompromised patients , endemic Burkitt 's lymphoma or Hodgkin 's disease ( see Kieff and Liecbowtz , 1990 ) .
In vitro EBV-transformation of B-cells is associated with the expression of a restricted set of proteins , so-called latency proteins .
Among them , the LMPI1 protein has been extensively studied .
After transfection , this membrane protein is able to transform cells , as well as to confer the activated phenotype of EBV-infected cells .
Results from several groups demonstrated that LMP1 protein interacts directly with TRAF molecules ( Mosialos et al .
, 1995 ) , which aggregation is an essential step in the transduction pathway of various member of the TNFa « receptor family such as TNFa Correspondence : J Feuillard , Service d'Hématologie Biologique , Hopital Avicenne , Bobigny , France Received 3 March 1998 ; revised 17 August 1998 ; accepted 17 August 1998 receptor types I and II , CD30 , CD40 .
LMPI protein induces multiple downstream effects , among which cell proliferation and activation of Rel/NF-xB proteins ( Laherty et al .
, 1992 ) .
The Rel/NF-xB proteins constitute a family of ubiquitously expressed eukaryotic factors that comprises p50 , p52 , p65 , c-Rel and RelB in mammalian cells .
The members of this family are defined as sharing the Rel homology domain , a conserved region of approximately 300 amino acids that contains critical sequences for dimerization , DNA-binding and nuclear localization .
The activity of these proteins is related to the formation of homo or heterodimers with one of the other members of the family .
These proteins are involved in the positive control of the transcription of a variety of genes involved in the immune response ( TNFa « , interleukin 1 , MHC class II , some adhesion molecules such as ICAMI ... ) , the inflammatory response ( i-NO synthase , interleukin 6 ... ) or onco-genes such as c-myc as well as some viruses such as HIV1 , CMV , SV40 ( see Baeuerle and Henkel , 1994 ; Grilli et al .
, 1993 for review ) .
The cytoplasmic localization of these proteins is due to the masking of the nuclear localization sequence by interaction with one of the IxB family inhibitors : IxBa « , B , y , 6 and s ( Verma et al .
, 1995 for review ) .
Following various cell activation events , such as B-cell receptor or T-cell receptor stimulation , exposure to certain cytokines or some viral infections , Rel/NF-xB dimers are activated .
This activation corresponds to their nuclear translocation after serine phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of IxB .
In the nucleus , Rel/NF-xB heterodimers are thought to enhance the transcriptional activity of a defined set of genes through their binding to a ( xB site ' , a specific DNA-sequence containing the consensus sequence GGGRNNYYCC .
The involvement of Rel/NF-xB dysregulation in tumorigenesis has been suggested by various reports in the literature .
For example , the viral equivalent of c-Rel , v-Rel , which correspond to a truncated and mutated version of c-Rel , is responsible for fatal haematological diseases in chicken and turkey , and transgenic mice expressing v-Rel present rapid T-cell lymphoblastic disorders ( Carrasco et al .
, 1996 ; Simek et al .
, 1986 ; Stephens et al .
, 1983 ) .
One of the first reports which describes the cloning of p52 correspond to the description of the Lyt-10 protein , which locus is rearranged with the t ( 10:14 ) chromosomic translocation ( Neri et al .
, 1991 ) .
This translocation has been reported in 14 % of the Sezary T-Cell lymphoma ( Migliazza et al .
, 1994 ) .
Aberrant Rel/NF-xB protein expression has been reported to be associated with the malignant progression in breast cancers ( Nakshatri et al .
, 1997 ; Sovak et al .
, 1997 ) .
Amplification of the Rel Roles of NF-xB activation in EBV-infected B-lymphocytes M Asso-Bonnet et al 1608 locus has been reported to be a feature of primary extranodal lymphoma ( Houldsworth et al .
, 1996 ) .
Antisense oligonucleotides raised against the p65 mRNA inhibit the proliferation of tumoral cells whereas sense oligonucleotides favour proliferation of tumoral cells ( Higgins et al .
, 1993 ) .
The fact that LMPI1 , the major transforming EBV latency protein , is responsible for NF-xB activation in EBV infected B-cells strongly suggests that Rel/NF-xB complexes could play a role in EBV-related lymphomagenesis .
The NF-xB activation domain of LMPI1 has been well defined , and in vitro mutations or deletions within this domain are associated with the loss of NF-kB activation ( Huen et al .
, 1995 ) .
However , natural variants of LMPI from EBV isolates still have the capacity to activate NF-xB , even if mutations or deletions are occurring within the NF-xB activation domain , suggesting that it exerts a selective pressure on EBV strains to keep intact the capacity of NF-xB activation through the LMP1I proteins in EBV-infected B-cells ( Rothenberger et al .
, 1997 ) .
LMPI activation of NF-xB corresponds to the translocation of p65/p50 complexes in the nucleus , and targets IxBa « phosphorylation and degradation , and over-expression of IxBa « inhibits the NF-xB activation by LMPI1 ( Herrero et a/ .
, 1995 ) .
Therefore , IxBa « expressing vectors could be an interesting tool in controlling NF-xB activity and thus , to understand the relationships between EBV-induced transformation and NF-xB activation .
In order to understand the role of Rel/NF-xB proteins in EBV-related lymphomagenesis , we have stably transfected the IxB « cDNA , mutated on serine 32 and 36 , which blocks its degradation in a lymphoblastoid cell line ( LCL ) .
This mutated IxBa is no longer degraded in response to activating signals .
We have obtained two clones in which expression of the transgene was correlated with the loss of NF-xB binding activity .
We have analysed the EBV latency , surface phenotype , intracytoplasmic cytokine content , cellular proliferation and apoptosis .
We show that intracytoplasmic levels of TNFa in IxBa « transfected clones were reduced to the level of EBV negative B cell lines .
Moreover , TNF « induced both cell apoptosis and cell proliferation arrest in IxBa « transfected cell .
Results Establishment of stably transfected lymphoblastoid cells with the mutated IxBx cDNA In agreement with previous reports , preliminary experiments showed that all EBV positive lymphoblastoid cell lines had a constitutive NF-xB binding activity .
This NF-xB was not enhanced after treatment of cells with PMA plus ionomycin , although this treatment was efficient on NF-xB induction in EBV ( - ) Burkitt cell lines ( not shown ) .
Supershift experiments showed the presence of p65/p50 and p50 , complexes ( Figure la ) .
We have transfected the pcDNA3 vector containing the mutated cDNA of IxBa under the control of CMV promoter , into lymphoblastoid cells .
Mutations consist in substitution of the two serine 32 and 36 by alanines ( IxBo ; ; , a ) ( Traenckner et al .
, 1995 ) .
Control transfection experiments were performed in parallel with the empty plasmid .
Thirty-five clones out of 576 ensemenced p32/p30 p30/p50 _ , .

Immune serum against p65 were raised against the N terminus of p65 ( lane 3 , immune serum no 1207 ) or the C-terminus of p65 ( lane 4 , immune serum no 1226 ) .

Clones were screened for both the loss of NF-xB binding activity by EMSA and genomic integration of cDNA by Southern blot .
Three clones 9C4 , 9B8 and X9 showed a genomic integration of cDNA ( not shown ) .
Among them , the 9C4 clone still had constitutive nuclear NF-xB binding activity ( see Figure 1b ) .
Constitutive NF-xB binding activity was almost abolished in 9B8 clone and totally abolished in X9 clone ( Figure 1b ) .
Treatment of cells with PMA plus ionomycin failed to induce a nuclear NF-xB binding activity in X9 clone and induced a hardly visible signal in 9B8 clone .
Analysis of the expression of the IxBx ; , , , , , protein was done by Western blot .
The wild type and the are distinguishable on the basis of their electrophoretic migration because the IxBa ; ; , ; , , migrates slightly slower in SDS gels ( Traenckner et al .
, 1995 ) .
Control experiments indicating the position of the IxBOz , protein were done using a clone previously described by HPB-ALL T-lymphoblast cell line stably transfected with IxBa » , ; , a ( Ferreira et al .
, 1998 ) .
Results showed that IxBa ; , , , was not detected in the 9C4 clone , was weakly expressed in 9B8 clone and strongly expressed in X9 clone ( Figure 1c ) .
Therefore , the study was continued with both 9B8 and X9 clones .
Note that endogenous IxBa was strongly expressed in both transfected and non transfected cells , suggesting that in spite of the continuous NF-xB activation , IxB « is permanently resynthesized in EBV infected cells .
Phenotypic analysis of IxB « transfected clones We first characterized the surface phenotype of stably transfected clones .
Our results did not evidence any significant modification in expression of adhesion molecules ( CD11a , CD18 , CD44 , CD58 ) , molecules having a xB site in their promoter region ( CD25 , CD48 , CD54 , HLA class I and II molecules ) nor in activation markers ( CD23 , CD30 , CD39 , CD71 ) .
LMPI , EBNA2 and BZLFIl protein expression was unaffected in transfected clones as assessed by immunocytochemistry ( not shown ) .
We next looked after the synthesis of three cytokines , IL-2 .
IL-6 , and TNFa that are potentially regulated by NF-xB and could play a role in B-cell proliferation .
As control , we have tested the IL-10 expression on transfected cells because its expression has never been reported so far to be NF-xB dependent .
Moreover , we have evaluated the synthesis of these cytokines in both Burkitt EBV ( - ) and EBV ( + ) cell lines .
After incubation of cells with brefeldin A , which prevents cytokine secretion by allowing its accumulation in the cytoplasm , and intracytoplasmic labelling , synthesis of cytokines was estimated by flow cytometry ( Picker et al .
, 1995 ) .
As expected ( Klein et a/ .
, 1996 ) , we have found highest levels of IL10 in LCL cells and intermediate levels of IL10 in Burkitt EBV ( + ) cells ( Figure 2 ) .
Intracytoplasmic levels of IL10 were similar in IxBa « transfected cells and non transfected cells ( Figure 2 ) .

Levels of these cytokines were not affected by IxBa transfection in LCL cells ( not shown ) .
TNFa was detected in cytoplasm of both EBV ( - ) and EBV ( + ) cells .
However , fluorescence intensity of intracytoplasmic labelling of TNFa in EBV ( + ) cells was fourfold higher than in EBV ( - ) cells ( Figure 3a ) .
The comparison of TNFa intracytoplasmic labelling in both Burkitt EBV - and EBV + cells suggested that EBV infection of Burkitt cells is associated with a strong increase of TNFa synthesis ( Figure 3a ) .
TNFa intracytoplasmic levels were strongly reduced in both 9B8 and X9 IxBa transfected clones ( Figure 3b ) .
Overlapping of fluorescence graphs of TNFa levels in X9 clone and EBV ( - ) Burkitt cells showed that TNFa synthesis levels in IxBa transfected clones reached down those of EBV ( - ) cells ( Figure 3¢ ) .
These results showed that the loss of NF-xB binding activity in LCL cells was associated with a decrease of TNFa synthesis , reaching levels similar to those found in EBV - cells .
Therefore , this result suggested that the NF-xB constitutive activity could be responsible for a continuous over-synthesis of TNF « in EBV infected cells .

, 1996 ; Wang et al .
, 1996 ) .
Thus we have investigated the effect of TNFa on cell cycle .
Cells were first incubated for 24 h with 10 ng/ml of TNF « and then BrdU incorporation was performed during 4 h and cell cycle analysis was performed with a flow cytometer after DNA staining with propidium iodide ( Lowe et al .
, 1993 ) .
Results are presented in Figure 4 .
No effect of TNFa treatment was seen on non transfected cells or cells transfected with the control plasmid .
By contrast , the number of BrdU positive cells was strongly decreased in both X9 and 9B8 clones after TNFa treatment .
The percentage of apoptotic cells on the X9 clone was first estimated morphologically after May Griinwald Giemsa staining and confirmed using a test which evidenced the DNA strand breaks ( Figure 5 ) .
Results showed that TNFa treatment induced apoptosis in IxBa & « transfected cells but not in non transfected cells ( Figure 5 ) or cells transfected with the control plasmid ( not shown ) .
These results suggested that the loss of NF-xB constitutive activity favoured the TNFa transduction pathway leading to apoptosis in EBV ( + ) cells .
Discussion LMP1I is inducing a continuous NF-xB activation .
A recent report suggested natural deletion variants of LMP1 are submitted to a selection pressure resulting in intact NF-xB activation capacities ( Rothenberger et a/ .
, 1997 ) .
This raises the question of the role of NF-KB in EBV -related lymphomagenesis .
In order to answer this question we have inhibited NF-xB activity by transfect-ing the inhibitor IxBa « in LCL cells .
Our results showed that the loss of nuclear NF-xB activity was associated with the decrease of TNFa synthesis and the increase of sensitivity to apoptosis after TNFa treatment .
A constitutive NF-xB binding activity was found in our EBV positive lymphoblastoid cells , as described previously ( Laherty et al .
, 1992 ) .
Supershift experiment evidenced both p65/p50 and p50 , complexes ( Figure 1 ) , which is consistent with previous reports ( Herrero ef al .
, 1995 ) .
No NF-xB binding activity was detected in IxBa transfected clones , which indicated that both p65/ p50 and p50 , complexes were apparently inhibited by IxB « .
IxBx has been shown first to target p65 containing dimers , whereas no inhibitory effect was seen on the binding of p50 , dimers ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1989 ) .
However , characterization of interactions between IxBa and p50 or p65 showed that , in vitro , IxBa may weakly interact with p50 , homodimers and partly inhibit its binding activity ( Liou et a/ .
, 1992 ) .
Moreover , transfection of IxBa « has been shown to induce a relocalization of p50 into the cytoplasm ( Zabel et al .
, 1993 ) .
Finally , p105 gene expression is regulated by NF-xB ( Ten et al .
, 1992 ) and LMPI induces p105 through NF-xB activation ( Herrero et a/ .
, 1995 ) .
Since our EMSA experiments were done on nuclear extracts , the lack of detection of any Rel/NF-xB complexes in our transfected clones may be explained by three hypothesis which are not exclusive : ( i ) IxB « may translocate in the nucleus ( Arenzana-Seisdedos et al .
, 1995 ; Cressman and Taub , 1993 ; Zabel et al .
, 1993 ) where it inhibits the DNA binding of Rel/ NF-xB complexes with an efficacy related to its differential affinity to these complexes ; ( ii ) IxBa may relocate Rel/NF-xB complexes into the cytoplasm , including p50 , complexes and ( iii ) the constitutive expression of the stably transfected mutated IxBOz3 > /ea may down regulate the p105 gene transcription leading to a decrease in the total amount of some Rel/NF-xB proteins such as p50 .
Except for TNF « , we did not evidence significative changes in expression of various genes that could be theoretically regulated by NF-xB complexes such as CD25 , CD48 , CD54 , HLA class I and II molecules or IL-1 , 2 or 6 .
This could be due to a weak in vivo NF-xB dependence of genes analysed in EBV infected B cells .
Alternatively , it could reflect a mechanism by which EBV infected cells escape from the control of gene expression by cellular factors .
One interesting example is related to the IL-6 gene regulation and its relationships with NF-xB and EBNA2Z .
Regulation of IL-6 may involve NF-xB ( Libermann and Baltimore , 1990 ) .
However , IL-6 gene transcription could potentially become NF-xB independent in EBV infected cells because of interference between EBNA2 and xB sites .
EBNA2 targets the RBP-Jx cellular factor ( Grossman et a/ .
, 1994 ; Henkel et al .
, 1994 ; Zimber-Strobl et al .
, 1994 ) .
RBP-Jx is involved in negative regulation of genes ( Hsich and Hayward , 1995 ; Waltzer et al .
, 1995 ) .
Binding of EBNA2 to RBP-Jx leads to the formation of a complex which activates gene transcription through the transcriptional domain of EBNA2 .
This complex is able to activate the transcription of numerous cellular genes such as CD23 as well as in the LMP I1 gene of the EBV episome ( Grossman et al .
, 1994 ; Henkel et al .
, 1994 ; Zimber-Strobl et al .
, 1994 ) .
A recent report showed that RBP-Jx is also able to bind to the xB site of the IL-6 gene and is responsible for low basal levels of IL-6 gene transcription in fibroblastic cells ( Plaisance et a/ .
, 1997 ) .
Thus , in EBV-infected cells , EBNA2 could target the RBP-Jk bound to the xB site of the IL-6 gene , leading to its over-transcription in an NF-xB independent manner ( Plaisance et al .
, 1997 ) .
This example shows the possibility for EBV to render transcription of some xB-regulated genes independent of NF-xB activation even if NF-xB is continuously activated by EBV .
We found a correlation between a decrease of TNFa synthesis and the loss of NF-xB binding activity in our IxBa « transfected clones .
One of the first reports on the regulation of the TNF « gene transcription evidenced the presence of xB sites in its promoter region and showed that this xB transcriptional activity is correlated with a constitutive NF-xB binding activity in macrophages ( Collart et al .
, 1990 ; Shakhov et al .
, 1990 ) .
Three xB sites have been found in the promoter region of the human TNFa gene ( Goldfeld et al .
, 1991 ) .
These xB sites are able to bind NF-xB complexes .
But , little or no effect has been observed on the induction of transcriptional activity through the TNFa promoter when xB sites are deleted .
In fact , the activity of the xB sites of the TNFa promoter depends on the cell type .
These xB sites are inactive in T-cells ( Goldfeld et al .
, 1991 ) .
However , multimerization of the xB sites of the TNFa promoter region is able to confer an inducible transcriptional activity of a reporter gene after PMA stimulation in the Roles of NF-xB activation in EBV-infected B-lymphocytes M Asso-Bonnet et al 1611 Raji cell line ( an EBV positive Burkitt cell line ) ( Goldfeld levels in EBV negative Burkitt cells Two reports et al .
, 1991 ) .
Our results showed that , in IxBa transfected evidenced relationships between the loss of NF-xB cells , the loss of NF-xB activity was associated with a _ activity and the decrease of TNFx gene expression .

Both reports showed that TNFa gene transcription is NF-xB dependent in macrophages ( Osnes et al .
, 1996 ; Shackelford et al .
, 1997 ) .
Another report showed that levels of TNFa synthesis are correlated with levels of NF-KB binding activity in human B-cells ( Coral et al .
, 1997 ) .
Finally , Aspirin blocks EBV-induced B-cell proliferation in vitro ( Sugano et al .
, 1997 ) .
Together with our results , this strongly suggests that the TNFa gene could be a genuine target of Rel/NF-xB complexes in some defined cell types such as macrophages and B-cells and that continuous NF-xB activation in EBV-infected B-cells by LMP 1 is responsible for a continuous over-expression of the TNFax gene .
Constitutive NF-xB binding activity was hardly detectable in EBV negative Burkitt cells ( not shown ) .
However , after brefeldin A incubation of these cells ( which blocks the cytokine secretion ) , accumulation of TNFa protein was still detectable in both IxBa « transfected clones and EBV negatives Burkitt-cells , suggesting that other components of the TNFa regulatory region are also playing important roles in the transcription of the TNFx gene .
Indeed , TNFa gene expression may be NF-xB independent in mice cells treated with LPS ( Goldfeld et al .
, 1990 ) or in human pernicious malaria ( McGuire et al .
, 1994 ) .
Nevertheless , our results suggest that Rel/NF-xB complexes could play a role in over-expression of TNFa gene in EBV-infected B-cells .
The role of NF-xB complexes in TNFa signalling seems to be at least to protect cells from apoptosis induced by the same TNFx ( Beg and Baltimore , 1996 ; Van Antwerp et al .
, 1996 ; Wang et al .
, 1996 ) .
Our results showed that the loss of NF-xB binding activity in EBV infected cells made them sensitive to TNFx-induced apoptosis .
LMPI1 protein is mimicking the TNFRII activation cascade by aggregating TRAF2 molecules , leading to NF-xB activation and cell proliferation ( Kaye et al .
, 1996 ) .
Our results suggest that TNF gene could be a target of NF-xB in EBV-infected cells .
Therefore , it seems likely that continuous NF-xB activation in EBV-infected cells would protect cells from adverse cytotoxic effects of autocrine TNFa secretion , and favour cell proliferation induced by permanent TRAF2 molecule cascade activation .
Roles of TNF « in lymphomagenesis are highly suspected by the fact that high levels of TNFx in plasma of patients having non Hodgkin 's lymphomas is predictive of a poor prognosis ( Macia et al .
, 1996 ; Salles et al .
, 1996 ; Warzocha et al .
, 1997a , b ) .
The proliferative effect of TNFa on B-cells is well known ( Cordingley et al .
, 1988 ; Jelinek and Lipsky , 1987 ; Kehrl et al .
, 1987 ) .
In vitro , EBV infection is associated with TNFa secretion ( Jochems et al .
, 1991 ; Klein et al .
, 1996 ; Sung et al .
, 1988 ) .
Our results suggest that TNFa could be a target gene of NF-xB in EBV-infected cells .
By protecting cells against TNFw-induced apoptosis , continuous NF-xB activation may therefore favour a synergy between EBV and TNFa in B-cell proliferation .

Transfection and cloning of cells Since LCLs are known to be refractory to stable transfection , a preliminary step has consisted of the analysing of cloning and transfection conditions of five different lymphoblastoid cell lines , that were homogeneous in terms of phenotype and NF-xB constitutive activity .
Transient transfection assays using the Biorad* electro-porator ( Biorad , Ivry/Seine , France ) with the PGL2-Luc plasmid ( which constitutively express the luciferase gene ) allowed us to optimize the electroporation conditions , that were 250 V and 960 uF with 10 ug of plasmid per 10 million cells .
Three out of the five LCLs tested ( PRI , F263 and 10847 ) appeared to be easy to transfect .
Furthermore , these three LCLs were easy to clone by limiting dilution .
Therefore , these three LCLs were stably transfected with the pCMV-IxBa ; » & , a construct and its control , the pecDNA3 plasmid .
After transfection , cells were resuspended in culture medium at 10° per ml and cultured 48 h without the selection antibiotic .
Cells were than plated at limiting dilution on two 96 wells plates and cultured with G418 antibiotic at 0.5 mg/ml .
Three series of transfection were done with both plasmid and the control pcDNA3 , which corresponds to 576 ensemenced well .
Thirty-five clones with pCMV-IxBa ; ; , ; , a and 30 clones with pcDNA3 were growing in selective conditions for the LCL PRI only .
Southern blot using the IxBa ; ; > 4 , a , cDNA as a probe evidenced the integration of the transgene cDNA in three out of the 33 clones transfected with the CMV-IxB « plasmid , named 9C4 , 9B8 and X9 .
Protein extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift assay Nuclear and cytosolic proteins were extracted in parallel from cells as previously described ( Feuillard et a/ .
, 1991 ) .
The xB oligonucleotide was purchased from Eurogenetec ( Serain , Belgium ) and corresponds to the tandem xB sequence ( PRE ) from the HIV LTR ( Korner et al .
, 1990 ; Wu et al .
, 1988 ) .
Gel shift experiment were performed with 20 ug of nuclear proteins as previously described ( Feuillard et al .
, 1991 ) .
Supershift experiments were performed as described ( Ferreira et a/ .
, 1998 ) and immune serum were diluted at 1/10 ( immune serum no 1141 for p50 , 1226 and 1207 for p65 , 1136 for c-Rel , 1267 for p52 and 1319 for RelB were generously gifted by N Rice , NCI , Frederick , USA ) .
Western blot Cytosolic proteins ( 50 ug ) were fractionated on a 10 % polyacrylamide gel by electrophoresis in denaturing condi- 1613 Roles of NF-xB activation in EBV-infected B-lymphocytes M Asso-Bonnet et al 1614 tions as previously described ( Ferreira et a/ .
, 1998 ) .
Briefly , after electrotransfer onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( Millipore , Bedford , MA , USA ) , and membrane saturation with gelatine , incubation was done with the mouse monoclonal antibody MAD 10B ( Jaffray et al .
, 1995 ) , a generous gift of R Hay ( University of St Andrews , St Andrews , UK ) diluted at 1/400 .
Revelation of the antigen/ antibody complex was performed using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse antibody ( Biorad , Ivry/ Seine , France ) , followed by chemiluminescent visualization ( ECL system , Amersham , Buckinghamshire , UK ) .
Immunolabelling and phenotypic analysis Antibodies used are listed in Table 1 .
The expression of cell surface molecules was assessed by direct and indirect immunofluorescence staining using a Coulter XL flow cytometer ( Coulter , Margency , France ) as previously described by Feuillard et al .
( 1995 ) .
Intracytoplasmic labelling of cytokines was performed as described ( Picker et a/ .
, 1995 ) .
Briefly , cultured cells were incubated with Brefeldin A ( Sigma , I'Isle d'Abeau Chesne , France ) at 10 ug/ml for 4 h at 37°C to allow intracytoplasmic accumulation of cytokines .
Cells were then washed twice in PBS and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde 15 min at 4°C in a dark room under continuous gentle stirring .
After washing in PBS , cells were permeabilized using a commercial reagent containing saponin ( Cytoperm B , Diaclone , Besangon France ) .
Each of the specific antibodies against cytokines were added to 10° cells at dilution indicated in Table 1 .
Incubation was performed for 30 min at 4°C in a dark room under continuous gentle stirring .
Cells were washed once in PBS with 0.5 % serum bovine albumin and 0.2 % saponin ( Sigma ) and then washed once in PBS alone .
Flow cytometry analysis was done on cells gated on the basis of their forward and 90° light scatter plot and negative controls consisted in irrelevant antibodies purchased from Coulter .
Latency of EBV in cells was assessed using immunocytochemistry by analysing the expression of EBNA1I , EBNA2 and LMP1 molecules .
Fifty thousand cells per slide were cytocentrifuged and air dried .
Cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for EBNA1 labelling and in acetone for EBNA2Z and LMP1I .
An indirect three stage immunoper-oxidase technique using the Vectastain kit ( Burlingame , CA , USA ) was performed according to the manufacturer 's procedure .
The biotinylated anti-mouse and anti-rat im-mune-serum were obtained from Vectastain and were used diluted at 1/150 .
The avidin peroxidase complex was used diluted at 1/125 .
Peroxidase reaction , which generates a brown labelling , was performed using di-amino-benzidine tablets ( Sigma ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Counterstaining was done with Harris Haematoxilin that stains nuclei in blue .
Control performed in parallel consisted of irrelevant mouse or rat monoclonal antibody .
Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis detection Analysis of cell cycle and detection of apoptosis was done after treatment of cells with TNFa ( Sigma ) at 10 ng/ml .
The cell cycle was analysed by flow cytometry after bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) incorporation and staining of DNA with propidium iodide as described ( Lowe et a/ .
, 1993 ) .
Briefly , cells were incubated 4 h with BrdU ( Sigma ) at 10 uM .
Cells were washed and fixed in ethanol , resuspended in 2 N HCl solution with 0.2 mg/ml pepsin for 30 min .
Neutralization was done with 0.1 M sodium borate .
Cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in PBS plus 2 % foetal calf serum and 0.5 % Tween 20 ( PTS ) .
BrdU incorporated in DNA was labelled with a FITC-conjugated antiBrdU antibody ( Boehringer , Meylan , France ) .

To eliminate cell aggregates from the analysis , flow cytometry analysis was done on cells gated on the basis of both their forward and 90° light scatter plot and the peak and the mean of the propidium iodide fluorescence scatter plot .
For apoptosis detection , 50 000 cells were cytocentrifuged on slides .
Apoptosis of cells was first recognized on the basis of cell morphology after May Griinwald Giemsa staining .
Apoptosis was confirmed by detection of DNA strand breaks using the TUNEL method , according to the instructions of the manufacturer ( Boehringer ) .
Percentage of apoptotic cells was estimated under fluorescence microscope by counting cells having DNA strand breaks .
