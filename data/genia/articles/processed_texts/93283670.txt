Expression of mRNA for the GATA-Binding Proteins in Human Eosinophils and Basophils : Potential Role in Gene Transcription By Leonard I. Zon , Yuji Yamaguchi , Karen Yee , Edward A. Albee , Akira Kimura , Joshua C. Bennett , Stuart H. Orkin , and Steven J. Ackerman The expression of the hematopoietic transcription factors GATA-1 , GATA-2 , and GATA-3 was studied in eosinophils and basophils .
Eosinophils express mRNA for GATA-1 , GATA-2 , and GATA-3 .
Basophils express GATA-2 and GATA-3 .
Treatment of HL-60 eosinophilic sublines with either interleukin-5 or butyric acid increased the expression of GATA-1 mRNA concomitant with the expression of OSINOPHILS and basophils are terminally differentiated cells that have been shown to mediate allergic and related immune responses and to act as effector cells in immunity to parasitic infections . ``
Despite their hematopoietic relationships , `` overlapping responses to certain cytokines ( eg , interleukin-3 [ IL-3 ] , IL-5 , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [ GM-CSF ] ) , and possible functional interactions , `` eosinophils and basophils each express a distinct cell-specific program .
Eosinophils contain a variety of unique cationic protein mediators of inflammation in their primary and secondary ( specific ) granules .
`` * These mediators include eosinophil peroxidase ( EPO ) , eosinophil major basic protein ( MBP ) , eosinophil cationic protein ( ECP ) , and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin ( EDN ) ( mRNA for EDN is also expressed in neutrophils , and is identical to liver ribonuclease ) . ``
The basophil program has not been as well defined as the eosinophil program .
One specific marker of the basophil lineage , the Bsp-1 cell-surface antigen , `` has been identified .
Basophils have also been shown to possess a unique phenotype , including certain activation-linked surface membrane pro-teins . ``
Interestingly , Charcot-Leyden crystal ( CLC ) pro-tein , '* a lysophospholipase ( EC 3.1.1.5 ) , is uniquely expressed in both eosinophils and basophils'* `` `` in comparable amounts . ``

Whereas GM-CSF and IL-3 each allow proliferation of eosinophil progenitors , IL-5 is more specifically involved in their differentiation and functional activation . ``
'' ' It has been recently shown that the 8 subunit of the IL-5 , GM-CSF , and IL-3 cytokine receptor complexes is shared and that these receptors show some functional cross-reactivity . ``
Plating of bone marrow cells in semisolid media containing IL-5 leads to the formation of colonies containing eosinophils . ``

MRNA FOR GATA-BINDING PROTEINS IN EOSINPHILS teins that contain a similar DNA-binding domain . ``
GATA-2 is expressed in mast cells , megakaryocytes , and erythroid cells , as well as a variety of other nonhematopoi-etic cells .
`` * `` `` GATA-3 is expressed in T cells , mast cells , and embryonic brain . ``
'' Functional analysis of several promoters of nonerythroid genes has shown a potential role for transcriptional regulation by the GATA-binding proteins .
The T-cell receptor « and 8 chain enhancers each contain a GATA site that regulates activity in T cells .
`` * `` `` The promoters of the megakaryocytic-specific genes , platelet factor 4 , gplb , and gpllb , contain GATA sites . ``
'' Disruption of the GATA site in the gpllb promoter disrupts function of the promoter in erythroid/megakaryocytic cells . ``
The mast-cell carboxypeptidase A promoter contains a GATA site , the mutation of which disrupts the function of this promoter in mast cells . ``
In this study , we have shown the expression of the GATA-binding proteins in the eosinophil and basophil lineages .
Taken together with previous results , `` `` this study provides a more complete analysis of the pattern of expression of these proteins in all of the peripheral blood lineages .
Ad-ditionally , these studies suggest that the level of the GATA proteins is developmentally regulated during eosinophil maturation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells and cell lines .
- K562 , Jurkat , and HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD ) .
Eosinophils were isolated and enriched from patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome ( HES ) by leukopheresis , dextran sedimentation to remove red blood cells , and separation over gradients of Ficoll-Hypaque ( Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) as previously de-scribed .
* `` `` Eosinophils were also obtained from the peritoneal dialysate of a patient with eosinophilia secondary to allergic hypersensi-tivity ; cell preparations contained 80 % eosinophils and 20 % macrophages .
The peritoneal eosinophils were of the hypodense activated phenotype ( density , < 1.077 g/mL ) and were not purified further .
Basophils were obtained from the peripheral blood of a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) in blast crisis with associated basophilia likewise by separation over a cushion of Ficoll-Hypaque . ``
This cell population contained 43 % mature basophils without any eosinophils , with the remainder of the cells being monocytes and lymphocytes .
Neutrophils were isolated from normal donor peripheral blood by sedimentation through a cushion of Ficoll-Hypaque .
Neutrophils were 96 % pure , with the remainder of the cells being eosinophils .
The HL-60 ( 3+C-5 ) * cell line was a generous gift of Dr David Golde ( University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , Oncology Division , Philadelphia , PA ) and the HL-60 ( C15 ) cell line was a generous gift of Dr Steven Fischkoff ( Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center , New York , NY ) .
Cell differentiation .
- HL-60 eosinophilic sublines were induced with either butyric acid ( 0.5 mmol/L ) ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) or B-cell growth factor-II ( BCGF-II ; Cellular Products Inc , Buffalo , NY ) 10 % ( vol/vol ) as a source of IL-5 .
Cells were harvested in log phase , washed twice in RPMI-1640 , resuspended at 2 X 10° cells/ mL , and cultured for 1 to 7 days in complete medium ( RPMI 1640 containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ) supplemented with butyrate or IL-5 .
Control inductions consisted of medium lacking IL-5 or , for butyrate induction , medium containing 0.1 % ethanol .
Similar results have been obtained using recombinant murine IL-5 ( data not shown ) .
At various time points , cells were counted by trypan-blue 3235 dye exclusion and cytospin preparations were stained with Wright's-Giemsa .
Northern blot analysis .
- Total RNA was prepared from different populations of cells by the guanidium isothiocyanate method . ``
RNA ( 10 to 20 ug/lane ) was denatured in formamide/formalde-hyde and electrophoresed in 1 % agarose/formaldehyde gels .
After electrophoresis , RNA was transferred to Magnagraph ( Micron Separations Inc , MA ) or Hybond-N ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) nylon membranes , and the blots probed with radiolabeled cDNAs encoding human GATA-L , `` GATA-2 , ° GATA-3 , `` CLC pro-tein , `` ECP , * and either a # -actin®* or 288 ribosomal RNA probe `` or an oligonucleotide specific for 288 RNA to confirm equivalent RNA loading .
All hybridizations were performed with random-primed cDNA probes at 42°C for 18 hours in 50 % formamide , 5 % SSC , 2x Denhardt 's buffer , 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , and blots were successively washed to 0.2 x SSC , 0.1 % SDS at 65°C .
Autoradiography was performed with Kodak XAR-5 film ( East-man Kodak , Rochester , NY ) .
Detection of GATA-1 mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) .
- Oligonucleotide PCR primers for human GATA-L and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) ®® ( for use as an internal standard ) were synthesized on an ABI Model 391 DNA synthesizer ( Applied Biosystems , Inc , Foster City , CA ) .
Total cellular RNA ( 1 Lg ) for each sample was reverse-transcribed in a total volume of 20 gL in buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl , pH 8.3 , 75 mmol/L KCI , 3 mmol/L MgCl ; , 10 mmol/L dithiothreitol , a 10 mmol/L dNTP mixture , 100 pmol random hexamer oligonucleotides ( Promega , Madison , WI ) , and 7.5 U of AMV reverse transcriptase ( Promega ) .
The cDNA was then amplified with 1 U of Vent DNA polymerase ( New England Biolabs , Beverly , MA ) and two pairs of oligonucleotide primers , one set each for GATA-1 ( 5-GGAGCCCTCTCAGCTCAGC-3 ; -GCCACCAGCTGGTCCTTCAG-3 ) and GAPDH ( 5-CCA-TGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3 ; 5-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATG-ACC-3 ' ) .
After 25 cycles on a thermocycler ( Perkin-Elmer Cetus , Norwalk , CT ) ( each PCR cycle included denaturation at 94°C for 1 minute , annealing at 55°C for 2 minutes , and extension at 72°C for 2 minutes ) , the PCR products were analyzed by separation on a 5 % acrylamide gel and transferred onto nylon membranes ( Hybond N ; Amersham ) .
Membranes were hybridized sequentially with ran-dom-primed P-labeled cDNA probes for human GATA-1 and human GAPDH at 65°C in 50 % formamide , 6x SSC , 5 % Den-hardt 's , 0.5 % SDS .
Filters were washed twice in 2 % SSC , 0.2 % SDS at 55°C for 30 minutes and 0.2 % SSC , 0.2 % SDS at 60°C for 60 minutes and exposed to film for 1 to 6 hours using a single intensifying screen .
Blots were scanned using a Hewlett-Packard Scanjet He and GATA-1 to GAPDH ratios quantitated using Molecular Dynamics ( Sunnyvale , CA ) Imagequant software .
RESULTS Northern blot analysis showed that GATA-1 mRNA was highly expressed in eosinophils ( Fig .
1 , lanes 1 through 3 ) , whereas expression was weak or undetectable in samples of basophil or neutrophil mRNA ( lanes 4 and 5 ) .
Of note , a larger 2.2-kb mRNA in each eosinophil sample also hybridized with the GATA-1 cDNA probe ( Fig 1 , lanes 1 through 3 ) .
This RNA species was not detected in HL-60 eosinophilic sublines C15 or 3+C-5 , nor in K562 RNA ( lanes 6 through 9 and 12 ) .
Based on the stringent hybridization conditions used for the Northern blot analysis , this 2.2-kb mRNA is less likely to represent mRNA for another cross-hybridizing GATA-binding protein in eosinophils , but could indicate potential alternative splicing or polyadenyla- From www .

tion of GATA-1 .
In contrast to GATA-1 , GATA-2 mRNA was abundantly expressed in eosinophils , basophils , and neutrophils .
GATA-3 mRNA was expressed in eosinophils and basophils , albeit at a lower level than GATA-1 , and not at all in neutrophils .
The eosinophil preparations ( Fig 1 , lanes 1 and 2 ) were approximately 70 % pure , with the remainder of cells being neutrophils .
Because neutrophils express little or no GATA-1 or GATA-3 , their presence as a contaminant is inconsequential .
The eosinophil preparation in lane 3 was 80 % pure , with the remainder of the cells being macrophages .
Because the level of GATA-binding proteins in highly purified macrophages has not been deter-mined , their presence in this cell preparation may or may not contribute to the detected levels of GATA-1 , GATA-2 , or GATA-3 RNA .
GATA-2 mRNA expression detected in these eosinophil samples could be due in part to GATA-2 mRNA expression from neutrophils or macrophages .
Different preparations of basophils gave trace expression of GATA-1 mRNA and variable expression of GATA-2 mRNA ( data not shown ) .
GATA-3 mRNA expression detected in the basophils could partially be due to low numbers of T lymphocytes in the preparations .
Thus , similar to other hematopoietic lineages , the granulocytic lineages ( eo-sinophils , basophils , and neutrophils ) express varying levels of mRNA for the GATA-binding proteins .
ZON ET AL To determine whether GATA-1 , GATA-2 , or GATA-3 expression was developmentally regulated in the eosinophil lineage , we used two HL-60 sublines that can be induced to differentiate toward the eosinophil lineage .
GATA-1 was not detectable by Northern blot analysis in uninduced HL-60 ( 3+C-5 ) cells ( Fig 1 , lane 8 ) .
However , after 3 days of induction with IL-5 , the cells expressed low levels of GATA1 mRNA ( lane 9 ) .
GATA-2 mRNA expression was both greater and relatively constant in this cell line after treatment with IL-5 ( Fig 1 , lanes 8 and 9 ) , whereas GATA-3 mRNA was not expressed ( Fig 1 , lanes 8 and 9 ) .
Because of the low levels of GATA-1 mRNA detectable by Northern blot analysis in the HL-60 ( 3+C-5 ) cells , quantitative RT-PCR amplification of GATA-1 RNA transcripts was used to study expression in this cell line .
These analyses showed that GATA-1 mRNA levels were undetectable in uninduced HL-60 ( 3+C-5 ) cells 1 day after the addition of fresh medium , then increased by day 3 , and decreased by day 5 ( Fig 2 ) .
In contrast , a more pronounced increase in the GATA-1 level was evident after IL-5 induction by day 3 , and the level increased further by day 5 .
No GATA-1 was detected in RNA from HeLa cells or in a control sample without template ( no RNA ) .
The level of GATA-1 expressed after IL-5 induction was a fraction of that expressed in K562 cells .
The level of mRNA for CLC protein , a marker of eosinophil differentiation , significantly increased on days 3 and 5 ( Fig 3 ) .

mRNA FOR GATA-BINDING PROTEINS IN EOSINPHILS I..— DAY 1 U IL-5 Fig 3 .
- Northern blot analysis of mRNA for CLC protein expressed in HL-60 ( 3+C-5 ) cells induced with IL-5 .
The eosinophil-committed subline of HL-60 ( clone 3 +C-5 ) was grown in the absence ( lanes 1 , 3 , and 5 ) or presence ( lanes 2 , 4 , and 6 ) of 10 % BCGF-II as a source of IL-5 for up to 72 hours .
Total RNA was obtained at day 1 , 3 , and 5 of culture .
The Northern blot containing 10 ug of total RNA from cells at each time point was simultaneously hybridized with a *°P-labeled 529-bp cDNA fragment encompassing the entire coding plus 5 ' untranslated region of the CLC cDNA and a 2-kb fragment of chicken # -actin cDNA as a control for RNA loading .
EDN have been shown to increase in the HL-60 3+C-5 line induced with BCGF-II as a source of IL-5.°38 As shown in Fig 4 , butyrate induction of the HL-60 ( C15 ) subline resulted in the formation of granules by day 3 , consistent with differentiation towards the eosinophil lineage .
Compared with the IL-5 induction of HL-60 ( 3+C-5 ) , which does not induce any significant morphologic differentiation , a more pronounced induction of GATA-1 ( Fig 1 , lanes 6 and 7 , and Fig 5B ) and GATA-3 ( Fig 1 , lanes 6 and 7 ) mRNA expression was seen in the HL-60 ( C15 ) subline after butyrate treatment .
The upper band in the GATA-3 hybridization seen in lanes 6 and 7 , which was not evident in Jurkat cells ( lane 10 ) , likely represents potential alternative processing or polyadenylation of GATA-3 , rather than mRNA for another cross-hybridizing GATA-binding protein .
The size of this transcript is identical to GATA-2 , but is unlikely to represent GATA-2 expression because other m A | B 3237 HL-60 ( 3+C5 ) -- DAY 3 DAY 5 U IL-5 - U L-S5 RNA samples that expressed GATA-2 did not hybridize to the GATA-3 probe ( lanes 5 , 8 , and 9 ) .
GATA-2 mRNA was constitutively expressed in both eosinophilic sublines of HL-60 ( Fig 1 , lanes 6 through 9 ) .
It is noteworthy that the level of GATA-2 mRNA is substantially higher than that expressed in the uninduced parental HL-60 cell line ( ATCC CCL-240 ) .
`` > `` As a marker of the eosinophilic differentiation of this HL-60 subline , ECP RNA transcripts , which were evident in the uninduced cells ( day 0 ) , were significantly increased by days 1 to 3 ( Fig 5A ) .
The levels of mRNA for CLC protein were similarly induced in the HL-60 C15 subline ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION The GATA-binding proteins are expressed at different levels in the eosinophil and basophil lineages .
In addition , the level of these transcription factors varies substantially in Fig 4 .

Induced expression of GATA-1 and ECP mRNA in HL-60-C15 cells .
( A ) Northern blot analysis for ECP mRNA in HL-60-C15 cells induced with 0.5 mmol/L butyric acid for 7 days .
Total RNA was obtained from the cells at the indicated time points .
The blot containing total RNA ( 20 ug/lane ) from cells at each time point was probed sequentially with cDNA probes for ECP and a 28S ribosomal RNA probe used to ensure equivalent loading in all lanes .
The decrease in ECP mRNA at 7 days likely reflects decreased cell viability in the cultures .
( B ) Northern blot analysis for GATA-1 mRNA expression in the eosinophilic HL-60-C15 induced with butyric acid .
Controls included RNA from the erythroleukemia cell line K562 and from HeLa cells .
two cell lines that can be induced to express eosinophil-specific genes .
The relative expression level of GATA-1 and GATA-3 in the HL-60 C15 cell line was substantially higher than in the 3+C-5 cell line .
These cell lines likely represent two stages of differentiation of the eosinophil lineage .
The induction conditions for the two cell lines differs ; C15 is inducible with butyrate , but not inducible with IL-5 .
The 3+C-5 line is inducible with IL-5 , but not butyrate ( Yama-guchi and Ackerman , unpublished observations ) .
Likewise , the formation of granules is more prominent in the C15 cell ZON ET AL inductions , whereas no morphologic changes occur with IL-5 induction of 3+C-5 cells .
The different induction conditions could account for the differences in the expression of the GATA-binding proteins .
These studies have examined the level of RNA expression for the GATA-binding pro-teins ; studies of these transcription factors at the protein level await the availability of specific antisera .
Preliminary results based on Western blot analysis with antisera directed to GATA-1 suggest that GATA-1 RNA levels correlate with protein level during erythroid development ( Zon , unpublished results ) .
Because we have shown that the level of GATA-1 and GATA-3 mRNA is upregulated during the induction of one or both of the HL-60 eosinophilic cell lines ( Figs 1 , 2 , and 5B ) , the expression of these proteins may be developmentally regulated during normal eosinophil differentiation and have functional relevance to gene expression by the eosinophil lineage .
This study of the granulocytic lineages , taken together with previous findings , `` `` * ' provides a more complete analysis of the expression of the known GATA-binding proteins in the committed peripheral blood cell lineages .
The hematopoietic lineages express GATA-binding proteins as fol-lows : GATA-1 in erythroid , megakaryocyte , mast cell , and eosinophil lineages ; GATA-2 in mast cell , basophil , eosinophil , neutrophil , megakaryocyte , and erythroid lineages ; and GATA-3 in T-cell , mast-cell , eosinophil , and , possibly , basophil lineages .
Preliminary studies of enriched monocytes indicate that GATA-2 is expressed in this lineage , although conclusive evidence awaits analyses of more highly purified preparations .
Of note , there is overlap of lineage expression , and particular lineages favor high level expression of one of the factors , ie , GATA-1 in erythroid cells , GATA-2 in mast cells , and GATA-3 in T cells .
In the eosinophil , it appears that GATA-1 and GATA-2 expression predominates over GATA-3 .
Because each of these factors binds to a core GATA sequence , it is possible that during the development of each hematopoietic lineage , a GATA site in the promoter or enhancer of a particular gene may be contacted and activated by distinct GATA-binding proteins .
Preferential binding to particular GATA sites based on different affinities to flanking sequences could specify which GATA-binding protein activates an individual promoter in vivo .
GATA-1 , GATA-2 , and GATA-3 are likely to function as transcriptional activators in granulocytic cells , similar to their role in erythroid cells .
Two mechanisms in erythroid cells function to maintain lineage survival .
First , GATA-1 is capable of positive autoregulation through a tandem GATA site in its own promoter . ``
Second , GATA-1 regulates the erythropoietin receptor promoter , `` allowing a proliferative signal to occur in the presence of erythropoietin , which prevents programmed cell death .
Because IL-5 is capable of inducing the expression of GATA-1 and GATA-2 , the genes for these transcription factors may be directly responsive to the action of IL-5 .
IL-5 , which prevents apoptosis in mature eosinophils , `` may additionally function to maintain the GATA-1 autoregulatory loop in eosinophils , similar to the function of erythropoietin in erythroid cells .
The IL-5 receptor may be similarly regulated by the GATA-binding From www .

mRNA FOR GATA-BINDING PROTEINS IN EOSINPHILS proteins .
In this regard , butyrate induction has been shown to induce the expression of high-affinity receptors for IL-5 in the C15 eosinophilic subline of HL-60 . ``
'' GATA-1 expression is activated in the HL-60 subline , 3+C-5 , with the addition of fresh medium after log phase growth ; induction with IL-5 in this cell line appears to increase and prolong the expression of GATA-1 mRNA .
This may represent effects of cell-cycle-dependent initiation of GATA-1 expression , a process that has recently been described in synchronized differentiation of purified hematopoietic progenitors to either the erythroid or granulocytic lineages . ``
Studies of eosinophil gene transcription have not yet defined functional cell-specific regulatory elements .
However , based on the expression of the GATA-binding proteins in the lineage , it is likely that some eosinophil-specific genes will be regulated by these factors , similar to the a and 8 receptor in T cells , mast cell-carboxypeptidase A ( MC-CPA ) in mast cells , gpllb in megakaryocytes , or the globins in erythroid cells .
In this regard , the 5 putative promoter regions of four of the five eosinophil granule protein genes that have been cloned ( MBP , `` `` ECP `` [ Ackerman , Dvorak , Tenen , unpublished data ) , EDN , `` * and CLC protein [ Go-molin , Yamaguchi , Paulpillai , Dvorak , Ackerman , and Tenen , submitted ] ) each contain potential target GATA-binding sites .
Further functional analyses will be required to determine whether these sites are required for the eosinophil-specific gene regulation of these promoters .
