An Intricate Arrangement of Binding Sites for the Ets Family of Transcription Factors Regulates Activity of the « 4 Integrin Gene Promoter* ( Received for publication , November 30 , 1993 , and in revised form , March 3 , 1994 ) Glenn D. Rosent§ , Jennifer L. Barks } , Michael F. Iademarcoj } 1 , Robert J. Fisher| , and Douglas C. Deant** From the { Departments of Medicine and Cell Biology , Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis , Missouri 63110 and the |Program Resources Inc./DynCorp , Frederick , Maryland 21701 o4 integrins mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions that are critical for maturation and function of the immune system as well as differentiation of skeletal muscle .
Here we examine molecular mechanisms controlling the pattern of « 4 expression .
The activity of constructs containing 5 deletion mutants of the a4 gene promoter was compared in transfection assays into cell lines that express a4 and cell lines that do not .
The sequence between position -42 and -76 base pairs ( bp ) was required for efficient transcription in cells that express a4 , but it showed no activity in HeLa cells , which do not express « 4 .
Three binding sites for the Ets family of transcription factors are found in this region : two adjacent sites at positions -50 and -54 bp and a more 5 ' site at position -67 bp .
Using a series of constructs containing deletions and mutations in this re-gion , we found that the 3'-most site alone was sufficient for binding GA-binding protein « ( GABP « ) /GABPG and for a low level of transcriptional activation .
When all three sites were present , a second complex `` a `` was de-tected , which contains an unknown member of the Ets family .
Formation of complex a was cell-type specific and correlated with a high level of transcription .
Deletion of the 5'-most Ets site had no effect on binding to GABPa « /GABPB , but it eliminated a. Concomitant with this loss of a , a new Ets-l-containing complex `` c `` ap-peared .
Complex c substituted efficiently for complex a in transcriptional activation .
We conclude that although neither of the two 5'-most Ets sites alone binds nuclear protein , they appear to act as modulators which control the pattern of Ets proteins that bind the a4 gene promoter .
This arrangement of Ets sites , coupled with the tissue- and developmental-specific expression of Ets members , likely play a key role in defining the pattern of a4 integrin .
a4B1 is a member of the integrin family that mediates both cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions ( reviewed in * This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants AR41908 and HL 43418 and by a Career Investigator Award from the American Lung Association ( to D.

Hemler , 1990 ) .
For cell-extracellular matrix interactions , « 4681 binds to the CS1 domain of the extracellular matrix protein , fibronectin ( Wayner , et al .
, 1989 ; Guan and Hynes , 1990 ; Mould et al .
, 1990 ) .
Expression of fibronectin is up-regulated in inflammation and tissue injury ( Macarak et al .
, 1989 ; Lazenby et al .
, 1990 ; Walle et al .
, 1990 ; Kang et al .
, 1991 ; Kang and Williams , 1991 ) .
Therefore , the interaction between « 481 , which is present on T-cells , B-cells , monocytes , basophils , and eosi-nophils ( reviewed in Hemler ( 1990 ) ) with fibronectin may be important for targeting these cells to sites of inflammation and injury .
For cell-cell interactions , « 481 binds vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) , ' which appears on the surface of endothelial cells in response to inflammation ( Osborn et al .
, 1989 ; Elices et al .
, 1990 ; Rice et al .
, 1990 ) .
This interaction of « 461 on immune cells with VCAM-1 on endothelial cells then targets immune cells to sites of inflammation .
The a4B1-VCAM-1-me-diated recruitment of immune cells is thought to be important in diseases such as asthma ( Walsh et al .
, 1991 ) , arthritis ( Laffon et al .
, 1991 ) , atherosclerosis ( Cybulsky and Gimbrone , 1991 ) , and autoimmune encephalompyelitis ( Yednock et al .
, 1992 ) .
In addition to B1 , a4 can associate with a second integrin subunit , B7 ( Erle et al .
, 1991 ; Neuhaus et al .
, 1991 ; Yuan et al .
, 1991 ; Ruegg et al .
, 1992 ) .
« 487 is expressed on lymphoid cells , and recent studies show that « 487 binds to the mucosal vascular addressin , MAdCAM-1 , on high endothelial cells of Peyer 's patches in the small intestine ( Berlin et al .
, 1993 ; Briskin et al .
, 1998 ) .
The interaction between a48B7 and MAd-CAM-1 is thought to mediate homing of lymphocytes to Peyer 's patches .
These properties described above suggest a key role for o4 integrins in immune function .
In addition to the immune system , we have found that a4 is expressed in a developmentally regulated pattern in several developing tissues , and we have recently demonstrated a role for « 481 and VCAM-1 in skeletal muscle differentiation ( Rosen et al .
, 1992 ) .
Therefore , the role of « 4 integrin appears to extend beyond the immune system .
We are interested in molecular events controlling the pattern of a4 integrin expression .
Thus , we have cloned the 5'-flanking region of the o4 gene and shown that it acts as a promoter with the proper cell type specificity ( Rosen et al .
, 1991 ) .
Using « 4 gene promoter deletion mutants , we show here in a series of transfection assays that a4 gene expression is dependent upon binding sites for Ets transcription factors .
Ets is a family of proteins that shares a conserved DNA binding domain ( Karim et al .
, 1990 ) .
They bind a core GGAA motif and have been ' The abbreviations used are : VCAM-1 , vascular cell adhesion mol-ecule-1 ; CAT , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ; GABP , GA-binding protein ; bp , base pair ( s ) ; PCR , polymerase chain reaction .
15652 Control of « 4 Integrin Expression by the Ets Family shown to activate transcription of several promoters , including Ick ( Leung , 1993 ) , stromelysin ( Wasylyk , et al .
, 1991 ) , collagen-ase ( Gutman and Wasylyk et al .
, 1990 ) , cytochrome c oxidase ( Carter et al .
, 1992 ) , the Moloney virus long terminal repeat ( Wang et al .
, 1992 ) , the SV40 enhancer ( Klemsz et al .
, 1990 ) , and the long terminal repeat of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 and -2 ( Bosselut et al .
, 1990 ; Leiden et al .
, 1992 ) .
Ets-1 was the first described member of the family ( Gegonne et al .
, 1987 ; Watson et al .
, 1988 ) .
It was originally discovered through its relationship to the v-ets transforming oncogene of the avian retrovirus E26 , which causes leukemia .
The expanding family now includes Ets-2 ( Boulykos et al .
, 1988 ) , erg ( Reddy et al .
, 1987 ) , elk-1 and elk-2 ( Rao et al .
, 1989 ) , spil/PU-1 ( Klemsz et al .
, 990 ) , fli-1 ( Ben-David et al .
, 1991 ) , elf-1 ( Leiden et al .
, 1992 ) , the Drosophila E74A and E74B proteins ( Burtis et al .
, 1990 ) , and the a subunit of the GA-binding protein ( GABP ) ( LaMarco et al .
, 1991 ) .
Although they recognize a common core of GGAA , members of the Ets family preferentially bind to different sites ( Wang et al .
, 1992 ) , suggesting that this specificity is conferred by the sequence flanking the GGAA core .
Ets members can cooperate with other transcription factors .
For example , Ets-1 can cooperate with c-Fos and c-Jun to increase the activity of the polyoma virus enhancer ( Wasylyk et al .
, 1990 ) .
Other potentially important interactions have been described between elk-1 and serum response factor ( Hipskind et al .
, 1991 ) , E74 and the ecdysone receptor ( Koelle et al .
, 1991 ) , E74 and E75 ( Feigl et al .
, 1989 ; Segraves and Hogness , 1990 ) , PU.1 and the retinoblastoma protein ( Hagemeier et al .
, 1993 ) , EIf-1 and the retinoblastoma protein ( Wang et al .
, 1993 ) , PU.1 and TFIID ( Hagemeier et al .
, 1993 ) , and GABPa and GABPB ( Thompson et al .
, 1991 ) .
Ankyrin repeats can mediate interactions between Ets proteins and other transcription factors .
Studies of ankyrin , a component of red blood cell membranes that has 22 such repeats , indicate that these repeats have a role in protein-proteins interactions ( Lux et al .
, 1990 ) .
Recent experiments have shown that the Ets domain of GABPa interacts with the 33-amino acid ankyrin repeats of forming a complex that contacts DNA more stably than the a subunit alone ( Thompson et al .
, 1991 ) .
Ankyrin repeats have also been found in other regulatory proteins including the NF- « B/rel family ( Blank et al .
, 1992 ) , Notch in Drosophila , and glp-1 and lin-12 in Caenorh-abditis elegans ( Greenwald , 1985 ; Wharton et al .
, 1985 ; Kidd et al .
, 1986 ; Yochem et al .
, 1988 ; Austin and Kimble , 1989 ; Yochem and Greenwald , 1989 ) , suggesting that these motifs could also be important for mediating interactions between other sets of transcription factors .
Here , we show that a4 gene transcription is controlled by an intricate interaction between three Ets sites in the promoter .
Using a series of deletions and point mutations , we characterize the activity of these sites and correlate this activity to the interaction with members of the Ets family .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture and DNA Transfections-The T-cell line , Jurkat , and the B-cell line , Raji , were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute media ( RPMI ) ( 1640 ) containing 10 % fetal calf serum .
Cells were transfected by electroporation with a BTX Transfector 300 ( BTX , San Diego , CA ) as described ( Birkenmeier et al .
, 1991 ) .
Approximately 1 x 10 cells were suspended in 0.1 ml of RPMI media containing HeBS ( 20 mx Hepes , 140 mm NaC ) , 5.0 my KCl , 0.7 myx Na , HPO , , and 6.0 mm dex-trose ) , salmon sperm DNA at 1.25 ug/ml , and 30 ug of plasmid DNA and subjected to electroporation at 225 V and 950 uF .
The rhabdomyosarcoma cell line , RD , and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum and transfected using the calcium phosphate method as described previously ( Dean et al .
, 1989 ) .
Two ug of pRSV/L , which contains the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat fused to the firefly luciferase gene ( de Wet et al .
, 1987 ) , was included as an internal control in transfection assays , and 15653 equal amounts of luciferase activity were added to each CAT reaction .
Luciferase assays were done using a bioluminometer ( Analytical Biolu-minescence Laboratory , San Diego , CA ) as described ( de Wet et al .
, 1987 ) .
Thirty-six h after transfection , protein extracts were made , and CAT activity was determined as described previously ( Dean et al .
, 1989 ) .
CAT assays with extracts from Jurkat cells contained approximately 200 ug of protein , and reactions were for 16 h. Acetylation of [ '*CJchloramphenicol was quantified by thin layer chromatography followed by scintillation counting ( Rosen et al .
, 1991 ) .
Plasmid Construction-To create -2.0 a4CAT , the « 4 genomic clone , pa4-4.3 ( Rosen et al .
, 1991 ) , was digested with Sail ( position -2003 bp ) and Nhel ( position ~200 bp ) , and the resulting fragment was li-gated into the ~400a4 CAT construct ( Rosen et al .
, 1991 ) , which had also been digested with Sall and NAeL .
This portion of the a4 gene 5'-flanking region was sequenced as described previously ( Rosen et al .
, 1991 ) .
Both strands were completely sequenced .
-2.004CAT was then used as a template for PCR reactions to generate a series of 5 ' deletion mutants in the a4 promoter .
The following are 5 ' primers used for each construct : -1200a44CAT ( 5-CGATCTCGAGGGCTAAAACTTAAC-CCATCCA-3 ' ) , 1000a4CAT ( 5'-CGATCTCGAGGAGCTGAGCGAGA-CAAATTC-3 ' ) , 800a4CAT ( 5'-CGATCTCGAGATCTCTCTTTAAGTGT-TCCTTA-3 ' ) , 600a4CAT ( 5-CGATCTCGAGCTGTCATTAGTGTCAG-ATGTG-3 ' ) , 400a4CAT ( 5'-CGATCTCGAGAAGGCAGGGCACACCTG-GATTG-3 ' ) , 200a4CAT ( 5'-CGATCTCGAGCGTTAAATGTGAATCAAGT-CACAG-3 ' ) , 120a44CAT - ( 5-CGATCTCGAGTCAGCCTGAGAGGCT GCTGCT-3 ' ) , 76e4CAT ( 5'-CGATCTCGAGGCTGCAGAGGAAGTGTG-GGGAGG-3 ' ) , and 42a44CAT ( 5'-CGATCTCGAGGTATAGAAGGGT-GCTGAGATGTGG-3 ' ) .
Numbers in the construct name indicate the amount of 5'-flanking region present ; an Xho I site ( underlined ) was included on the 5 end of each primer for cloning purposes .
A common 3 ' primer extending to position +15 bp and containing a HindIII site ( underlined ) on its 5 ' end was used in each PCR reaction ( 5'-CAC-GAAGCTTGACAAAGACGT TATGGCTATTC-3 ' ) .
PCR products were digested with Xhol and HindIII and cloned into pSKCAT-Pst/Bam ( Rosen et al .
, 1991 ) , which had been digested with the same enzymes .
Constructs were sequenced to insure that errors did not occur during PCR .
Complementary double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the three consensus Ets sites in the a4 gene promoter from position ~42 to -76 bp ( 5'-AGCTTGGCTGCAGAGGAAGTG TGGGGAGGAAGGAAGT-GGGA-3 ' ) were synthesized such that after annealing , HindIII sites are present on each end .
Nucleotides contributing to HindIII sites are underlined .
Annealed oligonucleotides were cloned into pTACAT ( Weintraub and Dean , 1992 ) , a minimal promoter construct containing the SV40 early gene TATA box driving the CAT gene , which had been digested with HindIII to create pTA ( -42/-76 ) CAT ; the HindIII site is located immediately upstream of the TATA box .
The same strategy was used to construct plasmids containing only the two 3'-most Ets sites at positions -54 and -50 bp in the « 4 gene promoter ( 5'-AGCTTGTGT-GGGGAGGAAGGAAGTGGGA-3 ' ; pTA ( -42/-63 ) CAT ] and the 5'-most Ets site at position -67 bp [ 5-AGCTTTGCAGAGGAAGTA-3 ' ; pTA ( -62/ ~73 ) CAT ] .
Mutations were made in the region between position -42 and -76 bp to generate mutant I ( M I ) ( 5'-AGCTTGTGTGGGGAAGAAA-GAAGTGGGA-3 ' ) , M II ( 5-AGCTTGTGTGGGGAGGAAAGAAGTG-GGA-3 ) , and M III ( 5'-AGCTT GTGTGGGTATGAAGGAAGTGGGA-3 ' ) .
Mutated nucleotides are in bold , and nucleotides contributing to HindIII sites are underlined .
Gel Retardation Assays-Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from Jurkat and HeLa cell lines were prepared using a modified Dig-nam protocol ( Dignam et al .
, 1983 ) .
Briefly , 1 x 10° cells were harvested and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline .
The pelleted cells were re-suspended in 15 ml of lysis buffer ( 20 mm Hepes ( pH 6.8 ) , 5 mm KCl , 5 mm MgCl , , 0.25 m sucrose , 0.05 % Nonidet P-40 , 4 mm phenylmethylsul-fonyl fluoride , and 10 mm dithiothreitol ) .
Cells were lysed using a Dounce homogenizer , and nuclear proteins were extracted in a solution of 20 mm Hepes ( pH 7.9 ) , 20 % glycerol , 0.35 KCl , 0.1 my EGTA , 0.5 mym EDTA , 0.01 % aprotinin , 0.01 % leupeptin , and 4 mm phenylmethylsul-fonyl fluoride .
Single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed in 10 my KCl , then purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
Gel-purified double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled on their 5 ' ends with °P using polynucleotide kinase and used as probes in gel retardation assays .
For gel retardation assays , nuclear extract was incubated with P-labeled probe for 30 min on ice in 4 % glycerol , 1 mm EDTA , 5 mm dithiothreitol , 10 mm Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) , 100 ug/ml bovine serum albu-min , and 2 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) .
Where indicated , 1 nl of anti-Ets antibody was preincubated with the nuclear extract for 30 min prior to addition of P-labeled probe in the gel retardation assays .
When antibodies were included , the dithiothreitol content of the binding buffer was reduced to 15654 Human~- ++ ee os Mouse- CCAGCAC TTGCCTCCTG CTCCAGCGT o 6 s e a e e ae e ese ese ce es se + e 66 ee se es G s 0 ee e ee 0 sesee cee « ee « e e see a « e # Control of « 4 Integrin Expression by the Ets Family TCGATCAGAG AGATAGCAGT ATCTTCAGTT TTTTTTAAAG CAACATGAAA CACACTTTAT TCCTGCTAAC ATTAGGAAAA GCGAGCTGTT -1904 TTCCAAGCCC TGGAGGAAGG AAATTCAGCT AACTAACGTG AGGTAATGTA GGGTGGCTAT TTCTTGAAAG GTAGTGAATC ATAACTATAA CCATACTATG -1804 GAAAAAAGTC CTGCCTTACC AACCACTCCA CTGACTGCTT GTCACCAAAA CTACGCTATG AAACGAATTG TGTTGAGTGG CTTTCATTGT AAAAGATTTT -1704 GCTGAAGGGA GGCAAAGAAA CTGGTAGGGG TTCAGATCAG AAGATCTGGC TTPGCCAGTPT TCTGGAGGGT GTCAGAATGG CTTCAACATA CCTACTTCCT -1604 TGGCCTCAAC TGGAGGTTTT GTAGCTGTAA ACAAGCAAGCA TTGCATAGTT CAGAATAACG ACACTGTAAG CTCATTGTGS AACTGGGTTA AAATCAGCAT -1504 GTAGATCTAC TAAGAAAGAA ACACACTCAG CACTACTACA GAAAGAAACA GCCATGGGCC CTGATTGTTA GCTTTCTGGA AGCCATTTCA TTTTTACAAT -1404 AGATTTATCA CACACTGTAT TGACTTTTTC CAGTATAGAG TAAGAGAAAG TTAATATTCC TCATGTTTTG TCTGTTGACA GACTGAAAAT AATTGCATTG -1304 AGTTTGGCTA GAATATCCTG TCATTCCATA AACATCTCAA ACTCCACATG GCTAAAACTT AACCCATCCA TGCCCCCATC TGCATGCACA CATACATGCA -1204 TATAACTTCA TTTCTCAGTG TTTTTTTCTC CATGAATGGT AGCACCATTC TCTTTCAAGA AAGAGAAATA CTTCCCCTTG GGATTATCCT ATCTCTACTT -1104 ATTGCTGCAG GGGCTTCCAA AATTAGGTTT TCTGTGTTCA GTCTTGCATT CACACTTCTG AAACCCAGAG CTGACCGAGA CAAATTCTTC AACTTCCTGT -1004 CAGTCCCAAC ATAGATTTAA AATTCCTAAC CTGGCTCATG AGGTTCACCA TGTATTCCTG CTTCCCTAAG TCAGCCTCAT ATCACACCAA CCTGTGTore | -904 GAGTGGCTAA ATACTCTAGC CAGGCAAGCT CTCTCAGTTC TTCTACCTGG CTCCTCTGGA GCCCTCCTTA TTGCTCATCC CATTCTTAGC CTGATTCAAG - ~804 ATTCCTGGTC CTTCAAATCT CTCTTTAAGT GTCCTTACCT GGATCTTTCT CTAGTTAGTA CAAATTTTTC TATCTACCAT TGGAGCGAAC ATTTTTTGAA | -704 ACTTTGTATC AGTCCTGCCT TACTCTTGGT GGAATCCTGT GGTCCTAGTC AAGTGCCTGC TCCATGAATG TGCTGAATAA ATGAATAAGC ATTTTAATTG - -604 TGTATCTGTC ATTAGTGTCA GATGTGTTAT TTATTCCAGC ATGGTTTTAG CACACAGACA CACTCTTTGA TGCAGACTTT TCTTTTCTTT TTACATATAG | -504 CAACAATAAA AAACTAG-AC TT -- -TCAT- CTCC -- -~-TG AAAA-TA-TC AGTCTAATAA TCA-CCTATG GC-TGTCTCT CTGGT-TGCT GAAGGAAAAA | -418 sees we even oe f so 2k k ck k 0 .

Comparison of the DNA sequence of the 5 end and 5'-flanking region of the human and mouse a4 genes .
The arrow denotes the major site of transcription initiation from the human a4 gene ( Rosen et al .
, 1991 ) .
The sequence of the mouse a4 gene 5'-flanking region was obtained from De Meirsman et al .
( GenBank accession number L20788 ) .
Sequences were aligned using the Nucleic Acid and Protein Sequence Program from Intelligenetics Geneworks .
The three boxed Ets sites between position -42 and -76 bp are conserved in human and mouse .
The GenBank accession number for the human sequence is L26059 .
1 mm , which had no effect on the assays .
The anti-Ets-1 antibody ( E44 ) is a monoclonal generated against the bacterially expressed v-Ets protein ( Koisumi et al .
, 1990 ) .
Pan Ets is a monoclonal antibody generated against the DNA binding domain of the Ets gene family ( Bhat and Papas , 1992 ) .
Anti-Ets-2 ( U244 ) is a monoclonal antibody to Ets-2 ( Fu-jiwara et al .
, 1990 ) .
Anti-GABPa and anti-GABPS antibodies and bacterial expressed purified GABPa and GABPB have been described ( Thompson et al .
, 1991 ) .
The Ets site from the Moloney virus long terminal repeat is 5-GCGCGCTTCCGCTCTCCGAG-3 ' ( Gunther et al .
, 1990 ) , and the Ets site from SV40 is 5'-~TAACCTCTGAAAGAG-GAACTT-3 ' ( Pettersson and Schaffner , 1987 ) .
RESULTS The Region between Position -42 and -76 bp of the « 4 Gene Is Required for Efficient Transcription-We have reported previously the sequence of the human a4 gene 5'-flanking sequence to position -423 bp ( Rosen et al .
, 1991 ) .
In Fig .
1 the sequence of the human 5'-flanking region to position -1993 bp is presented and a portion of this sequence is compared with the sequence of the mouse a4 gene 5'-flanking region .
This comparison reveals a significant conservation of the 5'-flanking region between human and mouse .
A series of 5 deletions were created in the human a4 gene promoter to determine which regions are important for expression .
The resulting constructs were transfected into the T-cell line , Jurkat , which expresses « 4 , and the HeLa cell line , which does not .
As expected , the « 4 promoter was active in the Jurkat , but not the Hela , cell line ( Fig .
2 ) .
Little change in promoter activity was seen with sequential deletions from position -2.0 kilobase to position -400 bp in Jurkat cells .
Deletion from position -400 to ~76 bp caused an increase in promoter activity , indicating that a negative element is removed with this dele-tion .
However , a subsequent deletion from position -76 to ~42 bp , immediately upstream of the TATA box , severely inhibited promoter activity , indicating that elements required for transcription of the a4 gene are located in this region .
Similar results were observed when these constructs were transfected into other cell lines that express « 4 , such as the B-cell line , Raji , and the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line , RD ( Wayner et al .
, 1989 ; Hemler , 1990 ) .
This region between position -42 and -76 bp is highly conserved from human to mouse ( Fig .
1 ) .
The Region between Position -42 and -76 bp Can Activate a Heterologous Promoter-To determine whether the region between position -42 and -76 bp was sufficient to activate a heterologous promoter , it was cloned into the minimal promoter construct , pTACAT , which contains only the SV40 early gene TATA box driving the CAT gene ( Weintraub and Dean , 1992 ) .
In transfection assays into Jurkat cells , this region significantly stimulated expression ( Fig .
3A ) .
Again , similar results were seen when this construct was transfected into Raji and RD cell lines ( results not shown ) .
Therefore , the region between position -42 and -76 bp is critical for transcription of the a4 gene , and it is sufficient to stimulate activity of a heterologous promoter .
The Region between Position -42 and ~76 bp Contains Binding Sites for Ets Transcription Factors-A survey of the sequence between position -42 and -76 bp revealed three consensus binding sites for the Ets family of transcription factors : two adjacent sites at positions -50 and -54 bp and a third site at position -67 bp ( Fig .
1 ) .
Each of these sites is conserved in human and mouse .
Binding of proteins to this region was examined using nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells in gel retardation assays .
Two complexes were observed : one appeared as a broad band , designated `` a , `` and the other as a more compact rapidly migrating band , designated `` b `` ( Fig .
3B ) .
Occasionally , additional more rapidly migrating bands were observed in the gel retar- Control of « 4 Integrin Expression by the Ets Family 15655 Jurkat HeLa Fic .

The region between position -42 and -76 bp was cloned upstream of the minimal promoter in pTACAT , which contains the SV40 early gene TATA box driving the CAT gene ( Weintraub and Dean , 1992 ) to create pTA ( -42/-76 ) CAT .
Constructs were transfected into the Jurkat cell line .
100 % relative activity corresponds to 49 % conversion of chloramphenicol to acetylated forms .
B , gel retardation assay showing binding of Jurkat nuclear proteins to the position -42 to -76 bp region of the « 4 gene promoter .
Specific complexes ( a and b ) are indicated .
`` NS `` denotes a nonspecific complex .
The region from position -42 to -63 bp only contains the two adjacent downstream Ets sites at positions -54 and -50 bp .
`` Moloney `` and `` SV40 `` are Ets sites from the Moloney virus long terminal repeat and the SV40 enhancer , respectively .
C , gel retardation assays comparing binding of Jurkat and HeLa cell nuclear proteins to the position -42 to -76 bp region of the a4 gene promoter .
The panel on the right is a shorter exposure of the panel on the left which shows the separation of complex a and b with the Jurkat extract .
The arrow indicates a specific complex that is seen with the HeLa but not with the Jurkat extract .
Where indicated , a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor was included in the assay .
dation assays that were specifically competed by unlabeled probes .
However , these bands were never reproducible , suggesting that they represent partial degradation products .
Competition with an Ets binding site from the Moloney sarcoma virus long terminal repeat inhibited formation of complex b , but not complex a ( Fig .
3B ) , suggesting that complex b contains an Ets protein .
In contrast , competition with a second Ets binding site from the SV40 early gene promoter , which binds preferentially to the B-cell-specific Ets protein , PU.1 ( Klemsz et al .
, 1990 ) , had little effect on binding of nuclear proteins to the -42 to -76 bp region ( Fig .
3B ) .
Neither the Moloney virus nor the « 4 Ets sites appeared to bind to PU.1 in extracts from the B-cell line Raji ( results not shown ) .
These results emphasize the fact that sequences flanking the Ets core consensus allow different sites to discriminate among members of the Ets family .
When extract from HeLa cells was used in gel retardation assays , complex b was evident but no complex a was detected ( Fig .
3C ) .
These results demonstrate that formation of complex a is cell type-specific .
And , since the a4 gene Ets sites show little activity in HeLa cells ( Fig .
2B ) , these results suggest that formation of complex a could be linked to efficient transcriptional activation .
Additionally , a more rapidly migrating complex , which was not evident with the Jurkat extract , was found with the HeLa extract ( Fig .
3C ) .
The significance of this complex is unknown ; however , it does not appear to contribute to transcriptional activation , since these Ets sites do not appear to be active in HeLa cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
Complex b Is GABPa and GABPB , Whereas Complex a Contains an Unknown Ets Protein-To determine which Ets proteins bind to the region between position -42 and -76 bp , 15656 antibodies that recognize specific Ets members were used in gel retardation assays .
A pan Ets antibody to the Ets family DNA binding domain , which inhibits binding of Ets proteins to DNA ( Bhat et al .
, 1992 ) , blocked formation of complex a and to a lesser degree complex b , suggesting that both complexes contain Ets proteins ( Fig .
4A ) .

The a4 gene 5'-flanking region between position -42 and -76 bp binds GABP « /GABPB and a unique Ets complex .
Antibodies that recognize Ets-1 ( E44 ) , GABPa ( « Ab ) , GABPB ( BAb ) , Ets-2 ( U244 ) , and the common Ets DNA binding domain ( Pan Ets ) were used in gel retardation assays with nuclear extracts from the Jurkat cell line and the region between position -42 and -76 bp as a probe .
The complex that is observed upon addition of E44 is designated c* .
In the first lane a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor corresponding to the region between position -42 and -76 bp was included in the assay .
Supershifted complexes are denoted by an asterisk .

The effect of deleting the 5'-most Ets site in the « 4 gene promoter on transcription and Ets binding .
A , the 5'-most Ets site alone has no transcriptional activity , and deletion of this site has little effect on the transcriptional activity of the two 3'-most Ets sites .
The regions between positions -42 and -63 bp ( contains the two 3'-most Ets sites ) and -62 and -73 bp ( contains only the 5'-most Ets site ) were cloned upstream of the TATA box in pTACAT to create pTA ( -42/ -63 ) CAT and pTA ( -62/-73 ) CAT , respectively .
The activity of these constructs was compared with that of pTA ( -42/-76 ) CAT , which contains all three Ets sites , in transfection assays into the Jurkat cell line .
B , deletion of the 5'-most Ets site changes the pattern of Ets binding .
When the region between position -63 and -42 bp , which lacks the Ets site at position -67 bp , was used as a probe in gel retardation assays with Jurkat nuclear proteins , complex a did not form .

Control of « 4 Integrin Expression by the Ets Family had an effect on complex a or b , therefore these Ets members do not appear to bind the a4 promoter in Jurkat cells .
Although anti-Ets-1 failed to supershift complex a or b , a new , more slowly migrating , complex `` c* `` was evident when this antibody was present .
This antibody has been shown previously to induce formation of a stable Ets-1 complex ( Seth et al .
, 1993 ) .
Thus , we conclude that this antibody induces the binding of Ets-1 , which does not normally bind the region between position -42 to -76 bp in Jurkat cells .
Complex b was completely supershifted into the well by antibodies to either the ubiquitous Ets protein , GABPa , or its binding partner the Notch-like protein , GABPB ( Thompson et al .
, 1991 ) , suggesting that complex b is GABP « /GABP $ B .
Based on gel retardation assays using antibodies to different Ets members and competition with known binding sites for specific Ets proteins , the Ets protein in complex a is not Ets-1 , Ets-2 , PU.1 , or GABPa .
Deletion of the 5'-Most Ets Site Changes the Pattern of Ets Protein Binding but Does Not Block Transcriptional Activity-The region between position -76 and -42 bp was divided into two parts : the 5'-most Ets site ( position -62 to -73 bp ) and the two adjacent 3'-most Ets sites ( position -42 to -63 bp ) .
The region between position -62 and -73 bp was cloned into pTACAT , and the resulting construct was transfected into the Jurkat cell line .
Neither a monomer nor a dimer of the sequence containing this upstream Ets site stimulated promoter activity ( Fig .
5A ) .
Consistent with its lack of transcriptional activity , this site did not bind nuclear protein ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , a single copy of the region between position -42 and -63 bp , which contains the two downstream Ets sites , was sufficient to stimulate expression from pTACAT ( Fig .
5A ) .
In gel retardation assays these two downstream sites at positions -54 and -50 bp formed a complex that comigrated with complex b ; however , no complex a was detected ( Fig .
5B ) .
Instead , a new complex that migrated more rapidly than complex b ( complex ¢ ) was formed .
The ratio of complexes b and c varied somewhat from experiment to experiment .
Both complex b and complex c were competed by the Ets site from Moloney virus , but not by the Ets site from SV40 which binds preferentially to B .

The two adjacent 3'-most Ets sites bind GABP « /GABP $ and an Ets-1 complex .
A , the effect of anti-Ets antibodies on complexes formed between Jurkat nuclear proteins and the two 3'-most Ets sites .
Antibodies to Ets-1 ( E44 ) , Ets-2 ( U244 ) , GABPa ( « Ab ) or GABPB ( BAb ) were added as indicated to gel retardation assays containing Jurkat nuclear proteins , and the region from position -42 to -63 bp was used as a probe .
In the second lane a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor containing the region between position -42 and -63 bp was included in the assay .
B , the two 3'-most Ets sites bind purified GABPa and GABP « /GABP $ , but not purified Ets-1 .
Where indicated , 50 ng of purified Ets proteins , or anti-Ets antibodies , were present in the assays .
The supershifted complex is denoted by an asterisk .
The arrow indicates a complex with GABPa alone .
PU.1 .
Consistent with their inability to form complex a , the two Ets sites at position -50 and -54 bp alone were unable to block formation of complex a when they were used as a competitor ( Fig .
3B ) .
Therefore , even though the 5'-most Ets site alone does not bind Ets proteins , it must collaborate with the other sites to form complex a .
The Two 3'-Most Ets Sites at Positions -54 and -50 bp Bind GABPa « /GABPB-Antibodies that recognize different Ets members were used in gel retardation assays with the two downstream Ets sites as a probe .
Either anti-GABPa or anti-GABPSG completely supershifted complex b ( Fig .
6A ) , suggesting that this complex consists of GABP « @ /GABPB , and thus indicating that these two downstream sites alone are sufficient for binding GABP « /GABP $ .
To confirm that complex b is composed of GABP « @ /GABPB , we examined the ability of the two downstream Ets sites to bind purified GABPa and GABP $ .
Addition of purified GABPa alone resulted in the formation of a complex that migrated more rapidly than complex b ( Fig .
6B ) .
GABPa alone has been shown to bind weakly ( Thompson et al .
, 1991 ) , suggesting that this complex is GABPa .
Purified did not bind alone , but when mixed with GABPa , a complex appeared with the same mobility as complex b. Anti-GABPa or anti-GABPRB supershifted this complex , indicating that complex b is indeed Deletion of the 5'-Most Ets Site Not Only Blocks Formation of Complex a , It Results in the Binding of a New Heterotypic Ets-1-containing Complex to the Two Downstream Ets Sites-As described above , deletion of the 5'-most Ets site not only blocked formation of complex a , it resulted in formation of a new complex c ( Fig .
5B ) .
Anti-Ets-1 supershifted complex c , indicating that it contains Ets-1 .
Therefore , it appears that removal of the 5'-most Ets site , which is required for formation of complex a , permits the two downstream sites to bind Ets-1 .
Interestingly , purified Ets-1 did not bind these two downstream Ets sites ( Fig .
6B ) , although it did bind efficiently to the Ets site from Moloney virus ( data not shown ) , which has been shown previously to bind Ets-1 ( Wang et al .
, 1992 ) .
Therefore , Ets-1 alone is not sufficient to bind the two downstream Ets sites , indicating that it must interact with another protein to form complex c. The 3'-Most Ets Site at Position -50 bp Binds GABP « / GABPB and Can Activate Transcription to a Limited Degree-Mutations in the Ets sites at positions -50 and -54 bp were created to determine whether both of these adjacent sites were required for transcriptional activation .
Mutations in both sites ( M I ) eliminated transcriptional activation ( Fig .
7A ) .
Consistent with its lack of transcriptional activity , this mutant did not bind nuclear protein ( data not shown ) .
A single base mutation was then made in the 3'-most Ets site at position -50 bp ( M II ) .
This mutant also failed to activate transcription ( Fig .
7A ) , indicating that the 3'-most Ets site is essential for transcriptional activity .
And like M I , M II failed to bind nuclear protein ( results not shown ) .
The Ets site at position -54 bp site was then mutated ( M III-V ; Fig .
7A ) .
Although M III was significantly less active than the wild type sequence , it did activate transcription ( Fig .
7A ) .
Similar results were seen with M IV and M V , which also mutate the Ets site at position -54 bp ( results not shown ) .
Therefore , the site at position -50 bp alone is transcriptionally active .
M III-V all gave the same pattern in gel retardation assays : they only formed a complex that comigrated with b ( Fig .

The 3'-most Ets site at position -50 bp is critical for transcriptional activity , and it forms a complex that comigrates with complex b .
A , the effect of mutations in the two 3'-most Ets sites on transcriptional activity .
Mutations M I-V are shown along with the wild type ( WT ) sequence .
M I mutates both the site at position -54 bp and the site at position -50 bp , whereas M II only mutates the site at position -50 bp , and M III-V only mutates the site at position -54 bp .
Transcriptional activity of these mutants was compared in transfection assays into the Jurkat cell line .
M IV and M V showed the same activity as M III ( results not shown ) .
100 % relative activity corresponds to 49 % conversion of chloramphenicol to acetylated forms .
B , the 3'-most Ets site at position -50 bp is sufficient for binding a complex that comigrates with complex b ; however , this site alone does not form the Ets-1-containing complex c. Assays contain Jurkat nuclear proteins and M III as a probe .
Where indicated , a 20-fold molar excess of M III competitor was included in the assay .
M IV and M V showed the same pattern as M III in gel retardation assays ( results not shown ) .
not shown ) .
Antibodies to GABPa or GABPB supershifted this complex ( Fig .
8A ) .
Moreover , M III bound purified GABP « / GABP , and this complex was also supershifted by anti-GABPa « ( Fig .
8B ) .
Therefore , we conclude that the single Ets site at position -50 bp is sufficient for binding GABP « @ /GABPB .
Anti-Ets-1 had no effect on binding to M III , indicating that M III does not bind Ets-1 ( Fig .
8A ) .
Both adjacent Ets sites at positions -50 and -54 bp are then required for binding Ets-1 , but not GABP « / GABPB .
These results , coupled with the transfection data , indicate that the GABP & @ /GABPB complex is sufficient for at least some level of transcriptional activation .
However , most of the transcriptional activity of the « 4 gene Ets sites appears to be the result of an unidentified complex of Ets proteins that results from a synergistic interaction between the three different Ets sites .
In situations where complex a does not form , a heterotypic Ets-1 complex can replace complex a and efficiently stimulate promoter activity .
It is interesting to note that although M IV disrupts the Ets site at position -54 bp , switching the G nucleotide to an A nucleotide in this mutant results in formation of a new Ets core GGAA motif ( Fig .
7A ) .
However , in contrast to the original site at position -54 bp , this new GGAA core seems to have no effect on transcriptional activity or binding of nuclear protein , suggesting that the core alone is not functional or that it can not synergize with the site at position -50 bp to form the Ets-1-containing complex c. DISCUSSION We present evidence here that transcription of the a4 integrin gene is dependent upon three Ets sites located between position -42 and -76 bp of the human a4 gene , which all share the same GGAA core sequence .
The 3'-most site at position -50 bp is sufficient for binding GABP « @ /GABP $ B , and this site can activate transcription to a limited degree , indicating that GABP « @ /GABPB is a transcriptional activator .
Neither of the other two sites alone are capable of binding nuclear protein or activating transcription , indicating that the region flanking the GGAA core is important in conferring binding specificity for different Ets family members .
Others have suggested that two GGAA repeats are required for efficient binding of GABPa and GABPB ( Thompson et al .
, 1991 ; Carter et al .
, 1992 ) .
However , in the « 4 gene promoter , a single Ets site is sufficient for binding to GABP « /GABP $ ( the three Ets sites together bind no better to GABP « @ /GABP $ than the single site at position -50 bp ) .
The transcriptional activity of GABPa and GABPB had been in question ; however , recent studies of the cytochrome oxidase IV gene have shown that these Ets members are transcriptional activators ( Carter et al .
, 1992 ; Virvasius et al .
, 1993 ) .
Our studies support this conclusion .
Although GABPa and GABP $ are likely to play some role in controlling « 4 gene expression , it is unlikely that they could be solely responsible for directing the pattern of « 4 tissue expression , because they appear to be ubiquitous and their transcriptional activity in the context of the « 4 gene promoter is modest .
Although only the 3'-most Ets site in the « 4 gene promoter is capable alone of binding nuclear protein , when combined , the three Ets sites work in synergy to bind another complex a .

The 3'-most Ets site at position -50 bp is sufficient for binding to GABP « @ GABPR but not Ets-1 .
A , anti-GABPa ( « Ad ) or anti-GABPB ( BAb ) supershifts complex b that forms with the Ets site at position -50 bp .
Gel retardation assays were done with Jurkat nuclear proteins and M III as a probe .
Anti-Ets antibodies or a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled M III were included in the assays as indicated .
The supershifted complex is denoted by an asterisk .

The arrow indicates a complex with GABPa alone .
activity .
Complex a is blocked by an antibody to the conserved DNA binding domain of the Ets family , indicating that it contains a member of the Ets family .
This Ets complex appears to be unique , because it is not competed by known Ets sites from Moloney virus or from the SV40 enhancer , and antibodies to Ets-1 , Ets-2 , GABPa , or GABP do not affect it .
The complex is not restricted to T-cells ; it is also found in non-lymphoid cells where the a4 gene promoter is active . ``
Complex a was not detected in HeLa cells where the Ets sites in the « 4 promoter showed no activity .
Since HeLa cells do not express « 4 , there is then a correlation between expression of « 4 and formation of complex a , suggesting an important role for complex a in controlling expression of « 4 in vivo .
Although complex a does not form in HeLa cells the GABPa « /GABPB does appear to form , yet the sites are not active .
These results suggest that GABPa ) GABPGB may not be important for regulation of a4 in vivo .
However , in addition to GABP @ /GABP $ B , an as yet unidentified complex forms with the HeLa cell extract .
It is conceivable that this complex is inhibitory and blocks the activity of GABPa GABP .
Neither of the two 5'-most Ets sites alone can bind nuclear protein , yet they appear to be modulators , determining the nature of Ets members that bind to the « 4 gene promoter .
In the absence of these two sites , only GABP « /GABPB binds .
When both sites are present , the unique Ets complex described above also forms .
Deletion of the upstream site results in a new binding pattern : GABP « /GABPB still binds ; however , the unique complex no longer forms .
Instead , a new , Ets-1 containing complex c forms .
Formation of complex c correlates with efficient transcription , indicating that it can substitute effi- * G. D. Rosen and D. C. Dean , unpublished results .
ciently for complex a in transcriptional activation .
Ets-1 alone does not bind the two 3'-most sites , thus complex c must be a heterotypic complex composed of Ets-1 and another protein .
It is possible that this Ets-1-containing complex becomes important for « 4 gene expression in vivo in situations where complex a does not form .
It is conceivable that the pattern of Ets members , which are capable of binding the a4 gene promoter , is cell-specific and developmentally regulated .
In support of this possibility , it has been shown recently that Ets-1 is expressed on the differentiating somite , on neural crest cells , on newly forming blood vessels , and at sites of embryonic hematopoiesis in blood islands of the yolk sac ( Pardanaud and Dieterlen-Lievre , 1993 ) .
We have shown that these are all sites of « 4 expression during embryogenesis . ``
In the adult , Ets-1 is present in lymphocytes ( Chen , 1985 ) , a principal site of « 4 expression in normal adults .
This pattern of Ets-1 could then be important for defining the pattern of « 4 during development and in the adult .
Potentially , each of the Ets complexes that we have described might have a role in controlling 4 expression .
Recent work has shown that activation of lymphoid-specific IgH gene expression depends upon DNA binding by two members of the Ets family , PU.1 and Ets-1 ( Nelsen et al .
, 1993 ) .
Therefore , a requirement for two different Ets-domain proteins with overlapping expression patterns ( i.e .
GABPa and either Ets-1 or the unidentified Ets protein ) could confer an additional degree of regulatory specificity on the « 4 gene promoter .
