One of the factors bound to a novel dyad symmetrical sequence .
This sequence is well conserved in various HIV-1 isolates and partial homology was found with the promoter region of the human retinoblastoma gene .
Similar DNA binding activity was detected in a variety of virus-uninfected human T cell lines and HeLa cells by means of a gel mobility shift assay .
The other factor bound to a putative AP-1 recognition sequence predicted for the HIV-1 NRE .
However , this factor did not bind to a typical AP-1 site .
The insertion of multiple copies of the binding site for the former or latter factor into a heterologous promoter reduced the promoter activity to one-tenth or one-third , respectively .
Thus , each factor may function as a novel negative regulator of transcription .
INTRODUCTION Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) , an etiologic agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) ( 1-3 ) , is a highly regulated retrovirus ( reviewed in refs 4 , 5 ) .
Previous studies demonstrated the location of cis-acting regulatory elements within the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) .
The trans-activation responsive ( TAR ) element , which is located between -17 and +80 ( +1 being the mRNA capping site ; ref .
6 ) , has been shown to be indispensable for trans-activation by a viral protein , Tat ( 7-12 ) .
The enhancer region ( -105 to -80 ; refs .
6 , 13 ) was shown to be responsible for the induction of HIV-1 gene expression through T cell activation signals ( 13-17 ) .
The negative regulatory element ( NRE ) was found far upstream from the transcription initiation site and is mapped over hundreds of bases ( 6 , 18 ) .
Deletion of the NRE resulted in increases in the basal level and Tat-induced trans-activation of HIV-1 transcription ( 6 , 16 , 18 ) .
The molecular basis of the function of each element has been characterized through analysis of the sequence-specific DNA binding proteins that interact specifically with the individual elements .
The interaction of LBP-1/UBP-1 ( 19-21 ) with the TAR element has been shown to be responsible for the basal and Tat-induced trans-activation of HIV-1 transcription ( 20 , 22 ) .
The enhancer binding proteins , which have been extensively purified by several groups ( 21 , 23 , 24 ) , are considered to transmit extracellular stimuli and to trigger HIV-1 transcription ( 25 ) .
The NRE also has a number of potential protein-binding sites .
The sequence between -349 and -330 contains putative recognition sites for the cellular trans-activator protein , AP-1 ( 26 ) .
It was reported , however , that this region was bound by a T cell protein , presumably a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor super family , not by AP-1 ( 27 ) .
More recently , human counterparts of the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factors ( COUP-TFs ) were shown to bind to this region ( 28 ) .
The region from -254 to -216 was found to be protected from DNase I digestion by the nuclear extract of an activated human T cell line , Jurkat ( 29 ) .
A DNA fragment of the HIV-1 LTR containing these sequences competed with the canonical binding site for a T cell activation-specific transcription factor , NFAT-1 ( 29 ) .
The sequence between -179 and -159 was also protected by a partially purified HeLa cell extract ( 19 ) .
This sequence is remarkably similar to that recognized by the upstream stimulatory factor ( USF ; ref .
30 ) .
Very recently , it was shown that a mutant HIV-1 provirus , of which the NFAT-1 site or USF site within the NRE was selectively deleted , replicated more rapidly in Jurkat cells than the wild type did ( 31 ) .
In addition to the proteins described above , we identified a new member of the HIV-1 NRE-binding protein in a partially purified T cell nuclear extract .
This cellular factor , designated as NRT-1 , was shown to suppress the transcription from a heterologous promoter containing multiple copies of the binding site for this factor positioned upstream from the TATA box .

22 identified a weak transcriptional suppressor that bound to the putative AP-1 site within the HIV-1 NRE and present evidence that this factor is distinct from AP-1 .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and nuclear extract preparation The HIV-1-infected human CD4 * T cells , H9/IIIB , which were maintained in RPMI1640 medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum , were kindly provided by Drs T.Hamakado and M. Mizukoshi ( FUJIREBIO Inc. , Ube , Japan ) .
H9 , Jurkat and MOLT4 cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum .
HeLa cells were maintained in minimal essential medium containing 5 % fetal calf serum .
Nuclear extracts were prepared as described ( 32 ) , and then dialyzed against buffer PB-0.1 containing 50 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.9 ) , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 100 mM KCl and 20 % glycerol .
The handling of the virus-infected cells and preparation of the nuclear extract were carried out in the P3 facility at the FUJIREBIO Ube Laboratory .
Fractionation of the nuclear extract The H9/IIIB nuclear extract ( approximately 100 mg protein ) was applied to a 30 ml heparin-Sepharose ( Pharmacia ) column equilibrated with buffer PB-0.1 .
The column was washed with 150 ml of buffer PB-0.1 , and then the bound proteins were fractionated by step-wise elution .
The 0.4 M KCI fraction was diluted with buffer PB-0.0 ( no KCI ) to 0.1 M KCl and subsequently loaded onto a 10 ml DEAE-Sepharose ( Pharmacia ) column equilibrated with buffer PB-0.1 .
The column was washed with 30 ml of PB-0.1 and then the bound proteins were recovered by step-wise elution with buffer PB-0.2 and PB-0.4 , containing 0.2 M and 0.4 M KCI , respectively .
Each fraction was precipitated by 60-70 % saturation with ammonium sulfate .
The pellets were suspended and dialyzed against buffer PB-0.1 , and then stored in aliquots at -80°C .
Plasmid construction and DNA probes A 718-base-pair ( bp ) Dral fragment containing the entire U3 and R regions of HIV-1 was excised from a plasmid , pCD12 ( 33 ) , and then sub-cloned into the Smal site of another plasmid , pTZI18R ( United States Biochemical Corp. ) .
This construct , pTHL8RSS , was 3'-end-labeled at the EcoRI site with [ a « -P ] dATP and the Klenow enzyme , followed by cleavage at the Hincl !
site .
The labeled fragments were isolated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described ( 34 ) and used as probes for DNase I footprint experiments .
To obtain a smaller DNA fragment suitable for the methylation interference experiment , plasmid pTHL8RSS was digested with Dralll and BsfYI , and then blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase .
One of the resultant DNA fragments containing the region from -404 to -245 of HIV-1 NRE was purified and then cloned into the Smal site of pTZ18R .
Probe preparation from the resultant constructs was performed as described above , followed by partial methylation with dimethyl sulfoxide as described ( 34 ) .
For gel mobility shift assays , double-stranded oligonucleotides complementary to the sequences protected from DNase I digestion were chemically synthesized ( the sequences are listed in Fig .
2 ) with a DNA synthesizer ( Applied Biosystem model 380B ) .
In addition , oligonucleotides containing 3 base-substitutions in half of the symmetrical sequence of probe A and 2 base-substitutions in the sequence of probe B were also synthesized ( see Fig .
2 ) .
These oligonucleotides were 5'-end-labeled with [ y- > P ] ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase , annealed and then electrophoretically purified .
For the insertion of multiple copies of a binding site , we designed the synthetic oligonucleotides so as to be connected in one direction .
The complementary DNAs for site 1 CAAGCTAGTACCA-3 `` ) and site 2 ( 5'-TATCCACTGACC-TTT-3 ' ) , with three guanine and cytosine residues at the 5'-end of the upper and lower strands , respectively , were chemically synthesized .
These oligonucleotides were 5'-phosphorylated with ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase , annealed and then polymerized with T4 DNA ligase .
The polymerized DNA containing four copies of each site was excised from a polyacrylamide gel and then cloned into the unique Smal site of a plasmid , pRAU3-CAT ( 35 ) .
The direction of the inserted fragment was determined by Smal digestion of the resultant plasmid .
DNA binding experiments Binding reactions were carried out in 20 gl for DNase I footprint analysis or in 10 gl for the gel mobility shift assay , with 1 ug of unlabeled poly ( dI-dC ) and various amounts of the protein fraction , under final buffer conditions of 25 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.9 ) , 50 mM KCI , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0.1 mM EDTA and 10 % glycerol .
Each mixture was preincubated for 10 min on ice , followed by the addition of 1-5 ng of the end-labeled DNA probe ( 5,000-10,000 cpm ) .
The binding reactions were performed for 20 min at room temperature .
For DNase I footprint analysis , the binding reaction mixtures were digested for 1 min by the addition of 5 ul of a DNase I digestion mixture ( 5 mM CaCl , , 10 mM MgCl ; and 0.2-0.5 units of RQ1 DNase purchased from Promega Inc. , with the same buffer conditions as for the binding reactions ) .
The digestion was terminated by the addition of 60 ul of a STOP solution ( 50 mM EDTA , 0.2 % sodium dodecyl sulfate and 100 ug/ml tRNA ) , followed by extraction with phenol and chloroform , and then precipitation twice with ethanol .
The pellets were rinsed with 70 % ethanol and then dried before loading on a 10 % sequencing gel .
For the gel mobility shift assay , the binding reactions were mixed with 4 gl of a loading buffer ( 0.05 % bromophenol blue and 0.05 % xylene cyanol , with the same buffer conditions as for the reactions ) and then electrophoresed on a 6 % non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel at 5°C .
For the methylation interference assay , the binding reactions with the partially methylated DNA probes were scaled up to 10-fold .
Free and bound DNAs were separated as described above and then purified with QIAGEN ( DIAGEN ) .
The DNAs were cleaved as described ( 34 ) and then applied on a 8 % sequencing gel .
Transfection and CAT assay The plasmids used for transfection were quantitated by measurement of the optical density at 280 nm and then on an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel .
2 x 106 Jurkat cells were co-transfected with 4 ug of each CAT construct described above and 4 4g of a control plasmid carrying the B-galactosidase gene under the control of the G-actin promoter by means of electroporation ( 36 ) .
The transfected cells were cultured for 48 hours in RPMI1640 medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum and then harvested for CAT assays .
The CAT assays were performed with 3 ug of a cell lysate under the standard conditions ( 36 , 37 ) .
Transfection efficiency was determined by measurement of B-galactosidase activity in the lysate .
The conversion of chloramphenicol in each assay was determined by densitometric scanning of the autoradiograph .
Values were normalized to the transfection efficiency .
RESULTS Identification of HIV-1 NRE-binding proteins in the nuclear extract of a HIV-1 infected human T lymphocyte cell line We prepared a nuclear extract from a HIV-1l-infected human CD4+ T cell line , H9/IIIB , and fractionated it on a heparin-Sepharose column .
The 0.4 M KCl fraction from the column , in which the majority of the stimulatory activity for HIV-1 LTR-specific transcription was present ( 33 ) , was further fractionated by step-wise elution from a DEAE-Sepharose column .
The resulting eluates were used for a DNase I footprint experiment .
Fr4.1 ( the flow-through fraction from the DEAE-Sepharose column ) protected the region of the HIV-1 LTR between -338 and -325 upstream from the transcription initiation site ( Fig .
1 ) .
This region contains one of two putative recognition sites for a cellular transcription factor , AP-1 ( 26 ; Fig .
2 ) .
Another fraction , Fr4.2 ( the 0.2 M fraction from the DEAE-Sepharose column ) , contained a novel factor which bound to a region adjacent to the region protected by Fr4.1 ( -320 to -295 ; Fig .
1 ) .
This newly identified region contains a pseudo-dyad symmetrical sequence ( Fig .
2 ) .
To precisely localize the sequence recognized by this factor , a DNase I footprint experiment on the other strand and a methylation interference experiment on both strands were performed for Fr4.2 .
The results are summarized in Fig .
2 .
Some other regions downstream from those indicated in Fig .
1 were also protected , such as the enhancer region by Fr4.1 Fr4.2 0 5 10 0 5 10 0 Figure 1 .

To confirm the sequence-specificity of each factor , we performed gel mobility shift assays with synthetic oligonucleotide probes containing the protected sequence in the DNase I footprint experiment ( see Fig .
2 ) .
A specific protein-DNA complex was detected when the protein fraction was incubated with the corresponding radio-labeled probe ( Fig .
3 ) .
A 10- or 50-fold molar-excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotides efficiently competed with the probe , while the same amount of base-substituted mutant oligonucleotides ( the sequences listed in Fig .

Moreover , a similar type of competition experiment involving DNase I footprint assays gave a consistent result , that is , the footprint of the -320 to -295 region was effectively abolished in the presence of the wild type oligonucleotides , but not in the presence of the mutant ones ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate the highly sequence-specific interaction of these NRE-binding proteins with DNA .

2 ug of Fr4.2 ( lane 1 in A ) or Fr4.1 ( lane 1 in B ) , and 10 ug aliquots of nuclear extracts of HIV-l-infected H9 ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , uninfected H9 ( lanes 5 and 6 ) , Jurkat ( lanes 7 and 8 ) , MOLT4 ( lanes 9 and 10 ) and HeLa ( lanes 11 and 12 ) cells were incubated with ( lanes 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 and 12 ) or without the wild type competitor ( lanes 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 and 11 ) .
Distribution of the HIV-1 NRE-binding factors in various cell lines We next , examined the nuclear extracts of various HIV- !
-uninfected cell lines , by means of gel mobility shift assays , to determine whether the HIV-1 NRE-binding factors are viral or cellular proteins , which are constitutively expressed or induced by viral infection .
A protein-DNA complex with the same mobility as that of Fr4.2 was detected in the nuclear extracts prepared from HIV-1 -uninfected H9 , Jurkat , MOLT4 and HeLa cells , respectively ( Fig .
4A ) .
The binding specificity of each complex was confirmed by the competition with a 10-fold molar-excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides .
The amount of this factor in HIV-1-infected or uninfected H9 cells seems to be greater than that in Jurkat , MOLT4 or HeLa cells ( compare lanes 3 and 5 with lanes 7 , 9 and 11 ) .
Fig .
4B shows the presence of the factor detected in Fr4.1 in various T cell lines .
In HeLa cells , there was no detectable band corresponding to that observed for Fr4.1 , whereas a thick band migrating more rapidly was detected in the gel ( Fig .
4B , lane 11 ) .
This suggests that a related but different molecule which recognizes the same DNA sequence is expressed in different cell types or that the same protein is modified in different ways in different tissues ( see below ) .
From these observations , we concluded that the factors detected in the nuclear extract fractions were cellular proteins which are constitutively expressed in the many cell lines examined here .
A factor distinct from AP-1 binds to a putative AP-1 site in the HIV-1 NRE The factor detected in Fr4.1 bound to a region containing a putative AP-1 binding site ( Fig .
2 ; ref .
26 ) .
To determine whether this factor is identical or related to AP-1 , a collagenase gene enhancer which contains a typical AP-1 site ( 38 ) was analyzed as to its binding to the factor in Fr4.1 .
When the AP-1 like sequence in the HIV-1 NRE was used as a probe , the formation of a specific protein-DNA complex was not affected by the addition of either wild type or mutant oligonucleotides of the AP-1 site from the collagenase gene enhancer ( Fig .
5 ) .
Similar DNA binding specificity was demonstrated with the factor detected in HeLa cell nuclei .
These results indicate that the factor that bound to this HIV-1 sequence has a DNA binding specificity distinct from that of AP-1 .
Conversely , when the AP-1 site was used as a probe , no retarded band was observed for Fr4.1 ( data not shown ) .
Thus , we conclude that the factor in Fr4.1 is a DNA binding protein distinct from AP-1 .
Multiple copies of the NRE-binding factor recognition sequence suppress the transcription from a heterologous promoter To examine the function of each NRE-binding factor in transcription in vivo , we first examined the promoter activity of HIV-1 LTR mutants , in which the binding sites for each or both factors were disrupted by means of site-directed mutagenesis , in Jurkat cells using the CAT assay .
The results indicated that the mutation in site 1 reproducibly increased the promoter activity about two-fold and that the mutation in site 2 did not significantly affect the promoter activity ( data not shown ) .
Thus , to determine the function of each factor more directly , we inserted four copies of the binding site for each factor into the upstream region of a heterologous promoter , which was derived from the Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV ) LTR by deleting other cis-elements upstream from the functional TATA box and linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene ( pRAU3-CAT ; ref .
35 ) .
Each chimeric promoter-CAT construct ( site1 X4 and site2 X4 ) , as well as the parental plasmid as a control , was co-transfected with a plasmid carrying the B-galactosidase gene under the control of the B-actin promoter as an internal control into Jurkat cells by means of electroporation , and then the promoter activity was determined as the CAT activity .
The efficiency of each transfection was determined as the B-galactosidase activity .

transfection and CAT enzyme assay were carried out three times , and each round of experiments was carried out in triplicate .
The CAT conversion rates were measured by densitometric scanning and the values were normalized to the transfection efficiency .
Fig .
6 shows typical results of the experiments and clearly demonstrates that the insertion of four copies of each NRE-binding factor recognition sequence reduced the CAT activity .
The normalized reduction rate relative to the control was approximately one-tenth for site1X4 or one-third for site2 X4 , respectively .
Activation of the transfected cells with a phorbol ester or co-transfection with a Tat-expression plasmid did not cause any significant change in the transcriptional suppression by each factor ( data not shown ) .
Thus , we conclude that the HIV-1 NRE binding factors identified here act as suppressors of transcription in vivo .
DISCUSSION We identified two cellular proteins that bound to neighboring sequences within HIV-1 NRE .
When the binding site for each factor was multimerized and placed upstream of the TATA box of RSV-LTR , the promoter activity was markedly reduced .
This indicates that each factor can suppress transcription from a heterologous promoter .
Thus , hereafter , we refer to each factor as a negative regulator of transcription ( NRT ) .
NRT-1 , the factor found in Fr4.2 , bound to a region containing a novel dyad symmetrical sequence .
This sequence , comprising 18 base-pairs ( bp ) , is well conserved in various HIV-1 isolates ( data not shown ) .
Interestingly , no such sequence was found in HIV-2 isolates , although 15 out of these 18 bp were found in the simian immunodeficiency virus isolated from an African green monkey ( 39 ) .
Furthermore , 74 % homology was detected with - 104 to -95 of the human retinoblastoma gene ( RB ) promoter region ( 40 , 41 ) .
No other significant homology was found with the regulatory sequences of other genes in the EMBL data base .

Transcriptional repression on insertion of multiple copies of the binding site for the factor in Fr4.1 or Fr4.2 .
The constructions of the plasmids used for transfections are indicated at the left .
Four copies of site 1 or site 2 oligonucleotides were inserted into the unique Smal site of a plasmid , pRAU3-CAT ( 35 ) .
The resultant plasmid , site1X4 or site2X4 , respectively , as well as the parental plasmid as a control , was co-transfected with a plasmid carrying the 3-galactosidase gene under the control of the G-actin promoter as an internal control into Jurkat cells .
After 48 h , CAT activity was measured ( right ) .
The results of triplicate experiments are presented .
protooncogene product , was shown to specifically bind to the U3 region of the HIV-1 LTR ( 42 ) .
The NRT-1 binding region covers this proposed Myb binding site .
Since the mutations in probe mt 1 , which did not bind to NRT-1 , were introduced upstream of the canonical Myb recognition sequence , CAACTG , in the HIV-1 NRE , the binding property of NRT-1 seems to be somewhat different from that of Myb .
It has also been demonstrated that the scrape-loaded recombinant Myb protein in HeLa cells resulted in the enhancement of CAT activity controlled by the stably transfected HIV-1 LTR .
Thus , the Myb function on the HIV-1 LTR is opposite to that of NRT-1 .
Differences in the assay systems or in the cell lines used could account for the discrepancy .
The binding site for NRT-2 , the factor detected in Fr4.1 , contained the recognition sequence of a mammalian transcription factor , AP-1 ( 43 ) .
AP-1 is activated by a phorbol ester , such as 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) , and activates the transcription from promoters bearing the consensus sequence , ( G/C ) TGACT ( C/A ) ( 38 ) .
Altbough two homologous sequences were predicted for the HIV-1 NRE ( 26 ) , only one site , as indicated in Fig .
2 , was protected from DNase I digestion by a partially purified H9/IIIB nuclear extract containing NRT-2 .
This factor seems to be different from AP-1 since it failed to bind to a collagenase gene enhancer , which has a typical AP-1 recognition sequence .
Moreover , the binding site for this factor deduced from the HIV-1 NRE did not respond to stimulation by TPA when inserted upstream of the TATA box of the RSV-LTR .
Recently , a DNA binding protein that binds to a similar region to that discussed here was reported by Orchard et al .
( 27 ) .
In their footprint experiment , the protected region was found to contain two putative AP-1 sites in the HIV-1 NRE , unlike in our case , where the protected region contained only one of the two sites .
More recently , one plausible explanation for these differences was presented by Cooney ert al .
( 28 ) .
They reported that the partially purified human COUP-TF family could bind to the region in question , through an imperfect GGTCA palindrome found in the HIV-1 NRE .
The pattern of protection in their footprint experiment was also different from and narrower than that of Orchard et al .
Since the DNA probes employed by 6112 Nucleic Acids Research , Vol .
19 , No .
22 these two groups were prepared from different HIV-1 isolates , DNA sequence polymorphism existed .
It was assumed that A to G sequence polymorphism at position -347 yielded a perfect GGTCA palindrome in the sequence employed by Orchard et al .
, resulting in a stronger and wider footprint than that of Cooney et al .
( 28 ) .
Since we used the imperfect version , our footprint was very similar to that of Cooney et al .
Moreover , our observation of an apparent difference in the mobilities of the protein-DNA complexes detected in T cell lines and HeLa cells ( Fig .
4B ) was consistent with the result of Cooney et al .
( 28 ) .
Thus , the proposed NRT-2 might be a member of the COUP-TF family in human T cells .
What are the roles of NRT-1 and NRT -2 in the regulation of HIV-1 expression ?
The results reported here clearly demonstrated the transcriptional repression by the individual factors .
Recently , a mutant provirus of HIV-1 which carries a selective deletion of the NFAT site ( 29 ) or the USF site ( 19 , 30 ) within the LTR was shown to replicate more rapidly than the parental virus in Jurkat cells , respectively ( 31 ) .
In this experiment , there was apparently no effect on the deletion of the AP-1 site in which the complete NRT -2 site and three nucleotides from the 5'-end of the NRT-1 site were included .
Because the transcriptional repression activity of NRT-2 was weaker than that of NRT-1 , the deletion might not reveal an apparent phenotypic change in their system .
Although the individual functions of these factors remain to be determined in detail , our observation that NRT-1 and NRT-2 can serve as negative regulators of transcription under certain circumstances should provide a basis for understanding the mechanism of negative regulation of HIV-1 transcription through the NRE .
