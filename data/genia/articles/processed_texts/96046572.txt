H. , A. St. , P. F. , A. Si } , and Department of Immunology , The Medical School , Vincent Drive , Birmingham B15 2TT [ J. G. ] , England Abstract B lymphocytes in the peripheral circulation are maintained in a non-proliferative state .
Antigen recognition stimulates limited proliferation , whereas infection with Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) results in continual proliferation and the outgrowth of immortal cell lines .
Because it is not clear at which point in cell cycle the peripheral B lymphocytes are arrested , we characterized the expression of several cell cycle-associated genes in quiescent and stimulated cells .
We show that the expression of four cell genes , edc-2 , cyclin E , CD23 , and cyclin D2 , are up-regulated approximately 100-fold as a result of EBV-mediated immortalization .
Because these genes play a positive role in cell proliferation , we suggest that this regulatory switch contributes to controlling entry into the cell cycle .
Transient stimulation of quiescent B lymphocytes with either a cocktail of anti-CD40 , anti-IgM , and IL4 , or EBV results in the rapid expression of the same four genes , suggesting that , after infection , EBV exploits the normal program of B-lymphocyte cell cycle activation .
Introduction The B lymphocytes found in the peripheral circulation exist in a quiescent state and require stimulation with a specific antigen to enter into the cell division cycle and to proliferate .
Although much progress has been made toward elucidating the signal transduction events arising from stimulation of the B-cell receptor ( reviewed in Ref .
1 ) , litle is known about the molecular mechanisms that maintain the quiescent status B lymphocytes , or about the changes necessary to facilitate cell cycle entry after stimulation .
Recent progress in dissecting cell cycle controls has shown that there are many routes to exit from the cell cycle ( 2 , 3 ) , and it is not clear at which stage of the cell cycle B lymphocytes became growth arrested during their differentiation into peripheral cells .
Quiescent B lymphocytes can also be activated after infection with the DNA tumor virus EBV ; infection causes cells to proliferate , and a proportion of the infected cells continue to divide indefinitely , resulting in the outgrowth of immortal LCLs ( reviewed in Ref .
4 ) .
Mutagenesis experiments have shown that at least six viral genes are necessary for EBV-mediated immortalization ( 5 ) , suggesting that a complex series of events are needed to override normal growth controls .
The simplest scenario to account for the quiescent phenotype of primary B lymphocytes would be the absence of essential positive regulators of cell cycle progression , such as cyclins or edks .

demonstrated that cyclin D2 mRNA is undetectable in quiescent primary B lymphocytes , but it is expressed at high levels after infection with EBV ( 6-8 ) .
Because the D-type cyclins , in conjunction with edk4 and cdk6 , act as positive regulators of progression through G , ( 9-11 ) , the increased expression of cyclin D2 in EBV-infected B lymphocytes might have a direct influence on their proliferation status .
In this report , we characterize the expression of several cell cycle control genes in quiescent B lymphocytes and investigate how these are altered in response to stimulation with physiological agents or infection with EBV .
In addition to cyclin D2 , we chose four cell genes involved in cell cycle control [ ¢de-2 , cyclin E , c-myc , and B-myb ( reviewed in Ref .
12 ) ] , as well as the B-lymphocyte activation antigen CD23 .
In its secreted form , CD23 acts as an autocrine growth factor for LCLs ( 13 ) , and as a trans-membrane protein it has the potential to act as a receptor ; CD21 has been identified as one of its counter structures ( 14 ) .
Our data show that stimulation with physiological ligands or infection with EBV up-regulates the expression of the same genes , implying that the lack of expression of these genes is necessary to maintain the quiescent status of peripheral B lymphocytes .
Materials and Methods Cell Culture .
Primary B lymphocytes were isolated from adult peripheral blood by positive selection with pan B-dynabeads essentially as described previously ( 7 , 15 ) .
The lymphoblastoid cell line LCL # 3 was generated by EBV-mediated immortalization of an equivalent population of cells ( 7 ) .
The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15 % heat-inactivated FCS , penicillin , and streptomycin .
Primary B cells were maintained at 1 X 10°/ ml ; LCL # 3 cells were maintained at between 2 and 5 X 10°/ml .
For infection experiments , EBV was purified ( 7 , 15 ) from the B95-8 cell line .
Its integrity was checked by the expression of viral genes or by the ability to stimulate DNA synthesis after infection ( data not shown ) .
B95-8 virus was added to primary B lymphocytes at saturating levels .
For stimulation assays , BU.1 ( anti IgM ; Ref .
16 ) was added to 25 ug/ml , G25-8 ( anti-CDw40 ; Ref .
17 ) was added to 1 ug/ml , and IL-4 ( Sigma Chemical Co. , Poole , United Kingdom ) was added to 1000 units/ml ; entry of cells into S phase was confirmed by measuring DNA synthesis ( data not shown ) .
RT-PCR assays .
Total cell RNA was routinely prepared from 1 X 10 ' cells supplemented with 100 ug of yeast RNA ( Boehringer Mannheim ) to act as carrier .
After treatment with DNase-1 , random primed cDNA was prepared using a StrataScript RT-PCR kit ( Stratagene ) and was then used as a template for PCR ( essentially as described ; Ref .
6 ) .
The PCR reaction included 2 um each dNTP supplemented with 1 wCi [ °P ] dCTP , and a standard thermocycle profile was used for all primer sets : 94°C for 1 min , 55°C for 2 min , and 72°C for 3 min , for a total of 30 cycles .
The products were fractionated on a 6 % denaturing gel and visualized by autoradiography .
The size of each gene product was confirmed by comparison with DNA size markers after fraction-ation on a 50-cm denaturing gel ( data not shown ) .
These genes included members of the cyclin family [ cyclin D2 ( 8 ) and cyclin E ( 18 ) ] , the prototypic cdk [ edc-2 ( 19 ) ] , growth-regulated transcription factors [ c-myc ( 20 , 21 ) and B-myb ( 22 ) ) , and the FceRlIla form of the B-lymphocyte activation antigen CD23 ( 23-25 ) .

Results and Discussion The increase in the level of cyclin D2 mRNA after EBV infection of primary B lymphocytes was shown to be at least 100-fold , as determined by a quantitative RNase protection assays ( 7 ) .
We therefore explored the possibility of using semiquantitative RT-PCR assays to detect equivalent changes in the expression of other cell cycle genes .
A series of specific primers as chosen to amplify segments of each gene from randomly primed cDNA .
In cases where the genomic organization was known , at least one splice junction was included in the amplified product ( Fig .
1 ) .
RNA was prepared from a population of quiescent primary B lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood by positive selection ( 7 , 15 ) and from a continually proliferating cell line established from an equivalent population of cells by EBV-mediated immortalization ( LCL # 3 ; Ref .
7 ) .
Using RT-PCR , we confirmed that the two control genes ( the cell surface protein CD44 and the ribosomal phosphopro-tein 36B4 ) were expressed at similar levels in primary B lymphocytes and LCL # 3 , with 36B4 up-regulated 10-fold after immortalization ( Fig .
2 ) .
However , even with this sensitive assay , most of the other genes were not expressed at detectable levels in the primary B lymphocytes .
This suggests that the peripheral B lymphocytes have entered into G , and thus are in a similar state of quiescence to peripheral T cells and serum-starved fibroblasts .
The only exception was the low level expression of c-myc mRNA , in line with a previous report ( 28 ) .
As anticipated , c-myc expression was up-regulated at least 10-fold in the LCL .
The expression of B-myb mRNA also appeared to be increased by at least 10-fold .
However , the most striking differences were in the expression of edc-2 , cyclin E , CD23 , and cyclin D2 ; comparison of a cDNA dilution series suggested that the expression of these genes was increased at least 100-fold after EBV-mediated immortalization ( Fig .
2 ) .
The magnitude of these changes in gene expression , together with the ability to readily detect the differences using RT-PCR , may enable us to investigate the effects on cell cycle progression of introducing individual EBV genes into quiescent primary B lymphocytes ( 7 ) .
In addition , it will be interesting to investigate the direct or indirect mechanisms by which the cell genes described here are regulated by Size Primer sequences 231bp 5GGCTCTTGGAAATTGAGCGGAY SAGGAACCCCTTCCTCTTCACT3 ' cyclin E -- - 234bp sGCTTCTCcTCcTrecccaGTocect x 5GCCCTGTTTGATGCCATCCACGAG3 ' cpr 220bp sCCAGAGCTGTGATTGTGCCCG3 ' 5GTGTCCCAGTGCCACAGGAGAY ' c-mye 271bp 5'CCATGAATTACCTGGACCGTTTC3 SGTGGCACACAGAGCAATGAAGG3 ' cyclin D2 _ 330bp SAAGATGTTGCCAGGGAGCGACAGY 5CCAGTTGGTCAGAAGACTTCCC3 201bp STACCCTCTCAACGACAGCAGCTCGCCCAACTCCT3 5'GGCCTCCAGCAGAAGGTGATCCAGACTCTGACCT » 480bp 5GACACATATTGCTTCAATGCTTCAG3 SGATGCCAAGATGATCAGCCATTCT3 ' 180bp 5GGCCGAATTCTGTCTGTGGAGACGGATTACACCY §GGCCGGATCCGACTCTTCCTTGGCTTCAACCITTAGY ' input cDNA - YPrimary B-cell LCL # 3 dilution -- - ad iG edc-2 aa % a cyclin E ‘ 0 ‘ CD23 y *¢e+ c-myc & & « = cyclin D2 * B-myb % * Q , * CD44 t 4 4 + C06 36B4 Fig .

COMMON PATHS TO CELL CYCLE ACTIVATION EBV .
It has been shown that the expression of CD23 and cyclin D2 are regulated by EBV genes ( 6-8 , 29 , 30 ) and , furthermore , that the increase in CD23 expression involves direct transcriptional regulation via an EBNA-2 response element within the promoter ( 31 ) .
During the early stages of EBV-mediated immortalization , infected cells leave G , , and take 3-4 days to progress around the initial cell division cycle ( 32-34 ) .
To determine whether edc-2 , cyclin E , CD23 , and cyclin D2 are early targets for EBV , we investigated their expression 4 days after infection with EBV .
36B4 mRNA was detected in both infected and noninfected cells and can be considered as a control for imput RNA ( Table 1 ) .
Increased expression of cedc-2 , cyclin E , CD23 , and cyclin D2 all occur within this period , thus , the up-regulation of these genes can be considered as events that occur during the initial cell cycle ( Table 1 and Refs .
7 and 28 ) .
The normal program of B-lymphocyte cell cycle activation can be mimicked in vitro by stimulating quiescent primary B lymphocytes with a variety of agents that cause limited cell proliferation ( reviewed in Ref .
13 ) .
Because several features of this program are common to the early stages of EBV-mediated immortalization ( 32-34 ) , we explored the possibility that edc-2 , cyclin E , CD23 , c-myc , and cyclin D2 may also be up-regulated during this process .
We therefore investigated the expression of the same genes 4 days after stimulation of quiescent B lymphocytes with a cocktail of physiological stimuli ( anti-CD40 , anti-IgM , and IL-4 , Ref .
16 ) that are capable of driving quiescent B lymphocytes through at least one cell cycle .
36B4 mRNA was detected in both stimulated and unstimulated cells , but cdc-2 , cyclin E , CD23 , c-myc , and cyclin D2 mRNA were only readily detected in response to stimulation ( Table 2 ) .
In this report , we investigated changes in the expression of a set of positive regulators of cell cycle after in vitro activation with either physiological stimuli or EBV .
From this analysis , we conclude that the quiescent status of peripheral B lymphocytes is maintained , in part , by the lack of several positive regulators of cell cycle progression .
In addition , we show that the same set of cell cycle regulators are up-regulated after either stimulation with anti-CD40 , anti-IgM , and IL-4 or infection with EBV ( Tables 1 and 2 ) .
Taken together with the observation that this cocktail of physiological stimuli generates cells that are morphologically indistinguishable from EBV-immortalized LCLs ( our observations and Table 1 Cell genes induced in the early stages of EBV infection Infection with B95-8 EBV ' Gene ( - ) ( + ) cdc-2 -P e cyclin E - + CD23 - + cyclin D2 - + 36B4 + + `` Primary B lymphocytes were incubated with B95-8 EBV where indicated and harvested after 4 days .

Ref .
13 ) , this provides compelling evidence to support the concept that EBV exploits the normal program of B-lymphocyte cell cycle activation as part of its strategy to infect quiescent cells .
