Expression of all mammalian genes of the MCM family is induced by growth stimulation , unlike yeast , and the mRNA levels peak at G1/S boundary .
In this study , we examined the transcriptional activities of isolated human MCM gene promoters .
Human MCMS and MCMé6 promoters with mutation in the E2F sites failed in promoter regulation following serum stimulation and exogenous E2F expression .
In addition , we identified a novel E2F-like sequence in human MCM6 promoter which cooperates with the authentic E2F sites in E2F-dependent regulation .
Forced expression of E2F1 could induce expression of all members of the endogenous MCM genes in rat embryonal fibroblast REFS2 cells .
Our results demonstrated that the growth-regulated expression of mammalian MCMS and MCM6 genes , and presumably other MCM members , is primarily regulated by E2F through binding to multiple E2F sites in the promoters .
Keywords : mammalian MCM ; E2F ; promoter ; cell cycle ; DNA replication Introduction In the cell cycle of eukaryotic cells , replication of DNA occurs once per cell cycle to ensure the integrity of the genome .
The mechanism that inhibits re-replication of the DNA that had already replicated in the current S phase seems to be conserved from yeast to human .
A model in Xenopus hypothesized a trans-acting factor ( licensing factor ) , which distinguishes replicated DNA from unreplicated one ( Blow and Laskey , 1988 ) .
On the other hand , the MCM family genes have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as essential genes involved in the initiation of DNA replication .
MCM gene products are reminiscent of a putative licensing factor .
A series of experiments with Xenopus egg extract identified Mcm molecules as components of a putative licensing factor ( Chong et al .
, 1995 ; Kubota et al .
, 1995 , 1997 ; Madine et al .
, 1995 ; Thommes et al .
, 1997 ) .
At present , there are six genes of the MCM *Correspondence : M Nakamura Received 6 August 1998 ; revised 28 October 1998 ; accepted 29 October 1998 family ( MCM2-7 ) that have been identified in yeast , Xenopus , and human .
Mcm proteins seem to regulate the initiation at the replication origin where the loading of the proteins onto the origin recognition complex ( ORC ) is regulated by Cdc6 and cyclin-dependent kinases ( Donovan et al .
, 1997 ; Tanaka et al .
, 1997 ) .
However , the mechanism ( s ) by which Mcm proteins control the initiation of DNA replication remains unclear .
Xenopus Mcm proteins seem to be able to access replicated DNA only after the breakdown of nuclear envelope in M phase .
The Mcm proteins in S. cerevisiae are in the nucleus during G1 phase but disappear from the nucleus upon the initiation of S phase , whereas Mcem proteins in fission yeast and mammalian cells are in the nucleus throughout the mitotic cell cycle .
Unlike yeast , in which expression of the Mcm proteins and messages is stable during the cell cycle , mammalian cells show a dramatic induction of MCM mRNAs at G1/S boundary coupled with a significant rise in protein levels upon growth stimulation such as stimulation of resting fibroblasts with serum ( Tsuruga et al .
, 1997a ) .
Thus , in mammalian cells , the transcriptional mechanism of expression of the MCM genes is , at least in part , central to the regulation of Mem activities .
To address this issue , we previously isolated the 5° flanking regions of human MCMS ( HsMCMS ) and MCM6 ( HsMCM6 ) genes ( Tsuruga et al .
, 1997a , b ) .
Both sequences were found to have putative E2F binding consensus sites , suggesting - E2F-dependent - regulation - of - the HsMCMS and HsMCM6 genes .
Overexpression of E2F has been shown to induce cellular DNA synthesis in serum starved fibroblasts ( DeGregori et al .
, 1997 ; Johnson et al .
, 1993 ; Qin et al .
, 1994 ; Shan and Lee , 1994 ) , suggesting that genes critically involved in regulation of DNA replication are targets of E2F .
Indeed , E2F is known to regulate a class of genes involved in DNA replication ( La Thangue , 1994 ; Nevins , 1992 ) .
These include genes for enzymatic machinery for DNA synthesis , such as dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) and DNA polymerase « , and regulatory molecules for the initiation of DNA replication , such as HsOrcl and HsCdc6 ( Ohtani et al .
, 1996 , 1998 ; Yan et al .
, 1998 ) .
HsOrcl and HsCdc6 may be necessary for the initiation of DNA replication .
However , overexpression of HsOrcl or HsCdc6 is not sufficient for the induction of DNA synthesis as shown in rat embryonal fibroblast REF52 cells ( Ohtani et a/ .
, 1998 ) , implying other E2F targets than Orcl and Cdc6 in inducing DNA synthesis in REFS2 cells .
E2F-mediated expression of mammalian MCM genes K Ohtani et al 2300 In the present study , we show that the cell growth-regulated promoter activity of HsMCMS - and HsMCM6 is primarily regulated by E2F through binding to the multiple E2F recognition sites of HsMCMS and HsMCM6 promoters .
Furthermore , expression of E2F1 induces all genes of the endogenous MCM family in REF5S2 cells .
Our results indicate that the MCM family genes are critical EZ2F target genes in the regulation of DNA replication .
Results Cell proliferation-regulated expression of MCM family genes in REFS2 cells We have recently reported that serum stimulation induced expression of all genes of the MCM family in human lip fibroblast KD cells and normal rat kidney fibroblast NRK cells ( Tsuruga et al .
, 1997a , b ) .
Serum-dependent expression of the MCM family genes was further examined in rat embryonal fibroblast REFS2 cells , which were used for a series of transfection experiments .
REFS2 cells were made quiescent by culture in 0.1 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) for 48 h then stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle by the addition of serum .
The level of mRNA expression of each MCM gene post-serum stimulation was monitored by Northern blotting with poly ( A ) t RNA .
The latter was purified from cells harvested at quiescence and at various time intervals after the addition of serum .
Serum-starved quiescent REF52 cells produced lower levels of mRNAs for all MCM genes compared with asynchronously growing cells ( Figure 1 ) .
Serum stimulation induced a transient marked inhibition of expression of MCM mRNAs at 4 h , which was followed with a profound increase for up to 12 h. The reduction at 4 h after stimulation may be due to the paucity of general transcription factors which are required for many genes activated at this stage .
The levels of MCM mRNAs remained persistently high at least until 28 h post-stimulation .
At 16 h post-serum stimulation REFS2 cells commenced DNA synthesis which was determined by uptake ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that MCM mRNA expression parallels proceeding to G1/S boundary of the cell cycle progression upon the addition of serum , implying the involvement of cell growth regulation in the expression of mammalian MCM genes .
HsMCMS and HsMCM6 promoters Our previous results showed multiple putative E2F sites in 5 ' flanking sequences of the HsMCMS and HsMCM6 genes ( Tsuruga et al .
, 1997a , b ) .
We wished to determine the functional significance of these sequences in the regulation of HsMCMS and HsMCM6 genes .
Transcriptional start sites were mapped by RNase protection assays .
By using RNA probes spanning sequences upstream of HsMCMS and HsMCM6 cDNAs , fragments with multiple sizes were protected with mRNAs from human T cell lines MT-2 and Kit 225 ( Figure 2A ) , indicating multiple transcriptional start sites around which no typical splicing acceptor consensus sequences were found .
These possible transcriptional start sites of the HsMCMS gene clustered about 15 bp upstream of the 5° end of HsMCMS cDNA ( Tsuruga et al .
, 1997a ) .
There are two sets of putative E2F binding elements arranged in an overlapping fashion in the 5 ' flanking sequence of HsMCMS cDNA .
One set ( E2F sites III +IV ) is located about 190 bp upstream of the 5 end of cDNA while the other ( E2F sites I +11 ) 2 bp downstream of the 5 ' end of cDNA ( Figure 2B ) ; i.e .
, each one set lies downstream and upstream of the transcriptional initiation sites .
Similarly , RNase protection assay of the HsMCM6 5° flanking sequence indicated multiple transcriptional start sites in 20 to 1 bp upstream of the 5 ' end of cDNA ( Tsuruga et al .
, 1997b ) .
Our independent search found , in addition to two sets of overlapping E2F sites ( E2F sites I-IV ) recognized previously ( Tsuruga et al .
, 1997b ) , another putative E2F site ( E2F like site V ) , which overlapped with the clustered transcriptional start sites .
The 5 flanking sequences of the HsMCMS and HsMCM6 genes contained multiple Spl sites but not typical TATA box .
These characteristics are similar to those of previously reported genes , such as B-myb , E2F1 and HsOrcl , which are primarily regulated by E2F ( Johnson et al .
, 1994 ; Lam and Watson , 1993 ; Ohtani et al .
, 1996 ) .

REFS2 cells were serum-starved and re-stimulated with 20 % FBS .
Cells were harvested at indicated time intervals after the addition of serum .
Poly ( A ) RNA prepared from 660 ug of total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1 % agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane .
The blot was sequentially probed with HsMCM2 through HsMCM7 and GAPDH cDNAs .
Lane A indicates mRNA expression in asynchronously cultured REF52 cells To determine whether the 5 flanking regions of the HsMCMS and HsMCM6 genes were indeed responsible for the growth-dependent regulation of expression of HsMCMS and HsMCM6 genes , we fused these sequences to a luciferase reporter gene and assayed the promoter activities in serum-starved and serum-stimulated REFS52 cells .
REFS2 cells were transfected with HsMCMS- and HsMCM6-luciferase ( Luc ) reporter plasmids and a plasmid containing the $ -galactosidase gene as an internal control , and then made quiescent by serum starvation .
Serum was added to stimulate transfected REFS2 cells to re-enter into the cell cycle .
Cell extracts were prepared at indicated time intervals and assayed for luciferase activity , which was corrected by B-galactosidase activity .
As shown in Figure 2C the promoter activities of both genes were low in quiescent and early G1 cells but markedly increased as the cell cycle progressed through G1 to S phase in response to serum stimulation .
The increase in promoter activities paralleled accumulation of MCMS and MCM6 mRNAs in Northern blotting ( Figures 1 and 2C ) .
We therefore conclude that the 5° flanking regions of the HsMCMS and HsMCM6 genes contain promoter sequences responsible for the growth-regulated expression of those genes .
Activation of HsMCMS and HsMCM6 promoters by E2F Given the presence of multiple putative E2F recognition sequences within the HsMCMS and HsMCMé6 promoters , we then examined whether the putative E2F recognition sequences are functional elements in the regulation of promoter activities .
The ability of these putative E2F sites to bind E2F was examined by the gel mobility shift assay .
Typical E2F sites from the DHFR gene showed a specific binding with total cell extract from F9 cells which are shown to contain a large amount of free E2F molecules ( La Thangue et al .
, 1990 ) .
This complex formation was completely inhibited by any wild type oligonucleotide of the putative E2F sites in HsMCMS and HsMCM6 promoters , with the exception of the HsMCM6 E2F like site V which was less effective in inhibiting the complex formation ( Figure 3A ) .
Their mutant forms with two-base substitution did not show appreciable effects on complex formation .
Furthermore , all of the putative E2F recognition sequences of HsMCMS and HsMCM6 , with the exception of HsMCM6 E2F like site V , were able to form complexes with the F9 cell extract .
The complex formation was competed away with either a typical E2F site or own oligonucleotides , whereas mutant forms of the typical E2F site and MCM gene E2F sites failed to inhibit complex formation ( Figure 3B ) .
The combination - of HsMCM6 E2F like site V and the F9 cell extract generated a complex whose formation was not interfered by typical E2F site oligonucleotides .
These results indicate that the putative E2F recognition sequences ( sites I-IV ) in the HsMCMS and HsMCM6 promoters are authentic E2F binding sites .
On the other hand , E2F like site V of HsMCM6 preferentially binds to a factor ( s ) different from E2F .
These findings prompted us to examine whether HsMCMS and HsMCM6 promoters could respond to E2F in the transient transfection assay .
The HsMCMS E2F-mediated expression of mammalian MCM genes K Ohtani et al and HsMCM6 promoter-driven luciferase reporter plasmids were transfected into REFS2 cells together with a plasmid expressing E2Fl , E2F2 or E2F3 .
Following transfection , the cells were grown in a medium containing 0.1 % FBS for 36 h. Cell extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity .
The activity of HsMCMS promoter increased seven- and sixfolds by exogenous expression of E2F1 and E2F2 , respectively , and to a lesser extent ( threefolds ) by E2F3 ( Figure 4A ) .
Introduction of mutation in two sets of the overlapping E2F sites abolished E2F1-dependent activation ( Figure 4C ) , indicating a direct involvement of E2F in the activity of HsMCMS promoter .
The mutant exhibited high levels of promoter activity , compared with the wild type with E2F1 , even without E2F1 and little , if any , activation by E2F1 .
These results show that the HsMCMS promoter is activated by E2F through multiple E2F sites .
Similarly , exogenous expression of E2F1 , E2F2 and E2F3 in quiescent REFS2 cells induced eight- to threefold activation of the HsMCM6 promoter ( Figure 4B ) .
Mutation was introduced into two sets of the putative overlapping E2F sites ( Mut I-IV ) .
The basal activity of the mutant promoter without E2F increased threefolds relative to that of the wild type , and the activity with E2F1 was similar to that of the wild type ( Figure 4D ) , resulting in a decrease in fold activation from 8 to 2 .
These results clearly indicate that the putative overlapping E2F sites are , at least in part , responsible for activation by E2F , and suggest the presence of another E2F responsive element ( s ) in the HsMCM6 promoter because the mutant still retains responsiveness to E2F1 .
The newly identified E2F like sequence ( E2F like site V : -14 to -21 ) , which is diverged from typical E2F site in terms of nucleotide sequence and non-preferential binding of E2F , was a likely candidate .
To examine this notion , we mutated this site and examined the response to E2F1 .
Introduction of mutation in E2F like site V in addition to the two overlapping typical E2F sites ( Mut I-V ) completely abolished the ability of the promoter to respond to E2F1 , implying involvement of E2F like site V in E2F-dependent response ( Figure 4D ) .
E2F like site V single mutant ( Mut V ) , however , showed reduced promoter activity either with or without E2F1 , resulting in activation by E2F1 which was essentially similar to the wild type .
Critical involvement of E2F in cell cycle-dependent regulation of HsMCMS and HsMCM6 promoter activities In view of the growth-dependent control of the HsMCMS and HsMCM6 gene expression ( Figure 1 ) , we further investigated the role of E2F sites in growth-dependent regulation of HsMCMS and HsMCMé6 promoters .
For this purpose , we compared the kinetics of the activity of E2F mutant promoter with that of the wild type in REFS2 after inducing cell cycle progression by stimulation with serum ( 20 % FBS ) of quiescent cells cultured in 0.1 % FBS for 48 h. The mutant of E2F sites ( Mut I-IV ) in the HsMCMS promoter failed to control expression in response to stimulation of cell growth .
The activity of the mutant promoter in quiescent cells was profoundly higher than that of the fully stimulated wild type 2301 E2F-mediated expression of mammalian MCM genes K Ohtani et al 2302 promoter and remained persistently high after growth _ activity in serum-starved conditions is not known at stimulation .
This result indicates that growth-regulated _ present .

REF52 cells were transfected with 5 ug of pHsMCMS-Luc ( -1384 ) or pHsMCM6-Luc ( -754 ) together with 2 ug of pCMV- $ -gal as an internal control .
Transfected cells were brought to quiescence and then stimulated with serum for the indicated time intervals .
At each time point , cell extracts were prepared , and luciferase and A-galactosidase activities were measured .
Luciferase activity was normalized to that of -galactosidase 2303 E2F-mediated expression of mammalian MCM genes K Ohtani et al 2304 conditions with the same fold activation as the wild type .
It is possible that the low activity of this mutant was due to the destruction by mutation of E2F like site V of the native transcriptional start sites while sparing cryptic transcriptional start sites , thus resulting in a loss of regulation by E2F .
In any event , E2F seems to be the main regulator of growth-dependent activation Activation of expression of all endogenous MCM genes by E2FI In order to examine the role of E2F in the regulation of expression of MCM family genes in a more physiological state , we examined the expression of endogenous MCM genes in response to E2Fl .

( A ) Competitive activity of HsMCMS and HsMCM6 E2F sites in E2F binding .
Gel mobility shift assays were performed with F9 cell extract and the end labeled E2F fragment from the DHFR promoter containing two overlapping E2F recognition sites as a probe .
Competition experiments were performed by adding 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides to the gel shift reaction mixtures .
Competitor oligonucleotides used were the E2F recognition sites from the adenovirus E2 promoter ( lane 3 ) , a mutant form of this sequence ( lane 4 ) , the putative E2F recognition sites I +II from the HsMCMS promoter ( lane 5 ) , a mutant form of this sequence ( lane 6 ) , the putative E2F recognition sites III +IV from the HsMCMS promoter ( lane 7 ) , a mutant form of this sequence ( lane 8 ) , the putative E2F recognition sites I +II from the HsMCM6 promoter ( lane 9 ) , a mutant form of this sequence ( lane 10 ) , the putative E2F recognition sites III +IV from the HsMCM6 promoter ( lane 11 ) , a mutant form of this sequence ( lane 12 ) , E2F like site V from the HsMCM6 promoter ( lane 13 ) , and a mutant form of this sequence ( lane 14 ) .
Lane 1 has the probe only , and lane 2 has no competitor .
( B ) Specificity in E2F binding to the HsMCMS and HsMCM6 promoters .
Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described for ( A ) .
End-labeled double stranded oligonucleotides containing putative E2F recognition sites I+II or III +IV from the HsMCMS promoter or putative E2F recognition sites I+1II , III +IV or E2F like site V from the HsMCM6 promoter were used as probes .
Competition assays were performed by adding 100-molar excess of the same unlabeled oligonucleotides to the gel shift reaction mixtures express E2F1 in serum-starved quiescent REF5S2 cells .
Cells were harvested for preparation of RNA , which was subjected to Northern blot analysis to monitor levels of MCMS and MCM6 mRNAs .
The levels of mRNAs of both genes were markedly increased upon infection with Ad-E2F1 virus compared to those with control virus infection ( Figure 6 ) .
In addition , exogenous expression of E2F1 significantly increased the levels of mRNAs for MCM2 , MCM3 , MCM4 and MCM7 .
Although no information on rat MCMS and MCM6 promoters is available , considering that the HsMCMS and HsMCM6 promoters have E2F sites that primarily regulate promoter activities in response to growth stimulation , it is highly likely that endogenous MCMS and MCM6 genes were induced through a direct action of E2Fl in REFS2 cells .

Discussion The present study provides evidence that the growth-regulated expression of mammalian MCMS and MCM6 genes is mediated by E2F .
Accumulating evidence suggests that the expression of mammalian genes regulatory to DNA replication is growth-dependent , mainly through the action of the transcription factor E2F ( Ohtani et al .

, 1998 ) .

REFS2 cells were transfected with 5 ug of pHsMCMS-Luc ( -1384 ) ( A ) or pHsMCM6-Luc ( -754 ) ( B ) and 0.2 ug of CMV promoter-driven expression vectors for either E2F1 , E2F2 , E2F3 , or a control CMV vector , pcDNA3 along with 2 ug of pCMV- $ -gal as an internal control .
Transfected cells were serum-starved for 36 h and harvested for preparation of cell extracts .
Luciferase and B-galactosidase activities in cell extracts were measured .
Luciferase activity was normalized to that of B-galactosidase , and was plotted for each cotransfected CMV expression vector .
REF52 cells were cotransfected with 5 ug of either wild type or E2F site mutant forms of HsMCMS5-Luc ( -1384 ) ( C ) or pHsMCM6-Luc ( -754 ) ( D ) with the E2F1 vector or the control CMV vector , together with 2 ug of pCMV- $ -gal as the internal control .
Luciferase activity was determined 2305 E2F-mediated expression of mammalian MCM genes K Ohtani et al 2306 The 1384-bp and 754-bp fragments upstream of HsMCMS and HsMCM6 genes , respectively , mimic the kinetics of promoter activities of the rat endogenous MCMS and MCM6 genes in response to serum stimulation ( Figure 2¢ vs Figure 1 ) .
These results indicate not only that the 1348-bp and 745-bp sequences encompass the transcriptional regulatory region of the genes , but also that humans and rats have a similar mechanism for the regulation of expression of MCMS and MCM6 genes .
As is the case with genes whose expression is primarily regulated by E2F ( Johnson et a/ .
, 1994 ; Lam and Watson , 1993 ; Ohtani et al .
, 1996 ) , the E2F sites of the HsMCMS and HsMCM6 genes are located near the RNA start sites in a multiple copy form in transcriptional regulatory regions .
We previously found two sets of overlapping E2F consensus sequences in the 5 ' flanking regions of the HsMCMS and HsMCM6 genes ( Tsuruga et a/ .
, 1997a , b ) .

Cells were brought to quiescence and then stimulated with serum for the indicated time intervals .

REFS52 cells were brought into quiescence by serum starvation for 48 h and infected with either Ad-E2F1 or Ad-Con .
Infected cells were harvested at 21 h post-infection , and poly ( A ) * RNA was prepared and then separated by agarose gel electrophoresis .
The RNAs were transferred to a nylon membrane and probed sequentially with either HsMCM2 through HsMCMT7 or GAPDH cDNA upstream of the clustered transcriptional start sites determined by RNA protection assay and the other downstream of those .
The latter is thus in the 5 untranslated region of the HsMCMS mRNA .
Two sets of MCM6 are upstream of the clustered transcriptional start sites .
We demonstrated in this study that these E2F sites can potentially bind to E2F and to regulate the expression of genes .
We also identified an additional E2F-like site in the HsMCM6 gene , which overlaps the transcriptional start sites .
Growth stimulation-dependent regulation of expression of HsMCMS was abolished by disruption of both sets of the overlapping EZF sites in the promoter , clearly demonstrating the critical function of E2F in expression of the HsMCMS gene .
The E2F site mutant showed higher activity than the wild type in serum-starved conditions and the activity remained unchanged after serum stimulation .
Many of E2F responsive genes such as B-myb , E2Fl and HsOrcl , are actively suppressed in serum-starved conditions .
Mutation of the E2F sites in these genes relieves the suppression , resulting in a higher basal activity in serum-starved conditions ( Johnson et al .
, 1994 ; Lam and Watson , 1993 ; Ohtani et al .
, 1996 ) .
The function of E2F sites in the HsMCMS promoter seems similar to that of the E2F responsive genes .
E2F complex with a member of the Rb family on the E2F sites is thought to be suppressive in transcription from promoters in serum-starved conditions ( Smith et al .
, 1996 ) .
Our knowledge at present is inadequate to account for the extremely high activity of the HsMCMS promoter in serum-starved conditions relative to that of the wild type promoter fully stimulated with serum .
One possibility is that mutation of the 3 ' set of the overlapping E2F sites , which are present in the 5 ' untranslated region of HsMCM5 , increases the stability of the mRNA .
Alternatively , the mutation in the 5 untranslated region might facilitate the efficiency of translation from mRNA molecules .
The mutant of two sets of the overlapping E2F sites ( Mut I-IV ) of HsMCM6 is different from that of HsMCMS5 ; the basal activity in serum-starved conditions is higher than that of the wild type but significantly lower than that of the wild type stimulated by growth signals .
Moreover , the MCM6 mutant could still be activated by E2F1l and serum similar to the wild type , indicating that E2F sites I-IV are partly responsible for the cell cycle-regulated expression and are presumably suppressed by binding of E2F complex with Rb family proteins in serum-starved conditions .
This conclusion implies another E2F responsive element ( s ) .
In this context , it is intriguing to imagine that newly identified E2F like site V plays a pivotal role in the regulation of expression in response to E2F .
Indeed , mutation of E2F like site V with mutation of E2F site I-IV completely abolished E2F-dependent regulation .
Obviously E2F like site V is involved in E2F-dependent regulation of HsMCM6 expression .
Nevertheless this E2F like site V element seems to be different from the typical E2F sites identified so far in various genes in that the E2F like site V mutant did not show elevation of the basal promoter activity in serum-starved conditions and the E2F site oligonucleotide was an ineffective competitor for the complex formation of a typical E2F site .
The reason that the E2F site I-V E2F-mediated expression of mammalian MCM genes K Ohtani et al mutant did not show higher activity than that of the wild type is not known at present .
One possibility is that the mutation of E2F like site V destroyed some of the transcriptional start sites .
We assume , however , that this is less likely because the E2F like site V single mutant showed essentially the similar response to stimulations as the wild type promoter .
Thus , although both E2F sites I-IV and E2F like site V are responsible for regulation of HsMCM6 expression , which is activated by serum stimulation or overexpression of E2F1 , they may mediate such regulation independently .
Collectively , expression of HsMCM6 is assured by combinatorial action of multiple E2F sites .
In any event , the E2F sites in HsMCMS and HsMCM6 promoters are major elements regulatory to growth stimulation .
This notion is supported by the induction of endogenous MCMS and MCM6 genes by overexpression of E2F1 in REF52 cells .
Overexpression of E2Fl induced all endogenous genes of the MCM family in REF52 cells .
Considering the direct action of E2F on HsMCMS and HsMCM6 promoters and putative E2F binding consensus sites in murine MCM3 and human MCM7 5° flanking sequences ( Kimura et al .
, 1994 ; Kiyono et al .
, 1996 ) , it is possible that the induction of those genes in REF5S2 cells is directly mediated by E2F .
Although we do not have any information on 5 ' flanking sequences of MCM2 and MCM4 , the induction of both genes might be a direct effect of E2F .
The Mcm proteins are rather abundant proteins even in serum-starved resting fibroblasts ( Tsuruga et al .
, 1997a ) .
Thus , expression of the MCM genes may not be rate limiting for serum-starved fibroblasts to initiate DNA replication after stimulation with serum .
However , in certain cellular circumstances such as prolonged serum starvation and treatment with anti-sense oligonucleotides specific to HsMCM7 , the Mem family proteins seem to decrease their levels sufficient enough for rate limiting ( Fujita et al .
, 1996 ) .
This may be similar to the in vivo situation in which most cells in vivo are in a resting state while only a very small proportion of the cells , e.g .
, in cases of immune responses and injury , reenters the cell cycle after a prolonged period of resting state .
Under such conditions , transcriptional activation of the MCM family genes is important in the regulation of DNA replication .
Overexpression of E2F has been shown to induce cellular DNA synthesis in serum-starved fibroblasts ( DeGregori et al .
, 1997 ; Johnson et al .
, 1993 ; Qin et al .
, 1994 ; Shan and Lee , 1994 ) , suggesting that genes critically involved in the regulation of DNA replication are targets of E2F .
It is possible that other E2F target genes may exist and mammalian homologs of CDC7 , DBF4 and CDC4S are potential candidates ( Sato et al .
, 1997 ) .
Identification of other E2F target genes should provide insight into the mechanisms that regulate the initiation of DNA replication in mammalian cells .
Materials and methods Cell culture Human T-cell lines MT-2 and Kit 225 were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % FBS supplemented with 0.5 nM IL-2 ( kindly provided by Ajinomoto , Yokohama , 2307 E2F-mediated expression of mammalian MCM genes K Ohtani et al 2308 Japan ) for Kit 225 .
A rat embryonic fibroblast cell line REFS2 and murine teratocarcinoma cell line F9 were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ) containing 10 % FBS .
For experiments of promoter activity assay and expression of endogenous MCM mRNAs , REFS2 cells were serum-starved in DMEM containing 0.1 % FBS for 48 h and stimulated by addition of 20 % FBS for indicated time intervals .
Northern ( RNA ) blot assay Total RNA extraction was carried out using Isogen ( Nippon Gene ) and poly ( A ) * RNA was purified from total RNA by PolyA Tract ( Promega ) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer .
Gel electrophoresis , transfer to nylon membrane , and hybridization were performed as described previously ( Johnson et al .
, 1994 ) .
The probes for MCM2 through MCM7 were the Ascl/NofI fragments cut out from pGEX8T-HsMCM2 , 3 , 5 and 7 , and pBAC3-HsMCM4 and 6 .
The GAPDH cDNA was used as a control probe .
Radioactivity of the signals was measured with an image analyzer BAS 1500 ( Fuji Film ) .
RNase protection assay RNase protection assay was performed as described previously ( Johnson et al .
, 1994 ) .
Briefly , 524-base and 622-base anti-sense RNA probes beginning at +43 and +35 ( relative to 5° ends of the cDNA as +1 ) in the HsMCMS and HsMCM6 5° untranslated regions , respectively , were hybridized to 1 ug of yeast tRNA , MT-2 or Kit 225 poly ( A ) RNA for 16 h at 65°C .
RNA hybrids were digested by RNase A ( 1 unit/ml ) and RNase Tl ( 50 units/ ml ) at 37°C for 30 min , and protected fragments were analysed on a 7 % polyacrylamide sequencing gel .
Sequencing reactions using primers corresponding to the end of the RNase protection probes were used as markers .
Construction of plasmids HsMCMS ( -1384 to +43 ) and HsMCM6 ( -754 to +35 ) 5 ' flanking sequences obtained by PCR using Promoter Finder DNA walking kit ( Clontech Laboratories ) were subcloned into the Neol-SacI sites of pPBV2 ( Wako ) to construct - pHsMCMS-Luc ( -1384 ) - and - pHsMCM6-Luc ( -754 ) , respectively .
The mutant of two sets of the overlapping E2F sites in the pHsMCMS-Luc ( -1384 ) construct was made by site-directed mutagenesis which changed TTTCCCGCGAAA ( nt +2 to +13 ) to TTTCCATCGAAA and TTTCGCGCCAAA ( nt -194 to -183 ) to TTTCGATCCAAA , generating pHsMCMS-Luc ( EZ2F- ) .
The mutants of putative E2F sites in the pHsMCM6-Luc ( -754 ) construct were similarly prepared by changing TTTGGCGCGAAA ( nt -107 to -96 ) to TTTGGATCGAAA and TTTGGCGCGAAA ( nt -169 to -158 ) to TTTGGATCGAAA , and GCGCGCAA ( nt -21 to -14 ) to GCGATCAA , generating pHsMCMé6-Luc ( E2FI-IV- ) and pHsMCM6-Luc ( E2FV - ) , respectively .
pHsMCM6-Luc ( E2FI-V- ) has both mutations .

REFS2 cells were transfected with expression and reporter plasmids by the calcium-phosphate method together with p-galactosidase expression vector , pCMV- $ -gal , which was used as an internal control to monitor the transfection efficiency .
Luciferase activities were assayed using Luciferase Assay System ( Promega ) and normalized to $ -galactosidase activities , which were determined by the method of Rose and Botstein ( 1983 ) .
All assays were performed at least three times in duplicates and representative data are presented .
Gel mobility shift assay Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing each of the putative E2F recognition sites in the 5¢ flanking regions of HsMCMS ( nt -194 to -183 and +2 to +13 ) and HsMCM6 ( -169 to -158 , -107 to -96 and -21 to -14 ) and mutants of these sequences were used for the assay .

A typical E2F site from the DHFR promoter ( Ikeda et al .
, 1996 ) was also used as a probe .
Gel mobility shift assay was performed as described previously ( Yee et a/ .
, 1989 ) .
In brief , radiolabeled probes were incubated with F9 cell extract in the presence or absence of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides for 20 min at room temperature , followed by electrophoresis in a 5 % polyacrylamide gel in TBE ( 50 mm Tris-borate/l mm _ EGTA ) containing 5 % glycerol .
Infection with recombinant adenoviruses The recombinant adenovirus for expression of E2F1 , Ad-E2F1 and control virus , Ad-Con ( previously Ad-CMV ) , have been described previously ( Schwarz et al .
