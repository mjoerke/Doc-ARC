Aram E. Elovic , * Hiroe Ohyama , * Alan Sauty , ' `` Jim McBride , * Takanori Tsuji , * Masazumi Nagai , * Peter F. Weller , `` and David T. W. Wong** TGFs play important roles in wound healing and carcinogenesis .
We have previously demonstrated that eosinophils infiltrating into different pathologic processes elaborate TGF- « and TGF-B1 .
Eosinophils infiltrating hamster cutaneous wounds were found to express TGFs sequentially .
In this study , we examined the biologic mediators that may regulate the expression of TGF-a @ and -1 by eosinophils .
Eosinophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors and cultured in the absence or presence of IL-3 , IL-4 , and IL-5 .
Cells were analyzed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry .
Supernatants from these cultures were assayed for secreted TGF-a and TGF-B1 using TGF-specific ELISAs .
IL-3 , IL-4 , and IL-5 independently up-regulated TGF-B1 mRNA and product expression by eosinophils in all donors .
Interestingly , TGF-a production by eosinophils was up-regulated by IL-3 and IL-5 but was down-regulated by IL-4 .
Consistent with the ability of IL-4 to regulate eosinophil responses , IL-4 signaling molecules are present in human eosinophils .
The observation that IL-4 can differentially regulate the expression of TGF-a and TGF-B1 suggests that IL-4 may serve as a physiologic molecular switch of TGF expression by the infiltrating eosin- ophils in wound healing and carcinogenesis .
- The Journal of Immunology , 1998 , 160 : 6121-6127. osinophils are bone marrow-derived granulocytes and are predominantly tissue-dwelling cells .
They are activated by a range of mostly T cell-derived factors that , among other functions , can stimulate eosinophils to secrete their stored granule contents and increase their longevity in tissues .
Although it has recently been demonstrated that eosinophils can express and elaborate many different cytokines , their roles in normal physiology as well as in eosinophil-associated disease processes remain uncertain .
We have demonstrated that eosinophils in oral carcinomas can synthesize TGF-a ( 1 , 2 ) .
We also showed that eosinophils from the peripheral blood of patients with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome produce TGF-a @ as well as TGF-B1 , whereas eosinophils from the peripheral blood of healthy donors contain little or no detectable TGFs ( 2 , 3 ) .
We have further shown that eosinophils infiltrating hamster cutaneous wounds express TGFs sequentially ; eosinophils express TGF- « in the early stages of wound healing , while eosinophil-derived TGF-B1 is more pronounced during the postacute phase of this process ( 4 ) .
Thus , it is conceivable that specific mediators released within the microenvironment of normal and diseased tissues can regulate the production of TGFs by eosinophils .

Copyright © 1998 by The American Association of Immunologists TGFs are multifunctional cytokines with various biologic and pathologic actions , such as stimulatory and inhibitory effects on epithelial cell growth , induction of angiogenesis , extracellular matrix remodeling , and regulation of inflammatory processes ( 5-8 ) .
TGF production by eosinophils , therefore , may be important in carcinogenesis as well as inflammatory disorders and wound heal-ing .
The ability to control TGF production by eosinophils may therefore have therapeutic benefits .
However , little is known about the mechanisms that activate and regulate the production of TGFs by eosinophils .
The present study demonstrates that the basal level of TGF expression by peripheral blood eosinophils can be enhanced by IL-3 and IL-5 .
Even more interesting is the finding that IL-4 can inhibit the synthesis of TGF-a and concurrently up-regulate the synthesis of TGE-B1 by peripheral blood eosinophils .
Materials and Methods Subjects Blood ( 200 ml ) was obtained from healthy volunteers ( 28-34 years old ) .
These subjects had no evidence by history and physical examination of asthma or other allergic diseases .
Human eosinophil isolation Eosinophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of six healthy donors .
Whole blood was subjected to dextran sedimentation ( Macrodex , Pharma-cia , Piscataway , NJ ) , centrifugation through Ficoll-Paque ( Pharmacia ) , and hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes as described previously ( 2 ) .
Eosinophils were enriched from granulocytes and passage via the MACS system by sequential incubation at 4°C with anti-CD16 mAb magnetic beads ( Mil-tenyi Biotec , Auburn , CA ) to deplete CD16 * neutrophils as described by Lim and Weller ( 9 ) .
Cytokine treatments Eosinophils with purities of 95 to 99 % were cultured for 18 h at 37°C in 24-well plates at 2 X 10° cells/ml in complete medium ( RPMI 1640 with 5 % dialyzed FBS ) in the absence and presence of the following cytokines : IL-3 at 10~'° M ( Genzyme , Cambridge , MA ) ; IL-4 at 10~° M ( Genzyme ) ; and IL-5 at 10~° M ( Amgen Biologicals , Thousand Oaks , CA ) .
Following incubation , eosinophils were collected and mixed into 1 % agar in 1 % X PBS and then fixed in 4 % freshly prepared paraformaldehyde , processed , and embedded in paraffin as previously described ( 2 ) .

In situ hybridization Our in situ hybridization procedures using the antisense and sense human TGE-a « and TGF-B1 *S-labeled riboprobes have been described in detail ( 1 , 2 ) .
Immunohistochemistry To detect human TGF- , we used a mAb directed against the C terminus of the human TGF- mature peptide ( amino acids 34-50 ) ( TGF-a : Ab-2 ; GF-10 ; Oncogene Science , Cambridge , MA ) .
A mAb to the bacterial protein was used at the same concentration as the negative control .
To detect TGF-B1 , we used a rabbit anti-human TGF-B1 polyclonal Ab at 1:100 dilution ( AB-20-PB ; R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) .
An IgG fraction from a nonimmune normal rabbit ( -5006 ; Sigma Chemical , St. Louis , MO ) was used at the same concentration as a negative control .
Immunohistochemistry was performed using an alkaline phosphatase detection system .
All sections were counterstained with 0.4 % aniline blue ( CI 42755 ) for 10 min to permit identification of eosinophils by UV fluorescence microscopy ( 2 , 3 ) .
Quantitative analysis of in situ hybridization data In situ hybridization results were quantified using a computer imaging analysis system ( MetaMorph , Universal Imaging , West Chester , PA ) .
Slides with sections of eosinophils from the different treatment conditions were subjected to in situ hybridization .
Following autoradiographic exposure for 3 days and counterstaining with Giemsa , slides were blindly coded and numbered in random order .
Slides were imaged on a Nikon Microphot-FXA microscope with a 40 X 0.95 objective using Koehler illumination .
Images of 50 cells from each condition were acquired from a Sony CCD/ RGB color video camera DXC 151 .
Images were stored and analyzed using an Universal Imaging 46 PC computer running the MetaMorph Imaging System .
At least 50 cells were quantified on each slide .

Isotype control , myeloma protein ( MOPC 21 ) , was used at the same concentration .
Cells were then washed twice in ice-cold FACS buffer and resuspended in 100 pl of 1/32 dilution FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse ( Sigma Chemi-cal ) .
After 30 min on ice , cells were washed twice in cold FACS buffer and fixed in 1 % paraformaldehyde .
FACS analysis ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) was performed on at least 10,000 cells .
Western blotting Western blotting was performed according to the protocol of Harlow and Lane ( 10 ) .
Cells ( 1 X 10 `` ) were lysed with 1 ml of RIPA buffer in the presence of PMSF ( 100 pg/ml ! )

Results Constitutive expression of TGF mRNA by peripheral blood eosinophils Since our initial report , which demonstrated that eosinophils from the peripheral blood of healthy donors showed no detectable levels of TGF-a or TGF-B1 mRNA and protein , we have modified our procedure for eosinophil isolation by adding an incubation step with anti-CD16 magnetic beads to achieve an enriched population of 97 to 99 % eosinophils ( 9 ) .
In the present study , in situ hybridization results using °°S-labeled TGF- « and TGF-B1 antisense riboprobes showed that eosinophils harvested in this manner expressed a basal level of TGF- and TGF-B1 mRNA ( Figs .
14 and 2A ) .
TGF mRNA expression by eosinophils treated with IL-3 , IL-4 , and IL-5 Marked changes in the TGF mRNA expression were observed in peripheral blood eosinophils incubated in the presence of IL-3 , -4 , and -5 ( Figs .
1 and 2 ) .
To quantify these differences , a computer-assisted analysis was used that allowed us to quantify the relative changes in TGF mRNA levels .
IL-3- , IL-4- , and IL-5-treated eosinophils were obtained from six normal donors , subjected to in situ hybridization , and analyzed blindly as described in Materials and Methods .
The results are summarized in Tables I and II .
All of the cytokines used significantly increased TGF-B1 mRNA expression in all of the donors ( Table II ) .
IL-3 and IL-5 , respectively , up-regulated the expression of TGF- « mRNA in five of the six donors .
IL-4 , however , significantly down-regulated the expression of TGF-a in all six donors .

TGF production by eosinophils treated with IL-3 , IL-4 , and IL-5 Immunohistochemistry was used on adjacent sections to evaluate intracellular immunoreactivity for TGF-a « and TGF-B1 .
Similar to the in situ hybridization results , eosinophils incubated in the absence of any of the exogenous cytokines demonstrated a basal level staining for TGF-a and TGF-B1 ( Figs .
1B and 2B ) .
Differences were observed in the intensity and numbers of eosinophils staining for both TGFs , depending on the cytokine used ( Figs .
1 and 2 ) .
Since the intensity of immunoreactivity is difficult to quan-tify , the effect of each exogenous cytokine on the cellular levels of TGF- « and TGP-B1 proteins were quantified by comparing the percentage of cells stained for TGF- « and TGF-B1 , examining 100 cells in each slide .
The results are summarized in Tables III and IV .
Consistent with our in situ hybridization results , eosinophils incubated with IL-3 and IL-5 demonstrated an increase in the percentages of cells that stained for TGF-B1 in all donors .
IL-4-treated eosinophils demonstrated an increase in the percentage of cells stained for TGF-B1 in five of the six donors .
Eosinophils incubated with IL-3 and IL-5 demonstrated an increase in the number of cells that stained for TGF-a ; however , eosinophils incubated with IL-4 consistently showed a decrease in the intensities of staining as well as a decrease in the number of cells that stained for TGF- « in all six donors .
These results demonstrate that IL-4 increased the level of TGF-B1 protein in eosinophils from five of the six donors , while it consistently decreased the expression of TGF-a protein in eosinophils from all donors examined .
Effect of IL-3 , IL-4 , and IL-5 on TGF protein release by eosinophils Human peripheral blood eosinophils from three donors were incubated in the absence and presence of IL-3 , IL-4 , and IL-5 for 18 h. Cell-free supernatants from these cultures were assayed for TGF- « and TGF-B1 protein release by specific ELISAs .
The results demonstrated that IL-3 significantly enhanced TGF- « release by eosinophils in all three donors by 3.7- to 5.5-fold above the nonstimulated controls .
IL-5 also induced an increase in TGF-release in all three donors by 2.3- to 3-fold above control levels ( Fig .
3A ) .
IL-4 treatment led to a slight decrease of TGF- « release compared to nonstimulated control .
The effects of IL-4 and IL-5 on TGF- « release by the treated eosinophils were not significant .

Eosinophils express IL-4R and IL-4 signaling proteins 4PS and STAT6 Our observations demonstrated that eosinophils are responsive to IL-4 and therefore should express cell surface IL-4R .
To determine whether human eosinophils express receptors to IL-4 , peripheral blood human eosinophils were phenotyped for IL-4R by RT-PCR and flow cytometry .
Figure 44 shows that when using human IL-4R PCR primers ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) to amplify total RNA isolated from two normal donors , the expected 526-bp IL-4R PCR product was detected in both donors .
For flow cytometry , 2 % 10° purified eosinophils were incubated with mouse anti-human IL-4R a-chain mAb ( Immunotech ) .
Compared with the control ( black line ) , cells stained with anti-IL-4R -chain mAb showed a unimodal increase in fluorescence , indicating that human eosinophils constitutively express IL-4R « -chain ( Fig .
4B ) .
Since IL-4 is known to act in various cells via either the 4PS or STAT6 signaling pathways , Western blotting was used to evaluate these signal transduction proteins in lysates from peripheral blood human eosinophils .
Figure 5 demonstrates the detection of STAT6 and 4PS signaling molecules in normal human eosinophils .
The sizes of the human STAT6 and 4PS proteins are 100 and 170 kDa , respectively .
Discussion We and others have previously shown that human eosinophils in either infiltrating tumors or inflammatory disorders express TGF- « and TGE-B1 , whereas eosinophils from the peripheral blood of normal donors do not ( 2 , 3 , 11 , 12 ) .
Furthermore , a sequential expression of TGF-a @ followed by TGF-B1 by eosinophils was demonstrated in cutaneous wound healing in the hamster ( 4 ) .
These observations led us to hypothesize that biologic mediators in the tissue can regulate the expression of eosinophil-derived TGFs .
The results shown in this paper indicate that IL-3 and IL-5 can stimulate the expression of both TGF- « @ and TGF-B1 by normal peripheral blood eosinophils , whereas IL-4 up-regulates eosinophil synthesis of TGF-B1 but suppresses TGF- « expression at both the mRNA and protein level .

Since the number of eosinophils is relatively small in the circulating blood , it is often a challenge to obtain sufficient numbers of purified cells to conduct studies both on the mRNA and protein M1223 4 FIGURE 4 .

To overcome this difficulty , in situ techniques were employed enabling us to work with a small number of cells and facilitating specific identification of positive cells .
The inability to accurately quantify the immunohistochemical staining intensities precluded a direct comparison with the more quantitative mRNA labeling results generated by computer-assisted analysis .
Never-theless , we noted differences in the percentage of cells that stained for both TGFs , which correlated with the in situ hybridization results .
The inhibitory effect of IL-4 on the expression of TGF- was initially shown by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry , later confirmed by TGF-o-specific ELISA .
Although the amount of TGF- « released by the IL-4-treated eosinophils did not show a significant reduction by ELISA , a slight decrease was ob-served .
While the mechanism responsible for this apparent discrepancy is not clear , potential reasons for the observed finding include the sensitivity of the assays and increased stability of secreted TGF- protein when treated with IL-4 .
In the cytokine-treated human eosinophils , IL-4 consistently up-regulated expression of TGF-BIl , as shown by in situ hybridization , immunohistochemistry , and ELISA .
The activation of eosinophils and their accumulation in tissue sites is believed to be mediated by mechanisms that involve T cell-derived cytokines ( 13 ) .
In particular , a subset of helper T cells , Th2 , secretes IL-5 , which like IL-3 and GM-CSF is released by both Th1 and Th2 cells , influences eosinophil growth , maturation , and differentiation , and appears to be critical in prolonging the survival of eosinophils in tissues and allowing their movement into the tissues ( 14 ) .
Although these lymphokines have been shown to activate eosinophils and prime them for several other effector functions ( 15 , 16 ) , only a few studies have evaluated the effects of cytokines such as IL-3 or IL-5 on expression levels of eosinophil-derived cytokines .
In agreement with our study , Brach et al .
have shown that treatment with both IL-3 and IL-5 resulted in a sever-alfold increase of TGF- mRNA expression and in protein release by eosinophils ( 17 ) .
IL-4 , originally defined as a B cell growth factor ( 18 ) , has been demonstrated to be a pleiotropic cytokine with both stimulatory as well as inhibitory effects on monocytes .
The regulation of mononuclear cells by IL-4 has been widely studied .
IL-4 was shown to inhibit the production of cytokines such as IL-1 , TNF-a , and IL-6 , but to enhance the production of the IL-1 receptor antagonist , IL-1RA ( 19 ) .
Until now , however , the effect of IL-4 on the regulation of eosinophil-derived cytokines has not been examined .
IL-4 may indirectly effect eosinophils accumulation in tissue by promoting the adherence of eosinophils but not neutrophils to endothelium g s } $ , ] g. o .

( 100-kDa ) ( 20 ) .
In this study , we have demonstrated that IL-4 can affect eosinophils directly and that it can differentially regulate the synthesis of TGF by eosinophil .
Consistent with the theory that IL-4 acts to regulate eosinophil function , we have shown by RT-PCR and flow cytometry that normal human eosinophils express IL-4R .
Since IL-4 is known to mediate its pleiotropic effects on cellular responses via 4PS or STAT6 signal pathways , we have further demonstrated the presence of these signaling proteins in lysates obtained from peripheral blood eosinophils ( Fig .
5 ) .
This is consistent with the recent results of Baskar et al .
( 26 ) and Dubois et al .
( 27 ) , which demonstrated that mature eosinophils do respond to IL-4 .
In future studies , we plan to use these findings to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of TGF genes expression .
The findings described above may have important implications in the context of our in vivo wound-healing studies .
We previously demonstrated a wound-healing model in the hamster in which eosinophils infiltrate into cutaneous healing wounds and elaborate both TGF-a « and with the expression of TGF- « preceding that of TGE-B1 ( 4 ) .
Our results in this study suggest that IL-4 may act as an in situ regulator of TGF expression by eosinophils .
In the postacute phase of healing , IL-4 may shut off TGF-a production and concurrently enhance TGF-B1 production , which may promote extracellular remodeling and inhibit epithelial proliferation .
Future investigations will be aimed at determining whether local expression of IL-4 in the healing wound correlates with the switching of TGF expression by the infiltrating eosinophils .
In support of IL-4 as a facilitator of wound healing , Kucukcelebi et al .
reported that exogenous application of IL-4 accelerated healing and improved the breaking strength of a wound ( 21 ) .
In other studies , we have demonstrated that eosinophils infiltrating hamster and human squamous carcinomas represent a source of TGF-a ( 1 , 2 ) .
In addition to its mitogenic effect on epithelial cells and its implication in malignant transformation , TGF-a « has also been shown to be a potent angiogenic factor ( 8 ) .
Since eosinophils can express the inhibitory cytokine TGF-B1 as well , it is possible that in situ mediators such as IL-4 can induce eosinophils to produce TGF-B1 and not TGF- « , leading to inhibition of tumor cell growth .
This hypothesis is interesting in light of recent reports by Tepper et al .
( 22 , 23 ) describing an eosinophil-dependent mechanism for the anti-tumor effect of IL-4 ( 24 ) .
In recent years , eosinophils have been shown to synthesize a wide array of cytokines , suggesting a functional versatility of these granulocytes .
Little is known , however , about the control and regulation of eosinophil-derived cytokine production .
In this study , we demonstrate that IL-4 can simultaneously up-regulate the synthesis of TGF-B1 and inhibit the synthesis of eosinophil-derived stats -a a E - N1 N2 N3 E - N1 N2 N3 kDa - 244 & - @ @ w® -- - 139 - ( 170-kDa ) 80 = 42 e - - 320-0 ® < l -- -- -i fm TGF- « , implying that the expression of cytokines by eosinophils can be differentially regulated .
The expression of TGFs by eosinophils may be modulated in a selective manner by particular cytokines present in the microenvironment of various pathologic and physiologic processes , which may significantly affect eosinophil function in vivo ( 25 ) .
A better understanding of TGF regulation by these cells may have therapeutic implications for processes involving eosinophils such as wound healing , carcinogenesis , and allergic inflammation .
