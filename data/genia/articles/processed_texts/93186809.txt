4989-4996 , 1993 Printed in U.S.A. A Serum Response Element and a Binding Site for NF-Y Mediate the Serum Response of the Human Thrombospondin 1 Gene* Paul Framsont and Paul Bornsteint§ !
( Received for publication , September 1 , 1992 ) From the Departments of { Biochemistry and §Medicine , University of Washington , Seattle , Washington 98195 The expression of thrombospondin 1 ( TSP 1 ) , a member of the TSP gene family , is rapidly induced by growth factors .
We tested the ability of human TSP 1-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs to respond to serum in stably transfected NIH-3T3 cells .
Two transcriptional elements in the TSP 1 promoter , a distal element at -1280 and a proximal element at -65 , were required for the response of the human TSP 1 gene to serum .
The distal element contains the 5'-CC ( A + T ) , GG-3 ' consensus sequence characteristic of a serum-response element ( SRE ) .
Deletions or mutations in this element reduced the serum response of the TSP 1 gene by 80-90 % .
In gel-shift assays , the -1280 element and the c-fos SRE cross-competed , whereas their functional and binding mutants did not .
The proximal element contains the sequence G-3 ' , which closely resembles the consensus binding motif for the CCAAT-binding factor NF-Y ( CBF , CP1 , a « CP1 ) } .
Deletions or mutations in this element also reduced the serum response by 80-90 % .
Methylation interference analysis of the -65 region identified a pattern of contacts with nuclear factors resembling that for NF-Y , and an NF- Y-binding site and the proximal TSP 1 element cross-competed in gel-shift assays , whereas their binding mutants did not .
Finally , an abbreviated TSP 1 promoter/5'-flank , containing the SRE- and NF-Y-binding sites , mediated a serum response that was close in magnitude to that of the parent promoter .
We conclude that the serum response of the human TSP 1 gene requires the coordinated function of an SRE - and NF-Y -binding site .
Thrombospondin ( TSP ) is a trimeric secreted protein , originally identified as an abundant constituent of platelet a-granules and now known to be associated with the extracellular matrix and cell surfaces of diverse cell types , including fibroblasts , smooth muscle cells , and glial cells .
Functions for TSP have been identified in blood clotting , in cell attachment , migration and growth , in neurite outgrowth , and in control of angiogenesis ( for reviews , see Refs .
1 and 2 ) .
A role for TSP in growth of smooth muscle cells was first shown by its ability * This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health Grants HL 18645 and DFE 08229 .

to enhance epidermal growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis ( 3 , 4 ) .
Subsequently , anti-TSP monoclonal antibodies were shown to inhibit entry of G , -arrested smooth muscle cells into Gi ( 5 ) .
The diversity of functions ascribed to TSP led us to propose that , for some cells , TSP functions as an extracellular morphogen ( 6 ) .
Consistent with this proposal , TSP could play a role in the dramatic changes in cell morphology that coincide with mitogenesis ( 7 ) .
Indeed , the identities of a subset of immediate early genes ( see below ) suggest a program of mor-phogenetic events that extends from the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton .
This subset includes ( in addition to TSP ) the extracellular matrix or cell surface-associated proteins , fibronectin and cyr 61 , the integral membrane proteins , tissue factor and the a and $ subunits of fibronectin integrin , and the cytoskeletal proteins , G-actin and « -tropomyosin ( 8 , 9 ) .
Recently , TSP has been found to comprise a family of at least three genes : TSP 1 , TSP 2 , and TSP 3 ( 1 , 10-12 ) .
We ( 13 ) and others ( 14 ) have previously described the TSP 1 promoter .
The TSP 1 gene is clearly growth-responsive ( 15 , 16 ) , whereas the TSP 2 gene is either nonresponsive ( 10 ) or requires stringent conditions of quiescence to show its responsiveness ( 17 ) .
The response of TSP 3 to growth factors has not yet been reported .
This study addresses the basis for the growth responsiveness of the TSP 1 gene .
In accord with its ability to play a role in mitogenesis of some cells , TSP 1 protein ( 18 , 19 ) , mRNA accumulation ( 15 , 16 , 20 ) , mRNA stability ( 20 ) , and transcription ( 20 ) , are all up-regulated by a number of growth factors .
Furthermore , up-regulation of mRNA levels by platelet-derived growth factor ( 16 ) and bovine fibroblast growth factor ( 20 ) occurs in the presence of cycloheximide , a finding that demonstrates independence of prior protein synthesis and qualifies TSP 1 as a member of the immediate early gene family .
Lau and Nathans ( 9 ) have organized the immediate early genes into three groups according to the kinetics of their transcriptional responses to growth factors and subsequent changes in mRNA levels .
Accordingly , group I genes show induction of mRNA synthesis within 5 min of growth stimulation .
Transcriptional initiation peaks by 10-20 min and mRNA levels peak within an hour .
c-fos is a prototypical group I gene .
Group II gene mRNA levels peak approximately 2 h after stimulation , with peak transcriptional initiation occurring between 1 and 2 h post-stimulation .
c-myc is a prototypical group II gene .
Group III genes show changes in transcription and mRNA accumulation that increase more slowly and persist for several hours , beyond the times when groups I and II mRNAs have returned to preinduced levels .
Fibronectin is prototypical for group III .
TSP 1 displays characteristics that are intermediate between groups I and III .
Its peak transcriptional initiation , from 10 to 30 min post-stimulation ( 20 ) , is characteristic of group I genes .
However , its peak mRNA accumulation at 3-4 ° P. Framson , unpublished data .
4989 4990 h post-stimulation ( 15 , 16 , 20 ) and its 4-8 h mRNA half-life ( 20 ) are characteristic of group III genes .
The large temporal delay between the peaks of transcriptional initiation and mRNA accumulation for TSP 1 could be a consequence of the long mRNA half-life , of post-stimulation increases in mRNA half-life ( 20 ) , and of the time required for mRNA elongation of an 18-kilobase structural gene ( 9 , 21 ) , compared with that for c-fos which is 4 kilobases .
The kinetics-based groupings described by Lau and Nathans ( 9 ) are likely to be augmented in the future by a classification of immediate early genes according to the underlying pathways involved in their activation .
For example , Lau and Nathans ( 9 ) observed that many group I genes , but not all , have either been shown to be transcriptionally regulated through an SRE ( 22 ) , as are c-fos , G-actin , Krox 24 , and Krox 20 , or to possess an SRE motif in the sequenced regions of their promoters .
Indeed , a sequence closely resembling an SRE has been noted in the promoter for human ( 13 , 14 ) and mouse ( 21 ) TSP 1 .
In this study we have explored the pro-moter/5 ' -flank of human TSP 1 for elements that mediate its response to calf serum .
We identified two elements , one of which is , in fact , an SRE , and the other is a binding site for the CCAAT motif-binding factor , NF-Y .
These elements in conjunction with the TATA box region , mediate the response of the human TSP 1 promoter to serum .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Plasmids-All plasmid constructions were verified by restriction analysis , and in cases of mutagenesis , by partial DNA sequencing .
Numerical designations for TSP 1 sequences are as described in Ref .
13 .
The parental construct , -2033 CAT , contains the human TSP 1 sequence from -2033 to +750 and has been described ( 23 ) .
The following members of a 5'-deletion series were derived by religating vectors derived from -2033 CAT after the following treatment : 1 ) -1539 CAT , Sall and Bsu836I restriction and Klenow fill-in ; 2 ) -1270 CAT : Sall and HindIII restriction and Klenow fill-in ; 3 ) -342 CAT , Pstl and Sacll restriction and T4 polymerase blunting .
The Sall site in these constructions originates from the vector polylinker sequence 5 ' to the PstI site at -2033 .
-1290 CAT was derived from -2033 CAT in a manner similar to -1270 CAT , except that the Klenow step was eliminated and two oligonucleotides spanning the human TSP 1 sequence from -1290 to -1270 and complementary to Sail at the 5'-end and HindIII at the 3'-end , were annealed and included in the ligation .
The two oligonucleotides are 5-TCGACTGAGATCCTTATTTGGTCA-3 ' and 5'-AGCTTGACCAAATAAGGATCTCAG-3 ' .
-2033 ( mut -1280 ) CAT was derived from -2033 CAT by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis ( 24 ) using -2033 CAT ( in the phagemid pBS* ) as template .
The mutagenizing oligonucleotide was 3 ' in which the underlined `` T `` represents a substitution for a conserved C in the CArG core of the SRE .
-89 CAT was derived from -342 CAT in the following way .
A vector was created from -342 CAT by excising the segment between -342 and +166 by Accl restriction followed by Klenow fill-in and NotI restriction .
This vector was then ligated to a -89 to +166 fragment derived from a sequencing deletion template ( 13 ) by EcoRI restriction followed by Klenow fill-in and Nof restriction .
-38 CAT was derived in the following way : -1270/66 bGH ( 23 ) was restricted by Bsml ( at -38 ) , blunt-ended with T4 polymerase , and digested with BamHI ( at the human TSP 1/bGH junction ) to release the -38 to +66 fragment , which was ligated to pBS*hGH ( 23 ) to generate -38/ 66 bGH .
This product was then restricted with PstI ( in the polylinker ) and BssHII to liberate the -38 to -23 fragment .
-2033 CAT was treated with Pstl and BssHII to eliminate the -2033 to -23 segment and to produce the appropriate vector .
Finally , this vector was ligated to the -38 to -23 fragment .
-2033 ( A-238/-38 ) CAT was derived by ligating a vector prepared by Sall restriction followed with Klenow fill-in and Sacl restriction of -38 CAT , to a fragment generated from -2033 CAT by BssHII restriction ( at -238 ) , Klenow fill-in , and Sacl restriction .
-2033 ( A-238/-89 ) CAT and -2033 ( A-238/-89 ; mut -65 ) CAT were derived as was -2033 ( A-238/-38 ) CAT , except that their parent vectors were prepared , respectively , from -89 CAT and -89 ( mut Serum Response of Thrombospondin 1 -65 ) CAT ( see below ) by Xbal restriction and Klenow fill-in followed by SacI restriction .
-89 ( mut -65 ) CAT was derived in the following way .
A polymerase chain reaction product was generated with the M13 universal oligonucleotide , a mutagenizing oligonucleotide , and a sequencing deletion template ( 13 ) bearing human TSP 1 sequences from -2033 to approximately +30 .
The mutagenizing oligonucleotide was TAGAGTCGAATTCGCTTCCTGCCCGGCCGCCGAAGCTTCTT GTAAGGAATCCCCAGGAATGCG-3 ' bearing polylinker Xbal and EcoRI sites at its 5'-end ( the mutant nucleotides are underlined ) .
The polymerase chain reaction product was blunt-ended with T4 polymerase , kinased , and ligated , and restricted with Xbal and BssHII to generate a mutant -89 to -23 fragment .
Finally , this fragment was ligated to a vector prepared by Xbal and BssHII restriction of -89 CAT .
-1307 ( A-1228/-89 ) CAT was generated by ligating a fragment whose 5'-end is the HphI site at -1307 blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase , and whose 3'-end is the Eco47II1 site at -1228 , to a vector generated from -89 CAT by Xbal restriction and Klenow fill-in .
T7ARsa CAT was constructed as follows : -38/66 bGH ( see above ) was treated with Avel and Klenow followed by HindIII to liberate a -38 to 15 fragment for ligation into a vector prepared from -1270 CAT by treatment first with BamHI and Klenow , and then with HindIl1 , to liberate its -1270 to 750 segment .
The product , -38 CAT , was then treated with PstI and Rsal to liberate a 205-bp fragment bearing TSP 1 intron 1 sequence adjoining 150 bp of the 5'-end of the CAT structural gene .
This fragment was lastly ligated to Smal-and Pstl-restricted pBS* .
mTS6PPO.5 was created by ligating a 500-bp Pstl fragment spanning intron 4 and parts of exons 4 and 5 of mouse TSP 1 ( 23 ) into the PstI site of pBS* .
pKONeo ( 25 ) , pUC119 bearing the SRE , and pUC119 bearing the SRE pm12 mutation ( 26 ) have all been published .
Cell Culture , Transfection , and Assays of Gene Expression-NIH-3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium + 10 % calf serum .
For the serum stimulation assay , cells were plated at 9 x 10° cells/10-cm dish .
Approximately 40 h later they were washed once with warm phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 24 h in quiescence medium ( Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium + 0.4 % calf serum ) .
Stimulation was achieved by supplementing the quiescence medium with 15 % fetal bovine serum .
All media were supplemented with penicillin , streptomycin , and butyl-p-hydroxy-benzoate .
All media used for culture of stably transfected cells were supplemented with 400 ug/ml ( activity ) Geneticin ( Gibco ) .
Stable cell populations were multiclonal and were established by electroporating the TSP 1-CAT constructs , together with pKONeo , at a mass ratio of 15:1 .
Gene activities in stably transfected cells were assayed by RNase protection ( 27 ) of total cellular RNA ( 28 ) .
T7ARsa CAT and mTS6PPOQ.5 ( see above ) were used to generate riboprobes to assay the transgene and endogenous gene mRNAs , respectively .
T7ARsa CAT protected 150 bases within the coding part of the CAT transgene mRNA , whereas mTS6PPO.5 protected 181 bases and 90 bases of exons 5 and 4 , respectively , in mouse TSP 1 .
Since specific mRNA levels in quiescent cells were very low and , in some cases , very high in serum-stimulated cells , we optimized quantitation by synthesis of riboprobes with [ *P ] CTP ( 3000 Ci/mmol ! )
and by quantitation of gels by imaging with a Molecular Dynamics Model 4005s Phosphorimager .
Analysis of DNA-Nuclear Factor Binding-Nuclear extracts were prepared from NIH-3T3 cells as described in Ref .
29 .
For gel shift , 8-10 ug of extract were incubated with specific and nonspecific DNA in 20 ul of nuclear dialysis buffer ( 29 ) .
Extract was incubated with nonspecific DNA at room temperature for 10 min .
Probe and specific competitor ( when appropriate ) were added and incubated an additional 25 min at room temperature .
Gel-shift reactions were electro-phoresed at room temperature on 4 % 30:1 polyacrylamide-bis gels buffered with 0.045 m Tris borate , 0.001 M EDTA .
Methylation interference analysis was performed using the Maxam and Gilbert sequencing protocol as described ( 25 ) .
Probe-specific binding conditions ( in addition to nuclear dialysis buffer composition ( 29 ) ) are as follows : TSP 1 -1280 , c-fos SRE , TSP 1 -65 , NF-Y and SP1 , 2 ug of calf thymus DNA/20 Ll ; CTF , 50 mM KCl , 5 mm MgCl , , 2 ug of calf thymus DNA/20 Ll ; and , C/EBP , 5 mM MgCl ; , 2 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) , 20 ul .
Gel-shift assay with CP2 as probe utilized a HeLa nuclear extract ( 30 ) and 2 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) / 20 ul .
The calf thymus DNA used in these assays was prepared by shearing and boiling .
Cloned DNA gel-shift probes and competitors are as follows .
The TSP 1 -1280 fragment extends from -1307 to -1228 and was prepared from -1307 ( A-1228/-89 ) CAT ( see above ) by restriction Serum Response of Thrombospondin 1 with BamHI and EcoRI .
The TSP 1 -1280 mutant fragment also extends from -1307 to -1228 and was prepared from -2033 ( mut -1280 ) CAT by HphI and Eco47III restriction .
The c-fos SRE fragment and the c-fos SRE mutant fragment were prepared by HindIII and EcoRI restriction of pUC119 bearing the SRE and pUC119 bearing the SRE pM12 mutation , respectively ( 26 ) .
The TSP 1 -65 fragment and the TSP -65 mutant fragment were prepared by Xbal and Bsml restriction of -89 CAT and -89 ( mut -65 ) CAT , respectively .
For preparation of gel shift probes the appropriately restricted plasmids were radiolabeled with T4 polymerase or Klenow prior to gel purification .
Oligonucleotide-derived binding elements were generated as follows .
NF-Y and NF-Y mutant are 34-mers corresponding to nucleotides -71 to -38 of the Ea gene ( 31 ) , except that the NF-Y mutant contains a CCAAT to CCAAA mutation .
SP1 is the high-affinity SP1-binding site in the first intron of « 1 type I collagen ( 30 ) .
CTF is the CTF/NF1 binding element in Ref .
32 except that it is extended on the 5'-end of each strand with GG dinucleotides .
C/EBP is as in Ref .
33 .
CP2 is as in Ref .
34 except that the sequence conforms precisely with the mouse -globin gene between -95 and -125 .
These oligonucleotides were all purified on polyacrylamide gels before use .
When used as gel-shift probes , oligonucleotides were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase or Klenow , and then repurified on polyacrylamide gels .
RESULTS Two Regions of the TSP 1 Promoter/5'-Flank , between -1290 and -1270 and between -89 and -38 , Display Serum-regulated Function-We initially attempted to devise an assay of serum regulation in transient expression , as was first reported for the c-fos promoter ( 35 ) .
However , the 3-6-fold induction by serum of the transfected -2033 CAT construct , obtained with this assay , was too small and variable for identification of cis-regulatory elements .
The approach that ultimately succeeded relied upon identification of a strain of NIH-3T3 cells in which the endogenous mouse TSP 1 gene was induced roughly 100-fold by fetal calf serum .
This strain became the parent cell line for stable expression of -2033 CAT and its derivatives .
Fig .
1A shows a representative time course of changes in the levels of -2033 CAT and the endogenous mouse TSP 1 mRNAs , determined by ribonuclease protection after serum stimulation of these NIH-3T3 cells .
The results are depicted graphically in Fig .
1B .
The behavior of the transgene and that of the endogenous gene were similar during the first 2 h of serum stimulation .
This close parallel provides the basis of the functional assay for the serum response of the TSP 1 gene .
The serum response of the transgene is defined as the fold response of the transgene mRNA , divided by the fold response of the endogenous gene mRNA , at 2 h. For the -2033 CAT transgene in Fig .
1 , the serum response is approximately 1.0 .
Fig .
2 presents the serum responses of members of a 5'-deletion series derived from -2033 CAT .
These serum responses fell , with one exception , into two categories : approximately 1 and 0.15 .
Members of the deletion series that contained at least 1290 bp of 5 ' -flanking DNA showed serum responses of about 1 ; those containing 5'-flanking DNA of 1270 bp or less showed serum responses of about 0.15 .
Therefore , the region between -1290 and -1270 mediates serum-regulated function .
The shortest member of the series , -38 CAT , showed a serum response which appeared to be less than 0.15 , a finding that suggested a serum-regulated function for the region between -89 and -38 .
Construction of a pair of plasmids with internal deletions spanning this region ( Fig .
3 , lines 2 and 3 ) , enabled us to determine the influence of this region in the context of the full promoter/5'-flank .
The A-238/-38 promoter deletion reduced the serum response of the CAT gene to about 0.15 ; however , the serum response of the CAT gene with the A-238/-89 internal promoter deletion was about 4991 Hours after A. serum 0 1 2 3 4 5 stimulation ug RNA/lane 35 .

4992 equal to that of -2033 CAT .
Therefore , the -89 to -38 region is the serum-responsive subregion of the -238 to -38 sequence and has an influence on the serum response of the TSP1 gene that is equal in magnitude to that of the region between -1290 and -1270 .
-1307 ( A-1228/-89 ) CAT ( Fig .
3 , line 4 ) contains both the -1290 to -1270 and -89 to -38 regions but lacks most of the rest of the promoter/5'-flank .
Its serum response of 0.84 was close to that of -2033 CAT ; this finding , in conjunction with earlier results , suggests that all essential serum-regulated elements in the promoter/5'-flank lie in two regions : -1290 to -1228 and -89 to -38 .
The experiments that follow identify two transcriptional elements within these regions , cen-tered , respectively , at -1280 and -65 .
The -1280 Region Displays the Functional and Nuclear Factor-binding Attributes of an SRE -- 1280 is the center of a sequence that resembles the c-fos SRE , and is conserved between the human and the mouse TSP 1 promoter ( Fig .
4 ) .
The `` CArG `` core , a C dinucleotide followed by 6 As or Ts followed by a G dinucleotide , characteristic of an SRE , is conserved among the three genes .
Fig .
4 also shows the 5'-sequence end points of -1290 CAT and -1270 CAT .
A deletion from -1290 to -1270 , which removes most of the SRE motif , reduced the serum response of the resulting construct to approximately 0.15 ( Fig .
2 , compare lines 3 and 4 ) .
Trans-fection of -2033 ( mut -1280 ) CAT tested the function of the SRE motif more specifically because the construct contains a T for C substitution in the 5 C dinucleotide of the SRE motif ( Fig .
4 ) .

The c-fos SRE shown is sufficient to confer serum responsiveness upon a nonresponsive promoter ( 26 ) and conforms closely with the outlines of DNase protection by SRF-contain-ing nuclear complexes ( 36 ) .
Serum Response of Thrombospondin 1 response factor , SRF ( see `` Discussion `` ) .
Analogous one-base mutations of the c-fos SRE impair or abolish binding of SRF to the c-fos SRE ( 37 ) .
Fig .
3 shows that -2033 ( mut -1280 ) CAT yielded a serum response that was close to that observed with -1270 CAT ( compare Fig .
3 , line 5 , with Fig .
2 , line 4 ) .
These results demonstrate a function for the -1280 region , consistent with its identity as an SRE .
We performed a competition gel-shift assay with nuclear extracts from NIH-3T3 cells , utilizing as probe a fragment containing the -1280 region ( Fig .
54 ) or the c-fos SRE ( Fig .
5B ) .
The -1280 fragment , the -1280 mutant , the c-fos SRE , and the c-fos SRE mutant , pm12 , were used as competitors .
The pm12 mutant is defective for SRF binding and for function in the c-fos serum response ( 26 ) .
As shown in Fig .
54 , the -1280 fragment , when used as a probe , produced a gel-shifted band that was competed by the unlabeled ~1280 fragment and by the c-fos SRE , but not by the -1280 mutant , nor by the SRE mutant .
As shown in Fig .
5B , the c-fos SRE , when used as a probe , produced a gel-shifted band that comigrated with that produced by the -1280 fragment ; this band shift demonstrated the same competition pattern as did the band shift produced with the -1280 fragment .
These findings , together with the functional data , establish the -1280 region as an SRE .
The Serum-responsive Function of the -89 to -38 Region Is Attributable to an NF- Y-binding Site at -65-The sequence between -89 and -38 in the TSP 1 promoter ( designated the -65 region ) and a -65 mutant sequence are shown in Fig .
6A .
The -65 mutant incorporates substitutions for 10 closely contacted nucleotides , determined by methylation interference analysis of a gel-shifted band produced by the -65 region ( Fig .
7 ) .
These interactions are also portrayed schematically in Fig .
6B and are compared with the contacted nucleotides previously established for the NF-Y binding site in the class II major histocompatibility complex ( 31 ) and for the CP1-binding site in the adenovirus major late promoter ( 32 ) .
NF-Y and CP1 are closely related , if not identical , binding factors ( see `` Discussion `` ) .
The three methylation interference patterns show the same contacted purines on both strands of the DNA within the CCAAT motif itself .
Furthermore , as shown in Fig .
6C , the CCAAT motif in TSP 1 exists in a sequence context which shows additional similarities with the consensus binding sites for NF-Y and CP1 .
The comparisons summarized in Fig .
6 , B and C , led us to test for the ability of an NF-Y-binding site to compete with the -65 region by gel-shift analysis .
The analyses in Fig .
84 show a single shifted band produced by the TSP 1 -65 DNA fragment which is competed by an excess of -65 fragment or NF-Y oligonucleotide , but not by mutant -65 fragment or by mutant NF-Y oligonucleotide .
The NF-Y oligonucleotide also yielded a shifted band that comigrated with that formed with the -65 probe ( Fig .
84 ) and the specific gel-shifted band was competed by excess unlabeled NF-Y oligonucleotide or by the -65 DNA fragment but not by their respective mutants ( Fig .
8B ) .
These findings suggest that the -65 region contains an NF-Y-binding site ; together with the severely compromised serum response observed for the construct -2033 ( A-238/-89 ; mut -65 ) CAT ( Fig .
3 , line 6 ) , these findings demonstrate that the NF-Y-binding site is involved in the serum response of the TSP 1 gene .
The -65 region in TSP 1 also contains a GC box , the core of the SP1 consensus binding site ( 39 ) , and CCAAT motifs are part of a subset of the binding sites characterized for CP2 ( 40 ) , C/EBP ( 41 ) , and CTF ( 42 ) , We therefore wished to determine whether any of these previously characterized transcription factors interacted with the -65 region of TSP1 .

The arrow in B designates the specific gel-shifted band .
contribution of each of these factors to the binding activity demonstrated by the -65 fragment was therefore tested by gel-shift analysis .
Fig .
9 shows that binding sites for these factors failed to compete with the -65 fragment for binding to factors in the NIH-3T3 nuclear extract .
However , each of the binding sites was capable of forming saturable complexes with either an NIH-3T3 extract ( SP1 , C/EBP , and CTF ) or a HeLa nuclear extract ( CP2 ) ( data not shown ) .
These findings , by exclusion , provide further support for the presence of an NF-Y -binding site in the -65 region of TSP 1 .

NF-Y Consensus TSP 1 -65 CP1 Consensus DISCUSSION In this study we have begun to map the elements that mediate the rapid induction of the human TSP 1 gene by serum .
The arrangement within the TSP 1 promoter of an SRE centered at -1280 and an NF-Y-binding site at -65 is in keeping with the organization of many promoters that combine the function of a proximal element with that of a more distant enhancer ( 43 ) .
The most relevant comparison may be with the B-actin promoter .
Thus , the serum response of B-actin also requires both an SRE and an NF-Y-binding site ( 44 , 45 ) .
However , the spatial arrangement of these regulatory elements differs from that in TSP 1 .
In B-actin , the two elements are closely situated within a 50-bp region centered at -75 relative to the transcription start site , and the NF-Y-binding site is upstream of the SRE .
Like TSP 1 , $ -actin shows growth factor-response kinetics intermediate between those of groups I and III genes ( 9 ) , with transcription and mRNA accumulation peaking 15 min and 4-8 h , respectively , post-induction ( 46 , 47 ) .
The comparison between B-actin and TSP 1 is considered again below in relation to the functional synergism between cis-acting elements in transcriptional regulation .
An SRE , at -1280 , Is Involved in the Serum Response of the TSP 1 Gene-The evidence for the identity of the SRE in TSP 1 , and for its function in the serum response of the TSP 1 gene , is as follows .
( a ) A discrete deletion of the SRE motif reduced the serum response of a TSP-CAT construct by 85 % in stably transfected NIH-3T3 cells ( compare Fig .
2 , lines 3 and 4 ) .
( b ) Mutation of a single nucleotide in the preserved CArG box at the core of the SRE ( Fig .
44 ) , a mutation which has been found to reduce or disrupt nuclear factor binding to the c-fos SRE ( 37 ) , also reduced the serum response of -2033 CAT by about 80 % ( compare Fig .
3 , lines 1 and 5 ) .
( c ) The TSP -1280 element and the c-fos SRE yielded gel-shifted bands that comigrated ( Fig .
5 , A and B ) and are therefore likely to bind the same nuclear factors in NIH-3T3 cell G+A B F § ' 's wank .

( d ) A DNA fragment containing the SRE ( TSP 1 -1280 ) competed with the c-fos SRE for nuclear factor binding in a gel-shift assay ( Fig .
5B ) and , conversely , the c-fos SRE effectively competed with the TSP -1280 element ( Fig .
5A ) .
( e ) Mutations in the -1280 element that reduced the serum response of TSP-CAT constructs , and in the c-fos SRE that disrupted the binding of SRF , abolished the ability of mutated DNA elements to compete for nuclear factor binding to either the -1280 element or to the c-fos SRE ( Fig .
5 , A and B ) .
In addition to their ability to mediate serum responsiveness , SREs have been shown to be involved in transactivation of genes by platelet-derived growth factor , protein kinase C , cycloheximide , epidermal growth factor , and nerve growth factor ( 22 ) , v-sre ( 48 ) , Tax ( 49 ) , and casein kinase II ( 50 ) .
The SRE , and more specifically the muscle-specific CArG element , is also capable of tranducing signals directing muscle-specific expression and of mediating transcriptional repression ( 22 ) .
Thus , to the extent that expression of the TSP 1 gene is similarly influenced , it may be productive to examine the role of the SRE in other aspects of the regulation of expression of the TSP 1 gene .
The similar function of the SREs in TSP1 and c-fos suggests that studies of the c-fos SRE and the identification of nuclear factors that may function as co-activators and accessory proteins in regulation of c-fos expression ( 43 ) , may also be relevant to the regulation of TSP 1 .

Gel-shift analysis of the TSP 1 -65 region with nuclear extracts from NIH-3T3 cells utilizing the -65 DNA fragment as gel-shift probe in A and the NF-Y binding element as probe in A and B. factors have been described that bind directly to the c-fos SRE ( 22 , 51 , 52 ) , SRF is most directly implicated in the induction of c-fos by growth factors .

Gel-shift analysis of the TSP 1 -65 region with nuclear extracts from NIH-3T3 cells .
The results show the absence of competition by SP1 , CTF , C/EBP , and CP2 binding elements .

The -65 fragment was used as gel-shift probe .
preparation ( 53 ) .
Recombinant human TFIID ( TATA-binding protein ) does not substitute for highly purified TFIID , a finding that suggests the involvement of one or more co-activators termed TAFs ( TATA-binding protein-associated factor ) ( 54 ) .
A Proximal Element , at -65 , Binds NF-Y and Contributes to the Serum Response of the TSP 1 Gene-The evidence for the identity of the -65 element as an NF-Y-binding site , and for its role in the serum response of the TSP 1 gene , is as follows .
( a ) Deletion or mutation of the -65 element reduced the serum response of -2033 CAT by about 85 % in stably transfected NIH-3T3 cells ( Fig .
3 , compare line 1 with lines 2 or 6 ) .
( b ) The -65 element and the NF-Y consensus sequences are closely matched ( Fig .
6C ) and the bases contacted by the -65 region , as determined by methylation interference analyses with nuclear extracts from NIH-3T3 cells , correspond closely with those published for NF-Y ( 31 ) and CP1 ( 32 ) ( Fig .
6B ) .
( c ) The -65 region and the NF-Y oligonucleotide form similar nuclear factor-DNA complexes in a gel-shift assay ( Fig .
8A ) and are therefore likely to bind the same nuclear factors in NIH-3T3 cell extracts .
( d ) A -65 region fragment competed with the NF-Y oligonucleotide for nuclear factor binding in a gel-shift assay and , conversely , the NF-Y oligonucleotide effectively competed with the -65 region ( Fig .
8 , A and B ) .
( e ) A mutation in the -65 element that reduced the serum response of TSP-CAT constructs and a mutation in the NF-Y-binding site , that had previously been shown to disrupt NF-Y binding , abolished the ability of the respective binding sites to compete for nuclear factor binding in gel-shift assays ( Fig .
8 , A and B ) .
( f ) Nuclear factor binding to the -65 element was not competed by oligonucleotides bearing consensus binding sites for other candidate transcription factors including CTF , C/EBP , CP2 , and SP1 ( Fig .
9 ) .
On the basis of these findings and the ubiquity of NF-Y ( see below ) we identify the -65 element as a component in the serum 4995 response of the TSP 1 gene and as a binding site for NF-Y .
NF-Y is a member of a group of CCAAT-binding factors , the most completely characterized of which include mammalian factors « CP1 ( 55 ) , CP1 ( 32 ) , and CBF ( 56 ) and yeast factor , HAP 2,3,4 ( 57 ) .
The three mammalian factors have been characterized , respectively , in lymphoid cells , HeLa cells , and liver .
NF-Y binding activity was identified in a number of cells including macrophages and fibroblasts ( 58 ) , and its mRNA was present in all mouse tissues tested , including mammary and salivary glands , intestine , and colon ( 59 ) .
The following observations demonstrate either the identity or close relatedness of these four factors .
Two subunits of NF-Y , cloned from mouse ( 59 ) , two subunits of CBF ( 60 , 61 ) and HAP 2 and 3 are interspecies homologs of each other .
Isolated CP1 and HAP subunits , incapable of binding DNA them-selves , complement each other when reconstituted to form DNA-binding complexes ( 62 ) .
Binding sites for « CP1 and CP1 cross-compete in gel-shift assay ( 32 ) .
« CP1 is heterotri-meric ( 55 ) as is HAP 2,3,4 .
Recently a third subunit of CBF has also been reported ( 60 ) , although cloning of this third subunit , or a similar one from NF-Y , has not yet been reported .
Last , NF-Y ( 31 ) , « CP1 ( 55 ) , CP1 ( 32 ) , and CBF ( 63 ) are all intolerant of mutations within the CCAAT motif .
We have found that an « CP1-binding site cross-competed with the -65 fragment of TSP 1 in a gel-shift assay ; furthermore , an « CP1 oligonucleotide containing a CCAAT to CA-GAT mutation that is defective for « CP1 binding , failed to cross-compete with the TSP 1 -65 element ( data not shown ) .
In addition , the substitution of CCAAA for CCAAT in an NF-Y-binding site resulted in the inability of the mutant oligonucleotide to compete for binding to the TSP 1 -65 element ( Fig .
84 ) .
These results support our identification of the TSP -65 element as an NF-Y-binding site and are consistent with the requirement of NF-Y for an intact CCAAT motif .
In contrast to NF-Y , the transcription factors CP2 , C/EBP , and CTF can all bind effectively to sequences that lack a CCAAT motif .
C/EBP binds with high affinity to the viral enhancer core sequence 5 ( -TGTGG ( A/T ) ( A/T ) ( A/T ) G-3 ' ; the substitution of GCAAT for CCAAT in a CCAAT motif-containing binding element actually increased binding affinity ( 64 ) .
The palindrome 5'-TGG ( A/C ) N , GCCAA-3 `` ' that forms the consensus sequence for binding of CTF ( 65 ) only occasionally includes a CCAAT motif in one of its termini .
CP2 also binds with high affinity to a consensus sequence derived from the mouse « -globin gene , 5-GCN ( C/A ) NANC ( C/A ) AG-3 ' , a sequence that clearly lacks a CCAAT motif ( 34 ) .
The consensus sequences listed above are not well preserved within the -65 element of TSP 1 .
These observations are consistent with the failure of binding sites for CTF , CP2 , and C/EBP to cross-compete with the -65 fragment in gel-shift assays ( Fig .
9 ) .
The SRE and the NF-Y-binding Site Cooperate in the Serum Response of the TSP 1 Gene-As shown in Fig .
3 , the residual effect of either the SRE or NF-Y-binding site alone in mediating the serum response of the TSP 1 gene is small ( 15-20 % of the response with the intact promoter ) .
Thus , these elements and their respective transcription factors probably interact , and this interaction is likely to be functionally synergistic .
Cooperativity between an SRE and another element has also been shown in c-fos ( with a CRE to mediate the response to epidermal growth factor ( 66 ) ) , in Krox 20 and Krox 24 ( with CREs to mediate TAX responsiveness ( 67 ) ) , and in B-actin ( with an NF-Y-binding site to mediate serum responsiveness ( 44 , 45 ) ) .
In the cases of Krox 20 , Krox 24 , and B-actin , as in the case of TSP1 , these interactions were 4996 functionally synergistic .
These examples are illustrative of the promiscuity and synergism of interactions between SREs and other regulatory elements and provide indirect evidence for the function of co-activators in the regulation of promoters containing SREs , as suggested by the models for transcriptional regulation presented by Lin et al .
( 68 ) .
Another potentially interesting example of functional promiscuity of the SRE is provided by the mouse TSP 1 gene .
The mouse TSP 1 gene contains an SRE centered at -1210 ( Fig .
4 ) but lacks a consensus NF-Y-binding motif .
Instead , at -70 , in register with the human NF-Y-binding site , the mouse gene contains a perfect match with the consensus sequence for binding of Egr1/Krox 24/Zif 268 .
This finding suggests that Egr1 may function analogously to NF-Y in mediating the serum response of the mouse TSP 1 gene .
It is of interest that an NF-Y-binding site can be replaced functionally by AP1 , SP1 , or E2-binding sites for cooperation with an HNF1l-binding site in driving albumin expression ( 69 ) .
Perhaps , the divergence of the human and mouse TSP 1 genes has performed a related experiment .
Whether serum-regulated elements other than an SRE and an NF-Y-binding site are present in TSP 1 is unknown .
However , this study places constraints on their possible lo-cation .
The constructs examined in this study all contain an 700-bp region that extends from +66 to +750 , and includes the 3 ' part of the first exon and the entire first intron .
While the latter sequences contribute to the high level expression of TSP 1-CAT constructs by a post-transcriptional mechanism ( 23 ) , preliminary evidence suggests that this region is not required for the serum response of the TSP 1 gene ( data not shown ) } .
This observation , in conjunction with the behavior of -1307 ( A-1228/-89 ) CAT and -1290 CAT ( Fig .
2 and 3 ) , suggests that two regions , -1290 to -1228 and -89 to +66 , contain all the elements within the -2033 to +750 sequence that are required for the serum response of the human TSP 1 gene .
