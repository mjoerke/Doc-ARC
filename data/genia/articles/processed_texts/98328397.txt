1 , July 1998 Copyright © American Society for Investigative Pathology Macrophages in Human Atheroma Contain PPARy Differentiation-Dependent Peroxisomal Proliferator-Activated Receptor y ( PPARy ) Expression and Reduction of MMP-9 Activity through PPARy Activation in Mononuclear Phagocytes in Vitro Nikolaus Marx , Galina Sukhova , Curran Murphy , Peter Libby , and Jorge Plutzky From the Vascular Medicine and Atherosclerosis Unit , Cardiovascular Division , Brigham and Women 's Hospital , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts Mononuclear phagocytes play an important role in atherosclerosis and its sequela plaque rupture in part by their secretion of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , including MMP-9 .
Peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor y ( PPARy ) , a transcription factor in the nuclear receptor superfamily , regulates gene expression in response to various activators , including 15-deoxy-~ `` `` *-prostaglandin J , and the antidiabetic agent troglitazone .
The role of PPARy in human atherosclerosis is unexplored .
We report here that monocytes/macrophages in human atherosclerotic lesions ( # = 12 ) express immunostainable PPARy .
Normal artery specimens ( # = 6 ) reveal minimal immunoreactive PPARy .
Human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages cultured for 6 days in 5 % human serum expressed PPARy mRNA and protein by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting , respectively .
In addition , PPARy mRNA expression in U937 cells increased during phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate-induced differentiation .
Stimulation of PPARy with troglitazone or 15-deoxy-* ' `` `` *-prostaglandin J , in human monocyte-derived macrophages inhibited MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity in a concentration-dependent fashion as revealed by zymography .
This inhibition correlates with decreased MMP-9 secretion as determined by Western blotting .
Thus , PPARy is present in macrophages in human atherosclerotic lesions and may regulate expression and activity of MMP-9 , an enzyme implicated in plaque rupture .
PPAR » is likely to be an important regulator of monocyte/macrophage function with relevance for human atherosclerotic disease .
( Am J Pathol 1998 , 153:17-23 ) Macrophages influence many aspects of atherosclerosis , including the vulnerability of plaques to undergo disruption and thrombosis .
'* Pathological studies have shown abundant macrophages in ruptured atheroma . ``
In vitro biomechanical studies have shown that the fibrous cap of macrophage-rich plaques has reduced tensile strength .
The role of macrophages in plaque rupture may involve secretion of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , enzymes that participate in extracellular matrix degradation . ``
MMP-9 , also referred to as gelatinase B , is the predominant MMP secreted by monocytes/macrophages in vitro .
A number of inflammatory cytokines found in atheroma can augment MMP-9 expression by mononuclear phagocytes , including interleukin 1 , tumor necrosis factor a « , ° and CD40 ligand . ``
'' Nonetheless , the majority of atheroma are stable .
This suggests that inhibitors of MMP-9 expression must be at work , opposing the effects of proinflammatory mediators in the plaque .
We therefore undertook an effort to identify endogenous inhibitors of MMP-9 expression .
Work from other groups has established that activation of various nuclear hormone receptors can inhibit MMP expression through a variety of mechanisms . ``

1 the role of peroxisomal proliferation activator receptors ( PPARs ) , a subgroup of the nuclear receptor superfamily , as transcriptional mediators . ``
One of these , PPARy , has been implicated as a `` master regulator `` of lipid metabolism and adipogenesis ; ectopic overexpression of PPARy in fibroblasts redirects these cells into an adipo-genic program .
'* `` `` Like other nuclear receptors , PPARy contains a ligand binding domain and a central DNA binding domain , which interacts with PPAR response elements in the promoter of target genes .
'® Specific activators identified thus far include both the naturally occurring prostaglandin D metabolite 15-deoxy-~ ' 2'*-pros-taglandin J , ( 15 d-PGJ , ) !
`` '° and the synthetic antidiabetic agent troglitazone .
`` `` ~ `` The role of PPARy in nonadipocytes has received little attention , although expression had been previously noted in hematopoietic cell lines . ``
'' Recent work suggests PPARy stimulation can inhibit both cytokine-induced activation of macro-phages `` * and in vitro expression of transfected promoter constructs of genes implicated in atherogenesis , including MMP-9.2° The present study tested the hypotheses 1 ) that macrophages in human atheroma express PPARy , 2 ) that this novel nuclear receptor is regulated during differentiation of monocytes into macrophages , and 3 ) that PPARy activation can limit MMP-9 expression and enzymatic activity by these cells .
Materials and Methods Immunohistochemistry Surgical specimens of human carotid atherosclerotic lesions were obtained by protocols approved by the Human Investigation Review Committee at Brigham and Women 's Hospital .
Serial cryostat sections ( 5 mm ) were cut , air dried onto microscopic slides , and fixed in acetone at -20°C for 5 minutes .
Staining for PPARy was performed with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human PPARy peptide antibody ' `` ( a generous gift from Dr. Mitchell Lazar , University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , Philadelphia ) .
Macrophages were identified by staining with anti-CD68 antibody ( DAKO , Carpinteria , CA ) .
Sections were preincubated with PBS containing 0.3 % hydrogen peroxidase activity and stained for 1 hour with primary antibody diluted in PBS supplemented with 5 % appropriate serum .
Negative control was performed by preabsorbing the anti-PPARy antibodies with the peptide from which the antibody was derived and subsequently using these `` peptide-blocked PPARy antibodies `` at concentrations similar to those of experimental conditions .
Finally , sections were incubated with the respective bio-tinylated secondary antibody ( Vector Laboratories , Bur-lingame , CA ) followed by avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex ( Vectastain ABC kit , Vector Laboratories ) .
Antibody binding was visualized with 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole ( Vector Laboratories ) or with True Blue Peroxidase substrate ( Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories , Gaithersburg , MD ) .
Sections were counterstained with Gill 's Hematox-ylin or Contrast Red ( Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories ) .
Computer-assisted image analysis was used to quantify staining on sections using Optimas 5.2 software .
Percentage area of positive staining for PPARy or CD68 in the shoulders of the plaques , defined as the intimal regions flanking the lipid core , was compared with the percentage area of positive staining in other zones of the sec-tions .
Cell Culture Human monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers by sequential gradient centrifugation with Lymphocyte Separation Medium ( Organon Tech-nika , Durham , NC ) and One Step Monocytes ( Accurate Chemical and Scientific Co. , Westbury , NY ) .
Monocytes were plated at a concentration of 3 X 10° cells/L in serum-free M199 medium ( BioWhittaker , Walkersville , MD ) and isolated by adherence to plastic dishes at 37°C .
Nonadherent cells were washed three times with Hanks ' buffer ( Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD ) , and the remaining adherent cells were cultured in M199 medium with 5 % human serum at 37°C/5 % CO , ; .
Medium was changed every 2 days for 6 days , and resulting cells were used as `` monocyte-derived macrophages . ``
In some ex-periments , monocytes were cultured for 6 days with 5 % human serum in the absence or presence of PPARy activators troglitazone ( provided by Parke Davis ( Morris Plains , NJ ) and dissolved according to manufacturer 's instructions ) or 15 d-PGJ , ( CalbioChem , La Jolla , CA ) at concentrations indicated .
After 6 days , cells were changed to serum-free conditions , and supernatants were collected after 24 hours for further analysis .
The human monocyte-like cell line U937 , obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA ) , was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium ( BioWhittaker ) with 1 % glu-tamine ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) , 1 % penicillin-streptomycin ( Sigma ) and 10 % fetal calf serum .
RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction Total RNA from 10 `` cells was isolated by the single-step guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method using RNAzol from Tel-Test ( Friendswood , TX ) .
Two micrograms of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA with 1 U/ml reverse transcriptase ( Superscript , Life Technologies ) at 37°C for 1 hour in standard buffer .
For the amplification of PPARy cDNA , two oligonucleotide primers were designed from nucleotides +235 to 708 ( a 473-bp fragment ) : sense primer , 5'-TCTCTCCGTAATG-GAAGACC-3 ' ; anti-sense primer , 5'-CCCCTACAGAG-TATTACG-3 ' .
The polymerase chain reaction reaction was carried out in a standard buffer ( Life Technologies ) with 200 ng of each primer ( IDT , Coralville , CA ) , 33 mmol/L MgCl , and 0.5 U Taq polymerase ( Life Technologies ) for 30 cycles .
Polymerase chain reaction products ( 10 w//25ul reaction ) were analyzed on a 2 % agarose gel .
Northern Blot Analysis Five micrograms of total RNA from undifferentiated and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) -differentiated U937 cells was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.2 % agarose gel and transferred using traditional Northern blotting techniques .
The membranes were ultraviolet-crosslinked , prehybridized at 42°C ( 50 % formamide , 5 % Denhardt 's solution , 5X standard saline citrate , 0.5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , and 20 mmol/L salmon sperm DNA ) , and hybridized in the same buffer with a random primed radiolabeled ( [ « -P° `` ] dCTP ) Sal-1 fragment of pCMX-PPARy ( generously provided by Dr. Bruce Spiegelman , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , MA ) .
'* The membranes were washed at 60°C in 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate/2x standard saline citrate and exposed ( 1-3 days , -70°C ) to Kodak X-OMAT film with an intensifying screen .
Preparation of Nuclear and Cytosolic Extracts and Western Blot Analysis For Western blot analysis , a positive control was generated by transiently transfecting a PPARy expression con-struct , pCMX-PPARy , '* into human skin fibroblasts using lipofectamine ( Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
Nuclear and cytosolic extracts of 10 `` cells were prepared separately .
Cells were lysed in 10 mmol/L Hepes ( pH 7.9 ) , 1.5 mmol/L MgCl , 10 mmol/L KCI , and 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 .
Nuclei were pelleted at 13,000 x g for 5 minutes , and the resulting supernatant was used as the cytosolic fraction .
Nuclei were lysed in 20 mmol/L Hepes ( pH 7.9 ) , 1.5 mmol/L MgCl , , 420 mmol/L NaCl , and 0.2 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraac-etate .
After centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 5 minutes , the supernatant was diluted in an equal volume of 20 mmol/L Hepes ( pH 7.9 ) , 100 mmol/L KCI , 0.2 mmol/L ethyl-enediaminetetraacetate , and 20 % glycerol and used as nuclear extract .
Protein concentration of nuclear and cys-tolic extracts was determined using a protein assay ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) .
Processed samples were applied to 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels , and protein was transferred to nitrocel-lulose membranes ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) using semi-dry blotting for 1 hour , as described previously . ``
Membranes were blocked overnight in Tris-buffered saline-Tween with 5 % dry milk and incubated with goat anti-human PPARy monoclonal antibodies ( N-20 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , San Diego , CA ) for 1 hour .
After washing , membranes were stained with horseradigh-con-jugated rabbit anti-goat monoclonal antibodies .
Antigen detection was performed with a chemiluminescent detection system ( NEN , Boston , MA ) .
Similar methods were used to perform Western blots on MMP-9 in monocyte-derived macrophage supernatants using a specific rabbit anti-human MMP-9 antibody ( Oncogene Science , Cambridge , MA ) .

1 Substrate Gel Zymography Gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 from conditioned medium ( 10 wl/500 pl total supernatant loaded ) of monocytes or monocyte-derived macrophages was analyzed by zymography on gelatin-containing polyacrylamide . '
'' Equal amounts were loaded in each lane .
After washing in 2.5 % Triton X-100 , gels were incubated overnight at 37°C in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCI ( pH 7.4 ) containing CaCl , and 0.05 % Brij 35 .
Gels were stained in 0.1 % Colloidal Brilliant Blue ( Sigma ) , 10 % acetic acid , and 40 % methanol for 2 hours and destained in 10 % acetic acid and 40 % methanol .
Proteins having gelatinolytic activity were visualized as clear zones in an otherwise blue gel .
Photographs of the gels were scanned by an imaging densitometer and quantified using the NIH Image 1.6 software program .
To ensure that differences in protein amounts did not account for the differences seen , the zymographic data were normalized to the total amount of protein applied to each lane .
Of note , the total amount of protein did not vary significantly from sample to sample .
Results Macrophages in Human Atheroma Contain PPARy Analysis of human carotid atheroma ( n = 12 ) demonstrated immunoreactive PPARy co-localizing with macrophages ( Figure 1 , A and C ) , so identified by morphology and by staining of parallel sections with the macrophage-specific antibody anti-CD68 ( data not shown ) .
PPARy staining was mainly localized in the macrophage-rich shoulder region of the plaque ( Figure 1A ) , with 35 + 5 % of this area positive for PPARy and 54 + 6 % positive for macrophages , as determined by color image analysis .
Quantification of staining in nonshoulder regions revealed a 2 + 1 % area positive for PPARy and 8 + 1 % for macrophages .
Preabsorption of anti-PPARy antibodies with the peptide antigen abrogated staining in adjacent sections ( Figure 1B ) , indicating the specificity of the im-munostaining .
Higher-power views of PPARy-stained plaque ( indicated by the rectangle in Figure 1A ) showed staining predominantly in nuclei of macrophages ( Figure 1C ) .
Only occasional endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells in lesions showed immunoreactive PPARy ( data not shown ) .
Study of nonatheromatous arterial specimens { ( n = 6 ) showed scant PPARy in nuclei of vascular smooth muscle cells ( Figure 1D ) .
Cells of the Monocyte/Macrophage Lineage Express PPARy mRNA and Protein Freshly prepared monocytes , monocyte-derived macrophages , and PMA-treated U937 cells all contained PPARy mRNA as detected by a 473-bp reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction product ( Figure 2A , upper panel ) .

Expression of PPARy in human atherosclerotic lesions .
A : Low-power view of frozen section of human carotid lesions shows immunoreactive PPARy next to the lipid core in the shoulder region with abundant macrophages present .
Similar results were seen in other atherosclerotic specimens ( x = 12 ) .
B : No immunoreactive PPARy is detectable in parallel sections stained with PPARy antibodies preabsorbed with the immunizing peptide , indicating that staining for PPARy in ( A ) and ( C ) is specific .
Similar results were seen with immunoglobulin G controls ( not shown ) .
C : High-power view of the area indicated by the rectangle in ( A ) shows PPARy staining restricted to macrophage nuclei ( see quantification in Results ) .
D : In nonatherosclerotic arteries ( » = 6 ) , little PPARy could be detected , with scant staining in occasional vascular smooth muscle cells .
above-mentioned cells , as well as untransfected and PPARy-transfected fibroblasts , and performed Western blot analysis .
Nuclear extracts of monocytes , monocyte-derived macrophages , and differentiated UQ937 cells ( Figure 2A , lower panel ) , but not cytosolic fractions ( data not shown ) , contained PPARy protein .
The identity of this band as PPARy was supported by its lack of cytosolic expression , its expected apparent molecular weight ( 55 kd ) , and co-migration with a signal in fibroblasts transfected with a PPARy expression construct .
Untransfected fibroblasts demonstrate no cross-reacting band of the appropriate size ( Figure 2A , lower panel ) .
Increased PPARy Expression during PMA-induced Differentiation of U937 Cells To investigate further the regulation of PPARy during differentiation of cells of the monocytic lineage , U937 cells were stimulated with PMA ( 10 ug/L ) for 12 hours , and Northern blotting was performed .
This treatment increased PPARy mRNA expression ( Figure 2B ) .
Western blot analysis showed a parallel rise in protein levels in nuclear fractions of PMA-treated U937 cells ( data not shown ) .
Neither undifferentiated nor differentiated U937 cells demonstrate PPARy in the cytosol ( data not shown ) .
PPARy Activators Troglitazone and PGJ , ; Decrease Both Protein Levels and Gelatinolytic Activity of MMP-9 Secreted from Monocyte-Derived Macrophages To elucidate the functional relevance of PPARy activa-tion , we investigated the effect of the selective PPARy activators troglitazone and 15 d-PGJ ; , on MMP-9 activity in monocyte-derived macrophages .
Monocytes were cultured initially in human serum and then transferred to serum-free medium in the absence or presence of troglitazone or 15 d-PGJ , .
Secreted MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was then measured using substrate zymography .
As previously reported , culture of monocytes for 6 days with human serum substantially increases gelatinolytic activity in the supernatant compared with freshly prepared monocytes ( Figure 3A ) .

1 macrophages inhibited the increase in gelatinolytic activity in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 3A ) .
Quantification of gelatinolytic areas by densitometry revealed a reduction of MMP-9 activity after treatment with troglitazone ( 1 wM and 5 uM ) to 73.5 + 1.9 % and 53.3 + 12.2 % ( P < 0.01 ) , respectively , and with 15 d-PGJ , ( 1 M and 5 uM ) to 79.0 + 14.6 % and 45.5 + 8.9 % ( P < 0.01 ) , respectively , in both cases relative to control cells { ( n = 3 ) .
Similar results were seen in UQ937 cells ( data not shown ) .
Treatment with either troglitazone or 15 d-PGJ , after 6 days of culture in human serum had no effect ( data not shown ) , suggesting that PPARy activation was required during differentiation for inhibition of MMP-9 lev-els/activity to occur .
The identity of the observed gelatinolytic area was confirmed by the mobility of the band and co-migration with the known 92-kd gelatinolytic activity in PMA-treated human fibroblast supernatants ( Figure 3A ) .
Treatment of monocyte-derived macrophages with either PPAR activator , troglitazone or 15 d-PGJ , , reduces supernatant MMP-9 protein levels from monocyte-derived macrophages ( Figure 3B ) .
Co-migration with the known MMP-9 band of supernatants from PMA-stimu-lated vascular smooth muscle cells confirms identity of the detected band ( Figure 3B ) .
Discussion This study demonstrates PPARy expression in macrophages in human atherosclerotic lesions .
Furthermore , we find differentiation-dependent regulation of PPARy expression in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage in vitro .
Treatment of differentiated monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro with two different PPARy activators , 15 d-PGJ , or troglitazone , decreased both MMP-9 protein levels and MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity in a concentration-dependent manner .

1 macrophages and inflammatory cytokines in most plaques , some arterial plaques rupture , whereas others do not .
The factors accounting for this variability are unclear .
Certainly , monocytes/macrophages are intimately involved in plaque rupture .
? ``
As monocytes differentiate in the subintima into macrophages and foam cells , the atherogenic microenvironment influences transcriptional regulation of genes , the products of which will determine the natural history of the lesion . ``
MMPs furnish one example of proteins , the induction and expression of which by monocytes/macrophages likely contributes to subsequent plaque rupture .
?
Several lines of evidence indicate that lesional macrophages synthesize MMPs de These proteins are enzymatically active , as shown by zymographic analysis of human arterial spec-imens . ``
Secretion of these MMPs , with MMP-9 prominent among them , favors destabilization of the plaque 's fibrous cap . ``
Our findings suggest that PPARy , as a nuclear transcription factor present in lesional macrophages , may inhibit MMP expression and activity .
Furthermore , PPARy may control expression of other target genes within the arterial wall , thus modulating a cascade of responses in monocytes/macrophages after activation by its endogenous or synthetic ligand ( s ) .
15 d-PGJ , , a naturally occurring ligand for PPARy , likely interacts with monocytes/macrophages .
J ; , prosta-noids , and the immediate upstream precursors of 15 d-PGJ , ; , are found in vivo . ``
'' Prostaglandins themselves are synthesized from fatty acids , with arachadonic acid as the primary source .
15 d-PGD , , the major prostaglandin in most tissues , is converted to 15 d-PGJ , .°2 This process requires 15 d-PGD , synthetase , an enzyme produced primarily by macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells . ``
Thus , 15 d-PGJ , , acting through PPARy , may be an important regulator of macrophage function .
Troglitazone , a synthetic PPARy activator , is currently in clinical use as an antidiabetic agent.°*°° The implications of its effects on inhibiting macrophage MMP-9 matrix degradation merit further consideration in a clinical context .
A very recent report showed that the PPARy activator 15 d-PGJ , inhibits expression of an MMP-9 promoter luciferase construct when transfected into U937 cells . ``
'' Our findings support a critical role for PPARy in atherosclerosis , demonstrating its presence in monocytes/macrophages of human atheroma and increased expression during differentiation in vifro .
Furthermore , the present study of MMP -9 gelatinolytic activity illustrates directly the functional relevance of PPARy in these cells .
These results establish a rationale for further study of PPARy in monocyte/macrophage biology , particularly in the context of atherosclerosis .
