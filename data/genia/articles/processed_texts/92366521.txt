KOoRNBERG Department of Cell Biology , Fairchild Center , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , CA 94305 Communicated by Robert G. Roeder , May 4 , 1992 ABSTRACT Resolution of whole cell extract through two chromatographic steps yields a single protein fraction requiring only the addition of TFIID for the initiation of transcription at RNA polymerase II promoters .
This approach allows the convenient generation of RNA polymerase II transcription systems from Saccharomyces cerevisiae , human lymphocytes , and Schizosaccharomyces pombe .
TFIIDs from all three organisms are interchangeable among all three systems .
The S. cerevisiae and Sch .
pombe systems support effects of acidic activator proteins , provided a further protein fraction from S. cerevisiae is supplied .
This further fraction is distinct from the mediator of transcriptional activation described previously and represents a second component in addition to general initiation factors that may facilitate a response to acidic activators .
Transcription by RNA polymerase II in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe bears a greater resemblance to that in higher cells than to the process in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae .
Initiation by RNA polymerase II in both Sch .
pombe and higher cells usually occurs at a unique site 25-40 bp downstream of a single TATA element ( 1 ) .
When mammalian promoters are introduced into Sch .
pombe , initiation occurs at the same sites as those utilized in mammalian cells ( 2 , 3 ) .
By contrast , initiation in S. cerevisiae occurs 40-120 bp downstream of the TATA element ( 4 ) ; there are frequently multiple initiation sites and often multiple TATA elements as well .
Sch .
pombe is therefore particularly attractive as an organism amenable to genetic and biochemical analysis for elucidating mechanisms of RNA polymerase II transcription in mammalian cells .
Recent analyses of RNA polymerase II transcription in S. cerevisiae further motivate study of the process in Sch .
pombe .
Activities have been identified in extracts from S. cerevisiae that substitute for general initiation factors TFIIA ( 5 ) and TFIID ( 6 , 7 ) in a mammalian ( HeLa cell ) transcription system .
Genes encoding yeast and human TFIIDs were cloned on this basis ( 8-14 ) , and the products of these genes are functionally interchangeable between S. cerevisiae and HeLa systems in vitro ( 6 , 15 , 16 ) .
It has not proved possible , to date , to exchange other initiation factors between S. cerevisiae and mammalian systems , and therefore Sch .
pombe , which so closely resembles mammalian cells in regard to polymerase II transcription in vivo , becomes of particular interest for studies of transcription in vitro .
The chief obstacle to such studies has been a lack of success in preparing extracts from Sch .
pombe that support initiation of transcription at polymerase II promoters .
We report here how this obstacle may be overcome , and exploit the Sch .
pombe transcription system to demonstrate the dependence The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Yeast Strains and Plasmids .
S. cerevisiae strain BJ926 was used ( 17 ) , and Sch .
pombe strain YNN36 ( leu1-32 , urad4-294 , ade6-216 ) was provided by Marj Thomas and Ronald W. Davis ( Stanford University ) .
Templates for reactions with the Sch .
pombe fraction contained an oligonucleotide sequence from the Sch .
pombe ADH promoter region ( corresponding to nucleotides -130 to -60 ; see figure 2 of ref .
1 ) except that the G residue at -65 was changed to an A and the G residue at -61 to a C. This synthetic promoter was blunt-end ligated to the G- cassette sequence ( 18 ) and cloned in pSP73 ( 19 ) .
A GAL4-binding site ( 20 ) or a tandem repeat of a GCN4 consensus site ( 19 ) was cloned upstream of the synthetic promoter/G- construct to give rise to plasmids pGAL4ADHG- and p ( GCN4 ) ADHG- .
Plasmid pMLG- , containing a minimal adenoviral major late promoter se-quence , was constructed as described ( 21 ) .
Extracts and Chromatographic Fractions .
S. cerevisiae and Sch .
pombe strains were grown in 12 liters of YPD ( 2 % peptone/1 % yeast extract/2 % glucose ) at 30°C for seven to eight generations to an ODay of 8 ( S. cerevisiae ) or of 3 ( Sch .
pombe ) .
Cells were harvested , washed once with 1 liter of cold distilled water , and suspended in 3x lysis buffer ( 1 ml per 3 g of cells ) with protease inhibitors and with 0.5 M potassium acetate in place of 0.4 M KCI ( 22 ) .
About 240 ml of cell suspension was placed in a 400-ml stainless steel bead beating chamber ( Biospec ) with sufficient glass beads to fill the chamber .
Cells were disrupted with 20 cycles of bead beating for 30 sec and cooling for 90 sec .
The temperature of the surrounding ice/salt bath was kept at -10°C .
Glass beads and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation in a Beckman JA1O rotor at 8000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C , and the supernatant was clarified by centrifugation in a Beckman Ti45 rotor at 42,000 rpm for 90 min at 4°C .
( During decanting of the supernatant , care was taken not to include a layer of loose sediment near the pellet at the bottom of the Ti45 tube . )
The protein concentration of the resulting high-speed supernatant ( whole cell extract , WCE ) was about 30 mg/ml .
WCE ( 2 g of protein ) was diluted 4-fold with buffer A containing protease inhibitors ( 15 ) and loaded on a Bio-Rex 70 ( Bio-Rad ) column ( ~40 mg of protein per ml of resin ) at 2 column volumes per hr .
The Bio-Rex and subsequent DES2 ( Whatman ) columns were washed and eluted with buffer A containing the potassium acetate concentration indicated in parentheses ( 3 column volumes in each case ) .

buffer A ( 600 ) eluate ( 120 mg of protein ) was dialyzed against buffer A containing 20 mM Tris acetate ( pH 7.9 ) in place of Hepes ( pH 7.6 ) , to a conductivity equivalent to buffer A containing 100 mM potassium acetate , and was loaded on a DE52 column ( 20 mg of protein per ml of resin ) .
The column was washed with buffer A ( 200 ) and eluted with buffer A ( 350 ) .
The peak protein fractions were pooled and used without further manipulation in transcription reactions .
This Bio-Rex-DES52 fraction typically contained about 3 mg of protein per ml .
Fraction c was purified from nuclear extract as described ( 15 ) .
Previously , we had found that the flowthrough fraction from WCE chromatographed over Bio-Rex 70 was inhibitory to transcription , and so fraction c activity has not been derived from WCE .
Jurkat cells were cultured as described ( 23 ) and WCE was prepared as follows .
Cells were harvested in a clinical centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 10 min at 4°C , suspended in 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mM MgCl » , and centrifuged again at 3500 rpm for 10 min .
The pellet ( 2.5 ml ) was suspended in 4 volumes of 10 mM Tris chloride/1 mM EDTA , pH 8.0 , containing 1 mM dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors and was incubated on ice for 20 min .
The cell suspension was homogenized manually with eight strokes of a 15-ml homogenizer with a B pestle .
After homogenization , 4 volumes of Manley buffer ( 23 ) and 1 volume of saturated ammonium sulfate ( about 3.9 M ) were added , and the ho-mogenate was stirred for 10 min at 4°C and then centrifuged in a Beckman Ti60 rotor at 50,000 rpm for 3 hr at 4°C .
Protein was precipitated from the supernatant by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate ( 0.33 g/ml ) , and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation in a Beckman SW28 rotor at 25,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C .
The pellet was resuspended in buffer A ( 15 ) and dialyzed against buffer A until the conductivity was equivalent to buffer A containing 100 mM potassium acetate .
The entire preparation ( 150 mg of protein ) was chromatographed over Bio-Rex 70 and DES2 resins as described above .
TFIID .
S. cerevisiae TFIID ( yTFIID ) was purified to homogeneity from a T7 polymerase overexpression vector as described by Kelleher et al .
( 16 ) .
The Sch .
pombe and human TFIID ( pTFIID and hTFIID ) genes were expressed from the T7 polymerase vector pET1la ( 13 , 24 ) .
Cells for both preparations were broken by sonication in buffer C [ 50 mM Hepes , pH 7.6/10 % ( vol/vol ) glycerol/1 mM EDTA/O.5 mM dithiothreitol/1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride ] containing 300 mM KCl , followed by passage over DE5S2 in high salt ( buffer C with 300 mM KCI ) to remove nucleic acids .
The extracts were dialyzed to a conductivity equivalent to 100 mM KCl and loaded on a heparin-Sepharose column equili- Whole Cell Extract I BIO-REX 70 mM KOAc 100 Proc .

The column was washed with buffer C containing 300 mM KCI and the TFIID proteins were eluted with buffer C containing 600 mM KCI .
As judged by SDS/PAGE and staining with Coomassie blue , pTFHD was at least 80 % pure and hTFHD was about 25 % pure .
RESULTS A Protein Fraction from WCE Requiring Only TFIID for Transcription .
In the course of fractionating an RNA polymerase II transcription system from S. cerevisiae ( 15 ) , we found that several general initiation factors copurified through two steps .
A single protein fraction was derived from WCE by ion-exchange chromatography on Bio-Rex 70 and DE52 resins ( Fig .
1 ) that required only the addition of TFIID for promoter-dependent RNA polymerase II activity ( ref .
16 and Fig .
2 ) .
The several general initiation factors in the active Bio-Rex-DE52 fraction were enriched ~200-fold from the starting extract .
Copurification to this extent may reflect an association of the factors in a larger complex , but these can be resolved on further chromatography ( M.H.S .
, unpublished observations ) .
Remarkably , the same procedure yielded active protein fractions from extracts of Sch .
pombe and of a human lymphocyte ( Jurkat ) cell line ( Fig .
2 ) .
Previously it had been shown that nuclear extracts made from Jurkat cells accurately initiate transcription ( 26 ) .
Transcription reactions were supplemented with bacterially expressed TFIID from the same organism as the Bio-Rex-DE52 fraction .
The level of transcription was similar for S. cerevisiae , Sch .
pombe , and Jurkat fractions .
Transcription was judged to be authentic for the following reasons .
First , transcription was abolished by a « -amanitin at 10 ug/ml for the S. cerevisiae and Sch .
pombe fractions and at 1 ug/ml for the Jurkat fraction , showing that the reaction was due to RNA polymerase II ( Fig .
2 ) .
Second , transcription was absolutely dependent upon the addition of TFIID ( Fig .
2 ) .
Third , transcription required a promoter , which could be either the adenoviral major late promoter ( Fig .
2 ) or the Sch .
pombe ADH promoter ( data not shown ) , in the case of the Sch .
pombe fraction .
Finally , primer extension mapping confirmed that initiation occurred with the Sch .
pombe and Jurkat fractions at the same site in the adenoviral major late promoter as previously reported for the HeLa transcription system ( data not shown ) .
The derivation of an active Bio-Rex-DE52 fraction from Jurkat cells was surprising in light of the chromatographic behavior reported for TFIIB from HeLa cells .
TFIIB and TFIIE are eluted at the same ionic strength from phospho-cellulose .
The two activities are then resolved on DEAE- ‘ DE-52 mM KOAc 100/200 + TFIID + TFIID + fraction C + activator Basal Activated Transcription Fig .

For fractions from S. cerevisiae the template was 0.3 ug of pACG- ( 21 ) , and for Sch .
pombe and Jurkat fractions 0.3 ug of pMLG- template ( 21 ) was used .
Reaction mixtures ( 35 l ) contained 8-10 ug of Bio-Rex-DE52 fraction and 75 ng of pTFIID , yTFIID , or hTFIID and were incubated and processed as described ( 21 , 25 ) .
Sephacel , with TFIIB flowing through and TFIIE eluted in 300 mM KCl ( 27 ) .
We found no requirement for the DES2 flowthrough fraction in transcription with our preparations from Jurkat cells .
Perhaps the Bio-Rex-DES2 procedure is less disruptive of a larger complex of general initiation factors than phosphocellulose and DEAE-Sephacel .
S. cerevisiae , S. pombe , and Human TFIIDs Are Functionally Interchangeable for Basal and Activated Transcription .
As mentioned above , S. cerevisiae and human TFIIDs are functionally interchangeable between S. cerevisiae and HeLa transcription systems .
This functional conservation reflects a high degree of sequence conservation- > 80 % identity of 180 C-terminal amino acids among six cloned TFIIDs , including S. cerevisiae , Sch .
pombe , and human TFIIDs ( 8-14 , 24 , 28-30 ) .
We therefore expected and indeed found that S. cerevisiae and human TFIIDs could be substituted in the Sch .
pombe system ( Fig .
3 Left ) .
Further , we found that S. cerevisiae and Sch .
pombe TFIIDs would support activity of the Bio-Rex-DE52 fraction from Jurkat cells and that Sch .
pombe and human TFIIDs were effective with the fraction from S. cerevisiae ( data not shown ) .
The Bio-Rex-DE5S2 fraction from S. cerevisiae was not only active in basal level transcription from a minimal promoter but would support effects of activator proteins bound to upstream sequences as well .
For example , GAL4-VP16 stimulated transcription 48-fold ( Fig .
4 ) , comparable to or greater than the degree of stimulation obtained with nuclear extracts .
The Bio-Rex-DE52 fraction from Sch .
pombe also supported effects of acidic activators , both GAL4-VP16 and GCN4 ( 19 ) ( Fig .
4 , 30- and 35-fold stimulation of transcription , respectively ) .
Elsewhere we have reported that yTFIID and hTFIID are functionally interchangeable in support of activation in the S. cerevisiae system ( 16 ) .

Templates ( 0.1 ug ) pGAL4ADHG- and p ( GCN4 ) ; ADHG- were used for the Sch .
pombe reactions .
In assays containing activator , 1.2 pmol of GAL4-VP16 and 0.6 pmol of GCN4 were used .
Seventy-five nano-grams of yTFIID and pTFIID and 3 ug of fraction c were added .
recombinant yTFIID and hTFIID support activation by GAL4-VP16 with the Sch .
pombe Bio-Rex-DE5S2 fraction ( Fig .
3 Right ) .
The levels of activation obtained with pTFIID , yTFIID , and hTFIID were 20-fold , 14-fold , and 12-fold , respectively .
In view of the evolutionary divergence of the N-terminal region of TFIID among these organisms , these results contradict the suggestion that the N-terminal region of TFIID is required for transcriptional activation ( 14 ) .
Further evidence that the N-terminal region of TFIID is dispensable for basal and activated transcription has come from the functional sufficiency of N-terminally deleted TFIID in vitro and in vivo ( 16 , 31-35 ) .
Factors Required for Transcriptional Activation .
The Bio-Rex-DE52 fraction contains mediator protein , since addition of this component , unnecessary for basal transcription but essential for activation ( 19 , 25 ) , was not required for the response to acidic activators ( Fig .
4 ) .
It did , however , prove important to add one further component , fraction c derived as previously described ( 15 ) from S. cerevisiae nuclear extract ( Fig .
4 ) .
Fraction c differs from mediator in that it is chromatographically distinguishable and further in that it fails to relieve activator interference .
Fraction c therefore may represent , along with mediator , a second protein fraction that influences the response to acidic activator proteins in the S. cerevisiae system .
Activation in the Sch .
pombe system required the addition of fraction c , which was derived from § .
cerevisiae , demonstrating the functional conservation of this component across species .
Low levels of fraction c had a small stimulatory effect on basal transcription in the S. cerevisiae system , whereas higher levels were slightly inhibitory ( Fig .
5 ) .
Fraction c may , like the USA fraction from HeLa cells ( 36 ) , contain both positive and negative regulatory factors .
Fraction c further resembles USA in regard to possible interaction with TFIID : some activation could be observed in the absence of fraction c at very low TFIID concentrations ( one-fifth that used in the experiments reported here ) .
A final assessment of the importance of fraction c for activated transcription awaits reconstitution of the reaction with homogeneous compo-nents .
DISCUSSION The several Bio-Rex-DE52 fractions described here provide a convenient basis for assay of both TFIID and fraction c. The Bio-Rex-DES2 fraction from Sch .
pombe may itself be further fractionated to resolve general initiation factors 7662 Biochemistry : Flanagan et al .

As mentioned above , the availability of these factors may contribute significantly to the elucidation of RNA polymerase II transcription in higher organisms .
Finally , the applicability of the Bio-Rex-DES2 procedure to S. cerevisiae , Sch .
pombe , and Jurkat cells suggests the method may be general and may thus facilitate the analysis of RNA polymerase II transcription in other plant and animal systems .
The derivation of a chromatographic fraction containing RNA polymerase II and all the general initiation factors except TFIID may have significance beyond the use in transcription reported here .
Copurification of polymerase and general factors through Bio-Rex and DES2 steps , which remove 99 % of the starting protein , might reflect the association of all these components in a large complex .
Two further observations strengthen the notion of such a complex .
First , as mentioned above , our active fraction was obtained by adsorption and elution from DE5S2 , whereas human TFIIB flows through DE5S2 .
We have recently found ( H.T .
, M.H.S .
, P.M.F .
, W. J. Feaver , and R.D.K .
, unpublished work ) that the yeast homolog of human TFIIB adsorbs to DES2 in a crude state but flows through when highly purified .
More-over , pure yeast TFIIB binds specifically to RNA polymerase II , which does adsorb to DE52 , and so a larger complex containing both molecules may exist initially but be disrupted in the course of fractionation .
Second , at least two of the general initiation factors cosediment as an ~400-kDa species in glycerol gradient analysis of the Bio-Rex-DE52 fraction ( R.J.K .
, unpublished observations ) , although both factors sediment more slowly following extensive purification .
The existence of a preformed assembly of polymerase and initiation factors would have important implications for the mechanism of initiation and its regulation .
Evidence for intermediary factors that are required in addition to general initiation factors for transcriptional activation has been reported in yeast , human , and Drosophila systems ( 19 , 25 , 35-38 ) .
Such factors , termed mediator , coactivator , USA , or transcriptional intermediary factor ( TIF ) , have been viewed as various manifestations of a common activity involved in the activation process .
It now appears , however , that mediator and HeLa coactivator may be distinguished in at least two respects : mediator supports effects of acidic activators , whereas HeLa coactivator does not , and mediator is readily separable from TFIID , whereas HeLa coactivator appears closely associated .
Here we have Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 89 ( 1992 ) demonstrated that the only additional factors required for activation with the Bio-Rex-DE52 fraction is purified recombinant TFIID and fraction c , for both S. cerevisiae and Sch .
pombe .
Further , we were unable to obtain activation in the Jurkat system upon addition of recombinant hTFIID ( P.M.F .
, unpublished observations ) , probably due to the removal of the TAF proteins ( 37 ) associated with the endog-enous hTFIID .
These results indicate that the mechanism of activation in S. cerevisiae and Sch .
pombe may differ from that found in higher eukaryotes .
The characteristics of fraction c reported here suggest a relationship to USA .
Both activities influence basal transcription and may be inhibitory as well as stimulatory .
If mediator is truly distinct from both coactivator and USA , then the question arises of whether counterparts of yeast mediator may be identified in higher organisms .
Indeed , TIF , which is required for transcriptional activation by GAL4-VPI16 in the HeLa system , may represent such a factor .
