Characterizatia of the Huma Platelet/Endothelia Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 Promoter Identification of a GATAZ2 Binding Element Require for Optima Transcriptionda Activity By Richard J. Gumina , Nancy E. Kirschbaum , Kim Piotrowski , and Peter J. Newman Platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 ( PECAM-1 ) is a 130-kD member of the Ig gene superfamily that is expressed on platelets , endothelial cells , and certain leukocyte subsets .
To examine the factors controlling vascular-specific expression of PECAM-1 , we cloned the 5'-flanking region of the PECAM-1 gene and analyzed its transcriptional activity .
5'-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends ( 5'-RACE ) analysis showed that transcription initiation occurred at several closely spaced nearby sites originating approximately 204 bp upstream from the translation start site .
Analysis of the sequence immediately upstream from the transcription initiation site ( TIS ) showed no canonical TATA or CAAT elements , however an initiator element commonly found in TATA-less promoters encompassed the TIS .
5'-serially truncated PECAM-1 promoter segments cloned in front of a lucif- ROMOTERS THAT REGULATE the transcription of genes expressed in myeloid , megakaryocytic , and endothelial cells have been examined and used to search for lineage-specific trans-acting factors that control vascular-specific gene expression .
Although to date few `` lineage-specific `` factors per se have been identified , particular combinations of motifs have often been shown to be required for optimal gene expression .
In particular , GATA elements appear to play an important role in regulating the transcriptional activity of vascular cell adhesion molecules , including those present in the promoters for human and rat glycoprotein IIb ( GPIb ) , '* human and rat platelet factor 4 , * `` human GPIX , ° GPIb , `` P-selectin , `` von Willebrand factor , `` `` and human CD11b . ``

Putative cis-acting control elements present within a 300-bp core promoter included two ets sites , an Sp1 site , tandem E-box domains , two GATA-associated sites ( CACCC ) , an AP-2 binding site , and a GATA element at -24 .
Mutational analysis showed that optimal transcriptional activity required the GATA sequence at position -24 , and gel-shift assays further showed that the GATA-2 transcription factor , but not GATA-1 , bound to this region of the PECAM-1 promoter .
Understanding the cis- and transacting factors that regulate the tissue-specific expression of PECAM-1 should increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which vascular-specific gene expression is achieved .

interactions , `` as well as leukocyte/endothelial cell interactions during the process of transendothelial migration . ``
In addition to its adhesive functions , a growing number of studies suggest that PECAM-1 may play a role in cellular signal-ing , as PECAM-1 becomes phosphorylated after cellular ac-tivation , `` * `` `` and engagement of PECAM-1 leads to a number of downstream cellular events , including integrin activa-tion `` and lymphocyte refractoriness . ``
Cellular expression of PECAM-1 appears to be limited to cells of the vasculature , having been found on the surface of circulating platelets , monocytes , neutrophils , and certain lymphocyte subsets . ``
PECAM-1 is also one of the most abundant adhesion molecules on the endothelial cell surface , where it is constitutively expressed at approximately 1 % 10° molecules per cell . ``
However , the cis- and trans-acting elements that restrict PECAM-1 expression to vascular cells and the mechanisms by which these factors control the cellular expression of PECAM-1 have not been defined .
Because of the importance of PECAM-1 in mediating cellular interactions and because of the importance of understanding the basic cellular processes that regulate vascular-specific gene expression , we have begun to examine the mechanisms regulating the transcription of PECAM-1 in vascular cells .
In this report , we describe the cloning and characterization of the PECAM-1 promoter and the identification of cis-acting sequences that may regulate transcription of the PECAM-1 gene .
In addition , we provide evidence that an element at position -24 , which preferentially interacts with the GATA-2 transcription factor , is essential for maximal transcriptional activity of the PECAM-1 gene in cells of the megakaryocytic lineage .

Detection was accomplished using the nitro blue terazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate ( NBT/BCIP ) substrate pair , as previously described . ``
RNA isolation and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) analysis .
RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent ( GIBCO-BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) following the manufacturer 's protocol and was stored at -80°C until use for either 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends ( 5'-RACE ) or RT-PCR .
The integrity of all RNA preparations was evaluated by ethidium bromide staining of agarose gels and by Northern blot analysis ( data not shown ) .
For RT-PCR analysis , total RNA was reverse transcribed using 200 U/mL of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus RT ( Boehringer Mannheim , India-napolis , IN ) primed with random hexamer oligonucleotides and poly-dT oligonucleotides .
The cDNA was amplified using a sense primer , spanning nucleotides 813-830 of exon 2 , having the sequence 5'-TGAACTGGTACCGTGACG-3 ' and an antisense primer located in exon 3 , spanning nucleotides 1213-1196 of PECAM-1 cDNA , having the sequence 5'-TGAAGTTGGCTGGAGGTGC-3 ' .
`` * These oligonucleotide primers yield a 400-bp product when mRNA is used as the template , but greater than 12 kb if the amplification product is derived from genomic DNA .
PCR products were separated by 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining .
5-RACE .
- 5'-RACE was performed using the 5'-AmpliFINDER RACE Kit ( Clonetech ) according to the manufacturer 's directions , with only minor modifications .
cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus RT with a 40-nucleotide antisense primer beginning at the +204 position and having the sequence 5-CCT-GAGAGTAAGACTGCAGGCACAGTTAGTTCTGCCTTCGG-3 ' .
Anchor-specific PCR amplification was conducted using 1 uL of the anchor-ligated cDNA , 0.2 U/mL of Vent polymerase , 0.5 umol/L of a forward primer complementary to the anchor , having the sequence - 5-CTGGTTCGGCCCACCTCTGAAGGTTCCAGAATC-GATAG-3 ' , and 0.5 mol/L of one of two different antisense primers , beginning either 101 bp upstream from the transcription 1261 initiation site ( TIS ) , having the sequence 5'-AAAAGCAGAAAT-TGCTCTGG-3 ' , or 63 bp upstream from the TIS , having the sequence 5-GCAGAGAGACCGGCTGTGGC-3 ' .
The resulting PCR products were separated by 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis , excised , and subcloned into pGEM7 for sequence analysis .
Expression vectors and the generation of PECAM-I-promoter/ reporter constructs .
- The luciferase expression vector , pGL3-Basic ( Promega Biotech ) , which lacks eukaryotic promoter and enhancer sequences , was used to establish basal levels of luciferase activity in cell lysates .
Selected segments of the 5'-flanking region of the PECAM-1 gene were subcloned into pGL3-Basic and examined for their ability to drive luciferase expression over that of pGL3-Basic .
The pGL3-Control vector , containing both a simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) promoter and enhancer , was used as a positive control for luciferase expression .
The pSVbGal vector , which encodes B-galactosidase under the control of an SV40 promoter and enhancer , was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency .
To generate the -4500/+196 PECAM-1 promoter fragment , genomic clone 7.2 DNA ( see Results ) was digested with Psf I , and the resulting 4.5-kb Psf I fragment of the PECAM-1 promoter ( -4500/+196 ) was subcloned into pGEM3 vector .
The 4.5-kb Pst I segment was then excised using flanking Xba I and Not I sites , and subcloned into pGL3-Basic .
Constructs containing this insert in both the forward and the reverse orientation were isolated to give the final -4500/+196 forward construct and +196/-4500 reverse construct .
Other PECAM-1 promoter fragments were generated by PCR using clone 7.2 DNA as a template .
Briefly , 50 ng of this genomic clone was resuspended in a total volume of 100 uL containing : 1 % Vent buffer [ 20 mmol/L Tris - HCI ( pH , 8.8 ) , 10 mmol/L KCI , 10 mmol/L ( NH , ) ; SO , , 2 mmol/L MgSO , 0.1 % Triton X-100 ] , 1 mg/ mL acetylated bovine serum albumin , 0.2 mmol/L of each deoxy-nucleotide triphosphate , and 0.20 U Vent polymerase ( New England Biolabs , Beverly , MA ) .
PCR amplification was performed using a cycle of denaturation at 94°C for 30 seconds , annealing at 56°C for 45 seconds , and primer extension at 72°C for 45 seconds for a total of 30 cycles .
To generate the PECAM-1 promoter constructs , four different forward primers were used , beginning at nucleotides -1136 ( 5-CACCATGTTGGCCAGGCTGG-3 `` ) , -588 ( 5-GGGATTAC-AGGCGTGAGCC-3 `` ) , -254 ( 5 GGG-3 `` ) , and -163 ( 5-AACGCCAAGGCAAATGTCAC-3 ' ) .
A reverse primer beginning at base +204 ( 5'-CCTGAGAGTAAG-ACTGCAGGCACAGTTAGTCTGCCTTCGG-3 ' ) was used in all cases to generate constructs spanning nucleotides -1136/+204 , -588/+204 , and -254/+204 , and -163-+204 .
The resulting PCR fragments were subcloned into pGL2-basic , removed by digestion with Xma I and HindIII , and then directionally subcloned into pGL3-Basic .
The construct -1136/-882/+20 and the reverse -1136/+20/-882 were generated by Nco I digestion and religation of the -1136/ +204 construct .
The GATA mutant construct and a matched wild-type control were generated by overlapping PCR mutagenesis .
Two primary PCR reactions were conducted using either Primer Set A , comprised of a forward primer beginning at position -588 ( 5-GGGATTACA-GGCGTGAGCC-3 `` ) and reverse primer beginning at the -9 position that contained a GATA > CTTT substitution ( 5-GGGCTG-GCCTGAAAAGTCCTCAGG-3 ' ) , or Primer Set B , comprised of a forward primer beginning at -9 that contained the GATA > CTTT substitution ( 5-CCTGAGGACTTITCAGGCCAGCCC-3 `` ) and a reverse primer starting at position +204 ( 5-CCTGAGAGTAAG-ACTGCAGGCACAGTTAGTTCTGCCTT-CGG-3 ' ) .
The primary PCR products were gel-purified and used as template in a secondary PCR reaction using the forward primer at position -588 and the reverse primer at position +204 .
The final PCR product was gel-purified , and digested with Bg/ II and Nco I to generate a -254 to +20 fragment that was subcloned into pGL3-Basic .

Transfections .
- Cells to be transfected by electroporation were maintained at 1 to 9 X 10°/mL , harvested , rinsed 2 times in ice cold phosphate-buffered saline , and resuspended to a final concentration of 3.3 x 10'/mL .
A total of 1 X 10 `` cells were placed in each of duplicate 0.4-cm gap electroporation cuvettes ( BioRad Corp , Rich-mond , CA ) and 50 mL of a DNA mixture comprised of 50 ug of a PECAM-1/pGL3 promoter construct together with 10 ug of the vector pSVbGal .
The cell-plasmid mixture was incubated on ice for 10 minutes and then electroporated at 250 V , 950 mF , using a GenePuls-erlI ( BioRad ) .
The time constants ranged from 44 to 54 milliseconds .
After electroporation , the cells were allowed to recover for 10 minutes on ice .
The cells were then resuspended in growth media , plated in 35-mm wells in 6-well plates , placed at 37°C in 5 % CO ; , and grown for 48 hours .
Transfected cells were harvested and lysed in 200 uL of 1X Reporter Lysis Buffer ( Promega ) .
Luciferase activity and B-galactosidase activity were measured according to the manufacturer 's protocols ( Promega and Tropix , Inc [ Bedford , MAJ , re-spectively ) using a Turner Model TD20e luminometer ( Sunnyvale , CA ) .
Each sample was assayed in duplicate for both luciferase and -galactosidase activity .
Luciferase activity was normalized to the -galactosidase activity , and the data were expressed as normalized luciferase activity ( luciferase relative light units [ RLU ] /100 B-galactosidase RLU ) .
All results shown were derived from the average of at least three individual experiments , with each experiment being conducted in duplicate .
Oligonucleotide preparation and labeling .
- The GATA wild-type oligonucleotide encoding the GATA site at position -24 in the PECAM-1 promoter had the sequence 5-GTCATTTCCTGAG-GAGA TCAGGCCAGCC-3 ' .
The mutant oligonucleotide had the sequence 5'-GTCATTTC-CGAGGACTIT TCAGGCCAGCC-3 ' .
Double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared by annealing equal molar amounts of complementary strands of DNA , followed by purification on Sephadex G-25 spin columns ( Pharmacia Biotech , Inc , Uppsala , Sweden ) .
Double-stranded oligonucleotides were then end-labeled with ( y-*°P ) adenosine triphosphate to a specific activity of 30,000 cpm/ng using T4 polynucleotide kinase ( New England Biolabs ) and repurified on a Sephadex G-25 spin column .
Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays ( EMSAs ) .
- Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al `` `` and stored in liquid nitrogen .
Protein concentration was determined using the bicincho-ninic acid assay ( Pierce , Inc , Rockford , IL ) .
DNA-binding assays were performed by incubating 10 ug of nuclear extract protein in binding buffer ( 20 mmol/L Tris [ pH , 7.9 ] , 80 mmol/L KCI , 10 mmol/ L MgC ] ; , 2 mmol/L 1,4-dithiothreitol , and 10 % glycerol ) with 1 ug poly ( dI-dC ; Pharmacia Biotech , Inc ) and 0.5 ng of P-labeled , double-stranded oligonucleotides for 30 minutes at 22°C .
For competition studies , 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was preincubated for 30 minutes at 22°C in the reaction mixture before the addition of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide .
For immunodepletion of the DNA-protein complexes , 1 ug of monoclonal antibody to either GATA-1 or GATA-2 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc , Santa Cruz , CA ) was preincubated for 30 minutes at 22°C with the reaction mixture before the addition of the labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide .
Both of these antibodies displayed specific reactivity for their respective proteins by Western blot and immunohistochemistry .
DNA-protein complexes were separated from free oligonucleotide on a 7 % nondenaturing polyacryl-amide gel containing 2.5 % glycerol .
Gels were electrophoresed at 40 mA for 90 minutes in a low ionic strength TAE ( 7 mmol/L Tris [ pH , 7.9 ] , 3.5 mmol/L sodium acetate , and 2 mmol/L EDTA ) .
The gel was then fixed in 10 % methanol/10 % acetic acid , dried , and exposed to KODAK Biomax MR ( Eastman-Kodak , Rochester , NY ) film for autoradiography .
GUMINA ET AL RESULTS Expression of PECAM-1 on transformed leukocyte cell lines .
As a prelude to examining the activity of the PECAM-1 promoter , we characterized several transformed cell lines for their ability to express PECAM-1 .
Because platelets are an end-stage differentiation product of megakar-yocytes , we examined the expression of PECAM-1 in two megakaryocytic tumor cell lines , HEL® and Dami . ``
Raji cells , which are derived from a B-cell lymphoma , `` were employed as a negative control .
Flow cytometric analysis was performed using the polyclonal antihuman PECAM-1 antibody , SEW16 .
As shown in Fig 1A , both HEL and Dami cells express PECAM-1 on the cell surface , whereas Raji cells do not .
Western blot analysis of total cellular PECAM-1 present in detergent cell lysates from HEL , Dami , and Raji cells ( Fig 1B ) , confirmed these observations .
To ensure that the lack of detectable PECAM-1 protein in Raji cells was not due to failure to translate PECAM-1 mRNA , the presence of PECAM-1-specific mRNA in all three cell lines was also examined by Northern blot analysis ( data not shown ) and RT-PCR .
As shown in Fig 1C , whereas both HEL and Dami cell mRNA yielded PECAM-1-specific amplification products , Raji cells did not express detectable levels of PECAM-1 mRNA .
Characterization of a genomic clone encompassing the 5'-region of the PECAM-1 gene .
A 15-kb Agtll genomic clone ( Clone 7 ) that hybridizes specifically with the 5'-region of PECAM-1 cDNA has previously been described . ``
Further digestion of this clone with HindIII yielded a 5.2-kb fragment that hybridized specifically with PECAM-1 cDNA ( data not shown ) .
This 5.2-kb fragment was subcloned into pGEM-7 to give Clone 7.2 , which was used for further restriction endonuclease mapping and sequence analysis .
As shown schematically in Fig 2 , Clone 7.2 contains part of intron one , exon one , and greater than 4.5 kb of upstream sequence .
A number of smaller fragments of Clone 7.2 were derived by restriction digestion , including an internal 4.7-kb Pst I beginning only 4 bp upstream from the initiator methionine of the PECAM-1 signal peptide , a 2.8-kb Sph I/ HindIII fragment , and a 1.3-kb Sma U/HindIII fragment .
The latter fragment was subcloned into pGEM3 , and its sequence determined in its entirety ( Fig 3 ) .
Detection of multiple transcription initiation - sites .
Primer extension analysis of total RNA isolated from human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) showed a relatively broad band denoting the major TIS , as well as several other minor initiation sites for the PECAM-1 gene , all located within a region approximately 200 bp upstream from the translation start site `` `` ( and indicated by `` +1 `` in Fig 3 ) .
To insure that the primer extension products previously observed corresponded with the sequence of Clone 7.2 and to determine whether transcription of PECAM-1 mRNA initiated at the same site in different vascular cells , 5'-RACE was conducted using total RNA isolated from HUVECs and HEL , Dami , and Raji cells .
As shown in Fig 4A , 5'-RACE products derived from each of these cell types were comparable in size , but were composed of a broad band , consistent with the presence of multiple PCR products of similar but From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Characterization of PECAM-1 expression on leukocyte tumor cell lines .
The human leukocyte cell lines HEL , Dami , and Raji were examined for PECAM-1 expression .
( A ) Flow cytometric analysis of PECAM-1 expression .
Cells were stained with either normal rabbit IgG or the human PECAM-1-specific polyclonal rabbit IgG , SEW16 .
Detection was accomplished by staining with a dichlorotriazinyl amino fluorescein-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG .
As shown , HEL and Dami cells , express PECAM-1 on their surface , whereas Raji cells are negative .
( B ) Western blot analysis of PECAM-1 expression in HEL , Dami , and Raji cells was performed using SEW16 .
Detection was accomplished using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antirabbit secondary antibody .
Note that Raji cells do not contain even an intracellular pool of detectable PECAM-1 .
( C ) RT-PCR analysis of PECAM-1 mRNA levels .
mRNA was isolated from HEL , Dami , and Raji cells and subjected to RT-PCR using primers spanning a 400-bp region of PECAM-1 that include exons 2 and 3 .
These primers would yield a PCR product of greater than 12-kb product if amplification were to occur from genomic DNA .
As shown , both HEL and Dami cells express PECAM-1 mRNA , whereas Raji cells are negative .
not identical size .
Sequence analysis of these 5'-RACE products ( Fig 4B ) confirmed that transcription of the PECAM-1 gene initiates from several closely spaced nucleotides , most of which are found proximal to the sequence CCCATT-GTTC , a motif that corresponds closely with that of an initiator element ( Inr ) , often found to direct transcription initiation in promoters that lack well-defined TATA boxes . ``

Characterization of a genomic clone containing the 5'-flanking region of the PECAM-1 gene .
The map of Clone 7.2 ( 5.2 kb ) indicates the relative position of selected introns and exons , as well as the restriction sites for several enzymes .
As shown , digestion with Pst 1 , Sph I , or Sma | , alone or in combination with Hindlll , yielded the following fragments : Pst | to Pst | ( 4.7 kb ) , Sph | to Hindlll ( 2.8 kb ) , and Sma | to Hindlll ( 1.5 kb ) .
These fragments were subcloned into the vector pGEM7 for sequence analysis .
from the translation start site .
As predicted by the presence of multiple transcription initiation sites ( Fig 4 ) , the PECAM-1 promoter lacks consensus TATA or CAAT elements , but contains numerous consensus binding sequences for a number of trans-acting regulatory proteins .
Interestingly , the first 1,300 nucleotides of the 5'-flanking region have a high GC content ( 68 % ) and contain more than 30 CpG dinucleotide sequences , including four Hpa II restriction sites ( CCGG ) in the immediate vicinity of the TIS , suggesting that the methylation state of this region may be one mechanism by which cells suppress their transcription of the PECAM-1 gene in a tissue-specific manner . ``
'' Other consensus cis-acting regulatory sequence motifs present in the PECAM-1 promoter include Pw/ets sites at -439 , -193 , -49 , and -28 ; NF-KB sites at -718 and -226 ; three shear-stress-respon-sive elements ( SSREs ) at positions -641 , -379 , and +53 ; Spl sites at -615 , -612 , and +107 ; retinoic acid receptor-binding motifs at -659 , -371 , -182 , and -111 ; a GTlHc element at position -269 ; E-box domains at -117 and -110 ; two tandem GATA-associated sites at -220 and -213 ; and GATA elements at -913 , -888 , -508 , and -24 .
An Alu repeat spanning nucleotides -859 to -557 was also found to be present within the 5'-flanking region of the PECAM-1 gene .
Transcriptional activity of the PECAM-1 promoter .

As shown in Fig 5A , transfection of two different constructs , one encompassing nucleotides -4500 to +196 and the other comprised of nucleotides -1136 to +20 , resulted in considerable luciferase expression in both HEL and Dami cells , whereas little or no luciferase activity was found in transfected Raji cells , demonstrating lineage-specific regulation of PECAM-1 gene expression .
The transcriptional activity observed was orientation-spe-cific , as paired reverse-orientation constructs displayed little or no activity in any cell type examined .

Identification of multiple transcription initiation sites for the PECAM-1 gene .
( A ) 5'-RACE analysis .
Total RNA was isolated from HUVEC , HEL , and Dami cells , all which express PECAM-1 , as well as from the PECAM-1-negative Raji cell line .
5'-RACE analysis was conducted using a forward primer complementary to the anchor together with one of two different antisense primers , beginning either 63 bp upstream from the major TIS ( lanes A ) or 101 bp upstream from the TIS ( lanes B ) , as described in Materials and Methods .
The resulting PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining .
( A ) and ( B ) represent the two separate primer sets used ( see Materials and Methods ) .
As shown , HUVECs and HEL and Dami cells yielded comparably sized products , indicating that all three cell lines use the same region for transcription initiation .
Note that the bands on the gel are somewhat broad , suggesting that a number of closely spaced PCR products might exist within each band .
Raji cells showed no specific amplification products .
( B ) Sequence analysis of the 5'-RACE products .
The 5'-RACE products shown in ( A ) were excised , subcloned , and se-quenced .
A summary of the 5'-termini derived from sequencing 15 individual clones is shown .
The number under a specific nucleotide indicates the number of clones whose 5'-end corresponded to that particular base .
The TIS , as previously determined by primer extension analysis , `` `` is shown above the sequence .
Based on the 5'-RACE data , it appears that transcription of the PECAM-1 gene initiates at several closely spaced sites within this region .
scriptional activity down to a fragment spanning nucleotides -163 to +204 .
Based on these observations , our data suggest that a core promoter region encompassing nucleotides -163 to +204 of the PECAM-1 gene contains much of the information necessary to drive transcriptional activity in a megakaryocytic lineage-specific manner .
The GATA element at -24 is required for optimal transcriptional activity of the PECAM-1 promoter .
- As shown in Fig 3 , the region from -163 to +204 contains numerous potential cis-acting elements that may regulate PECAM-1 expression .
The GATA sequence at position -24 of the PECAM-1 promoter was of particular interest , because similarly positioned GATA motifs have been shown to serve as a weak surrogate for the binding of TFIID in other TATA-less core promoters , including those of the platelet factor 4 ( PF4 ) , GPIIb , and erythropoeitin genes . ``
To determine whether the GATA element at position -24 in the PECAM-1 gene functioned as a positive regulatory element , we mutated the wild-type sequence 5'-GATA-3 ' to in a pGL3 construct containing nucleotides -254 to +20 of the PECAM-1 promoter , and examined its effect on tran-scription .
As shown in Fig 6 , when this construct was trans- 1265 fected into HEL and Dami cells , luciferase activity was reduced by approximately 70 % compared with that of the wild-type control .
Neither of these constructs showed transcriptional activity in Raji cells ( data not shown ) .
These results show that the GATA element at position -24 of the PECAM-1 gene is functional and contributes to the optimal lineage-specific transcription of the PECAM-1 gene .
The -24 element binds GATA-2 .
- To further corroborate these results and confirm that the GATA element at -24 is able to interact with at least one of the GATA transcription factors , EMSAs were performed using a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe encompassing the -24 GATA site .
As shown in Fig 7 , incubation of nuclear extracts from DAMI cells with the *P-labeled oligo resulted in the formation of a specific DNA-protein complex that was completely inhibited by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe .
A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a CTTT sequence in place of GATA ( identical to that used in the functional assays shown in Fig 6 ) did not form the DNA-protein complex .
To determine which GATA transcription factor bound the -24 GATA element ( both GATA-1 and GATA-2 are expressed in megakaryocytes ) , we immunodepleted the nuclear extracts with antibody directed against either GATA-1 and GATA-2 .
Formation of the major DNA-protein complex was unaffected by preincubation with anti-GATA-1 , but preincubation of the nuclear extract with the GATA-2-specific antibody resulted in the complete loss of the major DNA-protein complex .
Comparable results were obtained using HEL cell nuclear extracts ( data not shown ) .
Together with the results shown in Fig 6 , these data suggest that GATA-2 binds to and regulates PECAM-1 gene expression in cells of the megakaryocytic lineage .
DISCUSSION In this report , we have described the cloning and initial characterization of the PECAM-1 promoter , as well as the identification a specific GATA-2 binding site that regulates , in part , the expression of PECAM-1 in cells of the megakaryocytic lineage .
Characterization of a 5.2-kb genomic clone encompassing intron 1 , exon 1 , and approximately 5 kb upstream from the translation initiation site ( Fig 2 ) showed a promoter that ( 1 ) is GC-rich and devoid of TATA and CAAT elements ( Fig 3 ) , ( 2 ) contains a number of closely-spaced TIS ( Fig 4 ) , and ( 3 ) uses a functionally analogous initiator element first described for the terminal deoxytransferase ( TdT ) gene promoter , `` to direct transcription initiation .
Thus , the PECAM-1 promoter joins a growing list of vascular cell adhesion molecule genes that use a TATA-less , CAAT-less promoter possessing multiple , closely spaced transcription initiation sites , including the promoters for the GPIb1 , `` `` a ; , `` and as `` `` integrin subunits , platelet GPIx , ® human CD11 @ , *4 CD11b , * `` and CD18 . ``
Functional analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the PECAM-1 gene indicated that a 4.7-kb Pst I genomic fragment contains the promoter for the PECAM-1 gene , and that a 1-kb segment spanning nucleotides -1136 to +20 was capable of driving orientation-specific transcriptional activity in a lineage-restricted manner ( Fig 5A ) .

Nuclear extracts derived from DAMI cells were incubated with a `` P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing either a GATA consensus binding site { lanes 2 to 5 ) or a mutated CTTT sequence in its place ( lanes 6 and 7 ) .
Competition reactions were performed using a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing either the wild-type ( lane 3 ) or mutant CTTT sequence ( lane 7 ) .
Immunodepletion studies ( lanes 4 and 5 ) were conducted by preincubating the nuclear extracts with 1 ag of a monoclonal antibody specific for either GATA-1 ( lane 4 ) or GATA-2 ( lane 5 ) .
Note that a GATA-2-spe-cific DNA-protein complex ( arrow ) forms only when the GATA sequence is present .
Comparable results were obtained using nuclear extracts derived from HEL cells ( data not shown } .
PECAM-1 gene expression in these cell types .
Furthermore , studies in transgenic mouse models will be necessary to determine if this region is sufficient to mediate tissue-specific expression in vivo .
Given the tight restriction of PECAM-1 protein expression to cells of the vasculature , PECAM-1 gene expression is likely to be regulated at several levels .
In this regard , it is notable that there are more than 30 CpG dinucleotide sequences within the first 1,300 bp of the PECAM-1 promoter , with an especially high CpG : GpC ratio ( > 0.5 ) in the stretch running from -150 to +120 , centered around the transcription initiation site .
CpG island chromatin can be the target of DNA methylation and differs from bulk chromatin in a number of respects , including a reduction in histone H1 and a general absence of nucleosomes in the region . ``
'' Though we have not yet performed Hpa II/Msp digests on cells that differentially regulate PECAM-1 expression , it is possible that methylation may be one mechanism by which PECAM-1 gene expression is regulated at the `` pretranscriptional `` level .
Examination of the PECAM-1 promoter showed potential 1267 binding sites for a number of known trans-acting regulatory elements , including those that bind to AP-2 , GATA , ets ( Pu ) , Sp1 , NF-kb , retinoic acid receptor , E-box domain , and SSRE motifs .
The locations of these putative cis-acting control elements within the PECAM-1 promoter is provided in Fig 3 .
Of particular interest were four potential GATA-binding motifs identified within the first 1,000 nucleotides of the PECAM-1 promoter ( Fig 3 ) .
Functionally active GATA elements have been identified within the promoters of a large number of genes that are expressed constitutively in vascular cells .
Like PECAM-1 , the promoters for a subset of these , including rat PF4 , human GPIb , and human GPIX , are all TATA-less , `` TdT-type `` promoters that harbor GATA elements near the -30 region .
Examination of several such GATA-box-containing promoters in vitro has shown that the GATA box can serve not only as a recognition site for members of the GATA family of transcription factors , `` but also as a recognition site for basal transcription factors . ``
'' Although deletional analysis did not show a requirement for the GATA elements at positions -913 , -888 , or -508 , sited directed mutagenesis showed that the -24 GATA element contributes to the optimal transcriptional activity of the PECAM-1 core promoter ( Fig 6 ) .
Because both GATA-1 and GATA-2 transcription factors are present in cells of the megakaryocyte and endothelial cell lineage and have been shown to bind sequences similar to that found within the PECAM-1 promoter , `` it was hypothesized that one or both of these factors may participate in regulating PECAM-1 expression in megakaryocytes .
EMSAs and immunodepletion experiments ( Fig 7 ) showed that the transcription factor GATA-2 , but not GATA-1 , bound specifically to the -24 GATA element .
Thus , GATA-2 appears to regulate the transcription of PECAM-1 in cells of the megakaryocytic lineage .
In conclusion , we have characterized the 5'-flanking region of the PECAM-1 gene and showed that a GATA-2 binding element within the core PECAM-1 promoter contributes to its optimal transcriptional activity .
Further mutational analysis of other cis-acting sequences found within this region should result in the identification of other regulatory elements that contribute to the transcriptional activity of the PECAM-1 promoter .
It will be interesting to determine whether the same factors responsible for transcriptional activity in cells of the megakaryocytic lineage are operative in myeloid ( monocytic/neutrophil ) cells and endothelial cells .
Further characterization of the PECAM-1 promoter , in conjunction with studies of the promoters of other vascularly expressed genes , may clarify how common elements such as GATA regulate gene expression restricted to the vasculature .
