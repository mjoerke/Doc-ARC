Box 7031 , $ -220 07 Lund , Sweden A novel Ets protein was isolated by yeast one-hybrid screening of a cDNA library made from lipopolysaccha-ride-stimulated mouse splenic B cells , using the SP6 x promoter Y element as a bait .
The novel Ets protein was most closely related to PU.1 and Spi-B within the DNA binding Ets domain and was therefore named Spi-C .
However , Spi-C may represent a novel subgroup within the Ets protein family , as it differed significantly from Spi-B and PU.1 within helix 1 of the Ets domain .
Spi-C was encoded by a single-copy gene that was mapped to chromosome 10 , region C. Spi-C interacted with DNA similarly to PU.1 as judged by methylation interference , band-shift and site selection analysis , and activated transcription of a xY element reporter gene upon co-transfection of HeLa cells .
Spi-C RNA was expressed in mature B lymphocytes and at lower levels in macrophages .
Furthermore , pre-B cell and plasma cell lines were Spi-C-negative , suggesting that Spi-C might be a regulatory molecule during a specific phase of B lymphoid development .
Proteins that are members of the Ets family of transcription factors are involved in a variety of developmental and cellular responses ( 1 ) .
At present around 20 distinct proteins within the family have been described , and all these bind to a similar , purine-rich DNA sequence element ( 1 , 2 ) .
Given the similarity of their binding sites , and given that several of the proteins have overlapping pattern of expression , it has been difficult to define the individual function of each Ets protein .
However , gene targeting experiments in mice have shown that Ets proteins are not functionally redundant ( 3-6 ) , but that each Ets protein has a distinct function .
In the B lymphoid lineage , several of the Ets proteins are expressed ; among these are Ets-1 ( 7 , 8 ) , elf-1 ( 9 ) , PU.1 ( Spi-1 ) ( 10 ) , and Spi-B ( 11 ) .
However , none of these factors are restricted in their expression to B cells only .
Ets-1 , elf-1 , and Spi-B are also expressed in T cells ( 3 , 8 , 9 , 12 ) , and PU.1 can be found in both lymphoid and myeloid cells ( 10 , 13 ) .
Still , all four factors have been implicated in transcriptional regulation of B cell-specific genes .
Hence , a binding site for Ets-1 has been found in the Ig heavy chain intron enhancer ( 14 ) , while binding * This work was supported by grants from the Swedish Cancer Soci-ety , Swedish Medical Research Council , Kock 's Foundation , Crafoord Foundation , and Osterlunds Foundation .

This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org sites for elf-1 have been found in the Ig heavy chain 3 ' enhancer ( 15 ) and in a k promoter ( 16 ) .
Binding sites for PU.1 have been found in the Ig heavy chain intron enhancer ( 14 ) , the Ig k 3 ' enhancer ( 17 ) , x promoters ( 18 ) , the A 2-4 enhancer ( 19 ) , and the mb-1 ( Iga ) and B-29 ( Ig $ B ) genes ( 20 , 21 ) , as well as in the Ig IJ-chain promoter ( 22 ) .
However , no target genes for PU.1 that can explain the phenotype observed in PU.1~'~ animals have been identified .
Spi-B is closely related to PU.1 , and no clear difference between the binding sequences of the two proteins has been defined ( 2 ) .
As the expression pattern between PU.1 and Spi-B is overlapping within the B cell lineage ( 3 ) , it would not be surprising should the two proteins be functionally redundant .
However , this is not the case , since , although PU.1~'~ mice have a severe distortion of hematopoietic development ( 5 , 6 ) , Spi-B '~ mice form a normal myeloid and lymphoid compartment with the exception of a defective B cell receptor-mediated immune activation ( 23 ) .
Here we describe the cloning and characterization of a novel Ets family protein , Spi-C , which was identified in an yeast one-hybrid screen due to its interaction with the SP6 k promoter Y element .
The protein is mainly expressed in the peripheral B lymphoid compartment ; it is not expressed in early B cell precursors or in pre-B cell lines and appears to be down-regulated as the B cell matures to the plasma cell stage .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Yeast Strains-Four copies of a fragment containing the pentadecamer element and the Y core element ( 16 , 24 ) were cloned into the pHisi and pLacZi vectors ( CLONTECH ) , between the Xbal and EcoRI sites , and Smal and EcoRI sites , respectively .
The vectors were linear-ized by XhoI or Nco !
digestions and stably integrated into the YM 4271 yeast strain ( CLONTECH ) .
The integration was verified by Southern blotting of PCR-amplified DNA from genomic yeast DNA using either Hisi- or LacZi-specific primers , using one copy of the inserted fragment as a probe ( 5'-TACTCTCAAACAGCTGTGTAATTTACTTTCC-3 ' ) .
The EBF binding site yeast strain was constructed using the same protocol with four copies of the EBF binding CCCT element from the SP6 k promoter ( 25 ) .
The obtained yeast strains did not grow on histidine-deficient plates at a 15 mM concentration of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole ( 8-AT ) .
Yeast Library Construction and Screening-BALB/c mouse spleens were minced and set up at a lymphocyte concentration of 1 X 10° lymphocytes/ml in Iscove 's modified Dulbecco 's medium with 5 % fetal calf serum and 25 ug/ml LPS .
After 72 h , the activated cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and total RNA isolated using the acid phenol method .
A total of approximately 1 mg of RNA was isolated , and poly ( A ) * RNA was obtained by purification on an oli-go ( dT ) -cellulose column ( 26 ) .
Double-stranded cDNA was prepared , inserted into predigested Hybri-ZAP A arms and packaged as described for Stratagene 's two-hybrid system .
A total of 8.2 X 10° independent * The abbreviations used are : PCR , polymerase chain reaction ; LPS , lipoppolysaccharide ; RT , reverse transcription ; FISH , fluorescence in situ hybridization ; 3-AT , S-amino-1,2,4-triazole ; EMSA , electrophoretic mobility shift assay ; DAPI , 4',6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole ; GABP , GA-binding protein ; EBF , early B cell factor .
10259 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san $ 4g /310-2q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wou ; papeojumo ( 10260 plaques were obtained with an average insert size of 1.1 kilobase pairs .
The amplified stock was converted to its phagemid form as described by the manufacturer ( Stratagene ) .
20 ug of phagemid was transfected into the yeast strain and spread on SD agar plates minus histidine and minus leucine , containing 15 mM 3-AT as described ( CLONTECH ) .
Growing clones were tested in a LacZi assay ( CLONTECH ) , and positive clones were grown , plasmids isolated , transformed into bacteria , and finally retransformed into the screening yeast strain or the EBF control strain .
cDNA clones that remained positive through these procedures were sequenced from the 5 ' end .
A total of six E2A-containing , three E2-2-containing , and one Spi-C-containing clones were identified in the screen .
cDNA Library Screening and Sequencing-The Hybri-ZAP A library was spread on 90-mm plates at 22,000 plaque-forming units/plate and overlaid with sodium chloride magnesium to obtain 60 phage pools .
These were screened via PCR using two Spi-C-specific primers ( 5'-GC-AAACATTTCAAGACGCC-3 ' and 5'-CTGTACGGATTGGTGGAAGC-3 ' ) , the products separated by electrophoresis and blotted onto charged nylon membranes , which were probed with a polynucleotide kinase end-labeled oligonucleotide ( 5'-CAGACCTGTATTTGGAAGGA-3 ' ) as described by the manufacturer ( Bio-Rad ) .
Two positive pools were iden-tified , and these were subsequently screened according to standard procedures using the original yeast Spi-C clone as probe and then excised as plasmids according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Stratagene ) .
The longest of the two clones was completely sequenced on each strand using the Sanger dideoxy method ( 26 ) with a combination of internal primers and restriction fragments cloned into pGEM 3Z ( Pro-mega ) .
The original yeast clone was sequenced in parallel , and no differences between the two clones were detected in overlapping sequences .
In Vitro Translation , EMSA , and Methylation Interference Analy-sis-The full-length Spi-C clone was cloned between the EcoRI and Xhol sites of the vector ( Invitrogen ) , while the partial Spi-C cDNA obtained from the yeast screening was cloned between the EcoRI and Xhol sites in a modified pcDNA vector in which an OCT2 ATG region ( 5'-AATTGCGGGCAGCATGGTTCATTCCAGCGAATT-3 ' ) had been inserted into the EcoRI site .
The cDNAs were in vitro translated using Promega 's coupled transcription/translation reticulocyte system from the T7 promoter .
The EMSAs were performed as described ( 16 ) , using between 1 and 0.1 ul of reticulocyte extract .
Competitions were performed using 10 , 30 , 100 , and 300 times , or 30 , 100 , 300 , and 1000 times molar excess of competitor ; the sequences of the competitors and probes can be found in Ref .
16 .
The methylation interference analyses were made as described ( 24 ) using protein translated from the yeast clone .
After autoradiography of the wet gel for 4 h , the free and bound probes were cut out , eluted in 1X TE with 50 mM NaCl overnight , extracted with phenol , and ethanol-precipitated .
The precipitated DNA was treated with piperidine as described ( 26 ) and subsequently separated on a 10 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , 1 X TBE gel that was fixed , dried , and autoradiographed .
Recombinant Proteins , Antisera , and Site Selection-The full-length or carboxyl-terminal part of Spi-C cDNA were amplified via PCR using Spi-C primers ( full-length : 5'-ACGAGATCTATGACTTGTTGTATTGA-TC-3 ' against 5'-ACGGAATTCTCAGCTCTGGTAACTGG-3 ' , carboxyl part : 5'-ACGA GATCTGAGGCTGTTCTCCAAAGA-3 ' against 5'-ACG-GAATTCTCAGCTCTGG TAACTGG-3 ' ) and inserted between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pGEX-2 vector ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) after restriction with Bg/II and EcoRI and verified by sequencing using the pGEX 5 ' primer ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) .
The proteins were expressed and purified on glutathione-Sepharose according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) , and the carboxyl terminus-containing protein was further purified on a Q Column ( Beckman ) and was then used to raise a polyclonal sera in rabbits according to standard procedures .
For the first round of site selection , an N oligonucleotide ( 5'-GCCACTGCGAATTCTCT ( N ) , , AAT-GGGATCCCGTCGCA-3 ' ) was annealed to a [ °*P ] polynucleotide ki-nase-labeled oligonucleotide , and fill-in was performed using Klenow enzyme .
This oligonucleotide was then used in EMSA with the recom-binant , full-length glutathione S-transferase-Spi-C protein .
A piece of the gel that corresponded to the mobility of the Spi-C-DNA complex was cut out and eluted in 1 % TBE overnight .
The eluted DNA was amplified for 15 cycles in PCR using 5 and 3 ' primers ( 5 ' primer : 5'-GCCACT-GCGAATTCTC-3 ' , 3 ' primer : 5'-TGCGACGGGATCCCAT-3 ' ) , end-la-beled , and purified by gel electrophoresis .
The selection procedure was repeated twice more , and the final PCR products were cut with EcoRI and BamHI , inserted into the pGEM3Z vector ( Promega ) , and sequenced .
RNA Extractions , Northern Blotting , and RT-PCR Assays-Northern blotting was performed using standard protocols , and 2 ug of poly ( A ) * Spi-C , a Novel Ets Protein RNA was loaded in each lane ( 26 ) .
Isolation of cells was done either by cell sorting ( FACS Vantage , Beckton Dickinson ) or by using magnetic MACS beads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) .
RNAs were prepared from tissue using a Pharmacia poly ( A ) RNA kit ( the B cell lines ) , Qiaex spin columns ( Qiagen ; ES cells , lymph node and liver ) , or RNAzo !
B ( Tel-test , Inc. ; the rest ) .
The RT reactions were performed using Superscript II ( Life Tech-nologies ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions , and the primers and probe used were the same as used in the library screen ( see above ) .
The amount of cDNA in each reaction was titrated using HPRT primers ( 27 ) .
Primers used to detect PU.1 expression in cell lines were described before ( 28 ) .
In some cases different exposures from the same blots are shown , but the HPRT exposure were always matched with the Ets probe exposure .
Transfection Constructs and Assay-The 4 % « Y reporter construct was made by inserting an oligonucleotide containing four copies of the KY element and the TATA box from the SP6 k promoter between the HindIII and Xhol sites of the pGL3 luciferase reporter vector ( Promega ) , and the TATA box only containing was subsequently created by EcoRI digestion and re-ligation to remove the xY elements .
To obtain a PU.1 expression vector , an EcoRI/Apal fragment containing the coding region of PU.1 was inserted into the pecDNA3 vector ( Invitrogen ) .
Hela cells ( 2.5 X 10° cells/transfection ) were transfected in duplicate using LipofectAMINE ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) .
Each transfection contained 0.2 ug of reporter plasmid and 0.3 ug of expression plasmid , as indicated .
All co-transfections were normalized to contain 0.8 ug of DNW/ transfection using the pcDNAS plasmid .
The cells were harvested and the luciferase activity determined after 40 h of incubation , and the mean value * standard deviation from three experiments is shown .
Southern Blotting and Chromosome Mapping-Southern blotting and the isolation of a genomic Spi-C clone was performed according to standard protocols ( 26 ) .
The chromosome mapping using FISH was performed by SeeDNA Biotech Inc. , Toronto , Canada .
Mouse chromosomes were prepared according to the published procedure .
Briefly , lymphocytes were isolated from mouse spleen and cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15 % fetal calf serum , 3 ug/ml concanavalin A , 10 ug/ml lipopolysaccharide , and 5 X 10~° M mercap-toethanol .
After 44 h , the cultures were treated with 0.18 mg/ml bro-modeoxyuridine for an additional 14 h. The synchronized cells were washed and recultured at 37 °C for 4 h in a-minimal essential medium with thymidine ( 2.5 ug/ml ) .
Chromosome slides were made by conventional method as used for human chromosome preparation ( hypotonic treatment , fixation , and air-drying ) .
As a probe , a 12.5-kilobase pair genomic fragment cloned from a 1129 genomic library was used after biotinylation using a Life Technologies BioNick labeling kit at 15 °C for 1 h ( 29 ) .
FISH detection was performed as described ( 29 , 30 ) .
Briefly , slides were baked at 55 °C for 1 h , and after treatment with RNase A the slides were denatured in 70 % formamide in 2 % SSC for 2 min at 70 °C , followed by dehydration with ethanol .
Probes were denatured at 75 °C for 5 min in a hybridization mix consisting of 50 % formamide , 10 % dextran sulfate , and mouse cot I DNA , and prehybridized for 15 min at 37 °C before being loaded on the denatured slides .
After overnight hybridization , slides were washed , detected , and amplified as described ( 29 ) .
FISH signals and DAPI banding pattern were recorded separately by photography , and the assignment of the FISH mapping data with chromosomal bands was achieved by superimposing FISH signals with DAPI-banded chromosomes ( 30 ) .
RESULTS Cloning of Spi-C , a « Y Interacting Protein-Fig .
1A shows a schematic illustration of the mouse SP6 k promoter .
This immunoglobulin promoter contains several DNA elements that are poor activators of transcription per se but that will stimulate octamer-induced transcription ( 16 , 24 , 31 ) .
In this study we focused on the octamer upstream region that contains two transcriptional control elements , the bipartite pentadecamer element and the kY element ( 16 , 24 , 32 , 33 ) .
In an effort to identify the proteins that interact with these DNA elements , we used the sequence shown in Fig .
14 as bait in a yeast one-hybrid screen of a cDNA library made from LPS-stimulated mouse B cells ( Fig .
1B ) .
We isolated several E-box binding clones , all encoded by the E2A and E2-2 genes ( data not shown ) , and in addition a clone containing a novel DNA sequence that we decided to call Spi-C. Also shown in Fig .

When using the pentadecamer/kY yeast strain , Spi-C could rescue yeast growth on 3-AT-containing media while an EBF-containing plasmid could not .
The opposite was true using the EBF control .
Furthermore , in the absence of selection , the cDNA clones also activated the transcription of the LacZ genes as expected ; Spi-C was positive only in the yeast strain used for screening , while EBF was positive only in the EBF bait strain .
To investigate the binding specificity of the Spi-C gene prod-uct , the insert from the original yeast clone was transcribed and translated in vitro and the protein product analyzed by band-shift using the bait sequence as a probe .
As shown in Fig .
1C , unlabeled probe competed efficiently for binding in this assay while a competitor that contained the SP6 k promoter octamer and its 3'-flanking region did not .
Further analysis of the region used as bait showed that a competitor that contained an intact xY element competed efficiently for binding , while competitors with mutations of the « Y element or with a truncated « Y element did not .
We concluded from these experiments that Spi-C interacted specifically with the « Y element in the SP6 k promoter .
Spi-C Is a Member of the Ets Protein Family-A full-length cDNA clone of Spi-C was isolated from a A cDNA library made from LPS-stimulated B cells using the insert from the yeast clone as a probe .
The full-length cDNA encompassed 1267 base pairs ( accession no .
AFO98863 ) , and contained an open reading frame starting with an ATG at position 144 and a stop codon at position 870 .
This would generate an open reading frame of 242 amino acids , with a predicted molecular mass of 28 kDa ( Fig .

Boldface letters indicate amino acids conserved in all Ets proteins , and helices 1-3 of the Ets domain are indicated .
C , the percentage of amino acid identity between Spi-B , PU.1 , and Spi-C in the Ets domain or indicated subregions .
The analysis was performed by hand .
Identical amino acids in a given position were scored ( X ) , and the percentage of identity calculated as X/N x 100 , where N indicates the total number of amino acids in the analyzed region .
2A ) .
Homology searches using the protein sequence showed that the protein had sequence similarity to the Ets proteins PU.1 and Spi-B in their DNA binding domain , while no significant homology was detected outside of this region .
Hence , Spi-C appears to be a novel member of the Ets transcription factor family .
Fig .
2 ( B and C ) shows an analysis of the protein sequence homology in the Ets domain between Spi-C , PU.1 , Spi-B , elf-1 , and Ets-1 .
Outside the Ets domain , the amino acid sequence diverged quite extensively compared with the other Ets family proteins .
With regard to the Ets domain , that of Spi-C matched those of PU.1 and Spi-B more closely than those of Ets-1 or elf-1 , although all amino acids that are universally conserved in Ets proteins ( 34 ) were also conserved within the Ets domain of Spi-C ( Fig .
2B ) .
The amino acid identity within the Ets domains of Spi-B and PU.1 was 73 % , while it was 59 % or 63 % when compared with Spi-C for PU.1 and Spi-B , respectively ( Fig .
2C ) .
When the a helices within the Ets domain were analyzed separately , the degree of identity between PU.1/Spi-B and Spi-C was most pronounced in helix 3 ( 79 % ) , while less marked in helix 2 ( 54-62 % ) and in helix 1 ( 31 % ) .
This is in contrast to the degree of identity between Spi-B and PU.1 that was very high ( 77 % ) also in helix 1 and 2 .
Since helix 2 and 3 entail the amino acids that contact DNA directly in PU.1 ( 35 ) , the higher level of identity between Spi-B/PU.1 and Spi-C is not surprising , given that Spi-C binds a bona fide PU.1 binding site ( 18 ) .

A , methylation interference analyses was performed using both strands of the 5 ' region of the SP6 x promoter with either in vitro translated PU.1 or Spi-C .
Interfering positions are marked with arrow-heads , and below the autoradiograph the sequence of the probe with interfering positions marked is shown .
B , competition of Spi-C or PU.1 binding to the xY element using competitors containing published PU.1 binding sites .
critical for PU.1 binding to DNA were conserved between PU.1 and Spi-C ( 36 ) .
We conclude from these results that Spi-C is more closely related to PU.1 and Spi-B than to other Ets proteins , but more diverged from these two proteins than those to each other .
Given the low degree of identity in helix 1 of the Ets domain , Spi-C might be representing a novel subgroup within the Ets protein family .
Spi-C DNA Interactions Are Indistinguishable from Those of PU.1-The interaction between Spi-C and the « Y element was further characterized and compared with that of PU.1 ( 18 ) .
First , the binding of the two proteins were studied via methylation interference analysis .
Methylation of the two central G nucleotides within the Ets motif of the non-coding strand completely inhibited both Spi-C and PU.1 binding , while no specific interference could be detected by methylation of the coding strand ( Fig .
3A ) .
Upon longer exposures , detected partial interference by methylation of some of the A residues could also be detected , identically for both proteins ( data not shown ) .
To further investigate the relationship between Spi-C and 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san $ 4g /310-2q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wou ; papeojumo ( Spi-C , a Novel Ets Protein 10263 TaBLE I Binding site preference for Spi-C Site selection was performed as described under `` Experimental Procedures , `` and plasmids containing inserts were randomly selected and sequenced .
Thirty out of 33 plasmids contained previously described PU .
1 binding sites and were used for the compilation above .
In the compiled sequence , a higher degree of base preference is indicated with uppercase letters ( present in over 65 % of the sequences ) while lower degree of preference is in lowercase letters .

The in vitro translated , full-length Spi-C generated two complexes in the band-shift and also two bands in SDS-polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis ( data not shown ) .
The larger of these bands correlated in size with the predicted value for full-length Spi-C ( 28 kDa ) , and we therefore assume that the more abun-dant , faster migrating complex represents a partial breakdown product with an intact DNA binding domain .
That the DNA binding domain is not affected by the limited proteolysis is supported by the fact that in vitro translation of the original yeast clone generated only one product ( Fig .
2C ) .
As shown in Fig .
3B , Spi-C « Y binding could be competed by PU.1 binding sites from the SV40 enhancer ( 11 ) , the k3 ' enhancer ( 17 ) , and the J-chain promoter ( 22 ) .
Furthermore , the amount of competitor needed to compete Spi-C binding was similar to that needed to compete PU.1 binding to the same probe .
Finally , we performed a site-selection experiment using recombinant Spi-C to ask the question whether any novel Ets binding motifs could be revealed .
As summarized in Table I , 90 % of the selected templates contained established PU.1 binding sites .
The most common was a GGA core motif ( 21/33 sequences ) , while 9 out of 33 sequences contained instead the variant AGA core found in the J-chain promoter ( 22 ) and in the macrophage colony-stim-ulating factor receptor ( 37 ) .
There was a clear preference for an A in the -4 , -1 , and +1 positions , while a preference for A or T could be seen in the -3 and +3 positions .
We conclude from these data that Spi-C and PU.1 bind to overlapping DNA elements with similar selectivity .
Spi-C Is Preferentially Expressed in Mature B Cells-To characterize the expression pattern of Spi-C , we performed semi-quantitative RT-PCRs from a panel of mouse tissues and purified cell populations ( Fig .
44 ) .
High expression was found in spleen and significant expression was also detected in lymph node and bone marrow .
Low expression could also be detected in thymus , Peyer 's patches , and liver , while no expression was seen in heart , striated muscle , or kidney .
We subsequently analyzed the Spi-C expression in purified cell populations .
No Spi-C expression was detected in embryonic stem cells , double-negative or double-positive thymocytes , or purified peripheral CD4* or CD8* T cells .
On the other hand , purified macro-phages expressed Spi-C RNA at low but detectable levels , and B220 * peripheral B lymphocytes at higher levels .
Thus , Spi-C seems to be preferentially expressed in the macrophage and B lymphoid lineage .
We next investigated the expression of Spi-C RNA in various cell lines , as a complement to the tissue and polyclonal cell analysis discussed above .
For comparison , the expression of PU.1 RNA was also investigated in these preparations while all samples had first been normalized using HPRT expression ( data not shown ) .
Fig .
4B shows that the macrophage cell line J774 showed low but significant Spi-C expression , concordant with the observed expression in freshly isolated macrophages .
More interestingly , when cell lines representing various stages of B lymphoid differentiation were analyzed for Spi-C expression , only cell lines having a phenotype of mature B cells were positive .
The two plasmacytoma cell lines J558 and S194 were negative , as were the pre-B cell lines 230-238 , 18-81 , and 70Z/3 .
The 70Z2/3 cell line differentiates to a mature B cells upon addition of LPS ( 38 ) , but such induction did not induce Spi-C expression .
Hence , it appears as if Spi-C expression is temporally regulated during B lymphoid differentiation and is preferentially expressed in mature , non-secretory B cells .
We finally investigated the expression of Spi-C by Northern blotting using poly ( A ) RNA from two plasmacytomas and from the B cell lymphoma K46R ( Fig .
4C ) .
The Spi-C probe hybridized with a single band migrating below the 18 S RNA marker in the K46R lane , while no hybridization was detected in the lanes with plasmacytoma RNA .
All three lanes gave a similar hybridization signal with the GADPH control probe .
The size of the Spi-C transcript correlates favorably with the isolated cDNA clone and the low expression level with the RT-PCR data above .
Spi-C Can Transactivate a « Y Reporter Gene Construct in HeLa Cells-We subsequently wanted to determine whether Spi-C was a transcriptional activator as a first characterization of its function .
To this end , 0.2 ug of a reporter construct , containing four copies of the « Y element from the SP6 x promoter in front of the luciferase gene , was co-transfected into HeLa cells together with 0.3 ug of an empty expression vector or a PU.1- or a Spi-C-containing expression vector ( Fig .
5 ) .
All transfections were adjusted to include 0.8 ug of total DNA using the empty expression vector , except the control transfection with the xY reporter only .
Co-transfection of the Spi-C expression vector induced an almost 10-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with that seen after co-transfection of the empty expression vector .
Co-transfection of the PU.1 expression vector induced a slightly higher luciferase activity than that observed with Spi-C at the same concentration , while the addition of PU.1 and Spi-C expression vectors together resulted in luciferase activity at the same level as seen with PU.1 alone .
Transfection of the expression vectors alone or together with a luciferase vector containing a TATA box only did not induce any significant luciferase activity ( data not shown ) .
We conclude from these experiments that Spi-C is a transcriptional activator of similar efficacy as PU.1 .
Spi-C Is Encoded by a Single-copy Gene Mapping to Chromosome 10 , Region C-We finally wanted to determine the genomic representation of Spi-C and therefore performed a genomic Southern blot .
As shown in Fig .

DISCUSSION The expression of several transcription factors has been shown to be essential for B cell development ( 39 , 40 ) .
Some of these are obligate for the formation of several hematopoietic lineages , while others seem to be selectively involved in B cell development .
Examples of transcription factors of both these types can be found within the Ets family of transcription fac-tors .
For example , the phenotypes of mice lacking either PU.1 or the closely related Spi-B , which have a partially overlapping expression patterns within the B cell compartment , differ sig-nificantly .
In mice homozygous for an inactivated PU.1 gene defects in the development of T and B lymphocytes , granulo-cytes and monocytes were observed ( 5 , 6 ) .
In mice devoid of Spi-B , the phenotype was milder and only antigen receptor signaling in B cells during immune responses seemed to be perturbed , while the remaining hematopoietic system appeared to be normal ( 23 ) .
Here we describe a novel Ets family protein , Spi-C , that seems to be preferentially expressed within the B cell compartment and has an expression pattern distinct from that of Spi-B and PU.1 .
A low level of Spi-C expression was detected in the macrophage cell line J774 and in purified macrophages , but whether this is representative for the whole macrophage line 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san $ 4g /310-2q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wou ; papeojumo ( 10266 age remains to be investigated .
Furthermore , the Spi-C RNA expression detected in liver and thymus could be due to the fact that these tissues contained a low number of B cells that expressed Spi-C .
Upon very long exposures , a low level of Spi-C expression could also be detected in heart and kidney RNA ( data not shown ) .
The conclusion that Spi-C expression in some of these organs was derived from contaminating B cells is strengthened by the finding that purified , double-negative thy-mocytes as well as peripheral CD4~* or CD8* T cells did not express Spi-C , while purified B220 * cells did .
Lymphoid organs that contain mature B cells like spleen , lymph node , and bone marrow did express Spi-C RNA .
As a comparison , PU.1 is expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage ( 13 ) and both PU.1 and Spi-B are expressed in T lymphocytes ( 3 ) .
Furthermore , Spi-C appears to be expressed during a window of B cell differentiation representing peripheral , mature B cells but neither early B cells nor plasma cells , a finding that also distinguishes Spi-C expression from that of PU.1 and Spi-B .
We did not detect any Spi-C expression in embryonic stem cells using RT-PCR while several expressed sequence tags can be found in the NCBI data base that appears to be derived from Spi-C .
Some of these have been cloned from a cDNA library prepared from blastocysts , which might indicate an additional role for Spi-C during early development .
In conclusion , we show evidence that Spi-C has an expression pattern distinct from that of other Ets proteins and we would like to propose that it has a unique function during B lymphoid differentiation .
The elucidation of that putative function must await the targeted inactivation of the Spi-C gene in the mouse germline .
Spi-C is related to Spi-B and PU.1 in the DNA binding Ets domain based on amino acid sequence homology , while it showed no homology to other Ets proteins outside this domain .
Furthermore , PU.1 and Spi-B are more closely related to each other than to Spi-C. Spi-C may therefore be considered to represent a novel subgroup of Ets proteins , especially considering the lower degree of amino acid sequence identity compared with Spi-B and PU.1 within helix 1 of the Ets domain ( 1 , 41 ) .
The DNA binding characteristics of Spi-C were very similar to those of PU.1 .
In methylation interference assays using the SP6 x promoter « Y element , the same protection patterns were observed using either PU.1 or Spi-C .
Furthermore , several PU.1 binding sites competed as efficiently for Spi-C binding as for PU.1 binding , and a site selection experiment selected defined PU.1 target sequences in > 90 % of the templates .
The only significant difference in binding site preference between the two that could be noted was a clear preference for an A in position -2 for Spi-C , while PU.1 selects a G in this position ( 2 ) .
Thus , it appears as if these two Ets proteins are alternative ligands to the same recognition sequences in mature B cells , although a minor divergence could be detected .
This could be expected , given the conservation of all residues in helix 2 and 3 of the Ets domain that has been shown to interact with DNA either by structural analysis or mutagenesis ( 34 , 35 ) .
On the other hand , given the sequence divergence in helix 1 of the Ets domain , some difference in sequence recognition of motifs outside the Ets core could be envisioned .
For example , amino acids in the NH terminus of PU.1 helix 1 form water-mediated or phosphate backbone interactions with DNA ( 34 ) .
It should also be considered that Ets proteins have been described to mainly exert their function as members of higher order protein complexes ( 19 , 42-44 ) , which might qualitatively influence the protein/DNA interaction .
For example , the DNA interaction of GABPa is of lower affinity than that observed for the GABP « /GABP $ B heterodimer , although only the former contains an Ets domain ( 45 ) .
It has also been shown that the part of the Ets domain of GABPa that interacts with GABP $ is in Spi-C , a Novel Ets Protein helix 1 ( 44 ) .
It is thus tempting to speculate that Spi-C might have a distinct preference from that of PU.1 and Spi-B with regard to protein/protein interactions and , as a consequence , a distinct function with regard to gene regulation both qualitatively and quantitatively .
The identification of a selective li-gand for Spi-C is obviously an interesting topic for future studies , as is the definition of its target genes .
Spi-C was cloned using the SP6 xk promoter kY element as bait .
This element is only found in some k promoters , and the role of Spi-C in the regulation of k transcription is difficult to envision , especially since Spi-C seems to be turned off in plasma cells .
Rather , the Ets motifs that have been shown to be critical for the control of immunoglobulin expression should be interacting with PU.1 or other Ets proteins at this late stage of B cell differentiation ( 14 , 17-19 , 22 ) .
One obvious possibility is that the relevant target gene ( s ) for Spi-C is not immunoglobulin but that our cloning approach rendered its isolation fortu-itously .
On the other hand , we could show by co-transfection that Spi-C contains a transcriptional activation domain of similar efficiency as PU.1 .
Whether the potential of Spi-C as a transcriptional activator , or its target sequence specificity , is modified if proper adapter molecules ( 19 ) are present remains to be determined .
Finally , the Spi-C locus was mapped to chromosome 10 , region C in the mouse .
No homogeneous syntenic region with regard to the human genome can be found , but several markers from this region map to human chromosome 12q22-24 ( 46 ) .
Interestingly , several chromosomal translocations in non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas have been described in this region ( 50 ) .
It should also be pointed out that , upon a data base search , a sequence corresponding a human homolog of Spi-C was identified on human chromosome 4p16.3 in the Huntington 's disease region ( GenBank accession no .
268163 ) .
However , this locus most likely corresponds to a pseudogene , since it is a near perfect match of the Spi-C cDNA with the exception of a deleted region that potentially corresponds to a splice-intermediate .
Furthermore , no synteny is evident between mouse chromosome 10 and 4p16 ( 46 ) .
However , the sequence of the human pseudogene would indicate that the Spi-C gene has about a 70 % homology between the mouse and the human genome .
In conclusion , our initial characterization indicates that Spi-C is an important regulator of B lymphocyte development , but the elucidation of its biological function must thus await further experimentation in vitro and in vivo .
