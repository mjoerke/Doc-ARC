1 Inhibition of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Replication by a Tat-Activated , Transduced Interferon Gene : Targeted Expression to Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1-Infected Cells YEU SU , '¢ WALDEMAR POPIK , ' anp PAULA M. PITHA `` `` * Oncology Center ' and Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics , `` The Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , Maryland 21231 Received 23 May 1994/Accepted 13 October 1994 We have examined the feasibility of using interferon ( IFN ) gene transfer as a novel approach to anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) therapy in this study .
To limit expression of a transduced HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) -IFNA2 ( the new approved nomenclature for IFN genes is used throughout this article ) hybrid gene to the HIV-1-infected cells , HIV-1 LTR was modified .
Deletion of the NF-KB elements of the HIV-1 LTR significantly inhibited Tat-mediated transactivation in T-cell lines , as well as in a monocyte line , U937 .
Replacement of the NF-KB elements in the HIV-1 LTR by a DNA fragment derived from the 5 ' -flanking region of IFN-stimulated gene 15 ( ISG15 ) , containing the IFN-stimulated response element , partially restored Tat-mediated activation of LTR in T cells as well as in monocytes .
Insertion of this chimeric promoter ( ISG15 LTR ) upstream of the human IFNA2 gene directed high levels of IFN synthesis in Tat-expressing cells , while this promoter was not responsive to tumor necrosis factor alpha-mediated activation .
ISG15-LTR-IFN hybrid gene inserted into the retrovirus vector was transduced into Jurkat and U937 cells .
Selected transfected clones produced low levels of IFN A ( IFNA ) constitutively , and their abilities to express interleukin-2 and interleukin-2 receptor upon stimulation with phytohemagglutinin and phorbol myristate acetate were retained .
Enhancement of IFNA synthesis observed upon HIV-1 infection resulted in significant inhibition of HIV-1 replication for a period of at least 30 days .
Virus isolated from IFNA-producing cells was able to replicate in the U937 cells but did not replicate efficiently in U937 cells transduced with the IFNA gene .
These results suggest that targeting IFN synthesis to HIV-1-infected cells is an attainable goal and that autocrine IFN synthesis results in a long-lasting and permanent suppression of HIV-1 replication .
Human interferon A ( IFNA ) inhibits replication of retrovi-ruses , including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) , an etiological agent of AIDS ( 11 , 17 , 21 , 26 , 41 , 55 ) .
Although HIV-1 is sensitive to IFN-mediated inhibition , HIV-1 infection does not induce expression of IFNA and IFNB genes in T cells or monocytes .
The efficacy of IFNA in the treatment of HIV-1 infection and AIDS-associated Kaposi 's sarcoma has been demonstrated in clinical trials ( 10 , 27 , 45 ) .
Nevertheless , the clinical use of IFN has been limited by frequent side effects induced by the administration of high levels of exogenous IFN ( 7 ) .
Furthermore , effective inhibition of HIV-1 replication in vivo may require continuous administration of IFN , since the inhibitory effect in vitro was reversed upon IFN removal ( 22 , 42 , 62 ) .
Consequently , for an optimal IFN effect and effective therapy or prophylaxis of AIDS , an improved method of IFN delivery is desirable .
Targeting IFN synthesis to a focus of infection by a transduced IFN gene ( s ) may provide the most effective approach .
In our previous study ( 4 ) , we showed that HIV-1 replication was inhibited in human T cells containing the integrated HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) -IFNAZ ( the new approved no * Corresponding author .

110 menclature for IFN genes is used throughout this article [ 10a ] ) hybrid gene .
IFN synthesis was increased by about 10 to 100 times when these cells were transfected with Tat-expressing plasmid .
However , virus-encoded Tat protein is not the only factor that can activate transcription of HIV-1 LTR and mitogenic stimuli and cytokines , or infection with viruses of herpes group activates HIV-1 LTR in a Tat-independent fashion through the enhancer elements present in the HIV-1 LTR ( 12 , 18 , 20 , 23 , 33 , 43 , 60 ) .
Thus , activation through these enhancers may lead to nonspecific activation of a LTR-IFN hybrid gene in the absence of HIV-1 infection .
Among enhancer elements present in the LTR region , the two kB motifs were shown to play a crucial role in activating expression of HIV-1 provirus in latently infected T cells ( 35 ) .
Transcriptional activation by the NF- « B enhancer is mediated by binding of a NF-kB heterodimer composed of 50-kDa ( p50 ) and 65-kDa ( p65 ) subunits ( 2 , 25 , 59 ) .
In most of the cells , the classic NF-kB ( p50-p65 ) is present in an inactive form in cytoplasm where it associates with the inhibitory protein IxB ( MAD3 ) ( 1 , 63 ) .
Activation of NF-kB , which involves dissociation of p50/p65 heterodimer from IxB and subsequent transport to the nucleus , can be triggered by a variety of extracellular stimuli , including cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF- « ) and interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) ( 38 ) , double-stranded RNA ( 29 ) , herpes simplex virus type 1 infection ( 18 , 61 ) , viral transactivators Tax and hepatitis B virus X protein ( 3 , 58 ) , T-cell mitogens ( 54 ) , bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( 54 ) , UV light ( 57 ) , and hydrogen peroxide ( 53 ) .
It is well established that IFNA exerts its effects by binding Vou .
69 , 1995 to a specific cell surface receptor and subsequently enhancing the transcriptional activities of a specific set of IFN-stimulated genes ( 16 , 28 ) .
The coordinate transcriptional control of these genes depends on the presence of a consensus enhancer sequence , the IFN-stimulated response element ( ISRE ) ( 31 ) .
Since our goal has been to obtain prolonged high concentrations of IFNA at the site of infection , we wished to determine whether IFN production from a transduced gene could be augmented through a putative feedback mechanism .
Using a HIV-1 LTR-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) plasmid that had a xB enhancer deleted , we examined the responsiveness of a plasmid with this xB-deleted LTR to Tat in various cell types that can be infected with HIV-1 .
We also tested the possibility of maintaining high levels of Tat-mediated IFN expression by substituting the two kB motifs in HIV-1 LTR with either ISRE or a segment of the promoter region of the ISG15 gene ( IFN-stimulated gene 15 ) containing an ISRE ( 28 ) .
Our results indicate that the deletion of the two NF-kB enhancer elements significantly decreased the efficiency of Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR in both T cells and monocytes .
Replacement of NF- « B enhancers by the promoter region of the ISG15 gene increased Tat-mediated transactivation in both types of cells , while this promoter was not activated by TNF- « .
HIV-1 infection of T cells and U937 cells containing the transactivable IFNA gene leads to stimulation of IFNA synthesis and long-lasting inhibition of HIV-1 replication .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell cultures .
Hela , Vero , and bovine embryonic trachea cells ( ATCC CCL-44 ) were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium ( Life Technol-ogies , Inc. Grand Island , N.Y. ) with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 2 mM glutamine , and 50 ug of gentamicin per ml .
A3.01 , CEM-174 , Jurkat , and U937 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium ( Life Technologies ) at a density of 3 X 10° cells per ml as previously described ( 55 ) .
Plasmid constructions .
Cloning of various restriction fragments was performed as described by Sambrook et al .
( 51 ) .
The ISG15-CAT hybrid plasmid was constructed by inserting the EcoRI-BemHI fragment , which contains -366 to +44 of the ISG15 promoter from plasmid NcoISG15-E1B ( 46 ) , between the Psfl and BamHI sites of pBLCAT-3 ( 32 ) .
The ( ISRE ) , ( -119 ) HIV-1 LTR-CAT plasmid was constructed by subcloning an EcoRI fragment , containing three copies of ISRE of ISG15 from ISG15-TK-3 plasmid ( 47 ) , into the Xhol site of ( -119 ) HIV-1 LTR-CAT ( 48 ) .
ISG15 ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR-CAT plasmid was constructed by subcloning a HindIII-Ddel fragment containing -366 to -36 of the ISG15 promoter between the HindIII and Psfl sites of ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR-CAT ( 56 ) .
Retrovirus vectors containing the modified HIV-1 LTR-IFNA2 hybrid gene were constructed by cloning the IFNAZ gene ( 4 ) between the HindIII and BamHI sites of pBluescript SK plasmid ( Stratagene , La Jolla , Calif. ) .
The HindIII-KpnI fragments containing either the ISG15 ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR or HIV-1 LTR ( -83 to +80 ) were then subcloned into the ClaI site of this plasmid .
Finally , the Xhol-Xbel fragment containing the modified HIV-1 LTR-IFNA2 hybrid gene from the plasmid described above were subcloned into the BamHI site of retrovirus vector pLJenh~ ( 13 ) .
Transfection and induction of expression in a transient transfection assay .
HeLa and Vero cells were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation as previously described ( 6 ) .
Briefly , cells were seeded at a density of 5 X 10° cells per 60-mm-diameter plate , and 24 h later , 2 mg of reporter CAT or IFNA plasmid and 1 pg of Tat-encoding plasmid were added as calcium phosphate precipitate .
After 5 h of incubation , cells were treated with 15 % glycerol for 1 min , washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline , and incubated for an additional 48 h. CAT extracts were then prepared as previously described ( 19 ) .
The A3.01 , CEM-174 , Jurkat , and U937 cells were transfected with similar amounts of plasmids by DEAE-dextran coprecipitation as described previously ( 24 ) .
Briefly , 5 X 10° cells were washed and incubated with plasmid DNA in 1 ml of DEAE-dextran ( 100 pg/ml ; Pharmacia , Piscataway , N.J. ) in RPMI 1640 medium for 10 min at 37°C .
The cells were then washed , refed with medium , and incubated for 48 h before harvest for the CAT assay .
To examine the effect of IFNA , transfected cells were divided into duplicate plates after DEAE-dextran was washed off , and 16 h later , human recombinant IFNA ( Hoffman-LaRoche Inc. , Nutley , N.J. ) was added at a concentration of 1,000 U/ml to one of the plates .
Cells were processed for the CAT assay 24 h after the addition of IFNA .
To examine the effect of IFNA on Tat-mediated transactivation , CEM-174 or U937 cells were cotransfected with reporter CAT plasmids and pMMextefIII ( 1 g ) .
The reproducibility of the transfection experi- SELECTIVE EXPRESSION OF A TRANSDUCED IFN GENE 111 ments was ascertained by repeating each experiment at least twice .
Comparable results were obtained in all instances .
Permanently transfected cell lines were established by electroporation of the retrovirus vectors containing hybrid IFNA genes and selection of the transduced cells by growth in G418 .
The selected cells were cloned by limiting dilutions and allowed to grow into the cultures .
RNA isolation and analysis .
Total RNA was prepared from Hela cells , collected 24 h after transfection , and U937 cells , 14 days after infection with HIV-1 , by the guanidinium thiocyanate method ( 8 ) .
Northern ( RNA ) blot hybridization was performed as previously described ( 44 ) , using a CAT riboprobe .
To examine IFN-induced expression of ISG15 , cells were treated with IFNA ( 1,000 U/m ! )
for 3 h , and total RNA was isolated by the acid phenol-guanidinium thiocyanate procedure ( 9 ) and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization with an ISG15 riboprobe .
IFN assays .
The media were collected from Vero , U937 , or Jurkat cells 48 h after transfection .
The media from the permanently transfected Jurkat and U937 cells before or after HIV-1 infection were collected as indicated .
Biologically active IFN was assayed in duplicate by inhibition of the cytopathic effect of vesicular stomatitis virus on bovine embryonic trachea cells ( 15 ) .
The level of IFN antiviral activity in cach sample was quantitated by comparison with standards of human recombinant IFNA2 ( Hoffman-LaRoche ) .
HIV-1 infection .
The HIV-1 pLN4-3 strain obtained from M. Martin was used in all experiments .
Virus stock was obtained from activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PMBC ) and titrated on C8166 cells , and unless otherwise stated , all infections were done with a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 0.01 .
Jurkat and U937 cells and the permanently transfected clones were plated at 10° cells per ml in RPMI 1640 medium with 10 % fetal calf serum and infected with the pNL4-3 strain of HIV-1 .
Every third day , 50 % of culture medium was removed and replaced with an equal volume of fresh medium .
Virus in the collected medium was analyzed by a reverse transcriptase ( RT ) assay as described previously ( 55 ) .
Stimulation of IL-2 and IL-2R gene expression .
Jurkat cells or JISGA3A clone cells were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) ( 5 ug/ml ) and phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) ( 50 pg/ml ) for 16 h ; cells were then washed and harvested , and total RNA ( 10 ug ) was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization with IL-2 DNA probe ( pCDHuIL-2 ) and IL-2 receptor B ( IL-2RB ) -specific riboprobes .
RESULTS NF-B-binding sites are required for efficient Tat activation in human T cells and monocytes .
Several earlier studies had addressed the question of the importance of NF- « B elements of HIV-1 LTR in Tat-mediated transactivation with somewhat different results ( 36 , 56 ) .
Therefore , we initially tested whether the NF- « xB-binding sites could be deleted without affecting the magnitude of Tat activation of HIV-1 LTR .
Several human T-cell lines ( ¥A3.01 , CEM-174 , and Jurkat ) and one promonocytic cell line ( U937 ) were chosen as hosts , and expression of the plasmids containing HIV-1 LTR with ( -119 ) or without ( -83 ) ( dkB HIV-1 LTR ) NF- « B-binding sites was examined in the presence or absence of a Tat-expressing plasmid ( plMex-tatIII ) .
As shown in Fig .
1 , expression of a xB-deleted mutant [ ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR ] was not efficiently activated by Tat in any of the three T-cell lines tested ( lanes 4 , 8 , and 12 ) when measured under conditions of linear response .
A low degree of activation of the « B-deleted mutant [ ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR ] could be achieved when 10-fold-higher levels of Tat-expressing plasmid were used for transactivation ; however , these conditions were far out of the linear response and therefore , not meaningful for our comparative analyses .
Tat-mediated activation of the ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR was observed in U937 cells ( lane 16 ) , but the levels of CAT activity were at least fivefold lower than those expressed by a plasmid containing the intact NF- « B-binding sites ( lane 14 ) .
Since earlier studies have shown that the NF-kB-binding sites are not required for Tat activation in either Jurkat or HeLa cells ( 56 ) , we examined the reasons for this discrepancy .
In contrast to T cells and monocytes , we observed significant Tat activation from the < B-deleted mutant in HeLa cells ( lane 20 ) .
However , when analyzed under conditions of a linear response , a dramatic difference in Tat activation of ( -119 ) HIV-1 LTR and ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR was found , even in HeLa cells ( lanes 21 and 22 ) .
These data confirm the previous 112 SU ET AL .

Efficient activation of HIV-1 LTR by Tat requires the presence of « B motifs .
( -119 ) HIV-1 LTR and ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR-CAT ( shown schematically at the top of the figure ) were transfected with ( + ) or without ( - ) pMextafIII ( Tat ) into T cells and monocyte lines .
The CAT assay was performed 48 h after transfection by using 40 g of cell extract in a 1-h reaction at 37°C , except for the assays shown in lanes 21 and 22 in which 20 pg of cytosol was used and incubation was for 15 min .
In A3.01 cells transfected with ( -119 ) HIV-1 LTR-CAT ( -119 ) , the conversion was in the range of 1.5 to 2.4 % in the absence of Tat and 65 to 75 % in the presence of Tat , while in cells transfected with ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR-CAT ( -83 ) , the values for conversion were 1.2 and 2.1 % , respectively ; the exception was U937 cells in which the conversion of this plasmid was about 6 % in the presence of Tat .
In the gel in the lower right-hand of the figure , total RNA ( 15 pg ) prepared from HeLa cells at 24 h posttransfection was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization with the CAT antisense riboprobes .
observation that in HeLa cells , the NF-kB sites are not required for transactivation .
These data also clearly show that the magnitude of Tat transactivation is lower in the absence of NF- « B-binding factors and that the effect of Tat and NF-kB is more than additive .
To confirm that CAT activity is a valid measure of steady-state CAT mRNA levels , we analyzed the levels of CAT RNA in HeLa cells 24 h after transfection .
As shown in the gel in Fig .
1 , the ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR-CAT plasmid was transactivated by Tat ( lane 4 ) , but the relative levels of CAT mRNA were much lower than those encoded by the wild-type HIV-1 LTR-CAT plasmid ( lane 2 ) .
To rule out the possibility that the observed difference in CAT activity might have resulted from different transfection efficiencies , the amounts of plasmid in the cytosol from the transfected cells were determined by dot blot analysis ( 34 ) .
No significant differences in the amount of plasmid DNA were found between each transfection ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that the NF-kB-binding sites of HIV-1 LTR may not be essential for Tat activation in HeLa or U937 cells , but these cis elements appear to be much more important for Tat activation in the human T-cell lines we tested .
It should be pointed out that although others ( 49 ) have shown that HIV-1 provirus which had NF- « B sites deleted was able to replicate in PBMC , its replication rate was much slower than that of the wild type .
Expression of ISG15 in human T and promonocytic cells can be induced by IFNA .
To compensate for the decrease of promoter activity of HIV-1 LTR caused by removal of the NF- « B-binding sites , we examined whether insertion of a well-defined IFN response element ( ISRE ) from the ISG15 promoter region ( 46 ) , upstream of the HIV-1 LTR , could enhance the promoter activity of HIV-1 LTR .
Since most of the early studies showed IFNA-mediated induction of ISG15 gene in HeLa or other human fibroblast cell lines ( 16 , 31 , 46 ) , we examined whether the ISG15 gene can also be induced in IFNA-treated human T cells ( A3.01 , CEM-174 , and Jurkat ) and monocytic U937 cells .
The results of Northern blot analysis ( Fig .
2 ) showed inducible expression of the ISG15 gene in all cell lines except A3.01 cells , which are rather insensitive to the IFNA effect ( data not shown ) .
To verify that the ISRE present in the promoter region of ISG15 at positions -111 to -94 is sufficient to confer an IFN response in cells other than fibroblasts , the promoter regulatory region ( -366 to +44 ) of the ISG15 gene was inserted upstream of the CAT reporter gene .
This construct was transfected into HeLa , CEM-174 , or U937 cells , and 16 h after transfection , the cells were treated with IFNA for 24 h and CAT activity was measured .
The ISG15 promoter conferred IFN response to the reporter gene in all three cell lines tested ( Fig .
2A , lanes 2 , 4 , and 6 ) .
A plasmid containing three copies of ISRE 5 ' of ( =119 ) HIV-1 LTR-CAT was also induced in U937 ( Fig .
2B , lane 8 ) and CEM-174 cells ( data not shown ) although less efficiently .
These results indicate that while ISRE alone can function in human T cells and monocytes , additional cis Vou .

element ( s ) in the ISG15 promoter region may contribute to the magnitude of induction .
Activity of ISG15-HIV-1 LTR chimeric promoter is enhanced by Tat .
Since a higher response to IFNA was observed when the ISG15 promoter , rather than multiple copies of ISRE , was linked upstream of the HIV-1 LTR , in the following studies , an ISG15 promoter ( -366 to -36 ) lacking the TATA box inserted upstream of ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR-CAT was used .
The inducibility of this plasmid by IFNA in the presence or absence of Tat was first examined in CEM-174 cells .
Figure 3 shows that while transfected ISG15 ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR-CAT plasmid was not expressed constitutively in these cells ( lane 5 ) , treatment of transfected cells with exogenous IFNA2 resulted in an approximately 4-fold increase of CAT activity ( lane 6 ) , while Tat-induced expression of ISG15 HIV-1 LTR-CAT plasmid was about 10-fold higher than expression of ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR-CAT plasmid ( lanes 4 and 7 ) , suggesting that factors binding to the enhancer ( s ) in the ISG15 promoter region can cooperate with Tat protein .
However , the addition of exogenous IFN did not increase significantly ( twofold ) CAT levels in the presence of Tat , indicating that the Tat-mediated transactivation of this promoter is much stronger than the stimulation of ISRE induced by ISGF-3 complex ( 30 ) .
ISG15-HIV LTR-CAT was also transfected into U937 cells .
In these cells , transactivation of the chimeric promoter by Tat was about 4- and 20-fold higher than the ( -119 ) and ( -83 ) SELECTIVE EXPRESSION OF A TRANSDUCED IFN GENE 113 A L_ ISG 15 _ | TATA | TAR CAT Reporter ( -119 ) HIV LTR| ( -83 ) HIV LTR - + = + - [ + [ - | + & @ 6 [ r | s I§G15 ( -83 ) HIV LTR Tat IFNA = # @ || : 5 CI Control PMA REW TNF-A Fold Activation an ISG15 ( -83 ) HIV LTR ( -119 ) HIV LTR FIG .

CEM-174 cells were transfected ( + ) with a given plasmid and induced ( + ) or not induced ( - ) with recombinant human IFNA ( 500 U/ml ) 24 h after transfection as described in Materials and Methods .

( B ) Activation of ( -119 ) HIV-1 LTR and ISG15 ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR-CAT expression by TNF-a in U937 cells .
U937 cells ( 10 `` ) were transfected with either ( -119 ) HIV-1 LTR-CAT or ISG15 ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR-CAT as described in Materials and Methods and then divided into two plates .
Twenty-four hours after transfection , recombinant human TNF- « ( TNF-A ) ( 100 U/ml ; Genentech , South San Francisco , Calif. ) was added to the medium while the other plate was used as a uninduced control .
Incubation was continued for a further 20 h before the CAT assay was performed .

Treatment of transfected cells with IFNA did not greatly affect the Tat-mediated activation of ( -119 ) HIV-1 LTR and ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR , while it slightly stimulated the expression of ISG15 ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR .
The activation of modified HIV-1 LTR by cytokines was also tested .
In contrast to the ( -119 ) HIV-1 LTR , the ISG15 ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR could not be activated by TNF-a ( Fig .
3B ) or IL-1 ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the modified HIV-1 LTR is not sensitive to NF- « B-mediated transactivation .
Surprisingly , however , this promoter was still responsive to PMA-mediated stimulation , indicating that not only NF- « B binding , but as shown in megakaryocytes ( 50 ) , additional alternative pathways are involved in PMA-mediated stimulation .
Tat-induced IFN synthesis in cells transiently transfected with retrovirus vectors containing the ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR and ISG15-HIV-1 LTR hybrid genes .
Since the ultimate goal of this study was to obtain a promoter that could express the IFN gene selectively in HIV-l-infected cells , we further tested 114 SU ET AL .

whether the ISG15-HIV-1 LTR hybrid promoter could be used to direct high levels of IFN synthesis in the presence of Tat proteins .
We inserted the ISG15-HIV-1 LTR chimeric promoter upstream of the human IFNA2 gene , and this hybrid gene was then introduced into pLJenh : retrovirus vector which has a deletion in the enhancer region of its 3 ' LTR ( 13 , 14 ) .
Similar vectors containing either the entire ( -119 ) HIV-1 ISG ] -366 to -36 of ISG15 [ HIV ] -83 to +80 of HIV-1 LTR CCZHV CITI +451 to +80 of HIV-1 LTR human IFN A2 J. ViroL .
LTR or the ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR-IFNA hybrid gene were used as the positive or negative control , respectively .
Synthesis of IFNAZ from these retrovirus vectors in the presence or absence of Tat protein was first analyzed in Vero cells , which contain a homozygous deletion of type 1 IFN genes ( IFNA and IFNB ) , and therefore , any IFN synthesis in these cells is encoded by the transduced IFN gene ( 34 ) .
Culture medium was collected 48 h after transfection , and levels of biologically active IFNA were measured as described in Materials and Methods .
As shown in Fig .
4 , in the absence of Tat protein , the amount of IFNA produced from the vector containing the ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR-IFNA hybrid gene inserted in the opposite ( = ) orientation was twofold higher than the amount obtained from the vector carrying the hybrid gene inserted in the forward ( + ) orientation .
In the presence of Tat , a 4-fold increase of IFNA synthesis was observed from the vector containing the forward-oriented hybrid gene , while more than a 20-fold increase of IFN synthesis was observed from the vector carrying the hybrid gene in the reverse orientation .
Orientation-dependent activation of an inducible promoter in this retrovirus vector was also observed in our previous studies ( 4 , 14 ) and is presumably due to the presence of an enhancer in the 3 ' adjacent simian virus 40 promoter directing the expression of the neomycin-resistant gene ( 14 ) .
Linkage of the 5'-flanking region of ISG15 gene to ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR resulted in a four- to fivefold increase of a constitutively produced IFNA from the retrovirus constructs , suggesting that the ISRE enhancer present in the linked ISG15 DNA fragment functions in Vero cells .
When an ISG15-LTR-IFNA2Z hybrid gene was inserted in the opposite orientation in this vector , a relative magnitude of transactivation ( 16-fold ) was similar to that obtained from the ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR .

In lanes 2 , 4 , and 6 , cells were cotransfected with plextefIII .
The arrow indicates the position of IFNA2 mRNA .
orientation into this retrovirus vector , Tat-mediated expression of IFN gene was much higher ( 20-fold ) in the presence than in the absence ( 5-fold ) of a ISG15 fragment .
These data indicate that the presence of heterologous enhancer ( ISG15 or simian virus 40 ) 5 of ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR enhances Tat-mediated transactivation .
Production of IFNA from these retrovirus vectors was also analyzed in monocyte ( U937 ) and T-cell ( Jurkat ) lines .
In U937 cells , constitutive levels of IFN were very low ( 5 to 16 U ) and were not increased by a linkage of the ISG15 DNA fragment to the ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR ; however , the presence of ISG15 greatly facilitated Tat-activated synthesis of IFN , and about a 38-fold increase in IFN synthesis was observed .
The high level of transactivation of this hybrid promoter was confirmed when the levels of IFNA mRNA were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization ( Fig .
5 ) .
The relative levels of IFNA mRNA directed by the ISG15-LTR hybrid promoters in the presence of Tat were about 10-fold higher than the levels encoded by the ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR promoter ( Fig .
5 , compare lanes 2 and 4 with lane 6 ) .
In contrast , in T cells , no constitutive IFNA synthesis could be detected in the absence of Tat and neither the ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR nor ISG15-HIV-1 LTR-IFNA hybrid were expressed constitutively and no IFN activity could be detected in the medium .
Only in the presence of Tat protein were these promoters transcriptionally activated .
Similarly , as in U937 cells , plasmids containing the ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR or ISG15-HIV-1 LTR-IFNA hybrid gene inserted in the opposite orientation were induced by Tat more efficiently than when the hybrid gene was inserted in the forward orientation .
These results indicate that constitutive expression of the ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR and ISG15-HIV-1 LTR is determined by the host factors and that in T cells , transient expression of a modified HIV-1 LTR is strictly dependent on the presence of Tat .
In contrast , the HIV-1 LTR promoter containing the enhancer region ( -451 HIV LTR ) was expressed constitutively in Jurkat cells even in the absence of Tat and relatively high levels ( 100 U ) of IFNA could be detected in the medium .
Yields of the recombinant virus are inhibited by IFNA synthesized in the packaging line .
To be able to transduce effectively the ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR or ISG15-HIV-1 LTR-IFNA hybrid genes into T cells and monocytes , we have attempted to package these hybrid genes into amphotropic virus pseudo-types .
Retrovirus vectors containing various HIV-1 LTR hybrid genes ( Fig .
5A ) were transfected into PA317 cells , neomycin-resistant clones were selected , and the levels of a recombinant virus in medium were analyzed by a RT assay and by the titration of the recombinant virus on NIH 3T3 cells and counting the neomycin-resistant colonies .
While the levels of SELECTIVE EXPRESSION OF A TRANSDUCED IFN GENE 115 RT in the medium of transfected cells were about 10- to 15-fold higher than in the untransfected cells , a titration on NIH 3T3 cells showed that only about 100 to 500 particles per ml are present in the medium .
In contrast , PA317 cells transfected with the vector alone produced about 5 X 10° to 5 x 10° neomycin-resistant particles per ml .
Transfected cells were , therefore , cloned , and the individual clones were tested for the production of recombinant virus , but no clone that produced more than 1,000 particles per ml was identified .
However , all clones tested produced low levels ( 5 to 10 U/ml ) of human IFNAZ constitutively ( data not shown ) .
The low packaging efficiency could be due to the inability of this particular construct to assemble efficiently or a consequence of the low constitutive IFNA synthesis in packaging cells .
We have previously shown that assembly of murine retrovirus particles is impaired in the presence of IFN ( 40 ) .
To be able to distinguish between these two possibilities , we transfected into PA317 cells another retrovirus construct , containing the ( -119 ) HIV-1 LTR-IFNA hybrid gene inserted into the pLNL6 vector .
In contrast to a pLJenh : vector used previously ( 14 ) , this vector has unmodified 3 ' LTR , and the recombinant gene is inserted 3 ' of the neomycin gene and is therefore , effectively expressed from a spliced mRNA ( 5 ) .
The neomycin-resistant colonies were selected , and the levels of virus and IFNA2 in medium of the individual clones were tested .
The results in Fig .
6 suggest an inverted relationship between IFNAZ production and levels of recombinant virions in the medium .
The highest yields of a recombinant virus were observed in clones that did not synthesize IFNAZ efficiently ( less than 20 U ) , while a majority of the clones that produced about 50 to 300 U of IFNA constitutively yield low levels of virus particles .
These data indicate that constitutive IFNA2 synthesis in the packaging line interferes with the assembly of the recombinant virus .
IFN synthesis in stably transfected T cells and monocytes and its effect on immune functions .
Because of an inefficient packaging of the recombinant retrovirus vectors in the amphotropic cells , retrovirus vectors containing the ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR-IFNAZ and ISG15-HIV-1 LTR-IFNA2Z hybrid plasmids ( Fig .
4 ) were transduced into Jurkat cells and U937 cells by electroporation , and neomycin-resistant clones were selected and tested for spontaneous production of IFNAZ .
While the pool of transduced clones produced about 50 U of IFNA per ml constitutively , the individually selected transduced U937 clones produced constitutively variable levels of IFNA ( Table 2 ) .
A majority of ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR-IFNA2-transduced clones ( 60 to 70 % ) produced low levels ( 5 to 50 U/ml ! )
of spontaneous IFNA , while a small percentage ( 5 to 20 % ) of U937 clones synthesized more than 100 U of IFNA per ml .
Similarly , 70 to 76 % of U937 clones containing integrated ISG15-HIV-1 LTR-IFNA hybrid gene synthesized low levels of IFNA ( 0 to 50 U/ml ) , and about 20 to 30 % of clones synthesized more than 100 U/ml .
These differences in expression among individual clones may be due to the number of integrated copies , as well as the position of the integration site .
However , the levels of constitutively produced IFNA were generally higher in U937 cells than in Jurkat cells ( data not shown ) .
In contrast to the transient expression assays , where the expression of ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR-IFNA and ISG15-HIV-1 LTR-IFNA plasmids in T cells was seen only in the presence of Tat , low levels of spontaneous IFNA synthesis ( 20 to 40 U/ml ) could be detected in the pool of transfected clones and in a majority of permanently transduced T-cell clones tested ( data not shown ) .
In order to determine whether constitutive IFNA synthesis interferes with the T-cell immune functions , we analyzed and 116 SU ET AL .

IFNA synthesis does not alter the ability of T cells to respond to mitogenic stimuli .
HIV-1 replication is inhibited in Jurkat and U937 cells containing integrated HIV-1 LTR-IFNA2 hybrid plasmids .
Replication of HIV-1 was analyzed in a clone of Jurkat cells permanently transfected with the retrovirus vector containing the recombinant ISG15-HIV-1 LTR-IFNAZ plasmids .
The selected clone ( JISG3-A ) , produced low levels of IFNAZ constitutively , but IFNAZ synthesis could be greatly enhanced upon transfection with the Tat-expressing plasmid ( data not shown ) .
Kinetics of HIV-1 replication in Jurkat cells and in a clone ( JISG3-A ) of Jurkat cells transfected with the ISG15-LTR-IFNAZ plasmid ( construct IV in Fig .
5A ) are compared in Fig .
8A .
It can be seen that while the levels of RT activity in the medium of infected Jurkat cells gradually increased , reaching maximum at 10 days postinfection , in JISG3-A cells HIV-1 replication was permanently suppressed .
Furthermore , in contrast to infected Jurkat cells ( which , by 10 days postinfection , started to show cell fusion ; by 2 weeks postinfection , more than 50 % of the cells were dead ) , no cytopathic effect was observed in the infected JISG3-A clone , and the infected cells were viable without any detectable cytopathic effect for a month postinfection , when the experiment was terminated ( data not shown ) .
The levels of IFNA2 synthesized in infected and uninfected JISG3-A cells were then analyzed .
The levels of IFNAZ in uninfected cells during the first 4 days were negligible ( less than 20 U/ml ) ( Fig .
8B ) ; however , IFN synthesis ( about 200 U/ml ) could be detected in these cells upon prolonged culti-vation .
We believed that this increase in IFNAZ synthesis is mediated by a ISG15 element present in our construct that is activated by constitutively produced IFNA accumulating in these cells ( 46 ) .
IFNAZ synthesis was , however , greatly enhanced in infected cells with the highest levels at 10 days postinfection when HIV-1 replication in both Jurkat and JISG3-A cells reached the maximal levels ; IFNAZ synthesis stayed elevated in infected cells throughout the whole experi-ment .
The levels of IFNA produced in the JISG3-A clone were affected by the multiplicity of HIV-1 infection ( Table 3 ) ; however , the increase was not linear .
A 20-fold increase in the multiplicity of HIV-1 infection increased the levels of IFN in the medium by only about 3-fold .
These data indicate that IFNA2Z synthesis can be transactivated in HIV-1-infected cells even when the levels of replicative virus are very low .
The inhibition of HIV-1 replication in JISG3-A cells was not affected by an increase in virus multiplicity in the range of MOI Vou .

Replication of HIV-1 in Jurkat cells transfected with ( -83 ) LTR-IFNA2Z ( JLTRS ) was not tested , since in these cells IFN synthesis was not significantly transactivated by Tat ( data not shown ) .
Replication of HIV-1 was further examined in two clones of U937 cells , ULTRS-14 and UISG3-8 , containing integrated ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR-IFNAZ ( construct I in Fig .
4 ) and ISG15-HIV-1 LTR-IFNAZ ( construct IV in Fig .

In both of these clones , synthesis of IFNAZ was greatly enhanced upon transfection with Tat-expressing plasmid ( data not shown ) .
As shown in Fig .
9A , U937 cells were permissive to HIV-1 infection , with maximal virus yield obtained about 17 days postinfection ; at later times , virus production decreased because of the cytopathic effect of HIV-1 , and by 21 days TABLE 3 .

SELECTIVE EXPRESSION OF A TRANSDUCED IFN GENE 117 postinfection , more than 70 % of cells were dead .
In contrast , HIV-1 replication was significantly suppressed in the ULTRS-14 clone , with only minimal virus replication at 21 days postinfection and no detectable cytopathic effect ; the experiment has been carried for 40 days without detection of any cytopathic effect and significant escape of HIV-1 from the IFNA2-mediated inhibition ( data not shown ) .
The second clone tested , UISG3-8 , was virtually nonpermissive to HIV-1 infection .
To determine whether there is a direct correlation between the levels of synthesized IFNAZ in the infected cells and inhibition of HIV-1 replication , we measured IFN synthesis in these two clones before and after HIV-1 infection .
ULTRS-14 clone produced relatively high levels of IFN constitutively ( 700 to 1,000 U/ml ) , while in UISG3-8 cells constitutive IFN synthesis was very low ( 25 to 100 U/ml ) ( Fig .
9C ) .
The small fluctuation in IFNAZ levels seen during the cultivation of these cells represents the variability in a biological assay .
A marked increase in IFNAZ production was observed upon HIV-1 infection in ULTRS-14 clone ; the maximal enhancement ( fivefold ) of IFN synthesis was seen at 17 days postinfection , which coincided with the maximal virus produc-tion .
Although the enhancement in IFNAZ synthesis was also seen in UISG3-8 cells , the relative levels were lower than in ULTRS-14 cells , and maximal enhancement ( fourfold ) was observed at 14 days postinfection .
Thus , the difference in the degree of inhibition of HIV-1 replication between these two clones is not directly related to the levels of IFNAZ produced in these cells , and additional factors may have played a role in the resistance of the UISG3-8 clone .
Interestingly , IFNA2 synthesis in the HIV-1-infected cells shows periodicity that may be directly related to the levels of replicating virus and Tat protein in these cells .
Since we could detect low levels of HIV-1 replication at later times ( 21 days ) postinfection in ULTRS-14 cells , we were interested to determine whether this virus represents an IFNA-resistant variant .
We , therefore , compared the ability of the HIV-1 isolate from the ULTRS-14 clone to replicate in U937 cells and the ULTRS5-14 clone .
The results in Fig .
10 show that while this HIV-1 isolate replicated effectively in U937 cells , its replication was limited in the ULTR-14 clone , suggesting that under conditions tested , this virus is still sensitive to the IFNA effect .
DISCUSSION In a previous study ( 4 ) , we have demonstrated that Tat and HIV-1 infection induced synthesis of IFN encoded by a transduced LTR-IFNAZ hybrid gene in human T cells ( 4 ) and that T cells containing the transactivable IFNAZ gene were nonpermissive to HIV-1 replication .
However , HIV-1 LTR can be activated not only by Tat but also by stimuli that increase binding of the NF-kB heterodimer to the enhancer elements of HIV-1 LTR ; this mechanism was shown to play a major role in TNF- « -mediated activation of the latent HIV-1 provirus and its Tat-defective variant ( 43 , 60 ) .
Since synthesis of TNF-a can be detected in AIDS patients , expression by the transduced HIV-1 LTR-IFNA gene in vivo would not be limited to HIV-1-infected cells .
It was shown that the xB motifs were not involved in Tat-mediated activation of HIV-1 LTR ( 36 , 56 ) ; therefore , we reasoned that deletion of these two elements should minimize the induction of HIV-1 LTR by cytokines or by heterologous viral infection , both of which are mediated by NF-kB ( 43 , 60 , 61 ) , without affecting Tat transactivation .
Surprisingly , we found that in cells permissive to HIV-1 infection , HIV-1 LTR in which the xB motifs were deleted was not efficiently transactivated by Tat ( Fig .
1A ) .

HIV-1 replicating in ULTR5-14 cells is not an IFNA-insensitive variant .
HIV-1 isolate from ULTRS5-14 cells at 21 days postinfection ( MOI of 0.01 ) was used to infect U937 and ULTR5-14 cells , and viral replication of this variant was analyzed by measuring the levels of RT in the medium of infected cells .
cells classical NF-KB is present in an inactive form , it is unlikely that this factor alone plays an important role in Tat-mediated induction of HIV-1 LTR , unless activated during the course of Tat synthesis .
However , recent studies have shown that the Tat protein is unable to enhance expression of the p105 gene , which encodes the p105 precursor of the p50 subunit of NF-kB in U937 cells ( 39 ) .
Thus , we can only speculate that some other cellular factor ( s ) binds to the xB motifs of LTR in T cells and monocytes and cooperates with Tat to enhance transactivation .
Since deletion of the kB motifs resulted in inefficient transactivation of LTR by the Tat protein , we examined the feasibility of increasing IFNA synthesis through enhancer activity and/or a possible feedback augmentation by the IFN-induced cellular factor ISGF-3 ( 30 , 51 ) and inserted a DNA fragment from the ISG15 promoter region , containing an ISRE , upstream of HIV-1 LTR with deleted kB motifs .
Although it had been shown that the ISRE of the ISG15 promoter region is sufficient for transcriptional induction by IFNA ( 31 ) , in T cells and monocytes , the natural ISG15 promoter was induced more efficiently by IFNAZ than the three copies of ISREs , suggesting that additional cis-acting sequences in the ISG15 promoter may contribute to its response to IFNA in these cells .
The presence of ISG15 in ISG15 ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR significantly increased Tat activation , suggesting that the constitutively present , trans-acting factor ( s ) ( possibly ISGF-2 [ 31 ] ) bound to the ISRE enhancer ( s ) can cooperate with Tat .
In T cells , this cooperation seems to be less efficient than that between NF- « B and Tat , which is more than additive ; activation of wild-type HIV-1 LTR by Tat was 10 times higher than that of ISG15 ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR ( Fig .
3 ) .
In contrast , in U937 cells , Tat-mediated transactivation of ISG15 ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR was more efficient than that of HIV-1 LTR ( Table 1 ) .
This difference in the Tat-mediated effect between monocytes and T cells may be due to the difference in constitutive levels of the trans-acting factor ( s ) interacting with the ISG15 enhancer ( s ) .
In both cell types , activation of the ISG15 ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR by Tat was not significantly altered by the addition of exogenous IFN , suggesting a lack of synergistic interaction between the IFNA-induced ISGF-3 complex and Tat .
One important feature of this chimeric HIV-1 LTR is the elimination of its response to the NF-kB inducer ( s ) , and limitation of its expression to Tat-expressing cells .
Whereas the inducibility of TNF-a « was abolished completely , the response SELECTIVE EXPRESSION OF A TRANSDUCED IFN GENE 119 to PMA was merely decreased , since PMA activates HIV-1 LTR not only through NF- « B but through other cellular factors as well ( 50 ) .
Since PMA is not a physiological inducer , it should not play a major role in the activation of this chimeric promoter in vivo .
However , additional testing of this plasmid is needed to evaluate its response to extracellular stimuli in vivo .
The feasibility of using a chimeric HIV-1 LTR to direct IFN synthesis from a transduced IFN gene in HIV-1-infected cells was shown in both T cells ( Jurkat ) and promonocytic ( U937 ) cells .
Thus , in transiently transfected cells , expression of this modified HIV-1 LTR in the absence of Tat was either undetectable ( Jurkat cells ) or very low ( U937 ) .
In contrast , low levels of constitutive IFNAZ synthesis ( about 50 U ) were observed in pools of monocytes and T cells containing integrated ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR or ISG15-HIV-1 LTR-IFNA2 plasmids ( data not shown ) .
However , when individual clones were analyzed , a majority of transduced clones produced low levels of IFNA constitutively ( 5 to 50 U/ml ) , while a small percentage of clones synthesized more than 100 U of IFNAZ per ml .
We do not know presently whether a high level of expression of the transduced IFNAZ gene in these clones is a consequence of the presence of ISRE in the hybrid plasmid or reflects a multiple integration or position effect leading to an enhanced transcriptional activity .
Our data , however , indicate that the ( -83 ) HIV-1 LTR is not completely transcriptionally inactive in the absence of Tat protein ; the high specific activity of IFNA ( about 2.4 x 10° U/mg ) provides a detection sensitivity not available in a conventional assay ( measuring the levels of RNA transcripts ) .
While replication of HIV-1 was significantly suppressed in transduced cells , it was sufficient to stimulate IFNA synthesis in these cells .
These data indicate that only very low levels of Tat protein are needed for transactivation of a transduced IFNA gene .
Both the inhibition of HIV-1 replication and synthesis of IFNA persisted in the infected cells up to a month postinfection .
Synthesized IFNA protected the infected cultures from the HIV-1-induced cytopathic changes , while it did not alter the growth rate of transduced cells ( data not shown ) .
The constitutive IFNA synthesis also did not affect the mitogenic response of these cells , as shown by their abilities to express IL-2 and IL-Z2R genes upon PHA and PMA stimulation .
Our study showed , however , that should the transfer of IFNA gene be used in clinical studies , the packaging of the recombinant retrovirus vector into the amphotropic virus pseudotype has to be optimized .
The yields of recombinant virus produced by a majority of the selected clones were low and somewhat indirectly related to the levels of IFNA produced in transfected clones ; the highest virus yield was obtained from cell clones that produced very low levels of IFNA .
We have previously shown ( 40 ) that assembly of murine retrovirus is inhibited in IFN-treated cells , but we expected that the low levels of constitutively produced human IFNA in the murine packaging line would not have a major effect on the assembly of the recombinant virus .
Additional studies will have to determine whether a high yield of recombinant virus could be obtained in the presence of anti-human IFNA antibodies or whether other viral vectors may provide an alternative , more effective strategy for delivery of IFNA genes .
The IFNA-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 replication shows several unique features compared with the other HIV-1 inhibitors used in the gene therapy approach .
First , the long-lasting suppression of HIV-1 replication in cells that synthesize IFNA2 in an autocrine fashion suggests that the formation of the IFN-resistant HIV-1 phenotype is not acquired as easily as resistance to nucleoside inhibitors or ribozymes is ( 37 , 52 ) .
We 120 SU ET AL .
have previously shown that in a single-step cycle infection , IFNA inhibits HIV-1 replication on a preintegrational step at the level of provirus formation ( 55 ) .
Similarly , in cells transduced with the transactivable IFN gene , there was marked inhibition of provirus integration and expression ( data not shown ) .
The inability of HIV-1 to escape IFNA-mediated inhibition easily suggests that the formation of the IFN-resistant HIV-1 phenotype may involve larger changes than point mutations found in zidovudine and ribozyme-resistant HIV-1 variants ( 37 , 52 ) .
Second , in contrast to ribozymes or dominant negative mutants that have been used for intracel-lular `` immunization , `` transduction of the IFNAZ gene is associated with the amplification effect mediated by a released IFNA .
The ability of IFNA to inhibit HIV-1 replication by both the autocrine and paracrine mechanisms would be of a great advantage for its use in vivo , where transduction of a protective gene into every cell is not easily attainable .
In summary , we have shown that the modified ISG15-HIV-1 LTR promoter is able to direct high levels of IFNA2 synthesis in human T cells and monocytes infected with HIV-1 .
Unlike endogenous IFNA , expression of the transduced ISG15-HIV-1 LTR-IFNA gene is induced by HIV-1 infection , and its induction is further enhanced by IFNA ; in contrast to the natural HIV-1 LTR , the chimeric HIV-1 LTR is not stimulated by NF- « B-specific activators such as TNF- « .
It will be of interest to examine whether primary PBMC or macrophages containing the transduced ISG15-LTR-IFNAZ hybrid gene are resistant to HIV-1 infection and retain their immune functions .
These experiments are currently under way in our laboratory .
