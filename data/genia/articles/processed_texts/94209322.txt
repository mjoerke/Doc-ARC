Spl Is a Critical Factor for the Monocytic Specific Expression of Human CD14* ( Received for publication , December 3 , 1993 , and in revised form , January 5 , 1994 ) Dong-Er Zhangt , Christopher J. Hetherington , Shencao Tang , Suzan E. Dziennis , David A. Gonzalez , Hui-Min Chen , and Daniel G. Tenen1 From the Division of Hematology /Oncology , Department of Medicine , Beth Israel Hospital and Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 CD14 is a membrane glycoprotein expressed specifically on monocytes and macrophages , and its expression is markedly increased during the process of monocyte differentiation .
In order to study CD14 gene regulation , the human CD14 gene was cloned from a partial EcoRI digested chromosome 5 library .
A 5.5-kilobase genomic clone contained the full-length CD14 coding sequence and 4.2 kilobases of 5'-upstream sequence .
One major and one minor transcription start site were identified 101 and 130 base pairs ( bp ) upstream , respectively , from the protein translation start ATG .
A DNA fragment containing 128 bp of upstream sequence had strong , monocyte-specific promoter activity in the CD14 positive monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 as compared to the non-monocytic cell lines Hela and REX .
Four regions in this DNA fragment interact with nuclear proteins isolated from monocytic cells .
The Spl transcription factor bound to three different regions in the CD14 promoter .
Mutation of the major Spl binding site ( -110 bp ) decreased tissue-specific promoter activity , and these results , together with transactivation experiments , demonstrate that Sp1 plays a critical role in the tissue-specific expression of CD14 in monocytic cells .
CD14 Spl site oligonucleotides bound preferentially to a 105-kDa Spl species , which is present in higher relative levels in monocytic than non-monocytic cells , suggesting that modification of Spl , such as phosphorylation , may explain how the Spl site mediates monocytic specific promoter activity .
Monocytes/macrophages are important leukocytes in the circulating blood and in almost every tissue of the human body .
These cells are involved in regulation of specific immune responses and in nonspecific defense against infection and malignancy ( Ziegler-Heitbrock , 1989 ) .
However , the mechanism of development of this cell lineage from bone marrow pluripotent stem cells is still poorly understood .
One way to approach this problem is to study the regulation of monocyte-specific genes .
Since tissue-specific gene expression is regulated to a significant degree by specific trans-activators , characterizing the fac- * This work was supported by United States Public Health Service Grant CA41456 .

tors involved in lineage-specific gene regulation should reveal insights into the mechanisms of monocyte/macrophage lineage development and activation .
Furthermore , since acute myelogenous leukemia , the most common form of acute leukemia in adults , represents a failure of normal myeloid ( monocytic and neutrophilic ) differentiation , characterizing the factors involved in normal monocytic development may supply valuable information related to the pathogenesis of acute myelogenous leukemia .
CD14 ( previously known as gp55 , My4 , and My23 ) is a monocytic differentiation marker and a receptor for the complex composed of lipopolysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein ( Haziot et al .
, 1988 ; Simmons et al .
, 1989 ; Wright et al .
, 1990 ) .
Studies on the expression of CD14 using monoclonal antibodies demonstrate it is a specific marker for monocytic cells , with trace amounts detected in activated granulocytes ( Griffin et al .
, 1981 ; Ball et al .
, 1982 ) .
Little or no CD14 is expressed in monocytic precursors , and the receptor is strongly up-regulated during the course of monocytic differentiation .
Studies of CD14 expression using the human CD14 cDNA demonstrate that expression of CD14 mRNA in different cell lines matches that of the surface expression ( Simmons et al .
, 1989 ) .
When promyeloid and monoblast cell lines are treated with monocytic differentiation inducers , such 1,25-dihy-droxyvitamin D , , the accumulation of CD14 mRNA is increased in parallel with surface expression ( Simmons et al .
, 1989 ; Oberg et al .
, 1993 ) .
This up-regulation of CD14 expression is mediated mainly at the level of transcription , `` as is the reduction of CD14 expression by interleukin 4 ( Lauener et al .
, 1990 ) .
However , the transcription factors mediating tissue-specific expression and differentiation related up-regulation of CD14 have not been defined .
Recently , the murine CD14 promoter has been isolated and shown to direct tissue-specific expression of a reporter gene in transient transfections ( Matsuura et al .
, 1992 ) .
In addition , these investigators identified an upstream element which was capable of binding nuclear proteins in macrophage cell lines and could enhance the expression of a reporter gene , suggesting that this element played an important role in tissue-specific expression of the murine CD14 promoter .
In this paper , we report the isolation and characterization of the human CD14 gene , the identification of tissue-specific promoter activity in the first 128 bp `` of the promoter , and the description of the protein-DNA interactions in this region of the CD14 promoter .
These studies demonstrate that the Spl transcription factor , previously shown to play a role in other monocytic gene promoters ( Chen et al .
, 1993 ) , also contributes significantly to the monocytic specific expression of CD14 . '

Nuclear protein { in the presence of 4 ug of double stranded poly ( dI-dC ) ) , 1 ul of purified Spl ( Promega ) , or 1 ul of purified AP-2 ( Promega ) were incubated with radiolabeled DNA probe in a total of 20 pl of binding buffer ( 10 my HEPES , pH 7.9 , 30 mm KCI , 5 mm MgCl , , 1 mm dithiothreitol , 1 mx EDTA , 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 12 % glycerol ) .
Binding reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 0 °C .
Nuclear Extracts-Mono Mac 6 cells , REX cells , and HeLa S3 cells were grown to 4 x 10° cells/ml and harvested for nuclear protein ex-traction .
Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described ( Zhang et al .
, 1990 ) .
Approximately 15 mg of nuclear protein were prepared from 1 x 10° cells .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay-*P-Labeled double stranded oligonucleotides for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay were prepared as previously described ( Pah !
et al .
, 1993 ) .
DNA binding conditions were identical to those for DNase I footprinting , except for the addition of 1 ng of double stranded poly ( dI-dC ) .
Reactions were electro-phoresed at 10 V/em on a 6 % polyacrylamide gel ( bisacrylamide : acrylamide = 1:29 ) in 0.5 x TBE ( 45 mm Tris borate , 45 mm boric acid , 1 mm EDTA ) at 4 °C .
In Fig .

For on-rate binding experiments , samples were loaded to the polyacrylamide gel 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , and 8 min after the start of binding reaction .
For off-rate binding experiments , a 25-fold molar excess of unlabeled self-oligonucleotide was added to the DNA/protein mixture 20 min after the initial binding reaction and the samples were loaded on the polyacrylamide gel 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 15 min after adding the self-competitor .
Site-directed Mutagenesis-Mutation in the Spl site at bp -110 of the CD14 promoter was generated using oligonucleotides carrying point mutations ( Zaret et al .
, 1990 ) .
The mutated CD14 promoter fragment was generated by polymerase chain reaction .
Plasmid p-227CD14-luc was used as a template with primer A ( as indicated above ) and primer C ( 5'-GGGGTACCTTCCTTTCCTGG-3 ' ) to generate PCR fragment 1 ; with primer B ( as indicated above ) and primer D ( 5-GGGGTACCTG-GCTCGGAGG-3 ' ) to generate PCR fragment 2 .

Luciferase assays were performed 48 h after transfection as previously described ( Pah !
et al .
, 1991 ) .
Southwestern Blotting-This was performed following a published protocol ( Morabito et al .
, 1991 ) .
Whole cell proteins were prepared by adding the SDS sample buffer directly to fresh cell pellets ( Sambrook et al .
, 1989 ) .
Total protein from 1.5 x 10° cells were separated in a 6.5 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel ( bisacrylamide : acrylamide = 1:29 ) using the Laemmli buffer system ( Laemmli , 1970 ) .
The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane ( Schleicher & Schuell BA55 ) by electro-blotting at 0.4 A for 14 h. Prehybridization was performed for 2 h at 37 °C with 5 % nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline .
Hybridization was performed for 4 h at 4 °C with 50 ng of P end-labeled CD14 Sp1 binding oligonucleotide in 15 ml of hybridization buffer ( 0.25 % nonfat dried milk , 20 pg/ml salmon sperm DNA , 25 mu HEPES , pH 7.9 , 50 mm KCl , 3 mm MgCl , , 5 mx dithiothreitol ) .

Western Blotting-Following Southwestern blotting and autoradiog-raphy , the same nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 % nonfat dried milk at 37 °C for 30 min with gentle agitation to remove the probe .
Membranes were then incubated for 5 h at 37 °C with Sp1 polyclonal antibody ( diluted 1:1000 ) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 % nonfat dried milk , 0.02 % Triton X-100 , washed three times with Tris-buffered saline , and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody ( diluted 1:1500 , Bio-Rad ) in Tris-buffered saline containing 1 % nonfat dried milk and 0.02 % Triton X-100 , washed three times in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.02 % Triton X-100 and once with Tris-buffered saline .
Color development utilized 4-chloro-1-naphthol according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Sigma ) .
The colored Spl bands on the Western blot were quantitated by scanning on a ScanJet Plus Scanner ( Hewlett-Packard ) followed by densitometry analysis using ImageQuant `` Software ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
RESULTS Cloning and Characterization of the Human CD14 Gene-Since the transcription of CD14 mRNA is strongly up-regulated during myelomonocytic differentiation , we analyzed its genomic structure to further study key regulatory elements in the CD14 promoter .
The CD14 gene has been mapped to human chromosome 5q23-31 ( Goyert et al .
, 1988 ) .
Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA with the full-length cDNA as a probe demonstrated that CD14 is a single copy gene ( Simmons et al .
, 1989 ) .
A partial EcoRI-digested chromosome 5-specific genomic library from the American Type Culture Collection was used to clone the CD14 gene .
One clone was characterized and demonstrated to have a single 5.5-kb insert , which was the same size as the single band detected on Southern blots with EcoRI digested DNA ( Simmons et al .
, 1989 ) .
The 5.5-kb insert hybridized to an oligonucleotide made from the most 5'-region of the coding sequence ( data not shown ) , and was subcloned into pUC18 for further characterization .
Sequence analysis confirmed that this DNA fragment was the gene for CD14 .
There is a single 88-bp intron immediately after the ATG translation start codon .
Mapping this genomic clone indicated that the 3 ' end was colinear with the 3 ' end of the cDNA , and that approximately 4.2 kb of the genomic clone was 5 ' of the first codon for translation .
Therefore , the entire gene and the promoter region was isolated on this single phage .
The 5'-upstream region of the CD14 gene was sequenced as shown in Fig .
1 .
Identification of CD14 Gene Transcription Initiation Site-To identify the transcription initiation site of CD14 gene , RNase protection experiments were performed .
The radiolabeled riboprobe was 347 nucleotides long , including upstream CD14 sequence extending from 4 nucleotides upstream of the translation start site ATG .
When this probe was hybridized to total RNA from human monocytes and digested with RNases , it generated a major band of 98 bp and a minor band of 127 bp as shown in Fig .
2 , Lane 2 .
Total RNA from Hela cells ( Fig .
2 , Lane 1 ) and tRNA ( Fig .
2 , Lane 3 ) were used as negative controls and show no protected bands .
The results demonstrate that the major CD14 transcription start site is 101 bp upstream of the translation start site , with a minor start site 130 bp upstream as indicated in Fig .
1 .
The first base pair of the major transcription start site is numbered as +1 .
Sequence Analysis of the CD14 5'-Upstream Region Reveals Consensus Transcription Factor Binding Sites-Sequence analysis of the region upstream of the transcription start site identified several putative binding sites of transcription factors as marked in Fig .
1 .
The sequence CATAAA at -28 is similar to the sequence of the TATA box ( TATAAA ) ( Greenblatt , 1991 ) .
There is no typical initiator sequence YAYTCYYY around the transcription start sites ( Smale and Baltimore , 1989 ; Roeder , 1991 ) .
A Spl consensus sequence is found at +20 ( Dynan and Tjian , 11427 -474 CATGC AGTTAAATAT CTGAGGATAT -451 yb TCAGGGACTT GGATTTGGTG GCAGGAGATC AACATAAACC AAGACAAGGA -401 [ AGAAGTCARh carafoGaa®c Armcracamtc TcroccaTat Arcoraccoc -351 Api Api rrecaracrte caororaTes TaAcTGGoccTA AGGCACTGAG -301 ccarnr/cop GATCATCCTT TTCCCACACC CACCAGAGAA GGCTTAGGCT CCCGAGTCAA -251 CAGGGCATTC A E ; l CGCCEELPCAGGACAC TGCCAGGAGA -201 AP2 APL CACAGAACCC TAGATGCCCT GCAGAATCCT TCCTGTTACG G'IECCCCTCC ~151 AP2 ETGAAACATC CTTCATTGCA ATATTTCCAG GAAAGGAAGG [ GEETC -101 SP1 MAG AGGTGGGGAG GTGATCAGGG TTCACAGAGG AM -~51 PU .

Human CD14 5'-flanking region .
Sequence was obtained from both strands by the dideoxy method .
The translation start site ATG is underlined .
The major and minor transcription start sites are marked with large and small arrows , respectively .
The beginning of the major transcription start site is numbered as +1 .
Lower case letters indicate the intron sequence .
The shaded boxes are putative transacting factor binding sites , as discussed under `` Results . ``
Also shaded is the experimentally detected Sp1 site at bp -110 .
The asterisk ( * ) indicates the end of the published cDNA sequence at bp +27 ( Simmons et al .
, 1989 ) .
The DNA sequence has been submitted to the Genbank data base ( accession No .
UOO699 ) .
1983 ; Letovsky and Dynan , 1989 ) .
A potential site for the ets family member PU.1 ( GAGGAA ) is located at -95 ( Klemsz et al .
, 1990 ) .
In addition , there are two Myb sites ( -55 , -469 ) ( Weston , 1992 ) , 3 AP-1 sites ( -220 , -385 , -395 ) ( Wasylyk et al .
, 1989 ) , two AP-2 sites ( -235 , -155 ) ( Williams and Tjian , 1991 ) , and one CDP ( CCATT displacement protein ) site ( -397 ) ( Skalnik et al .
, 1991 ) .
The human CD14 sequence was compared with the recently available murine CD14 upstream sequence ( Matsuura et al .
, 1992 ) .
As shown in Fig .
3 , the similarity is about 71 % between -200 and +110 of the human CD14 gene with 100 % match in many smaller regions .
The similarity is much lower further upstream of this region .
Since important regulatory sequences are more conserved during evolution , these similarities suggest the region from bp -200 to +110 may contain tissue-specific promoter activity .
Identification of CD14 Positive Cell Lines to Characterize CD14 Promoter-To study the tissue-specific expression of CD14 , it is important to identify cell lines that are positive for expression of CD14 RNA .
The Mono Mac 6 cell line is perhaps more similar to mature monocytes than other cell lines available ( Ziegler-Heitbrock et al .
, 1988 ) .
Surface expression of CD14 protein by fluorescence-activated cell sorting in Mono Mac 6 cells is significantly higher than the monoblast cell line U937 ( data not shown ) .
The expression of CD14 at the mRNA level was examined in different cell lines .
As shown Fig .
44 , compared to HeLa cells , in which there is no detectable CD14 mRNA , Mono Mac 6 cells expressed high levels of CD14 mRNA .

Identification of the CD14 transcription start site by RNase protection assay .
Ten ug of total RNA from HeLa cells ( Lane 1 ) , human monocytes ( Lane 2 ) , and tRNA ( Lane 3 ) were hybridized with antisense riboprobe and digested with RNases A and T , .
The size of undigested 347-nucleotide riboprobe is marked with an asterisk ( * ) .
Arrows on the left side of the panel point to the 127- and 98-nucleotide protected fragments .
Lanes G , A , T , and C , are M13 mp18 sequencing size markers .
The immature T cell line REX , undifferentiated promonocytic cell line U937 , and undifferentiated promyelocytic cell line HL-60 did not show any CD14 mRNA in Northern blot analysis ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that Mono Mac 6 would be an excellent model for further study of CD14 expression .
The CD14 5'-Upstream Sequence Contains Strong Tissue-specific Promoter Activity-To analyze the 5'-flanking region for promoter activity , a series of deletion fragments of CD14 5'-upstream sequence were generated by either restriction enzyme digestion or PCR and inserted into the luciferase reporter vector pXP2 , as shown in Fig .
4B .
Promoter activity was monitored by luciferase assay after transfection into the CD14 expressing cell line Mono Mac 6 .
All values were corrected for transfection efficiency with co-transfection of RSV-hGH .
In Mono Mac 6 cells , the CD14 5'-flanking region demonstrated very strong promoter activity ( Fig .
4B ) .
The luciferase activity of p-227CD14-lue transfection was over 300-fold higher than the pXP2 promoterless construct .
As little as 128 bp of upstream sequence was capable of directing reporter activity 120-fold above pXP2 .
Addition of sequences up to 4.2 kb upstream did not yield higher promoter activity compared to the bp -227 to +80 construct .
In order to investigate whether the CD14 promoter directed tissue-specific reporter activity , CD14 promoter activity was also examined in the CD14 negative cell lines REX and HeLa .
As shown in Fig .
4C , comparative analysis revealed that the CD14 promoter functions 18-28-fold more efficiently in CD14+ cells than in CD14- cells .
Therefore , the results of these transfection experiments demonstrated that as little as 128 bp of 5'-flanking region of the CD14 gene contains strong tissue-specific promoter activity .
Sp1 Directs Monocytic Specific CD14 Promoter Expression DNase I Footprinting Analysis Reveals Multiple Interactions between Nuclear Proteins and the CD14 Promoter-Important cis-acting elements of promoters direct gene expression through interaction with tissue-specific and constitutive transacting factors .
DNase I footprinting was used to study the interaction of nuclear proteins with the DNA fragment including the strong bp -227 to +80 tissue-specific promoter described above .
Nuclear extracts isolated from Mono Mac 6 cells and HeLa cells were used in this footprinting analysis .
Fig .
5 , Panels A and B , show the footprinting results with coding and noncoding strand labeled DNA fragments , respectively .
There are four strongly protected regions marked with bars and roman numerals .
Region I includes the TATA box sequence ATAAA .
Region II contains sequences similar to PU.1 and Myb binding sites .
Region III includes a sequence similar to a PU.1 binding site .
Region IV contains sequences similar to NF-IL6 and PU.1 binding consensus sites .
A summary of the specific sequences protected in the DNase I footprinting experiments is shown in Fig .
5C .
Transcription Factor Sp1 Binds to the CD14 Promoter-The sequence GGGCTGG at the 3 ' side of protected region IV is similar to the Sp1 binding consensus sequence GGGCGG ( Dynan and Tjian , 1983 ; Letovsky and Dynan , 1989 ) .
To verify whether Sp1 can interact with the CD14 promoter , purified Spl protein was used in a DNase I protection experiment as shown in Fig .
6 .
There was a strong Sp1 binding site from bp -99 to -118 of the CD14 promoter and two weak binding sites ( bp -50 to -70 and bp -75 to -94 ) .
The strong Sp1 binding site includes the GGGCTGG sequence .
As a control , purified AP-2 protein was also used in the DNase I footprinting experiments as shown in Fig .
5 , Lane 3 .
No interaction of AP-2 and CD14 promoter fragment can be detected .
To verify whether Sp1 is indeed a component of the binding activity in nuclear extracts , an oligonucleotide representing the CD14 promoter region from bp -124 to 96 was used in gel mobility shift analysis with nuclear proteins from the monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 and from non-monocytic HeLa and REX cells ( Fig .
7 , Lanes 2-4 ) .
As shown in the figure , there were no tissue-specific factors interacting with this region of CD14 promoter .
The major shifted complex ( labeled Sp1 in Fig .
7 ) can be competed with unlabeled self oligonucleotide ( Lane 5 ) and a characterized Sp1 binding oligonucleotide ( Lane 6 ) , but not by a non-Sp1 binding oligonucleotide ( Lane 7 ) .
The Spl complex also can be specifically reduced with Sp1 antibody ( Lane 8 ) , but not with preimmune serum ( Lane 9 ) .
These results demonstrate that Spl binds to the CD14 promoter in nuclear extracts .
Two complexes designated with astersiks ( * ) are shifted bands likely generated by degraded Sp1 protein , since an older lot of purified Sp1 protein ( Promega ) also gave these two complexes which could be competed with Sp1 binding oligonucleotides but not abrogated by Sp1 antibody ( data not shown ) .
We have previously observed such faster migrating Spl complexes using monocytic nuclear extracts ( Chen et al .
, 1993 ) .
The Sp1 Binding Site Is Critical for the Tissue-specific Expression of CD14 Promoter-To verify the functional importance of Sp1 for CD14 promoter activity , 3 base pairs ( -110 to -108 bp ) in the core Sp1 binding site were changed from GGG to TAC by PCR mediated site-directed mutagenesis , .
This mutation destroyed Spl binding to the -110-bp region ( Fig .
8 ) .
Luciferase constructs with and without this mutation in CD14 promoter were used in transient transfections .
The mutation decreased relative CD14 promoter activity 10-fold in Mono Mac 6 cells .
Although the wild type CD14 promoter is much more active in the Mono Mac 6 cells compared to non-monocytic HeLa and REX cells , the Sp1 binding site mutation has a much stronger relative effect in Mono Mac 6 cells than in HeLa and REX cells .

used in the transfection , CD14 promoter activity was 15- and 38-fold higher in Mono Mac 6 cells compared to REX cells and Hela cells , respectively .
When the Spl mutant construct p-227CD14 ( m110 ) -lue was used , CD14 promoter activity was only 3- and 5-fold higher in Mono Mac 6 cells compared to REX cells and HeLa cells , respectively .
Sp1 Can Transactivate the CD14 Promoter in Sp1 Negative Drosophila Cell Lines-To further demonstrate the importance of Spl to CD14 promoter activity , Spl transactivation experiments in the Sp1 negative Drosophila Schneider S2 cells were performed as shown in Fig .
9 .
The results showed no transactivation of the promoterless pXP2 and herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter pT81-luc luciferase constructs .
When an Sp1 binding site is inserted into the thymidine kinase promoter ( the pT109-lue construct ) , Spl can transactivate the thymidine kinase promoter 8-fold .
When the CD14 promoter was used in place of thymidine kinase promoter , Spl transactivated the promoter 44-fold .
This indicates that Spl plays an important role in CD14 expression .
When the -110 bp Sp1 binding site-mutated CD14 promoter was used in the same experiments , Sp1 still could trans-activate CD14 promoter , but the transactivation was much weaker , about 10-fold ( Fig .
9 ) .
This remaining 10-fold increase could due to the activity of the other Sp1 binding sites , or perhaps by Spl stimulation of the activity of other CD14 promoter binding factors .
Characterization of Sp1 in Monocytic and Non-monocytic Cells-The above results demonstrate that Sp1 is an important transcriptional regulator of CD14 expression in monocytic cells .
We asked whether there was a difference in affinity of binding in nuclear extracts prepared from monocytic Mono Mac 6 cells and non-monocytic HeLa .
The CD14 Sp1 binding site oligonucleotide was used as in Fig .
7 in on-rate and off-rate experiments to analyze the association and dissociation rates of Sp1 complex ( Wagner and Green , 1993 ) .
In the conditions used to perform these experiments , there were no significant differ ences in Sp1 binding on- and off-rates between nuclear extracts from Mono Mac 6 cells and HeLa cells ( data not shown ) .
Sp1 exists in multiple forms , including differences in glyco-sylation and phosphorylation ( Jackson and Tjian , 1988 ; Jackson et al .
, 1990 ) , which can be distinguished by SDS-polyacryl1-amide gel electrophoresis ( Jackson et al .
, 1990 ) .
To investigate whether different forms of Spl interact with the CD14 Sp1 site in different cells , whole cell protein extracts from Mono Mac 6 and HeLa cells were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels , transferred to nitrocellulose membranes , and studied by Southwestern blot analysis .
The P-CD14 Spl binding site probe was used in the hybridization .
As shown in Fig .
104 , the CD14 Sp1 site probe only interacted with the 105-kDa form of Spl ( con-firmed by the following Western blot analysis in Fig .
10B ) and there was no cell type-specific band detected in this assay .
To study which Sp1 forms are present in the two cell types , the same nitrocellulose membrane used in the Southwestern analysis described in Fig .
10A was washed and reused in a Western blot analysis .
As shown in Fig .
10B , polyclonal Spl antibody detected a DNA binding 105-kDa and a non-DNA binding 95-kDa Sp1 protein , as well as a slower migrating form which has also been observed previously ( Jackson et al .
, 1990 ; Katai et al .
, 1991 ) .
In three independent experiments , Mono Mac 6 cells had 65 % less total Sp1 than HeLa cells .
The ratio of 105-kDa Sp1 to 95-kDa Sp1 is higher in Mono Mac 6 cells ( 1:2 ) than the ratio in HeLa cells ( 1:4 ) .
DISCUSSION In this paper , we report the isolation of the promoter for the human monocytic differentiation antigen CD14 , which provides an opportunity to study the regulation of tissue and differentiation specific CD14 expression through analysis of the cis-acting promoter elements and identification of the important trans-acting factors interacting with these elements .

action within bp -227 to +80 of the CD14 promoter ( data not shown ) .
If this monocytic specific factor plays any significant role in CD14 expression , it may be through an interaction with presently unidentified CD14 enhancer element ( s ) , as in the interaction of PU.1 with the immunoglobulin x chain 3'-en-hancer ( Pongubala et al .
, 1992 ) .
Recently , Matsuura et al .
( 1992 ) presented evidence for the existence of an element in the murine CD14 promoter which was capable of forming gel shift complexes with proteins from macrophage cells .
Although the human and murine promoters have significant similarities in structure , with a nearly identical transcription start site and high conservation of the first 200 bp of DNA sequence upstream of the transcription start site ( Fig .
3 ) , there clearly are significant differences in the regions of the promoters which direct tissue-specific promoter activity .
Specifically , we have found no evidence that the element described by Matsuura et al .
( 1992 ) plays a significant role in human CD14 tissue-specific promoter activity , since the murine macrophage factor binding element that they described is not conserved with the human promoter ( see Fig .
3 ) , and the corresponding region of the human promoter ( located at approximately bp -295 ) is not necessary for promoter activity and tissue-specific promoter activity ( Fig .
4 ) .
However , the sequence GCATTCA at bp -246 to -240 of human CD14 is similar to TGATTCA of the critical element identified by Matsuura et al .
( 1992 ) .
It is possible that these human sequences bind the factor reported by Matsuura et al .
( 1992 ) .
We provide evidence for a role for Sp1 in the tissue specific activity of the CD14 promoter .

In particular , Spl is highly expressed in hematopoietic tissues , suggesting an important role in hematopoietic cell development ( Saffer et al .

Studies have demonstrated modulation of Spl activity by level of expression ( Saffer et al .

, 1991 ) , and post-translational modifications , including phosphorylation and differential glycosyla-tion in different cell types ( Schaufele et al .

Tjian , 1988 ) .
Methylation of Spl binding sites may regulate developmental specificity of the human y globin gene promoter in erythroid cells ( Jane et al .
, 1993 ) .
Furthermore , Spl has been implicated in the retinoic acid-induced expression of the tissue plasminogen activator gene , and retinoic acid is known to induce differentiation of myeloid cell lines .
Recently , it has been shown that the retinoblastoma gene product ( RB ) can activate several promoters through a response element consisting of an 11433 Spl binding site ( Kim et al .
, 1992 ; Udvadia et al .
, 1993 ) .
RB becomes dephosphorylated ( and therefore activated ) during the course of myeloid differentiation of promonoblasts to mono-cytes , in temporal association with the up-regulation of CD14 mRNA expression .
Sp1 binding sites , present in multiple monocytic specific genes such as CD11b ( Pahl et al .
, 1993 ) , the M-CSF receptor promoter ( Zhang et al .
, 1994 ) , and CD14 , could facilitate the modulation of monocyte gene expression by RB .
Finally , we have previously demonstrated that Spl plays a critical role in the monocytic specificity of the CD11b promoter by binding to the CD11b promoter specifically in myeloid cells in vivo ( Chen et al .
, 1993 ) .
All of these results suggest that Spl may play a critical role in tissue-specific promoter activity of monocyte genes .
We have identified Spl binding to the CD14 promoter with DNase I footprinting and gel mobility shift assays .
In contrast to the CD11b Sp1 site , in which mutation of the Sp1 site decreases promoter activity indistinguishably in both monocytic and non-monocytic cells ( Chen et al .
, 1993 ) , mutation of the -110 bp Sp1 binding site in CD14 promoter not only decreases the activity of the tissue-specific -227 CD14 promoter 10-fold , but also results in a relative loss of tissue specificity , in that the mutation reduces the ratio of reporter gene activity between monocytic cells and cervical carcinoma cells from 40:1 to 5:1 .
This same Spl site mediates at least part of the vitamin D ; -induced up-regulation of CD14 expression when monocytic cell lines undergo monocytic differentiation in response to vitamin D ; , `` The N-terminal glutamine-rich region of Spl contains two potent transcriptional activation domains ( Courey and Tjian , 1988 ) and is important for the formation of Spl homomultimers and interactions with the transcriptional coactivator TAF110 ( Pascal and Tjian , 1991 ; Hoey et al .
, 1993 ) .
While dephosphorylated Sp1 has an apparent molecular mass of 95 kDa , phosphorylation of this N-terminal region results in the formation of a 105-kDa form ( Jackson et al .
, 1990 ) .
Our results indicate that the ratios of 105- and 95-kDa Sp1 in HeLa cells and Mono Mac 6 cells are different .
The CD14 Sp1 binding oligonucleotide only interacts with the 105-kDa form of Sp1 .
The higher percentage of 95-kDa Spl in HeLa cells may compete out the 105-kDa Sp1 for CD14 promoter binding and thus reduce CD14 expression in HeLa cells .
Although we could not detect any other factors interacting with Sp1 by in vitro gel mobility shift assays , it is still possible that Sp1 interacts with other specific factors in vivo ; for ex-ample , RB can activate the c-fos and insulin-like growth factor II promoters through Sp1 sites , although no complexes between RB and Sp1 could be observed in gel shift assays ( Udvadia et al .
, 1993 ; Kim et al .
, 1992 ) .
The -227 to +80 region of the promoter appears to direct tissue-specific transcription , and DNase I footprinting experiments reveal four regions of this part of the CD14 promoter which interact with nuclear proteins .
Besides Sp1 , other factors which bind to the promoter , and possibly with Sp1 , could be important for tissue specific expression .
DNase I footprinting did not directly show any monocytic specific interactions of nuclear proteins with the CD14 promoter in this region ( Fig .
5 ) .
One possibility is that although ubiquitous factors might interact with the CD14 promoter in a non-tissue specific manner in vitro , they only bind to CD14 promoter in vivo in CD14 positive cells ; an example in monocytic cells is the interaction of Spl with the myeloid specific gene CD11b ( Chen et al .
, 1993 ) .
This possibility can be confirmed by in vivo footprinting analysis .
Alternatively , such ubiquitous factors , such as Spl , may be altered by modifications , such as phosphorylation , to contribute to differential regulation of promoter activity .
Our results sug- 11434 gest that such modification of Spl may indeed contribute to the monocytic specificity of CD14 expression .
