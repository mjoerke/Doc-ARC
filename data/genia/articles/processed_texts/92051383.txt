21 5929-5936 One base pair change abolishes the T cell-restricted activity of a kB-like proto-enhancer element from the interleukin 2 promoter Karoline Briegel* , Bernd Hentsch , Isolde Pfeuffer and Edgar Serfling* Institut fur Virologie und Immunbiologie der Universitat Wurzburg , Versbacher StraBe 7 , D-87 Wurzburg , FRG Received July 25 , 1991 ; Revised and Accepted October 7 , 1991 ABSTRACT The inducible , T cell-specific enhancers of murine and human Interleukin 2 ( II-2 ) genes contain the kB-like sequence GGGATTTCACC as an essential cis-acting enhancer motif .
When cloned in multiple copies this so-called TCEd ( distal T cell element ) acts as an inducible proto-enhancer element in El4 T lymphoma cells , but not in HeLa cells .
In extracts of induced , II-2 secreting E14 cells three individual protein factors bind to TCEd DNA .
The binding of the most prominent factor , named TCF-1 ( T cell factor 1 ) , is correlated with the proto-enhancer activity of TCEd .
TCF-1 consists of two polypeptides of about 50kD and 105kD ; the former seems to be related to the 50kD polypeptide of NF-kB .
Purified NF-kB is also able to bind to the TCEd , but TCF-1 binds stronger than NF-kB to TCEd DNA .
The conversion of the TCEd to a 'perfect ' NF-kB binding site leads to a tighter binding of NF-kB to TCEd DNA and , as a functional consequence , to the activity of the 'converted ' TCEd motifs in HeLa cells .
Thus , the substitution of the underlined A residue to a C within the GGGATTTCACC motif abolishes its T cell-restricted activity and leads to its functioning in both El4 cells and HeLa cells .
These results indicate that lymphocyte-specific factors binding to the TCEd are involved in the control of T cell specific-transcription of the II-2 gene .
INTRODUCTION The expression of tissue-specific genes is controlled to a large extent at the level of gene transcription by the activity of tissue-specific promoters and enhancers .
These control elements consist of multiple sequence motifs that are bound by a variety of transacting factors ( 1 ) .
The enhancers of many tissue-specific genes , for example those of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) , globin and albumin genes , interact with cell type-specific factors as well as ubiquitous factors , and it is assumed that the cooperative activity of both types of factors controls the transcriptional activity of the linked gene ( 1 ) .
Similar to the immunoglobulin enhancers , the inducible activity of the Interleukin 2 ( I1-2 ) enhancer is restricted to one cell type , i.e .
to T lymphocytes ( 2-4 ) .
The II-2 enhancer harbors several T cell-specific proto-enhancer elements ( 4 , 5 ) .
These are protein binding sites which exert a T cell-specific activity in transient transfection assays when they are cloned in multiple copies in front of a test gene .
One of the T cell-specific II-2 proto-enhancer elements , the so-called distal T cell element ( TCEd ) ( 4 ) , has been identified to bind in vitro the ubiquitous factor NF-kB as well as lymphocyte-specific factors ( 4 , 6-9 ) .
However , so far there is no compelling experimental evidence on how the binding of these factors is involved in the establishment of T cell-retricted activity of the TCEd motif in vivo .
NF-kB was originally described as a lymphocyte restricted transcription factor , but soon it was also found in an inducible form in the cytoplasm of non-lymphoid cells ( 10 , 11 ) .
Active ubiquitous NF-kB consists of two components , i.e .
of polypeptides of about 50 kD and 65kD which share sequence similarity with the products of proto-oncogene c-rel , the oncogene v-rel and the Drosophila gene dorsal ( 12-15 ) .
The 65kD polypeptide seems to be necessary for the interaction of NF-kB with IkB , the cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-kB ( 16 ) .
It is thought that IKB is the primary target for the numerous extracellular signals which lead to the activation of NF-kB ( 10 ) .
Binding sites for NF-kB are part of transcriptional control regions of numerous cytokine and lymphokine genes ( 17 ) .
The inducibility of NF-kB by stimuli which are able to activate resting T lymphocytes led to the assumption that NF-kB plays a pivotal role in the transcriptional control of many lymphokine genes , including the I1-2 gene ( 10 , 11 ) .
However , many of the kB-like sequence elements of lymphokine gene enhancers and promoters diverge in their primary structure from the 'consensus ' NF-kB binding site , and they represent only weak binding sites for NF-kB ( 17 ) .
Thus , it remains to be shown whether the weak binding of NF-kB to these kB-like elements in vitro has any functional implication for the control of lymphokine gene activities in vivo .
The TCEd sequence differs in a few nucleotides from a canonical NF-kB binding site .

21 in extracts of activated E14 T lymphoma cells three factors bind to the TCEd .
The binding of the most prominent factor , named TCF-1 , is correlated with the proto-enhancer activity of TCEd in E14 cells .
TCF-1 consists of two polypeptides of about 105kD and S5SOkD ; the latter seems to be similar to the SOkD polypeptide of NF-kB .
Moreover , we will show that the transition of the underlined A residue within the TCEd 'core ' sequence , GGG-ATTTCACC , to a C converts this weak NF-kB binding site to a distinctly stronger NF-kB binding site and abolishes its T cell-restricted activity .
Thus , the change of one nucleotide determines whether this kB-like proto-enhancer motif acts as a cell type-specific or ubiquitous enhancer motif .
These data are in line with the conclusion that in T lymphocytes the activity of kB-like enhancer motifs of lymphokine genes is controled by several differently regulated DNA binding proteins ( see ref .
18 ) .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture , DNA transfections and CAT assays Murine E4 lymphoma cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 5 % fetal calf serum to a density of about 4x 10° cells per mi .
1.6 x 10 `` cells were transfected with 10 ug DNA ( purified by two CsCl/ethidium bromide density gradient centrifugations ) in a final volume of 1.2 ml using the DEAE dextran procedure ( 19 ) .
After transfection , the cells were shocked with 15 % dimethylsulfoxide for 3 min and , 20 hr later , they were divided .
One half of the cells were induced with the phorbolester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ; 10 ng per ml ) and the plant lectin concanavalin A ( Con A ; 2.5 ug per ml ) ; the other half was used as the uninduced control .
The cells were incubated for another 20 hr , sonicated , and their CAT acitivity was measured as described ( 4 ) .
HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium containing 5 % fetal calf serum .
They were transfected using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation procedure ( 20 ) and shocked with 25 % dimethylsulfoxide for 4 min .
Ten ug DNA were normally transfected per 100 mm plate .
CAT activities were calculated by counting the radioactive spots of thin layer chromatograms and normalized with regard to the protein content of cell lysates .
The 'percentage of acetylation ( in Fig .
2B ) corresponds to the percentage of acetylated chloramphenicol determined for the induced cells .
The 'ratio of induction ' ( Fig .
2B ) was calculated by dividing the percentage of acetylation of stimulated cells by the percentage of acetylation of unstimulated cells .
DNA cloning The recombinant DNA work was carried out according to standard recombinant DNA techniques ( 21 ) .
Point mutations were introduced into the TCEd sequence using the Amersham oligonuclotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis system .
The mutated enhancer DNA was sequenced and introduced into the CAT vector pBLCAT2 ( 22 ) .
For the cloning of multiple protein binding DNA sequences chemically synthesized oligonucleotides were purified on 20 % polyacrylamide ( PAA ) -42 % urea gels , annealed , ligated and fractionated on 2.5 % agarose gels .
Multiple copies were isolated from the gel and introduced in front of the tk promoter in pBLCAT 2 ( 22 ) .
The construction of all except four of the recombinant plasmids used in this work has been described ( 4 , 23 , 24 ) .
They were : SxTCEd-M : ; Five copies of the TCEd-M ( Fig .
2A , with Hind III ends ) were introduced opposite to the direction of transcription .
5xTCEd+kBcore : Five copies of the TCEd+kBcore ( with Hind III ends , Fig .
2A ) were introduced in the direction of transcription .
SxkB+TCEdcore : Five copies of the kB+TCEd core ( with Sal I/Bam HI ends as the kB oligonucleotide in J16 : Fig .
2A ) were introduced between the Sal I/Bam HI sites of pBLCAT2 .
Three copies were oriented in the direction of transcription , two ( the 2nd and 4th copy ) in the opposite direction .
4xTCEd ( 4-C ) : Three copies of TCEd , in which the A nucleotide at -199 was replaced by a C ( Fig .
2A ) , were cloned in the direction of transcription , the fourth distal copy in the opposite direction .
Preparation of DNA binding proteins Crude nuclear protein extracts were prepared as described ( 9 ) and used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) .

In the construct pHICAT2/1+ ( - 199C ) the A residue at position -199 was replaced by a C , and in plICAT2/1 + ( 205/206 ) , the G residues at positions -205 and -206 of TCEd 'core ' were replaced by A residues , and , in addition , the A residues at the positions -211 and -214 of TCEd DNA were replaced by T residues ( see Fig .

DNase I footprint protection assay .
An I1-2 enhancer probe , labelled near nucleotide position -293 , was incubated with 2 al of an AP-3 preparation ( containing about 2 ug/ml protein ) from human HeLa cells ( Ref .
32 ; lane 1 ) , 3 ul or 1 al TCF-1 from murine El4 lymphoma cells ( lanes 2 and 3 ) , 3 gl or 1 al NF-kB from human placenta ( Ref .
16 ; lanes 4 and 5 ) .
In lanes 6 and 7 , 25 ug bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) was added to each reaction .
The boxes indicate the binding of factors NF-kB and AP-3 to the TCEd and further I1-2 enhancer motifs , e.g .
to the upstream promoter sequence ( UPS ) , the proximal T cell element ( TCEp ) and the upstream site 1 ( US-1 ) ( 4 ) .
cell protein extracts were prepared as described ( 4 ) from packed deep-frozen El4 lymphoma cells stimulated for 4hr by TPA/Con A ( 10 ng/2.5 ug per ml ) .
The extracts were passed over a heparin-agarose column , and protein in the 0.4 M KCI column peak was used in DNase I protection and EMSA experiments .
For the enrichment of factors , proteins in the 0.4 M KCI fraction were dialysed overnight against buffer Z ( 25 mM Hepes-KOH , pH 7.8 , 12.5 mM MgCl , , 20 % glycerol , 0.1 M KCI , 0.1 % NP-40 ) and subsequently passed over a $ 300 Sephacryl column equilibrated with buffer Z .
The resulting fractions were tested by DNase I footprinting .
Fractions giving similar protection patterns over the TCEd ( see Fig .
5B ) were pooled and passed over a DNA affinity column containing ligated TCEd ( or kB ) oligonucleotides ( 25 ) .
Bound protein was eluted with 0.6 M KCI ( in buffer Z ) and used in protein binding assays .
DNA-protein binding assays and factor analyses In the electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) , chemically synthesized and annealed double-stranded oligonucleotides were used .
About 5000 cpm ( equivalent to about 0.2 ng ) of P-end labelled probes were incubated in a final volume of 15 gl with 4 ug protein ( of crude nuclear extracts or from the 0.4 M KCl peak of a heparin-agarose column ) , along with 4 ug poly dI - dC , or with enriched factors as described ( 4 , 23 ) .
The samples were fractionated on native 4 % PAA gels at 200 V/15 cm at room temperature according to Schreiber et al .
( 26 ) .
DNase I footprint experiments were carried out as described ( 4 ) .
For the size determination of TCF-1 polypeptides ( see Fig .
7A ) an aliquote of a TCF-1 preparation was subjected to electrophoresis on a SDS-10 % PAA gel , followed by silver staining .
In binding studies of renatured TCF-1 polypeptides ( Fig .
7B ) , preparative SDS-PAA gels were cut into slices , and the proteins were extracted , renatured ( 27 ) and used in EMSA experiments .
In UV-crosslinking experiments , protein factors were incubated with a bromodeoxyuridine-substituted TCEd probe under EMSA conditions , fractionated on a 5 % EMSA gel and UV irradiated for 15 min ( 28 ) .
A fter exposure the labelled gel slices were loaded onto a 10 cm SDS-10 % polyacrylamide gel and fractionated for 3 hr at 250 V. In proteolytic clipping band shift assays ( 26 ) the labelled DNA probes were incubated with factors for 20 min under EMSA conditions , 0.2-1 unit trypsin or Staphylococcus aureus protease V8 was added , and the samples were incubated for 10 min at 20°C .
The resulting tryptic cleavage products were fractionated on 5 % EMSA gels .
RESULTS The TCEd is a functional important sequence motif of the II-2 enhancer The TCEd sequence GGGATTTCAC corresponds to the consensus sequence GPuGPuTTPyCAPy which was detected within the upstream segments of numerous lymphokine genes ( 29 , 30 ) .
We and others identified the TCEd as a binding site for several nuclear proteins , including the ubiquitous factors NF-kB and AP-3 ( 4 , 6-9 ; see Fig .
1B ) .
Moreover , in transient transfection experiments the TCEd turned out to be an inducible , T cell-specific proto-enhancer element when it was cloned in multiple copies in front of a CAT test gene ( 4 ) .
In order to investigate whether the TCEd also takes part in the inducible activity of the entire murine II-2 enhancer , we introduced two point mutations into the TCEd 'core ' ( by replacing the G residues at the positions -205 and -206 by T residues ) and two A to Nucleic Acids Research , Vol .

21 5931 T changes at the positions -211 and -214 of TCEd DNA .
When such mutated II-2 enhancer CAT constructs were transfected into El4 cells , they were found to be uninducible by TPA/ConA , and their constitutive activity increased about 10fold in comparison to that of wild type enhancer constructs ( Fig .
1A ) .
This demonstrates that the TCEd plays an essential role in the establishement of overall inducible activity of murine II-2 enhancer in T lymphoma cells .
One base pair change abolishes the T cell-restricted proto-enhancer activity of the TCEd motif As shown in Fig .

21 order to assess whether these subtle sequence differences play any role in the establishment of T cell-restricted , inducible proto-enhancer activity of TCEd , we synthesized TCEd oligonucleotides with a NF-kB 'core ' and , vice versa , NF-kB oligonucleotides with a TCEd 'core ' ( the NF-kB 'core ' is defined as the stretch of nucleotides of NF-kB binding site contacting NF-kB : see 31 ) .
As for the TCEd , the double-stranded oligonucleotides , designated as TCEd +kBcore and kB+TCEdcore , were cloned in five copies in front of the tk promoter into the CAT vector pBLCAT2 ( 22 ) , and their activity was determined in transient transfection assays in El4 cells and HeLa cells .
As controls , the constructs 5 XTCEd and 2xkB ( also designated as J16 : see 31 ) were transfected into the same cells in parallel .
The results of these experiments ( Fig .
2B ) show that the conversion of TCEd to a TCEd+kBcore sequence had a dramatic effect on the inducible proto-enhancer activity of TCEd derivative : In El4 cells , the inducible proto-enhancer activity of 5 XTCEd+kBcore construct appeared to be manyfold stronger than that of the 5xTCEd construct , and in HeLa cells upon induction the SxTCEd +kBcore DNA was as active as constructs containing genuine NF-kB binding sites .
In striking contrast , and similar to the mutated TCEd-M construct , the 5 x kB +TCEdcore construct was found to be inactive in both El4 cells as well as HeLa cells ( Fig .
2B ) .
NF-kB contacts all G residues within its semi-palindromic DNA binding motif ( 31 ) .
The AT base pair between the two CG base pairs located in the proximal half of the TCEd impairs the semi-palindromic structure of a NF-kB binding site .
This prompted us to assume that the AT base pair at position -199 of TCEd DNA impairs the binding of NF-kB ( or of a kB-like factor ) to the TCEd , and , as functional consequence , could be responsible for the inactivity of 5 X TCEd construct in HeLa cells .
In order to test the latter hypothesis , we synthesized TCEd A-C oligonucleotides containing a CG base pair instead the AT pair at position -199 and tested their activity in El4 cells and HeLa 6 opbnltrathanld cs 4.0 , 9 .

The inducible proto-enhancer activity of TCEd motifs is correlated with the binding of an inducible , NF-kB like factor in HeLa cells .

cells ( see Fig .
2B ) .
As expected , this base pair substitution had about the same effect as the introduction of a kB 'core ' into the TCEd motif : the 5 XTCEd A-C construct turned out to be very active in El4 cells as well as in HeLa cells ( Fig .
2B ) .
In order to test whether the A-C transition also has an influence on the overall 1-2 enhancer activity in El4 cells and HeLa cells , we introduced this mutation into the entire enhancer and tested the activity of the resulting pNCAT2/1+ ( -199C ) construct in both cell types .
The A-C replacement resulted in a severalfold increased activity of the 1-2 enhancer in E14 T cells ( see Fig .
1A and the note in its legend ) , and to an about 2.Sfold induction in HeLa cells ( B.H .
et al , in prep . )
.
This again demonstrates that the TCEd is an important sequence motif necessary for the establishement of enhancer activity in T lymphoma cells .
Moreover , it also shows that in HeLa cells the activity of more sequence elements than the 'converted ' TCEd is necessary for the efficient functioning of the I1-2 enhancer in nonlymphoid cells .
The inducible activity of TCEd constructs correlates with the binding of protein factors The results of transient transfection studies suggest that the mutation of one or a few TCEd nucleotides is accompanied with distinct changes in the binding of transacting factors .
In order to elucidate which DNA binding factors interact with the mutated TCEd derivatives in T lymphocytes and HeLa cells , crude nuclear protein extracts of these cells were prepared and incubated with TCEd and kB probes in EMSA experiments .
In nuclear extracts of TPA-treated HeLa cells one inducible factor was found to bind to a genuine NF-kB binding site ( Fig .
3A , lane 12 ) .
Since the binding could be specifically competed by a 50-200fold molar excess of kB DNA ( Fig .
3B ) , the appearance of this factor complex should be due to the binding of authentic NF-kB .
A very similar complex was formed with the TCEd +kBcore and TCEd A-C probes , whereas , in most of our experiments , the incubation of TCEd , TCEd-M and kB+TCEdcore probes did not result in the occurrence of an Fig .

inducible factor complex ( Fig .
3 ) .
Thus , the binding of NF-kB in HeLa cells extracts to the DNA correlates with the activity of the proto-enhancer motifs in these cells .
More complex results with respect to factor binding and activity were obtained for El4 cells .
Again , no inducible factor complex was formed after incubation with the functional inactive TCEd-M and kB+TCEdcore oligonucleotides , and the incubation of a kB-probe resulted in one inducible , NF-kB like factor complex ( Fig .
4A ) .
However , more than one inducible factor complex was formed after incubation with the TCEd derivatives TCEd+kBcore and TCEd C-A and , yet more important , with the TCEd motif itself .
The most prominent complex , designated as T in Fig .
4A , was observed with all three TCEd probes .
This complex exhibits a somewhat faster electrophoretic mobility than the NF-kB complex , and a 20 to 200fold molar excess of kB-DNA ( which efficiently competes the binding of NF-kB to its cognate sequence ) did not compete for its binding to TCEd DNA 1.0 $ 300 A B 0.8 A D , 0.6 './ ¥a o I £ | i B p -TCF-1 oa | l ¥ -- ] -TCF-2 | 4 `` wf ) -tcr-3 k ® | h 0.2 / ‘ f ‘ ﬂ ' 4 AA 60 70 80 90 FRACTIONS 30 40 50 C PS TREp TCEp TCEq US1 US2 S3 - « » » # > + « Fig .

This demonstrates that factors other than NF-kB bind to the TCEd in El4 cells .
Three individual factors bind to the TCEd in extracts of induced El4 lymphoma cells The heterogeneity of TCEd binding factors in the crude nuclear extracts of El4 cells prompted us to enrich the TCEd factors from these cells .
For this purpose , a whole cell protein extract of cells induced by 10 ng/ml TPA and 2.5 ug/ml ConA for 4hr was loaded onto a heparin-agarose column , and the majority of proteins binding to the column were eluted by 0.4 M KCI .

Passage of pooled fractions 55-65 ( pool A ) over a TCEd DNA affinity column resulted in the binding of one factor to the column .
This factor , which we designated as TCF-1 , corresponds in its electrophoretic mobility ( Fig .
6A ) and DNA binding properties to factor T in crude nuclear extracts .
In addition to TCF-1 two further factors were detected in pool B which we designated as TCF-2 and TCF-3 .
In order to characterize the DNA binding properties of the TCFs , we investigated their binding to several TCEd/kB like sites .
As shown in Fig .
6A and B , TCF-1 strongly binds to TCEd DNA , but only weakly to kB DNA .
While the binding of TCF-1 to TCEd DNA could be competed by a 25fold molar excess of unlabelled TCEd DNA ( Fig .
6A ) more than a 250fold excess Fig .
6A ) .
A better competition of TCF-1 binding was observed with the same excess of TCEd +kBcore DNA ( lane 5 in Fig .
6B ) , or with the kB DNAs of SV40 enhancer and 1-2 a receptor genes ( lanes 15 and 16 in Fig .
6B ) .
TCF-2 and TCF-3 appear to represent specific TCEd 'core ' binding factors because both factors did neither bind to the TCEd when its 'core ' was converted to a kB 'core ' ( Fig .
6B , lane 6 ) , nor to a canonical kB probe ( Fig .
6B , lanes 8-13 ) .
TCF-2 , but not TCF-3 , also binds to the TCEd-M and US-1 oligonucleotides both of which differ substantially in their 'core ' from the TCEd 'core ' ( Fig .
6B , lanes 4 and 7 ) .
Since TCEd-M and US-1 are also AP-3 binding sites ( as are the TCEd and TCEp to which TCF-2 also binds ) , TCF-2 appears to be related in its binding properties to AP-3 .
of kB DNA was necessary to reach a ( still incomplete ) competition effect ( compare lanes 3 and 4 with 5 and 6 in When we used the same factor preparation and a canonical kB DNA probe in EMSA experiments , we observed the mG ccr `` srs cna o Fig .

A polypeptide of about 5OkD binds to TCEd DNA after fractionation on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and renaturation .
A TCF-1 preparation ( see Fig .

After the run , the gel was cut into five slices which contained the polypeptides larger than 80kD ( slice no .

C. ) Size determination of TCF-1 proteins by UV-crosslinking .
A TCF preparation ( fraction B in Fig .
5C ) was incubated with a bromodeoxyuridine-substituted TCEd probe , fractionated on a 5 % EMSA gel and UV irradiated for 15 min .
The gel slices containing the labelled TCF complexes were loaded onto a 10 cm SDS-10 % PAA gel ( SDS-PAGE ) and subjected to electrophoresis for 3 hr at 250 V. D. ) and NF-kB share a similar DNA binding peptide .
Proteolytic clipping band shift assay ( 26 ) .
TCEd probes were incubated with TCF-1 ( lanes 1 , 3 and 5 ) or a kB-like factor from induced E14 cells ( lanes 2 , 4 and 6 ) .
The latter factor was isolated , like TCF-1 , by chromatography on a heparin-agarose column , $ 300 gel filtration and affinity chromatography on a DNA column ( 25 ) containing ligated kB oligonucleotides of Ig-kappa enhancer .
The factor probably corresponds to the 50 kD polypeptide of ubiquitous NF-kB , the complex of which runs slightly faster than TCF-1 in EMSA gels ( see Fig .
6B , lanes 8-13 and unpubl .
results ) .
After complex formation one unit Staphylococcus V8 protease ( lanes 3 and 4 ) or trypsin ( lanes 5 and 6 ) was added .
The samples were incubated for 10 min at 20°C , followed by fractionation on a 5 % EMSA gel .
Note the appearance of similar factor sub-complexes after V8 protease cleavage ( labelled with dots beside lane 4 ) and of a trypsin-resistant complex ( in lanes 5 and 6 ) for both factors .
formation of one factor fomplex only ( Fig .
6B , lanes 8-13 ) .
This complex run slightly faster than the TCF-1 complex , and in its DNA binding properties it differed from all three TCF complexes .
We assume that this kB-like factor ( which probably corresponds to a SOkD homodimer ) was co-purified on the TCEd DNA affinity column along with the TCFs .
TCF-1 contains two polypeptides ; one of which appears to be related to the 50kD protein of NF-kB Electrophoretic separation of TCF-1 protein ( fraction A in Fig .
5C ) on denaturing SDS-PAA gels yielded three prominent polypeptides of about 50kD , 105kD and 170kD ( Fig .
7A , lane T ) .
Since the latter eluted in low salt buffers ( containing less than 0.3M KCI ) from the TCEd DNA columns ( not shown ) it is unlikely that it is specifically associated with the SOkD and 105kD polypeptides ( which elute from the TCEd affinity column in 0.6M KCl buffers ) .
This conclusion was supported by the results of UV-cross linking experiments in which TCF proteins ( fraction B in Fig .
5C ) were incubated with a bromodeoxyuridine-substituted TCEd probe and UV-irradiated after fractionation on EMSA gels .
As shown in Fig .
7C , subsequent electrophoresis of cross-linked TCEd-protein adducts in denaturing SDS-PAA gels resulted in the appearance of two major bands , a weak band of about 105kD and a more prominent one of 5OkD .
In distinct contrast , fractionation of TCF-2 and 3 adducts resulted in the appearaance of several smaller cross-linked products .
The much stronger appearance of the 5SOkD band suggests that this protein was bound more tighter to DNA than the 105kD polypeptide .
Results supporting this assumption were obtained when TCF-1 ( fraction A , Fig .
5C ) was fractionated on a preparative SDS-PAA gel and , after the extraction from gel slices and renaturation ( 27 ) , used in EMSA experiments .
A retarded DNA-protein complex was found to be reconstituted with protein in the size range of 40-60kD , but not of any other size ( Fig .
7B ) .
These findings favour the 50kD polypeptide to be the major DNA binding component of TCF-1 .
The similarity in size between the S5SOkD polypeptide of TCF-1 and that of the ubiquitous NF-kB prompted us to investigate whether the proteins of both factors share common structural properties .
One characteristic feature of the purified 50kD polypeptide of NF-kB is its cleavage by trypsin to a large proteolytic peptide fragment ( of about 40kD ) which is still able to bind DNA ( 16 ) .
To see if TCF-1 contains a similar large , trypsin-resistant and DNA binding peptide component , TCF-1 complexes were partially trypsinated and subsequently fractionated on EMSA gels , in parallel with a trypsin digest of a NF-kB factor complex .
As shown in Fig .
7D , trypsinisation of both complexes resulted in the appearance of one large factor complex .
These and further results with other proteases , such as the Staphylococcus V8-protease and Chymotrypsin ( Fig .
7D and results not shown ) indicate that TCF-1 shares common sequences with the 50kD polypeptide of NF-kB .
DISCUSSION The results of this investigation confirm and extend the data of earlier published studies on the activity and protein binding of the TCEd , a kB-like sequence motif of I1-2 enhancer ( 4 , 6-9 ) .
They show that the TCEd is a functional important sequence motif of the murine I1-2 enhancer .
This motif alone is able to function as an inducible , T cell-specific ( proto- ) enhancer .
Moreover , the results of this study show that in protein extracts of induced , 1-2 Nucleic Acids Research , Vol .

21 5935 secreting El4 T lymphoma cells three factors with individual DNA binding properties interact with the TCEd .
This implies that the T lymphocyte-specific proto-enhancer activity of TCEd is controlled by the concerted action of several differentially regulated DNA binding proteins .
The ubiquitous factor NF-kB is also able to bind to TCEd DNA ( Fig .
1B and unpubl .
results ; ref .
17 ) , but neither in crude nuclear protein extracts from El4 cells ( Fig .
4 ) nor from HeLa cells ( Fig .
3 ) an efficient binding of NF-kB to TCEd DNA was detected under the experimental conditions used here .
In HeLa cell extracts , NF-kB efficiently bound to the TCEd derivatives TCEd +kBcore and TCEd A-C ( Fig .
3 ) , and this binding is strongly correlated with the proto-enhancer activity of both motifs in HeLa cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
However , in crude nuclear extracts from induced El4 cells , we never detected a clear-cut binding of NF-kB to the TCEd + kBcore and TCEd A-C motifs ( Fig .
4 ) .
This suggests that in these cells the binding of NF-kB to both motifs is hindered by the more efficient binding of TCF-1 ( and of other factors ) to the same sequences .
Like the binding of NF-kB , the binding of TCF-1 to numerous TCEd-/kB-like sequences is correlated with the proto-enhancer activity of binding sequences .
All sequences , to which TCF-1 binds , i.e .
the TCEd , TCEd+kBcore , SV40 kB and Il-2-Ra-kB elements ( Fig .
6B ) , are able to act as proto-enhancers , whereas all the other elements , to which TCF-1 does not bind , are unable to do so .
This correlation between TCF-1 binding and proto-enhancer activity suggests that TCF-1 is the transcacting factor that positively controls the activity of TCEd in T lymphoma cells .
In contrast to TCF-1 , the binding of TCF-2 and TCF-3 to TCEd-like motifs does not exert a positive influence on TCEd activity .
Instead , TCF-2 and TCF-3 binding seems to exert rather a negative effect on TCEd DNA .
Motifs that bind TCF-2 and TCF-3 , but not TCF-1 ( such as the TCEp , TCEd-M and kB+TCEdcore motifs : see Fig .
6 ) are unable to act as proto-enhancers , and the loss of TCF-2/TCF-3 binding ( as found for the TCEd +kB core DNA : Fig .
6 ) leads to an increased proto-enhancer activity ( Fig .
2 ) .
The results of UV cross-linking experiments with TCF-1 suggests that TCF-1 consists of two polypeptides of about 50kD and 105kD ( Fig .
7A ) .
Very similar results were obtained by Molitor et al .
( 18 ) in cross-linking studies using nuclear proteins from human Jurkat T cells and the TCEd sequence of the human I1-2 enhancer .
The protease cleavage experiments , on the other hand , indicate that TCF-1 and NF-kB share common DNA binding polypeptides ( Fig .
7B ) .
Taken together , these data indicate that in T lymphoma cells the activity of TCEd is controlled by the binding of a kB-like factor , TCF-1 , and two further factors , TCF-2 and TCF-3 , which seem to be unrelated to NF-kB .
Several factors other than NF-kB have been shown to interact with kB-like motifs , including AP-3 , MP-1 , PRDII-BP1 , HIV-EPI and « A-CRYBP-1 ( 32 , 34-37 ) .
The latter four factors do not share any sequence homology with NF-kB but belong to a family of Zn*t* finger containing DNA binding factors .
Likewise , AP-3 differs from NF-kB because it binds to several sites of the II-2 enhancer to which NF-kB does not bind ( Fig .
1 ) .
In its DNA binding properties , AP-3 appears to be related to TCF-2 ( Fig .
6 ) .
In further experiments , we also detected the specific binding of bacterially expressed « -CRYBP-1 to the TCEd and several other TCEd-like sequence motifs ( unpubl .
results ) .
Thus , it is tempting to speculate that TCF-2 and TCF-3 could be related to these non-kB factors which specifically interact with kB-like DNAs .

21 Finally , it should be mentioned that the TCEd is not the only kB-like enhancer motif within the promoters and enhancers of lymphokine genes to which factors other than NF-kB bind .
One further example is the so-called CK-1 ( for cytokine 1 ) motif of human and murine GM-CSF genes which is bound by the factor NF-GMa ( 38 ) .
In contrast to NF-kB , the activity of NF-GMa can not be induced with TPA , and the binding of NF-GMa to CK-1 DNA is very weakly competed by an excess of genuine NF-kB or TCEd DNA ( 38 ) .
Further examples are the kB-like motifs of the murine TNF-a gene ( 39 , 40 ) .
One of them , the site between the positions -655 and -850 of TNF-a upstream region , is bound with high affinity by proteins not related to NF-kB ( 40 ) .
These and further data indicate that the activity of kB-like elements within the transcriptional control regions of lymphokine genes is controlled by multiple factors , and the interplay of all these factors seems to contribute to the activity of lymphokine genes .
