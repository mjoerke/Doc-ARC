NEL* *Division of Clinical Immunology and Allergy , Department of Medicine , UCLA School of Medicine , Los Angeles , CA , and { Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , Tarrytown , NY , USA SUMMARY Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) is an important B-cell growth and differentiation factor .
IL-6 treatment of the human lymphoblastoid cell line , SKW6.4 , leads to increased IgM production .
We have previously shown that IL-6 induces activation of JAK1 and JAK2 in human B cell lines .
A chimeric IL-6 receptor , comprised of the intracellular tail of the IL-6 receptor subunit gp130 fused to the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor , was stably transfected into SKW6.4 cells .
EGF treatment induced IgM production in cells transfected with an intact gp130 cytoplasmic tail , but not in untransfected cells or cells transfected with a cytoplasmic tail lacking all four signal transducers and activators of transcription ( Stat ) binding sites .
Moreover , EGF treatment induced Stat3 phosphorylation in cells transfected with the intact chimeric EGF-gp130 receptor along with induction of DNA-mobility shift of a classical interferon-y-activated site .
To define further the relation between Stat3 activation and enhanced IgM production , we determined the effect of chimeric gp130 on the transcriptional activation of a genetic element linked to immunoglobulin production , namely the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer ( IgH-enhancer ) .
Parental as well as transfected SK W6.4 cells were transiently transfected with an IgH-enhancer-luciferase construct .
The transcriptional activity of the IgH-luciferase construct was induced upon ligation of the full-length chimeric receptor but not by truncated gp130 receptors .
Moreover , the gp130-induced activity of this reporter gene was abrogated by Stat3EE , a mutant Stat3 incapable of binding DNA .
These results indicate that IL-6-induced B-cell differentiation , as measured by IgM production , may be controlled by Stat3 proteins .
INTRODUCTION Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates acute phase reactions , haematopoiesis and host defences during infection and inflammation . ``
IL-6 exhibits multiple effects on the immune system , including B-lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation .
** `` We have previously reported that IL-6 affects two human B-cell lines , AFIO and SKW6.4 , differen-tially.© While IL-6 induces enhanced proliferation of AFIO cells , the predominant response to IL-6 treatment in SKW6.4 cells is enhanced IgM secretion . ``
These cell lines provide us with models for investigating the IL-6-induced signalling pathways associated with B-cell growth and differentiation .
To this end , we have shown that engagement of the IL-6 receptor Received 3 September 1996 ; revised 20 November 1996 ; accepted 20 November 1996 .

( IL-6R ) activates the Janus kinase ( JAK ) /signal transducers and activators of transcription ( Stat ) pathway® but do not understand how this pathway relates to B-cell growth and differentiation .
Specifically , very little is known about B-cell-specific genes which are targeted by Stat proteins . ``
'' `` Recently , we have described a chimeric IL-6R which consists of the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor joined to the intracellular domain of the signalling subunit of the IL-6R , namely gp130 . ``
' Transfection of COS-1 cells with these chimeric receptors followed by EGF treatment , induced the activation of a JAK/Stat pathway along with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the intracellular gp130 domain . ``
The cytoplasmic domain of gp130 , contains several regions deemed essential for signalling through the IL-6R , including boxes 1 and 2 known to bind JAK kinases .
`` , In addition , the cytoplasmic tail of gp130 carries four tyrosine-based motifs , with the consensus sequence YXXQ , which act as modular domains for binding and activation of Stat3 .
`` * `` `` An advantage of the chimeric gp130 receptors is that they can conceptually be used to stimulate signal transduction by gp130 without interference from the endogenous IL-6R .
These effects , in turn , can be used to study the biological effect of IL-6 on B-cell growth or differentiation .
We wished to determine if overexpression of the chimeric IL-6R could initiate activation of the JAK/Stat pathway in ©1997 Blackwell Science Ltd Chimeric gp130 induces Ig M in a Stat3-dependent fashion 351 SKW6.4 cells , and whether these biochemical responses could be related to an IL-6-mediated biological response in these cells , namely enhanced IgM synthesis .
Our results show that EGF induced IgM production in SKW6.4 cells stably transfected with intact EGF-gp130 chimeras , but not in cells transfected with truncated receptor which lacks Stat3 binding sites .
The induction of this response correlates with the transcriptional activation of the intronic immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer , which responds in a Stat3-dependent manner .
These results indicate that IL-6-induced B-cell differentiation , as measured by IgM production , may be controlled by Stat3 proteins .

Expression of chimeric EGF-gp130 receptors in stable transfected SKW6.4 cells .
( a ) Schematic representation of the chimeric gp130 receptors .
The chimeric receptors consist of the extracellular domain of the EGF receptor linked to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail of gp130 .
The A2 receptor represents a chimeric receptor in which the intracellular gp130 tail is intact and carries four modular YXXQ motifs ( hatched boxes ) .
The D4 receptor represents a truncated chimeric receptor such that all four YXXQ motifs are deleted .
Both chimeric receptors express a myc-tag at their C-terminus ( circle ) and carry an intact JAK binding site at their membrane proximal domain ( dark boxes ) .

Ig M production Parental and transfected SKW6.4 cells ( 5 x 10° ) were incubated for 4 days in the presence of media alone , 100 U/ml IL-6 or 100 ng/ml EGF .
Supernatants were collected and assayed for the presence of IgM by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) as described previously . '
'' In short , cell supernatants were incubated for 4h in Costar ELISA plates previously coated with 1:1000 mouse anti-hlgM ( Tago , Burlingham , CA ) .
Goat anti-human IgM coupled to alkaline phosphatase ( Tago , Burlingham , CA ) was added for 2 hr at room tempera-ture .
The reaction was initiated with p-nitrophenylphosphate substrate and the absorbance was read at 405 nm .
Each experiment was performed in triplicate , and included a standard curve consisting of serial dilutions of purified IgM ( Tago , Burlingham , CA ) .
Ig H-enhancer luciferase activity SKW6.4 or AF1O cells ( 3 x 10° ) were transfected by electroporation as described above with 8 ug of IgH-enhancer luciferase reporter plasmid .
In cotransfection assays , 10 ug of empty vector or 10 ug constructs encoding for wild type Stat3 or Stat3EE were transfected simultaneously with the reporter plasmid .
Samples were pooled and allowed to recover for 6 hr .
The cells were stimulated for 14 hr .
The cells were washed , lysed in luciferase buffer ( Analytical Luminescence , Ann Arbor , MI ) and luciferase activity was measured by using 90 ug of proteins in a Monolight 2010 luminometer ( Analytical Luminescence ) .
Inter-sample variation in efficiency of transfection was monitored by cotransfection with 5 ug pSV BGal reporter plasmid ( Promega Corp , Madison , WI ) , and BGal activity was measured using a galactosidase assay kit from Promega ( Madison , WI ) .
RESULTS Stable transfection of chimeric IL-6 receptors in SKW6.4 cells SKW6.4 cells were transfected with expression constructs encoding epitope-tagged chimeric gp130 proteins consisting of the extracellular domain of the EGF receptor linked to the full-length cytoplasmic domain of gp130 ( Fig .
la ) . ``
The cyto- plasmic tail of gp130 exhibits four YXXQ motifs necessary for signal transduction `` ( Fig .
la ) .
To delineate further the significance of these motifs in IL-6-induced B-lymphocyte differentiation , another aliquot of SKW6.4 cells was stably transfected with a chimeric receptor from which all four YXXQ motifs were deleted ( Fig .
1a ) .
The cells were subcloned by limiting dilution and selected with geneticin at 800 ug/ml for 4 weeks .
The cell line transfected with the intact gp130 cytoplasmic tail domain was designated A2 , while the cell line containing the truncated cytoplasmic domain was designated D4 .
To determine the expression of chimeric receptors in transfected SK W6.4 cells , we used the myc-tag at the carboxyl-terminus of the construct to immunoprecipitate the chimeric receptors .
Western blotting of the anti-myc immunoprecipitates revealed that while no chimeric receptors were detectable in untransfected ceils , full length as well as truncated chimeric EGF-gp130 receptors were discernible in SKW6.4 transfectants ( Fig .
1b , lanes 3 and 5 ) .
Engagement of gp130 chimeras by EGF induces IgM secretion in stable transfected SKW6.4 cells SKW6.4 is an Ig M-secreting B-cell line in which IgM secretion can be enhanced by IL-6.° We made use of this characteristic to ask whether the chimeric IL-6R can generate a biological response in transfected cells .
Parental SKW6.4 and A2 cells were incubated for 4 days in media alone or in the presence of IL-6 , EGF , or a combination of both .
The supernatants were collected and IgM production was measured by ELISA .
Figure 2 shows that IL-6 increased IgM production in both parental SKW6.4 and A2 cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
However , while EGF treatment induced a 4-5-fold increase in IgM production in A2 cells , no significant response was obtained in parental cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
Costimulation of A2 cells with IL-6 and EGF resulted in an additive effect , generating a 10-4-fold increase in IgM production ( Fig .
2 ) .
Costimulation of parental SKW6.4 cells with IL-6 and EGF failed to produce an additive response ( Fig .
2 ) .
These results can not be explained by differences in the rate of cellular proliferation , since SKW6.4 cells fail to proliferate in response to IL-6 treatment . ``
In addition , we failed to observe a difference in cell number or viability in stimulated and control cells ( data not shown ) .
In a second set of experiments , we compared IgM production in A2 and D4 cells ( Table 1 ) .
IL-6 induced a five- to sixfold increase in IgM production in parental as well as in transfected SK W6.4 cell lines ( Table 1 ) .
While A2 cells demonstrated a threefold increase in IgM secretion upon treatment with EGF , no enhancement of IgM production was seen with this stimulus in parental or D4 cells ( Table 1 ) .
These results suggest that in the initiation of this biological response , SKW6.4 cells require the presence of an intact gp130 cytoplasmic domain .
Chimeric A2 but not D4 receptors induce discernible effects on protein tyrosine phosphorylation , including the phosphorylation and activation of Stat3 We have previously shown that IL-6 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130.° This effect is likely mediated by receptor-associated protein tyrosine kinases ( PTK ) , JAK1 and ©1997 Blackwell Science Ltd , Immunology , 90 , 350-357 Chimeric gp130 induces Ig M in a Stat3-dependent fashion 353 Medi ( 10-4 ) `` | a `` fem © EGF e_ EGF + IL-6 10 & .6 8 s C o a .

In contrast , neither endogenous gp130 nor JAK1 were phosphorylated in unstimulated SKW6.4 cells .
IL-6 is also known to activate the cytoplasmic signal transducer and activator of transcription , Stat3 , by inducing its phosphorylation on tyrosine residues .
`` `` ~ `` We studied the effect of chimeric EGF-gp130 receptors on Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation .
Total cell lysates from control and EGF-stimulated cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and overlaid with antiserum raised against the consensus tyrosine phosphorylation site of Stat3 ( Y¥705 ) ( Fig .
3 , upper panel ) .
As a positive control we used AFIO cells .
In addition to inducing the phosphorylation of the 89000 MW Stat3 protein in AFIO cells , IL-6 treatment also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of an 83000 MW protein ( Fig .
3 , upper panel , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
This may be a splice variant of Stat3 which has been characterized as Stat3 $ . ``
'' Figure 3 shows that while EGF did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of p89 in parental SKW6.4 cells , this ligand did induce phosphorylation of Stat3 in A2 cells ( Fig .
3 , upper panel , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
No phosphorylation of Stat3 was seen in D4 cells ( not shown ) .
These results were not due to dissimilar amounts of Stat3 , since equal amounts of Stat3 proteins could be visualized in Stat3 immunoblots of total cell lysates ( Fig .

In particular , activated Stat3 is known to associate with interferon-y ( IFN-y ) -activated sites ( GAS ) .
Utilizing EMSA , we measured the ability of cell lysates from control and treated cells to form DNA binding complexes with a GAS , the hSIE of the c-fos promoter ( Fig .
4 ) .
IL-6 treated AFIO cells were used as positive control ( Fig .
4 , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Treatment of the A2 cells , expressing the full-length chimeric receptor , with EGF induced the mobility shift of the labelled hSIE oligonucleotide ( Fig .
4 , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
The specificity of this binding reaction was confirmed by abrogation of the gel shift with excess unlabelled hSIE ( Fig .
4 , lanes 7 and 8 ) .
Moreover , preincu-bation of cell lysates with anti-Stat3 antibody resulted in a hypomobility shift of the protein/DNA complex in EGF-treated A2 cells , confirming the presence of Stat3 in that complex ( not shown ) .
In contrast , EGF failed to induced a shift complex in parental SKW6.4 cells ( Fig .
4 , lanes 3 and 4 ) , or in D4 cells ( not shown ) .
Taken together , our data show that the chimeric EGF-gp130 receptor which contains an intact cytoplasmic tail is able to transduce biochemical signals , including activation of the JAK/Stat pathway .
Engagement of gp130 induces activity of an immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer-reporter construct in AF10 and transfected SKW6.4 cells A critical question is whether the effects of the chimeric gp130 receptor on IgM production in A2 cells could be explained by a genetic element in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus .

AFIO , SKW6.4 and A2 cells ( 5x 10° ) were incubated in media alone or in the presence of 100 U/ml IL-6 or 100 ng/ml EGF as indicated for 10 min .
Twenty micrograms of total cell lysates were added to *P-labelled hSIE oligonucleotides in the presence ( lanes 7 and 8 ) or absence ( lanes 1-6 ) of 10-fold excess unlabelled hSIE .
The complexes were separated on a 5 % PAGE .
The gel was dryed and autoradiographed for 16 hours .
Since IL-6 is known to enhance immunoglobulin synthesis as a result of transcriptional activation of immunoglobulin genes without isotype specificity , `` ° we considered genetic response elements that conform to this characteristic .
A genetic element that participates in isotype-independent enhancement at the heavy chain locus is the so-called immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer ( IgH-enhancer ) , which is an intronic sequence immediately upstream of the p switch region .
'** `` After V-D-J rearrangement , this intron separating J4 and Cu becomes a part of all productive arrangements . ``
The Igu enhancer is a complex regulatory element that contains binding sites for many different DNA-binding proteins .
`` °~ ' In order to define whether gp130 may affect the transcriptional activation of the IgH enhancer , we constructed a reporter gene in which the first 450 nucleotides of the IgH enhancer were linked to a luciferase reporter gene in the pGL2 vector ( see the Materials and Methods ) .
The construct was introduced by transient transfection into parental and EGF-gp130 expressing SK W6.4 cell lines .
For comparison , the IgH-enhancer luciferase construct was also introduced into AFIO cells . ``
Cells were treated with IL-6 or EGF for 14 hr , lysed and analysed for luciferase activity .
Cotransfection of a gal construct was used to correct for the efficiency of transfection .
IL-6 induced a 3:2-fold increase in transcriptional activation of the IgH-enhancer in AFIO cells ( Fig .
5a ) , which is comparable to the magnitude of expression of an Ign reporter gene in haematopoietic cells . ``
Compared with untreated cells , treatment with IL-6 increased the transcriptional activity of the IgH-enhancer 3:1-fold in A2 cell line , while treatment with EGF resulted in a 4-8-fold increase in IgH activity ( Fig .
Sa ) .
The magnitude of this response compares favourably to the 4-5-fold enhancement of IgM production by EGF in A2 cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
In a separate experiment , treatment of A2 cells with both IL-6 and EGF showed an additive effect on the IgH-enhancer activity ( Fig .
5a ) .
In contrast to its stimulating effect in A2 cells , EGF failed to induce the activation of the IgH-enhancer reporter in parental SKW6.4 ( Fig .
Sa ) .
Treatment with IL-6 did , however , induce a 2-2-fold increase in luciferase activity in parental cells ( Fig .
Sa ) .
An important question is whether the IgH-enhancer is regulated by Stat3 in response to engagement of endogenous or transfected IL-6 receptors .
If such a functional relationship exists between Stat3 and IgH-enhancer activation , we reasoned that interference with endogenous Stat3 function should disrupt the effect of gp130 on the IgH-enhancer .
Stat3EE is a Stat3 mutant that is incapable of DNA binding , yet maintains its tyrosine phosphorylation site . ``
'' Utilizing this mutant as a potential dominant negative construct that can interfere with activation of the IgH-enhancer by endogenous Stat3 , the A2 cell line was transiently transfected with cDNA copies of both the IgH enhancer and Stat3EE ( Fig .
5b ) .
As a control , we also cotransfected A2 cells with an equal amount of wild-type Stat3 or empty vector .
The cells were treated with IL-6 or EGF for 14 hr and then assayed for luciferase activity .
In A2 cells cotransfected with the empty vector , treatment with IL-6 and EGF induced the activation of the IgH enhancer 2+3- and 2-2-fold , respectively ( Fig .
5b ) .
In A2 cells transfected with wild-type Stat3 , EGF stimulated IgH-enhancer activity 3:5-fold ( Fig .
5b ) .

Stat3 is involved in mediating the effect of gp130 on an IgH-enhancer reporter construct .
( a ) Induction of the IgH enhancer luciferase activity by IL-6 and EGF .
Aliquots of 3 x 10° AFIO , SKW6.4 and A2 cells were transiently transfected with the 8 ug of the IgH-luciferase construct .
After resting for 14 hr , the cells were incubated in media alone or in the presence of 100 U/ml IL-6 or 100 ng/ml EGF for 6 hr .
The cells were lysed , equalized for protein concentration and analysed for luciferase activity .
The efficiency of transfection was monitored by cotransfection with a pSV BGal reporter plasmid .
The data are representative of three experiments .
The panel for A2 cells on the right-hand side represents a second experiment in which IL-6 and EGF were combined .
( b ) Effect of Stat3EE on IgH activity ; aliquots of 3 x 10° AFIO and A2 cells were transiently transfected with 8 ug of the IgH-enhancer reporter construct in the presence of 10 ug control vector , wild-type Stat3 ( wt Stat3 ) or mutant Stat3 ( Stat3EE ) .
The cells were treated as above .
These data are representative of two experiments .
in A2 cells ( Fig .
5b ) .
This suggests that Stat3EE acts as a dominant negative protein in this system .
To confirm that the endogenous IL-6R utilizes Stat3 to induce the IgH-enhancer activity , we also looked at the effect of dominant negative Stat3EE in AFIO cells AFIO cells transiently transfected with the IgH reporter construct in the presence of a control vector , responded to IL-6 treatment by increased IgH activity ( Fig .
5b ) .
Expression of wild-type Stat3 generated a modest increase in the basal level of IgH enhancer , reporter activity in AFIO cells , which was further increased upon treatment with IL-6 ( Fig .
5b ) .
Transfection of Stat3EE in AFIO cells blocked IgH-enhancer activation by IL-6 ( Fig .
5b ) , indicating that the endogenous IL-6R also induced transcriptional activity via Stat3 .
DISCUSSION In this paper , we show that ligation of a chimeric gp130 protein can induce IgM production in SKW6.4 cells along with Stat3 activation .
Stat3 activation was initiated at the level of the receptor , where consensus tyrosine-based motifs were required in order for gp130 to induce hSIE electrophoretic mobility shift complexes and enhanced IgM production .
In parallel to its effect on IgM production , engagement of chimeric gp130 and the endogenous IL-6R induced transcriptional activation of a transfected IgH-enhancer reporter construct .
Stat3EE , a mutant Stat3 incapable of binding DNA , interfered with the activation of the Ig H-enhancer reporter .

Because the endogenous IL-6R would interfere with the assessment of mutated gp130 receptor subunits , we used chimeric gp130 receptors to look at the effect of Stat proteins on IgM production .
We demonstrated that the chimeric gp130 receptors could induce measurable biochemical signals in stable transfected SKW6.4 cells .
Expression of full-length chimeric receptor showed EGF-inducible phosphorylation of the intracellular tail of chimeric receptors ( not shown ) .
This is likely because of dimerization of gp130 subunits which bring opposing receptor-associated JAK to proximity with one another followed by transphos-phorylation and Accordingly , we found constitutive as well as inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 in A2 cells ( not shown ) .
Activated JAK , in turn , play a role in initiating downstream signalling events at the level of gp130 by phosphorylating consensus tyrosine phosphorylation sites .
`` `` ~ `` > > Because the D4 receptor contains no Stat3 consensus sites , we could not discern any phosphorylation upon EGF treatment ( not shown ) .
Differences in receptor tyrosine phosphorylation were reflected in the activation of subsequent signalling pathways .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 at consensus YXXQ motifs provides binding sites for Stat3 proteins . ``
After recruitment to these sites , Stat3 proteins are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by receptor-associated JAK kinases .
`` `` > > `` In accordance with these facts , EGF induced Stat3 phosphorylation in A2 cells , but failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 in D4 cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
Since tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 affects dimerization and binding to GAS-like DNA 356 elements , `` `` `` * > `` it was not surprising that EGF induced hSIE binding complexes in A2 but not D4 cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
Our results suggest that , in addition to recruiting signalling components to the receptor , the tyrosine-based modular domains in the cytoplasmic tail of gp130 regulate the biological effect of the IL-6R .
Engagement of the chimeric receptor carrying all four Stat3-binding motifs induced the production of IgM in stable transfected A2 cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
In contrast , chimeric receptors that lack the tyrosine-based motifs failed to induce IgM secretion ( Table 1 ) .
To explore more directly the relationship between IgM secretion and Stat3 activation , we examined the effect of gp130 on the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer .
The IgH enhancer is an intronic sequence located 5 ' of the Ig u locus'* `` `` and plays an important role in up-regulating the rate of transcription of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes . ``
'' `` `` Although multiple positive and negative binding sites have been characterized in the IgH enhancer , `` °** ' it has not been shown that Stat proteins can affect this element .
Ligation of the chimeric gp130 receptor in A2 cells increased the activity of an IgH-enhancer reporter construct ( Fig .
5a ) .
This effect occurred in parallel with Stat3 activation and IgM secretion ( Fig .
3 and Table 1 ) .
In contrast , IgH-enhancer activity was not observed in cells that failed to activate Stat3 .
In order to determine whether the effect of the chimeric receptor on IgH-enhancer reporter is mediated by Stat3 pro-teins , we sought to interfere with the function of activated Stat3 .
To this end , we made use of a mutant Stat3 construct , Stat3EE , which contains substitutions of two critical amino acids in its DNA binding domain , and fails to bind DNA response elements . ``
Because the Stat3EE protein still undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation , `` we reasoned that the Stat3EE protein may function as a dominant negative protein which competes with endogenous Stat3 .
Indeed , cotransfection of Stat3EE prevented the activation of the IgH-enhancer reporter by the chimeric receptors in A2 cells ( Fig .
5b ) .
In contrast , wild-type Stat3 cotransfection enhanced the response .
In order to show that this effect is not an artifact induced by the chimeric receptor , we also showed that StatEE abrogated the stimulating effect of the endogenous IL-6R on the IgH-enhancer reporter in AFIO cells ( Fig .
5 ) .
This is consistent with preliminary data in our laboratory showing the induction of a mobility shift complex with a non-consensus Stat-like binding site corresponding to nucleotides 88 to 96 in the IgH enhancer ( TTAGAGCAA , data not shown ) .
Since it is not possible at this stage to demonstrate by transient transfection the effect of Stat3EE on endogenous immunoglobulin genes , we aim to explore in future experiments the effect of stable , inducible Stat3EE expression on IgM induction .
These data do not exclude the possibility that IL-6 exerts its effect by acting on additional cellular targets , such as enhancing the expression of the J chain . ``
'' Taken together , the above findings demonstrate that IL-6 , by way of Stat3 , plays an important role in the humoral arm of the immune response and affects an important aspect of B-cell differentiation .
This complements recent studies that have shown the importance of Statl in innate immunity against viral infections . ``
