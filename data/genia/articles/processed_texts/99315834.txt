In this study , we demonstrate the effects of DZA on nuclear factor- « B ( NF- « B ) regulation .
DZA inhibits the transcriptional activity of NF- « B through the hindrance of p65 ( Rel-A ) phosphorylation without reduction of its nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity .
The inhibitory effect of DZA on transcriptional activity is potentiated by the addition of homocysteine .
Taken to-gether , DZA promotes the proteolytic degradation of IxBa , but not IBB , resulting in an increase of DNA binding activity of NF-B in the nucleus in the absence of its transcriptional activity in RAW 264.7 cells .
The reduction of IxBa by DZA is neither involved in IB kinase complex activation nor modulated by the addition of homocysteine .
This study strongly suggests that DZA may be a potent drug for the treatment of diseases in which NF-xB plays a central pathogenic role , as well as a useful tool for studying the regulation and physiological functions of NF-KB .
Nuclear factor- « B ( NF- « B ) , `` a ubiquitous transcription fac-tor , is a pivotal regulator of immune responses , inflammation , cell proliferation , oncogenesis , and apoptosis ( 1-3 ) .
A prototype member of the Rel family , hetero- or homodimeric NF- « B , is made from monomers that have a highly conserved approximately 300-amino acid amino-terminal domain , which is called the Rel homology domain , which functions in DNA binding , * This work was supported in part by funding from the 1995 and 1997 Basic Research Promotion Fund of the Ministry of Education , Korea , and the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation ( KOSEF ) , Cancer Research Center at Seoul National University , Grant 97K4-0401-00-01-3 .

Most of the dimeric NF- « B complexes are stored in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells as inactive complexes through interactions with a group of inhibitory proteins called IB .
Recently , the vertebrate I « B family such as IxBa , IxBB , Bel-3 , precursor proteins p105 and p100 , and IxBe were reported ( 4 , 5 ) .
Inactive cytoplasmic NF-kB can be activated by stimulation of cells with a broad range of NF- « B-inducing agents including bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and tumor necrosis factor-a ( TNF-a ) .
Despite differences among these stimuli , one of their common targets is the cytoplasmic NF- « B-IxB complexes .
These signals known to activate NF- « B result in phosphoryla-tion , subsequent ubiquitination , and proteasome-mediated degradation of the IxB proteins , allowing NF-B to translocate into the nucleus , bind to specific kB sites and thereby activate target genes such as various cytokines , cell adhesion molecules , acute-phase proteins , and immunoreceptors ( 6 ) .
Researchers have long searched to identify IxB kinase which phosphoryl-ates the IxB proteins to initiate the activation cascade of NF- « B .
Recently , IxB kinase « ( IKKa ) and IB kinase B ( IKKB ) were reported as essential kinases for NF- « B activation downstream of TNF-a and interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) receptors ( 7-9 ) .
Activation of NF- « B could be inhibited through diverse mechanisms by manifold compounds at distinct positions in the activation cascade .
One group of NF- « B inhibitors which share the property of being anti-oxidative , includes N-acetyl-L-cys-teine ( 10 ) , acetylsalicylic acid ( 11 ) , and pyrrolidine dithiocar-bamate ( 12 ) .
Some inhibitors interrupt the induced degradation of IB proteins by the inhibition of 26 S protease ( 13 ) , or by increase of IxBa synthesis ( 14 , 15 ) .
Another group of inhibitors hinders the transcriptional activity of NF- « B already bound to DNA .
This group includes SB203580 , a specific inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( 16 ) , and elevated intracellular cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) ( 17 ) .
3-Deazaadenosine ( DZA ) was developed to be one of the most potent inhibitors of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase ( EC 3.8.1.1 ) ( 18 ) .
This agent binds to S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase resulting in the accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine and S-adenosylmethionine , and serves as a substrate for the enzyme resulting in the huge accumulation of 3-deazaade-nosylhomocysteine ( DZA-Hcy ) in cultured cells ( 18 , 19 ) , especially in liver tissue ( 20 ) .
DZA exerts a number of interesting biological properties , such as anti-human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) activity ( 21 , 22 ) , immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects ( 23 , 24 ) , inhibition of lymphocyte-medi-ated cytolysis ( 25 ) , inhibition of cytokine expression including TNF- « and IL-18B ( 26 ) , inhibition of cell adhesion molecule expression ( 27 , 28 ) , and induction of apoptosis in human and mouse leukemia cells ( 29 , 30 ) .
Although the wide variety of biological properties underscores that DZA is to be an effective 18981 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 18982 drug for treatment of many human diseases , the action mechanism of DZA is not yet fully understood .
Previously , we reported that DZA inhibits LPS-induced TNF- « and IL-1B transcription in mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells ( 26 ) .
In this study , elementary experiments confirming DZA inhibition of TNF- « transcription in human monocytic macrophage THP-1 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes ( PBMC ) encouraged us to investigate the effect of DZA on NF-KB activation with the intention of understanding the cellular mechanism of DZA .
DZA potently inhibited the transcriptional activity of NF- « B through the hindrance of p65 phosphorylation without reduction of nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of NF- « B .
In RAW 264.7 cells , DZA promoted the proteolytic degradation of IxBa resulting in an increase of DNA binding activity of NF- « B in the nucleus .
These results strongly suggest that DZA may serve as a potent drug for the treatment of diseases in which NF- « B plays an important pathogenic role , as well as a useful tool for studying the regulation and physiological functions of NF-kB .

pSVL65 expressing p65 of NF- « B from a SV40 promoter was kindly donated by Dr. Mahnhoon Park of Mogam Biotechnology Research Institute , Yon-gin , Kyunggi-do , Korea .
pSVL ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) was used as a control taking the place of pSVL65 .
To assess variations in transfection efficiencies , a control plasmid pCMVB ( CLONTECH ) which expresses the LacZ gene was used .
Transfection of cells was performed using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent ( Roche Molecular Biochemicals ) according to a procedure recommended by the manufac-turer .
Cells transfected with either J16 or J82 were cultured for 18 h , and then exposed to LPS or TNF-a in the presence or absence of DZA alone or DZA with Hey together .
For the pSVL65 transfection , cells were exposed to 100 uM DZA at 6 h after transfection , and further incubated for 18 h. Induction of CAT expression was determined using CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( Roche Molecular Biochemicals ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions , and standardized to constitutive levels of B-galactosidase activity .
In Vivo Labeling and Immunoprecipitation-Confluent monolayers of RAW 264.7 cells in 10-cm tissue culture dishes were washed twice with phosphate-free Dulbecco 's minimum essential medium and incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco 's minimal essential medium for 1 h. Media was replaced by fresh phosphate-free Dulbecco 's minimal essential medium containing 100 mCi of °°P ; per ml ( ICN , Costa Mesa , CA ) , and the cells were incubated for 2 h. Cells were pretreated with or without DZA ( 100 uM ) for 1 h , and stimulated by the addition of LPS ( 1 ug/ml ) .
After incubation for 1 h , the cells were washed , and p65 was recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-p65 ( C-20 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) and protein A-Sepharose ( Amersham Pharmacia Bio-tech ) .
The immunopellets were fractionated by SDS-PAGE , and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 to confirm that the equal amount of protein was loaded in each wall .
Dried gel was subjected to autoradiography .
IKK Assay-RAW 264.7 cells were treated with 100 um DZA for various time intervals , and subjected to IKK assay .
IKK activity was measured as described ( 84 ) , using recombinant protein of GST-human IkBa as a substrate .
A polyclonal antibody to IKKa ( M-280 ) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology .
RESULTS LPS-induced Expression of TNF-a mRNA Is Inhibited by DZA-Transcription of TNF-a and IL-1 was inhibited by DZA in a dose-dependent manner in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by LPS ( 26 ) .
To investigate the effects of DZA on the expression of TNF-a in other types of cells , THP-1 cells and PBMC were pretreated with increasing concentrations of DZA for 1 h , and stimulated by the addition of LPS at a final concentration of 1 ug/ml .
As shown in Fig .
1 , LPS stimulation increased the steady-state levels of TNF-a mRNA as early as 2 h. Treatment of DZA inhibited the LPS-induced expression of TNF-a mRNA dose dependently in both THP-1 cells and PBMC in the same manner as in RAW 264.7 cells .
Expression of B-actin mRNA as a control was not affected by DZA in any of the cells .
These results show that DZA efficiently inhibits the LPS-induced expression of TNF-a mRNA and this potency is not only restricted to murine macrophage cells .
DNA Binding Activity of NF- « B Is Increased by DZA-Since the activation of transcription factor NF- « B has been shown to be indispensable for TNF-a expression induced by LPS ( 85 ) , we examined the effect of DZA on DNA binding activity of NF- « B in the nucleus of RAW 264.7 cells by EMSA , using °°P-labeled NF-kB specific oligonucleotides .
An inducible protein-DNA complex was observed in the nuclear extracts from LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 ( Fig .
24 ) .

A , dose-response effect of DZA in RAW 264.7 cells .
The cells were pretreated with or without DZA at the indicated concentrations ( uM ) for 1 h , and then stimulated by the addition of LPS ( 1 ug/ml ) or not stimulated .
Nuclear extracts were prepared at 1 h after stimulation .
5 ug of each nuclear protein were subjected to a DNA binding reaction with `` °P-end-labeled NF- « B consensus sequence , and then DNA-protein complexes were separated by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
B , competition experiments in RAW 264.7 cells using 50-fold cold NF-kB binding oligonucleotide or AP-1 .
C , removal of DTT in EMSA .
Preparation of nuclear extracts in RAW 264.7 cells and DNA binding reactions were accomplished without DTT .
Data illustrated are from a single experiment and are representative of a total of three separate experiments .
DNA binding activity of NF- « B , even though expression of the TNF-a gene was potently inhibited by exposure to DZA .
More-over , DNA binding activity was potentiated in nuclear extracts dose dependently by DZA , irrespective of LPS stimulation .
In competition experiments , a 50-fold amount of unlabeled NF- « B-specific oligonucleotide absolutely inhibited typical binding activities , but the same amount of unlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotide failed to inhibit binding activities , confirming their speci-ficities ( Fig .
2B ) .
These results suggest that the inhibition of TNF-a gene expression by DZA occurred without down-regula-tion of NF- « B DNA binding activity , and that DZA increases DNA binding activity of NF- « B in RAW 264.7 cells .
Since the presence of a reducing agent such as DTT in preparation of the nuclear extract and the execution of EMSA could mask lost DNA binding activity of NF-kB , we repeated the EMSA assay 18983 A DZA - - ++ LPS - + + pes ( wwe ne pN -e @ @ « ¢-Higl mme B - DZA - - 1 i010 1 10 100 LPS tot $ o # - PGS = - « -- - @ m - -- « m » G Min 0 5 10 15 x 3 60 120 p65 -- Fig .

Nuclear translocation of is increased by DZA .
A , the effect of DZA in RAW 264.7 cells .
The cells were pretreated with or without 100 uM DZA for 1 h , and then stimulated by the addition of LPS ( 1 ug/ml ) .
After 1 h , nuclear extracts were prepared .
10 ug of each nuclear protein was fractionated by SDS-PAGE , and then subjected to Western blot analysis with specific antibodies against p65 , p50 , c-Rel , respectively .
B , dose-response effect of DZA .
RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with DZA at the indicated concentrations ( uM ) for 1 h , and then stimulated by the addition of LPS ( 1 pg/ml ! )
or not stimulated .
After 1 h , nuclear extracts were prepared .
10 pg of each nuclear protein was separated by SDS-PAGE , and then Western blot analysis with specific antibody against p65 was performed .
C , time-response effect of DZA .
RAW 264.7 cells were treated with 100 uM DZA for the indicated times .
At the end of the times , nuclear extracts were prepared .
10 ug of each nuclear protein was separated by SDS-PAGE , and then Western blot analysis with specific antibody against p65 was performed .
Data illustrated are from a single experiment and are representative of a total of three separate experiments .
without DTT ( Fig .
2C ) .
Removal of DTT from the assay could not modulate each of the DNA binding activities which were presented by DTT in an assay with DTT , indicating that the DZA inhibition of TNF-a gene expression is not caused by a loss of NF-kB DNA binding activity .
Nuclear Translocation of NF-kB Is Increased by DZA-We examined the effects of DZA on the translocation of p65 ( Rel-A ) , p50 ( NF- « B1 ) , and c-Rel into the nucleus of RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with or without LPS using Western blot analysis .
LPS stimulation increased protein levels of each NF- « B subunit in the nucleus .
Treatment of DZA at a concentration of 100 uM induced an increase of Rel family proteins in the nucleus of RAW 264.7 cells regardless of LPS stimulation ( Fig .
34 ) .
These results are in exact agreement with the results in Fig .
24 , which shows that DZA induces nuclear translocation of NF- « B and potentiates its LPS-induced translocation in RAW 264.7 cells .
We next established the modulation of p65 in the nucleus of RAW 264.7 cells by DZA at either various concentrations or various time intervals .
Similar to the results in Fig .
24 , DZA at 100 um concentration increased the levels of p65 in the nucleus regardless of LPS stimulation ( Fig .
3B ) .
Fig .
3C shows the modulation of p65 level in the nucleus by treatment of DZA at various time intervals .
p65 in the nucleus increased remarkably at 60 and 120 min after treatment with DZA , even though there was a slight decrease at 15 min .
The total amount of cellular p65 was not modulated by DZA , whereas the amount of cytoplasmic p65 decreased proportionally to the increase of nuclear p65 by DZA as measured in a Western blot analysis of total cellular extracts and cytoplasmic fractions ( data not shown ) .
These results demonstrate that DZA increases the amount of p65 nuclear translocation in RAW 264.7 cells , and that the increase of p65 in the nucleus by DZA is caused only by 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 18984 nuclear translocation , and not by the enhancement of p65 expression .
LPS-induced NF- « B Transcriptional Activity Is Inhibited by DZA , and This Inhibitory Effect Is Augmented by the Addition of Hcey-Since DZA is known to inhibit the expression of TNF-a mRNA without a diminution of NF- « B nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity , we proved the effects of DZA on the NF- « B transcriptional activity by transient transfection experiments of RAW 264.7 cells using reporter gene constructs carrying two copies of the wild-type ( J16 ) NF-kB binding sequence or mutant ( J32 ) NF-kB binding sequence in front of the CAT gene , which have been shown to specifically respond to NF- « B activation ( 83 ) .
LPS stimulation of cells transfected with J16 resulted in a 4.7-fold induction of CAT expression ( Fig .
44 ) , whereas no induction of CAT expression by LPS was observed in cells transfected with J32 .
Treatment of the cells with 100 uM DZA for 1 h before LPS stimulation resulted in a drastic inhibition of LPS-induced CAT expression .
LPS-induced transcriptional activity of NF- « B was dose dependently inhibited by DZA ( Fig .
4B ) .
These results strongly suggest that DZA potently inhibits NF- « B transcriptional activity in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by LPS , even though it more intensely provokes the nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of NF- « B .
The effect of Hey on DZA inhibition of NF- « B transcriptional activity was examined .
There was a tendency to inhibit NF- « B transcriptional activity more than the inhibition observed by DZA alone ( Fig .
4B ) .
These results imply that DZA inhibition of NF- « B transcriptional activity is involved in the accumulation of DZA-Hey in RAW 264.7 cells .
To determine the effect of DZA on CAT expression induced by expression of p65 , RAW 264.7 cells were co-transfected with CAT-reporter plasmids and pSVL65 that express large amounts of p65 .
As a control , cells were transfected with pSVL substituting for pSVL65 .
After 6 h of transfection , one group of cells was exposed for 18 h to 100 um DZA and the other was not ( Fig .
4C ) .
Expression of p65 induced a 5.9-fold increase of CAT protein , driven from J16 under the absence of DZA treatment , but did not induce CAT protein expression from J32 .
The expression of CAT protein was completely inhibited from the cells transfected with pSVL65 when DZA was treated into cells at the concentration of 100 um , although the induction of CAT expression in the cells transfected with pSVL 65 was higher than that in the cells only stimulated with LPS .
The production of p65 was not affected by DZA as monitored by Western blot analysis using anti-p65 ( data not shown ) .
These results , together with the results in Fig .
4 , A and B , showing DZA inhibition of LPS-induced NF-KB transcriptional activity , suggest that DZA directly inhibits the transcriptional activity of p65 but not at the signal cascade of LPS-induced NF- « B activation .
To elucidate whether any of the observed effects could be due to DZA-Hey , cells to be exposed to 100 um DZA for 1 h before LPS stimulation were pretreated with a more specific and potent inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase , DZAri , to block the intracellular accumulation of DZA-Hey ( Fig .
4D ) .
Treatment of DZAri almost completely abrogated the inhibition of NF- « B transcriptional activity in cells treated with 100 um DZA , indicating a central role for DZA-Hcy in the DZA inhibition of NF-kB transcriptional activity .
No inhibition of NF- « B transcriptional activity was observed in cells treated with DZAri alone .
To investigate whether exogenous DZA-Hcy is capable of inhibition , cells were exposed to 100 um DZA-Hcy for 1 h before LPS stimulation .
As shown in Fig .
4D , exogenous DZA-Hcy failed to inhibit NF- « B transcriptional activity in the cells stimulated with LPS , demonstrating that DZA-Hecy is incapable of inhibition when given exogenously .
LPS-induced Phosphorylation of p65 Is Inhibited by The Effects of 3-Deazaadenosine on NF-kB Regulation DZA-To determine if DZA might inhibit the functional activation of NF- « B by modifying phosphorylation of p65 , we examined the phosphorylation of p65 in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells in the presence or absence of DZA .
As shown in Fig .
5 , LPS induced a strong phosphorylation of p65 .
In cells pretreated with 100 um DZA , however , LPS-induced phosphorylation of p65 was markedly reduced .
A low constitutive phosphorylation of p65 was observed in unstimulated cells , which was reduced by treatment of the cells with DZA alone .
These results strongly suggest that DZA inhibits the transcriptional activity of NF- « B by the hindrance of p65 phosphorylation required for the functional activation of NF- « B .
TNF-induced NF- « B Transcriptional Activity Is Inhibited by DZA-We tried to determine if DZA could inhibit NF- « B transcriptional activity without affecting nuclear translocation in non-hematopoietic cells stimulated by other inducers of NF-kB .
TNF- « stimulation of COS-7 cells prominently induced the nuclear translocation of NF- « B and the DNA binding activity of NF-kB , which was not observed in unstimulated cells ( Fig .
6A ) .
The addition of 100 um DZA to COS-7 cells before TNF- @ stimulation had no effect on nuclear translocation or DNA binding activity of NF- « B , suggesting that DZA did not affect TNF- « -induced nuclear translocation of NF- « B in COS-7 cells .
DZA alone did not induce the nuclear translocation of NF- « B in the cells .
In transient transfection experiments of COS-7 cells using reporter gene constructs ( J16 or J32 ) , TNF - « stimulation of cells transfected with J16 resulted in CAT expression that was 2.6-fold greater ( Fig .
6B ) .
No induction of CAT expression by TNF-a was observed in cells transfected with J32 .
Treatment of these cells with 100 um DZA for 1 h before TNF- @ stimulation resulted in complete inhibition of CAT protein expression .
These results reveal that DZA is a common and potent inhibitor of NF- « B transcriptional activity induced by distinct stimuli .
The effect of Hey on DZA inhibition of NF- « B transcriptional activity was examined .
As shown in Fig .
6C , DZA dose dependently inhibited the transcriptional activity of NF-KB in cells stimulated by TNF-a .
Combination of DZA and Hey more potently inhibited NF- « B transcriptional activity than inhibition observed by DZA alone .
These results show that DZA inhibition of NF- « B transcriptional activity is involved in the accumulation of DZA-Hey in COS-7 cells stimulated with TNFa .
Cells co-transfected with pSVL65 and CAT-reporter plasmid ( J16 or J32 ) showed a 3.0-fold expression of CAT protein driven from J16 , but not from J32 ( Fig .
6D ) .
100 um DZA strongly inhibited the induction of CAT protein in cells expressing p65 , suggesting that DZA directly inhibits the transcriptional activity of p65 .
DZA Induces Proteolytic Degradation of IxBa , but Not IxBB-Translocation of NF- « B into the nucleus is linked to proteolytic degradation of IB proteins ( 1 ) , and as we have described above , DZA increases NF- « B nuclear translocation in RAW 264.7 cells .
To test whether DZA promotes proteolytic degradation of I « B proteins , RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with DZA following stimulation with or without LPS .
As shown in Fig .
7A , the level of IxBa protein was notably reduced by treatment of DZA alone for 2 h at a concentration of 100 unm .
The I « Ba protein was fully recovered at 1 h after LPS stimulation without DZA , since IxBa is autoregulated through the activation of NF- « B ( 3 , 36 ) .
Notably , DZA pretreatment before LPS prevented synthesis of IxBa which was recovered when treated with LPS alone , indicating that DZA interfered with the synthesis of IxBa because the transcriptional activity of NF- « B was inhibited by DZA .
Resynthesis of IxBa after stimulation of LPS was more potently prevented by the addition of Hey plus DZA ( data not shown ) .

LPS-induced phosphorylation of p65 is inhibited by DZA .
Phosphate-labeled RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with or without DZA ( 100 pM ) for 1 h , and stimulated with the addition of LPS ( 1 ug/ml ) .
After incubation for 1 h , p65 was recovered by immunoprecipitation using specific antibody and fractionated by SDS-PAGE , followed by autoradiography .
Similar results were obtained in an independent experiment .
p65 vals .
IxBa levels were reduced from their level at 60 min to their level at 120 min after treatment with DZA , and this reduction was continued to 240 min ( Fig .
7B ) .
Thus , these results demonstrate that DZA promotes the degradation of IxBa and prevents its resynthesis .
Furthermore , these results reasonably support that DZA increases nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of NF-kB in RAW 264.7 cells .
A different I « B isoform , IBB is one of the major regulators of NF- « B activity , whose kinetics is slower than that of IxBa in response to NF-kB inducers such as LPS ( 6 ) .
We investigated the effect of DZA on IxBB in RAW 264.7 cells ( Fig .
7 , C and D ) .
Stimulation of LPS for 1 h without pretreatment of DZA led to the disappearance of IBB , which would normally exist in Western blot analysis using unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells ( Fig .
7C ) .
The disappearance of I « BB was also observed in cells pretreated for 1 h with DZA at increasing concentrations following stimulation with LPS .
Interestingly , treatment of 100 uM DZA alone for 2 h at several concentrations could not reduce the level of IxBB ( Fig .
7C ) , and IxBB remained continuously until 4 h after exposure of 100 um DZA ( Fig .
7D ) , implying that DZA can not lead to I « BB down-regulation , and the down-reg-ulation of I « B # is not involved in enhanced nuclear translocation of NF- « B , mediated by DZA in RAW 264.7 cells .
DZA-induced Proteolytic Degradation of IxBa Is Neither Modulated by Hey nor Involved in IKK Complex Activation-The addition of 100 um Hey potentiated the inhibitory effect of DZA on NF- « B transcriptional activity .
To investigate whether Hey can potentiate the effect of DZA on proteolytic degradation of IxBa in RAW 264.7 cells , cells were treated with increasing concentrations of DZA in the presence or absence of 100 uM Hey .
As shown in Fig .
8A , additional treatment of Hey could not modulate the proteolytic effect of DZA on IxBa .
The treatment of Hey alone could not reduce IxBa at all .
In addition , the synergic effect of Hcy was not observed in cells treated with 100 uM DZA for increasing times ( Fig .
8B ) .
These results indicate that DZA-induced proteolytic degradation of IxBa in RAW 264.7 cells is dissociated from the accumulation of DZA-Hey .

As shown in Fig .
8C , treatment of cells with LPS for 15 min severely activated IKK complexes leading to excessive phosphorylation of recombinant IxBa protein .
However , exposure with 100 um DZA from 15 to 240 min never activated IKK complexes , showing that DZA-induced proteolytic degradation of IxBa in RAW 264.7 cells is independent of activation of IKK complexes .
DISCUSSION In this study , we demonstrated the dual effects of DZA on the regulation of NF-KB , inhibition of NF- « B transcriptional activity , and promotion of IxBa degradation .
A hypothetical diagram of the effects of DZA is illustrated in Fig .

There have been many reports that described some interesting properties of DZA , including the inhibitory effect on the expression of cytokines and cell adhesion molecules , the induction of apoptosis and an anti-HIV effect .
The involvement of NF- « B in the expression of numerous cytokines and adhesion molecules which promote several diseases is well known ( 1 ) .
Our previous study ( 26 ) and this paper shows that DZA potently inhibited the transcription of cytokines such as TNF-a « and IL-1 .
Additionally , other researchers reported that the adherence of cells was inhibited through the suppression of adhesion molecule expression of CAT .
Determination of CAT expression was performed using CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit .

expression by DZA ( 27 , 28 ) .
Even though they provided for the possibility of DZA as a potent therapeutic agent for diseases in which these cytokines and adhesion molecules play a central pathogenic role , the mechanism has not been elucidated .
Since these cytokines and adherence molecules are included in specific target genes of NF-KB , this study successfully explains how DZA inhibits the expression of cytokines and adhesion molecules .
Beg et al .
( 37 ) reported that a phenotype of the p65 '~ mice died during embryonic development through massive apoptosis of hepatocytes , suggesting that NF- « B might play an important role in protecting cells from apoptosis , instead of promoting growth of cells .
Additionally , recent reports ( 38-41 ) have described a role for NF-KB in blocking apoptosis induced by TNF .
18987 Interestingly , this protective function of NF- « B was apparent not only against TNF but also against cells treated with ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic agents ( 89 ) .
On the other hand , the role of the Rel proteins in oncogenic transformation is quite well established , and it is now clear that Rel proteins malignantly transform and immortalize cells by inducing expression of specific genes .
These findings suggest the possibility that some of the target genes for Rel-mediated oncogenesis and for NF- « B-mediated blockage of apoptosis may be identi-cal .
Thus , it is strongly suggested that agents which inhibit NF- « B transcriptional activity may have both direct anti-can-cer effects and effects that facilitate apoptosis in tumor cells .
Recently , we reported that DZA induced apoptosis in lympho-cytic mouse leukemia L1210 cells ( 30 ) .
The report showed that even though DZA raised the NF- « B binding activity during apoptosis induction , e-mye transcription that is a downstream target gene of NF- « B ( 1 , 42 ) was markedly reduced at the early stage of apoptosis induction .
Similarly , the reduction of e-mye transcription in DZA-induced apoptosis was also observed in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells by other researchers ( 43 , 44 ) .
Collectively , it is reasonable that DZA inhibition of NF- « B transcriptional activity may entirely serve as a potent inducing factor or may participate at least in part of the induction of apoptosis by DZA in tumor cells .
Finally , these findings point to DZA as a useful chemotherapeutic agent which may prevent malignant transformation of normal cells into tumor cells and induce apoptosis of tumor cells through the inhibition of NF- « B transcriptional activity .
NF- « B , whose enhancer elements are located in HIV-long terminal repeats , is a key molecule of HIV replication for the pathogenesis of AIDS ( 45 ) , suggesting that NF-kB may be a target for the therapy of AIDS .
Previously , other researchers described that DZA may have an anti-HIV effect ( 21 , 22 ) , but the mechanism of this effect has not been understood .
The finding of DZA inhibition of NF-kB transcriptional activity described in this study explains how DZA can exert an anti-HIV effect as described by other researchers .
The inhibition of NF- « B transcriptional activity by DZA suggests that DZA may inhibit the replication of HIV , implying that DZA may be a useful drug for the therapeutic treatment of AIDS .
Naumann and Scheidereit ( 46 ) described that p65 is strongly phosphorylated during the activation of NF- « B in vivo .
A recent study demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of NF- « B is regulated through phosphorylation of p65 by cAMP-independent activation of a catalytic subunit of protein kinase A ( PKAc ) associated with IB proteins by a mechanism which signals caused degradation of IxB proteins results in the activation of PKAc and subsequent phosphorylation of p65 ( 47 ) .
In this study , we showed that DZA disturbed the phosphorylation of p65 induced by LPS .
So , we suggest a possibility that accumulated cellular DZA-Hey , caused by treatment of cells with DZA , might inhibit the activation of PKAc associated with IB proteins , or interrupt the PKAc-mediated phosphorylation of p65 directly or indirectly .
SB203580 , a specific inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase , and elevated intracellular cAMP has been represented as an inhibitor of NF- « B , which inhibit NF- « B transcriptional activity already bound to DNA in the nucleus ( 16 , 17 ) .
Even though , DZA and these inhibitors share a similarity that all of them inhibit NF- « B transcriptional activity without affecting its nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity , there is a definite difference in the mechanism of NF- « B inhibition .
In contrast to SB203580 and elevated cellular cAMP , DZA inhibits the phosphorylation of p65 .
This study indicates that DZA inhibits NF- « B transcriptional activity through a hindrance of p65 phosphorylation by 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 18988 the accumulation of DZA-Hcy in cells .
Nevertheless , we can not totally rule out that DZA independent of cellular DZA-Hey accumulation , may have interfered with NF- « B transcriptional activity .
In the report by Backlund et al .
( 48 ) , treatment with 100 um DZA resulted in significant accumulation of DZA-Hey in RAW 264.7 cells .
The addition of Hey to DZA increased the accumulation of DZA-Hey to about 5 times the level caused by DZA alone .
In contrast to a greatly increased accumulation of DZA-Hcy by the addition of Hey to DZA treatment in the cells , we observed a slightly potentiated inhibition of NF- « B transcriptional activity by the addition of Hey to DZA .
We described that DZA promotes the proteolytic degradation of « Ba , but not IxBfB in RAW 264.7 cells , leading to an increase of nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity .
Increased DNA binding activity of NF- « B in the nucleus by DZA was also observed in DZA-induced apoptosis in L1210 cells ( 30 ) , and DZA might reduce I « Ba in this case .
However , a DZA-mediated increase of NF- « B DNA binding activity in the nucleus was not discernable in COS-7 cells , suggesting that DZA-mediated IxBa degradation is cell-type specific .
A number of kinases have been suggested to phosphorylate IxBa , and recently a high molecular mass , approximately 700 kDa , kinase complex termed IKK ( 7-9 ) was identified .
However , DZA mediates IxBa degradation through an IKK-independent pathway and DZA can stimulate other kinase pathways .
We conclude this because IKK was not activated at all by DZA while it was intensely activated by LPS in this study .
One notable fact is that DZA stimulates proteolytic degradation of IxBa but not IBB .
Among kinases which have been reported to induce degradation of I « B proteins , including IKK , none can selectively differentiate between IxBa and I « xBB .
Thus , we expect that DZA might be a valuable probe to identify kinases that function with only I « Ba .
In conclusion , we demonstrate that DZA has dual effects on NF- « B regulation .
One is an inhibitory effect on NF- « B transcriptional activity already bound to target DNA , and another is the promotion of proteolytic degradation of IxBa .
Although the wide variety of biological properties observed with DZA has emphasized that DZA is to be an effective drug for treatment of human diseases including inflammation , infections , and tu-mors , the mechanism and target molecules of DZA 's action have never been elucidated .
This study is the first to demonstrate that NF- « B is a specific target molecule of DZA and suggests that DZA may be a potent drug for the treatment of diseases in which NF-kB plays an important pathogenic role , as well as a useful tool for studying the regulation and physiological functions of NF- « B .
