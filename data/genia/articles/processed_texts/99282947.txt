LP T cells exhibit enhanced IL-2 secretion when activated through the CD2 pathway .
Coligation of CD28 leads to synergistic enhancement of IL-2 secretion .
Previous studies have characterized the CD28 augmentation of TCR-mediated signaling in peripheral blood T cells through transcriptional activation of an IL-2 promoter CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) , along with enhanced mRNA stability .
This study characterized molecular events involved in CD28 costimulation of IL-2 production in LP mononuclear cells ( LPMC ) .
LPMC exhibited increased IL-2 production in response to CD28 costimulation , compared with cells activated through CD2 alone .
IL-2 secretion was paralleled by increased expression of IL-2 mRNA , resulting from enhanced IL-2 mRNA stability .
In contrast to transcriptional activation in PBMC , EMSA revealed that CD28 coligation of CD2-activated LPMC does not result in increased binding of trans-factors to the CD28RE , nor did Western blots detect changes in I-xBa or I-BB levels following CD28 coligation .
Furthermore , CD28 coligation fails to enhance IL-2 promoter-reporter or RE/AP construct expression in CD2-activated LPMC .
The results reported herein indicate that the molecular mechanisms involved in CD28 cosignaling and regulation of IL-2 secretion in LP T cells are unique to that compartment and differ from those seen in peripheral blood T cells .
These observations suggest a biological significance for different mechanisms of IL-2 activation in initiation and maintenance of the cytokine repertoire found in the mucosa .

Evidence indicates that regulation of IL-2 expression by PBMC takes place largely at the level of transcriptional regulation .
Transcriptional regulation of the IL-2 promoter has been extensively studied in PBMC and T cell lines following TCR activation ( 1 ) .
The 300-bp promoter region of the IL-2 gene upstream of the transcriptional start site contains multiple binding sites for transcriptional activating factors including NF-AT , NF- « B , AP-1 and OCT-binding proteins ( 2 ) .
Cooperative binding of these trans-acting factors appears to determine the balance of transcriptional activation .
In addition to transcriptional regulation of IL-2 mRNA levels , an inducible degradation mechanism has been reported ( 3 , 4 ) .
Production of IL-2 can be enhanced markedly by treatment with translational inhibitors such as cycloheximide without directly affecting the rate of IL-2 transcription ( 5 ) .
Maximal activation of T cells requires two signals , the first of which is generated by engagement of the TCR , with a second signal provided by a costimulatory molecule .
One major costimulatory T cell surface molecule is €D28 ( 6 , 7 ) .

Copyright © 1999 by The American Association of Immunologists CD28 costimulated peripheral blood ( PB ) `` lymphocytes is mediated transcriptionally as well as posttranscriptionally .
CD28 costimulation activates transcription of IL-2 through the binding of « B-like transcription factors to a promoter motif defined as the CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) ( 8 ) .
The Rel family of proteins , p50 , p65 , and c-Rel , are components of the transcriptional complex binding to the CD28RE in PBMC ( 9 ) .
A major component of regulation of « B-like transcription factors is the control of their intercellular localization .
« B-like transcription factors are normally shielded within the cytoplasm through their physical interaction with the -B inhibitory protein ( 10 , 11 ) .
T cell activation results in the rapid and transient decrease of I- « B , thereby releasing the transcriptionally active « B factors and increasing translocation to the nucleus ( 10 , 11 ) .
CD28-mediated IL-2 gene expression in PBMC is regulated likewise by stabilization of IL-2 mRNA .
The IL-2 mRNA possesses AU-rich sequences within the 3 ' untranslated region identified as the target signal for rapid mRNA degradation ( 12 ) .
While CD28 costimulation enhances IL-2 mRNA stability , as well as the stability of other cytokines , no preferential enhancement in the stability of c-myc or c-fos was detected , notwithstanding the presence of AU-rich motifs in the mRNA ( 13 ) .
Thus , regulation of IL-2 RNA / appears to be com-plex , involving specific additional pathways that may be sensitive to the events initiating T cell activation ( 14 ) .
The activation pathways of PB T cells are different from those of lamina propria ( LP ) T cells ( 15 , 16 ) .
LP T cells do not respond well to activation via the TCR/CD3 receptor .
However , they do exhibit increased proliferation and cytokine production when activated via the CD2 pathway ( 16 , 17 ) .
CD28 coligation further enhances the activation of LP T cells .

The intensity can be amplified further as has been demonstrated in conditions of dysregulated inflammation such as Crohn 's disease ( CD ) and ulcerative colitis ( UC ) .
These disorders are characterized by widespread intestinal inflammation and an enhanced T cell activation state with increased production of inflammatory mediators including IL-2 ( 18 ) .
We have developed a model of LP-like T cells by coculturing PB T cells in the presence of irradiated Daudi B cells and IL-2 , which mimics a phenotype of CD2 pathway-dominant cytokine secretion similar to that seen in lamina propria lymphocytes .
Previous studies have shown that the LP-like T cell model is validated by its functional equivalency to LP T cells , not only with regard to CD2 pathway dominance , but with identical phosphorylation patterns upon CD2 pathway stimulation as well ( 16 ) .
Furthermore , recent studies have provided evidence that the LP-like T cell activation model is most representative of the activated state of T cells present in inflamed CD mucosa , as evidenced by CD2-activated up-regulation of AP-1-transactivating factors with similar kinetic profiles ( 19 ) .
The LP-like T cell model has very similar activation properties to those expressed by LP mononuclear cells ( LPMC ) from inflamed CD mucosa , and allows investigations of the mechanism of cytokine gene regulation to be performed initially on a more easily manipulated experimental system .
Little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms regulating IL-2 secretion in LP T cells .
Recent studies have suggested that regulation of IL-2 production in LPMC following CD2 activation may involve a distinct transcriptional regulatory mechanism different from that observed in T cell lines ( 19 ) .
The purpose of this study was to determine whether enhanced IL-2 secretion by CD2 and CD28 costimulation was the product of unique events that regulate transactivation of the IL-2 gene in LP T cells .
The data in this study support the hypothesis that enhanced CD28-mediated IL-2 secretion following coligation with CD2 does not result from increased transactivational activity of the CD28RE or other elements within the first 600 bp of the IL-2 promoter .
The results suggest that the molecular mechanisms involved in CD28 cosignaling and regulation of IL-2 secretion in LP T cells are unique from those involved in the peripheral compartment .
Materials and Methods Target cells and culture media The murine T cell line , CTLL-2 , was obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA ) and was maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO , in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % FCS with 10 U/ml IL-2 ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) .
The human B cell line , Daudi , was obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO ; in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % FCS .
Monoclonal Abs Anti-CD2 mAbs ( clones CB6 and GD10 ) were a gift from Chris Benjamin ( Biogen , Cambridge , MA ) .
Anti-CD28 mAB ascites , clone 9.3 , was obtained from Bristol-Meyers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute ( Princeton , NJ ) .
The ascites was purified over a protein G column and quantified by ELISA .
Purification of LPMC and PBMC Intestinal specimens were obtained from patients undergoing surgical re-section of the colon ( with colon carcinoma or treatment-resistant CD or UC ) at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center , Los Angeles , CA .
Approval for the use of human subjects was obtained from the Institutional Review Board at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center .
In this study , all tissue specimens were taken from an uninvolved area of resected colon from patients with colonic carcinoma ( normal ) , involved areas of patients with UC , as well as from uninvolved and involved areas of patients with CD .
LPMC were isolated using a technique modified from that described previously ( 20 ) .
Briefly , the TRANSACTIVATION OF THE IL-2 PROMOTER intestinal specimen was washed with HBSS , and the mucosa was dissected away from the underlying layers .
The mucosal layer was incubated in a shaking water bath ( 100 rpm ) in calcium- and magnesium-deficient HBSS , containing 1 mM EDTA , 50 pg/ml gentamicin , 100 U/ml penicillin , 100 ug/tol streptomycin , and 50 pg/ml fungizone , with the solution changed every 30 min until the supernatant was free of epithelial cells .
The remaining LP was minced into 1- to 2-mm pieces and digested for 10 min in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % FCS , 0.5 mg/ml collagenase B ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) , 1 mg/ml hyaluronidase ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) , 0.1 mg/ml DNase I ( Sigma ) , 50 ug/ml gentamicin , 100 U/ml penicillin , 100 g/ml streptomycin , and 50 pg/ml fungizone in shaker water bath ( 100 rpm ) .
The supernatant was collected , filtered through 110-um nylon mesh ( Spectrum Laboratory Products , Houston , TX ) , and centrifuged at 500 X g for 5 min .
The cell pellet was resuspended in 15 ml and centrifuged at 30 X g for 5 min to remove epithelial and other large cells .
The supernatant was removed and lymphocytes were isolated by separation on Ficoll-Hypaque gradients .
The cells were then washed three times with HBSS and resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % FCS .
PBMC were isolated from normal healthy volunteers by separation on Ficoll-Hypaque gradients .
Induction of LP-like T cells Mononuclear cells from Ficoll-Hypaque gradients were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10 % FCS with a 1:5 ratio Daudi : lymphocytes plus 10 U/ml rIL-2 for 5 days ( 16 ) .
Daudi were irradiated with 3000 rad and washed three times in HBSS before addition to cultures .
Following a 5-day culture , LP-like cells were washed with HBSS to remove dead Daudi cells ( at this point , there were virtually no live Daudi cells in the culture as determined by flow cytometry ) .
Stimulation of mononuclear cells For stimulation through the CD2 receptor , LPMC and LP-like T cells were stimulated with 0.1 pg anti-CD2 Abs ( both CB6 and GD10 clones ) /10® cells at 37°C for the times indicated for each experiment .
CD28 costimulation was carried out with 0.1 pg anti-CD28 Ab .
Stimulation of T cells with anti-CD2 Abs did not require further cross-linking , since the combination of two anti-CD2 Abs directed against different epitopes was sufficient to induce activation .
IL-2 bioassay IL-2 activity was determined using a CTLL-2 bioassay ( 21 ) .
rIL-2 standards and dilutions of samples were added to 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates ( Costar , Cambridge , MA ) containing 5 X 10° CTLL-2/well and incubated for 48 h at 37°C .
Wells were then pulsed with 2 [ H ] thymidine for 4 h. Wells were harvested using a Harvester 96 ( Tomtec , Orange , CT ) microplate harvester and counted using a Microbeta 1450 liquid scintillation counter ( Wallac , Gaithersburg , MD ) .

Samples were mixed by gentle inversion and kept on ice for 10 min followed by centrifugation .
The pellet was resuspended in 25-60 pl ( volume is dependent on the starting number of cells ) of cold buffer C ( 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7.4 ) , 0.42 mM NaCl , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 0.2 mM EDTA , 25 % v/v glycerol , 0.5 mM DTT , 20 mM leupeptin , 10 pg/ml aprotinin , and 1 mM PMSF ) .
Samples were incubated on ice for 30-40 min during which time they were pipetted twice .
Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation and nuclear proteins were diluted with an equal volume of buffer D ( 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7.4 ) , 50 mM KCI , 0.2 mM EDTA , 20 % v/v glycerol , 0.5 mM DTT , 20 mM leupeptin , 10 pg/ml aprotinin , and 1 mM PMSF ) .

The oligonucleotide was then added ( 20,000 cpm ) and the binding reactions were incubated for an additional 30 min .
Specificity was determined by the addition of 100-fold excess unlabeled oligonucleotide as competitor .
The DNA-protein complexes were separated from unbound probe on a prerun native 5 % polyacrylamide gel in low ionic strength buffer ( 22.3 mM Tris ( pH 7.4 ) , 22.3 mM borate , and 0.5 mM EDTA ( pH 8.0 ) ) .
After 2 h , the gel was dried under vacuum and exposed to x-ray film .
The oligonucleotide used was the composite IL-2 CD28RE/AP site : ( 5'-GTTTAAAGAAATTCCAAAGAGTCATCAG-3 ' ) .
Nonspecific competitor oligonucleotide used was : ( 5-GAGCCTGATTITTCCCCGAAATGA TGAGC-3 ' ) .
DNA constructs The human IL-2 cDNA clone and B-actin were obtained from American Type Culture Collection .
A human IL-2 luciferase reporter plasmid containing a 600-bp fragment of the IL-2 promoter subcloned immediately 5 ' to the luciferase gene has been described previously ( 23 ) .
The human RE/AP and mutant RE/AP promoter-reporter constructs have been previously described ( 24 ) and were a generous gift from Virginia Smith-Shapiro and Arthur Weiss ( University of California , San Francisco , CA ) .
The plasmid TREZ luciferase , used to determine AP-1-dependent frans-activation , was generated by subcloning three copies of the collagenase AP-1 binding sites into a luciferase reporter plasmid ( a gift from M. Karin ) ( 25 ) .
Transfection Freshly isolated LPMC and PBMC were primed for transfection competence by culturing for 16 or 20 h , respectively , in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % FCS , 50 mM 2-ME , and 1 pg/ml PHA-L ( Sigma ) as previously described ( 19 , 23 ) .
Cells were then washed and resuspended in 250 ul fresh medium at 2 X 10 `` cells/ml and electroporated in the presence of 50 ug of reporter construct ( 250 V , 2250 microfarads , 48 ohms ) using 4-mm ( gap width ) cuvettes in a BTX Electro Cell Manipulator ( Genetron-ics , San Diego , CA ) .
After electroporation the cells were diluted in fresh medium , allowed to rest for 1 h prior to plating , and then stimulated with anti-CD2 or anti-CD2 + CD28 mAbs for 4 h. Since transfection of a single promoter was assayed for expression under different activation conditions , normalization for transfection efficiency was not necessary .
However , multiple transfections with different preparation of reporter constructs gave similar results .
Luminescence was measured using a Promega ( Madison , WI ) luciferase assay kit and counted on a 6-detector Wallac ( Gaithersberg , MD ) 1450 Microbeta liquid scintillation counter with coincidence counting turned off .
Western blotting Samples containing 10-15 pug of nuclear protein extracts were separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel ( 10 % polyacrylamide ) and transferred by electroblotting to nitrocellulose membrane ( Hybond C , Amersham ) .
The membrane was blocked for 2 h with 5 % nonfat milk in TBS with 0.1 % Tween-20 and analyzed for immunoreactivity with antisera to IxBa and IxBB ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system ( Pierce ) .

Results Costimulation by CD28 augments IL-2 secretion and increases mRNA accumulation in LPMC and LP-like T cells activated via the CD2 pathway We have described previously a model developed using in vitro-activated PB T cells , known as LP-like T cells , which reproduce the CD2-driven cytokine secretion phenotype seen in LP T cells ( 16 , 19 ) .
LP T cells and LP-like T cells are significantly more responsive than PB T cells to activation via the CD2 pathway than the CD3 pathway , as exhibited by the secretion of IL-2 and other cytokines ( 16 ) .
Coligation of CD2 , but not CD3 , with CD28 resulted in a marked increase of IL-2 secretion in LPMC and LP-like T cells ( 16 ) .
To assess the molecular mechanisms of CD28-enhanced IL-2 secretion , we first examined the kinetics of IL-2 production following activation of LPMC and LP-like T cells via the CD2 pathway in the presence or absence of CD28 costimulation .
As shown in Fig .
1A , measurable amounts of IL-2 were detected in superna-tants of LPMC isolated from inflamed mucosa as early as 3 h following CD2 activation .
IL-2 levels continued to increase over 24 h. CD28 costimulation resulted in a striking increase of IL-2 production at all time points measured .
CD28 coligation of LP-like T cells likewise resulted in enhancement of IL-2 secretion at all time points tested ( Fig .
1B ) .
To determine the molecular events associated with CD28-aug-mented IL-2 production , mRNA was measured at time points following CD2 or CD2 + CD28 activation of LPMC and LP-like T cells .
Northern blot analysis of IL-2 mRNA from LPMC revealed that following activation by CD2 , cytokine secretion was preceded by an increased expression of IL-2 mRNA .
IL-2 mRNA was detectable within 1 h , peaked at 4 h , and then declined to barely detectable levels by 6 h ( Fig .
24 ) .
CD28 costimulation resulted in a striking elevation of IL-2 mRNA expression , as well as a prolonged period of detectability .
The early kinetics of IL-2 mRNA accumulation appeared similar to that seen with CD2 activation alone .
IL-2 mRNA was detectable at 1 h following activation and peaked at 4 h. However , while no IL-2 mRNA was detectable from the CD2-activated cells at 24 h following activation , IL-2 mRNA was still detectable from cells costimulated with CD28 .

EtBr represents ethidium bromide staining of the ribosomal RNA from equalized RNA samples used to prepare the Northern blot .
A , LPMC from inflamed mucosa stimulated with 1 pg anti-CD2/108 cells or 1 ug cells + 1 ug anti-CD28/10° cells .
B , PBL cultured 5 days in IL-2 with irradiated Daudi cells ( LP-like T cells ) prior to stimulation with anti-CD2 or anti-CD2 + anti-CD28 .
Representative of three experiments with similar results is shown .
CD2 + CD28 are similar to those seen in LPMC from inflamed mucosa .
Activation of LP-like T cells via the CD2 pathway resulted in a steady increase in IL-2 secretion within 3 h. The increase in IL-2 persisted throughout 24 h. IL-2 mRNA was detectable within 2 h , and persisted over 6 h , but declined by 10 h ( Fig .
2B ) .
In contrast , the levels of IL-2 mRNA expressed in LP-like T cells costimulated with CD28 were significantly elevated compared with those stimulated with CD2 alone .
Increased IL-2 mRNA expression in CD2- and CD28-costimulated LP-like T cells was still detectable at 10 h and remained elevated at the 24-h time point .
CD28 alone was unable to induce cytokine production or expression of IL-2 mRNA ( data not shown ) .
Thus , CD28 costimulation of the CD2 activation pathway leads to an increase in IL-2 secretion that is paralleled by enhanced level and duration of IL-2 mRNA expression in both LPMC and LP-like T cells .
Costimulation by CD28 enhances mRNA stability in LPMC and LP-like T cell activated via the CD2 pathway The increased IL-2 mRNA accumulation induced by CD2 and CD28 coligation could be related to an increase in mRNA transcription , processing , and/or enhanced mRNA stability .
To determine whether this augmentation was related to mRNA stability , LPMC from inflamed mucosa were preactivated by CD2 or CD2 and CD28 for 2 h ( maximum for mRNA expression in LPMC is 2-4 h ) .
Actinomycin D was added to prevent further transcription , and mRNA decay was monitored for the time periods indicated in Fig .
3A .
CD28 coligation extended the / of IL-2 mRNA from 70 to 180 min .
A strikingly similar result was obtained with LP-like T cells .
LP-like T cells were preactivated by CD2 or CD2 and CD28 for 5 h ( to maximize mRNA expression in LP-like T cells ) .
As seen in Fig .
3B , the : s of IL-2 mRNA from CD2-activated LP-like T cells was 60 min compared with over 200 min following CD28 costimulation .
Thus , CD28 costimulation increases the stability of IL-2 mRNA in both LPMC and LP-like T cells activated via the CD2 pathway .
CD28 costimulation of CD2-activated LPMC does not affect the transcriptional rate of IL-2 gene expression Previous studies carried out with activated PBMC have reported increased transcription after CD28 costimulation of the CD3 pathway ( 26 ) .
To determine the contribution of CD28 signaling on initiation of IL-2 gene transcription in LPMC , run-on assays were performed .
Nuclei were isolated from LPMC activated by CD2 in the presence or absence of CD28 costimulation .
As seen in Fig .
4 , while IL-2 gene transcription was undetectable in unstimulated LPMC , following CD2 activation induction of IL-2 transcription was evident .
CD28 costimulation , however , did not result in an increased transcriptional rate above that observed by CD2 alone ( Fig .
4 ) .
Under all conditions , close to equivalent levels of B-actin were detected .
No increase in signal was detected hybridizing to the plasmid vector alone ( Fig .
4B ) .
To further study transcriptional activation , a wild-type IL-2 promoter reporter luciferase construct encompassing the CD28RE , known to be involved in CD28 enhanced gene transcription in PBMC , was transfected into LPMC activated by CD2 , and LPMC activated by CD2 and CD28 .
Fig .
5 shows that in contrast to results in PBMC , CD2 + CD28 coligation did not significantly increase IL-2 transcription in LPMC from normal or inflamed mucosa over that induced by CD2 alone .
As reported recently , CD2 signaling in LPMC is transmitted in part by induction of AP-1-transactivating factors ( 19 ) .
Fig .
6 demonstrates that while CD2 ligation results in transactivation of a multimeric AP-1-binding TREZ reporter construct in LPMC from normal or inflamed mucosa , coligation of CD28 was unable to further enhance promoter activity .

an increase in the IL-2 promoter activity following CD2 pathway activation of LPMC , costimulation in the presence of CD28 does not further increase transcriptional activity .
Activation of LPMC via the CD28 pathway does not enhance binding of nuclear proteins to the CD28RE , or decrease I- « kB function in LPMC and LP-like T cells Previous studies have identified a CD28RE within the IL-2 promoter region that is required for transcriptional induction of IL-2 gene expression by CD28 costimulated PBMC and T cell lines ( 8 , 9 , 26 ) .
It is believed that the complexes binding to the CD28RE are members of the NF- « B/Re !
family , the function of which is regulated by sequestration of binding of inhibitory I- « B proteins ( 10 , 11 ) .
The results depicted in Fig .
5 suggest that while the IL-2 promoter containing the CD28RE responds to CD2 activation , the CD28RE is not the site at which transactivation is enhanced following CD28 coligation .
To assess the effect of CD28 coligation on functional regulation of the CD28RE in our system , LP-like T cells were activated with CD2 in the presence or absence of CD28 costimulation and nuclear proteins were analyzed for binding to the composite CD28RE/AP-1 cis regulatory element by EMSA .
As shown in Fig .
7 , a very modest increase in binding of complexes to the CD28RE/AP-1 element was detected following CD2 activation .
No additional alteration in the binding of this complex was detectable following CD28 costimulation .

Activation of LPMC via the CD28 pathway does not significantly enhance transcriptional expression of composite CD28/AP promoter-reporter construct Previous studies carried out in T cell lines have demonstrated that transactivation of IL-2 gene expression following CD28 coligation is conferred through a composite element , RE/AP , consisting of the synergistic interaction of both the CD28RE and the adjacent nonconsensus AP-1-binding site ( 24 ) .
Mutation of either one of these components was sufficient for abolishing the CD28 response of RE/AP promoter-reporter constructs transfected into T cell lines .
The data presented above supported the hypothesis that following CD28 costimulation of LPMC no transcriptional up-regulation of the IL-2 promoter could be detected over that observed in the presence of CD2 alone .
However , most of the information regarding our understanding of transcriptional regulation of IL-2 expression has been performed in T cell line systems rather than primary T cells .
Therefore , it seemed possible that the failure to detect transcriptional up-regulation following CD28 coactivation of LPMC might not be unique for mucosal T cells but , rather , might be due to unique transcriptional regulatory mechanisms related to primary T cells compared with T cell lines .
In order to investigate this possibility , PBMC were transfected with multim-erized RE/AP and mutant RE/AP reporter constructs , and expression compared with that of LPMC following CD2 and CD2 + CD28 costimulation .

similar to up-regulation of the RE/AP element described for T cell lines , in peripheral T cells transfected with the RE/AP reporter construct following CD28 costimulation , there is enhanced promoter transactivation ( Fig .
9 , from 14- to 300-fold ) ; however , in contrast to peripheral T cells , in LPMC from normal mucosa following CD2 + CD28 coligation , only a marginal 2-fold increase in RE/AP reporter activation was noted over that induced by CD2 alone .
CD28 stimulation alone did not activate promoter-reporter constructs in all cells tested ( data not shown ) .
Likewise , mutation of either the CD28RE or adjacent nonconsensus AP-1 site abolished CD2 responsiveness .
These results indicate that the regulatory mechanisms involved in IL-2 gene expression following CD28 pathway stimulation in LPMC are distinct from those observed in peripheral T cell and T cell lines .
Discussion In this study , we examined molecular events and mechanisms involved in the regulation of IL-2 production in CD2-activated LPMC and LP-like T cells costimulated with CD28 .
IL-2 gene expression in LPMC and LP-like T cells is highly sensitive to CD2 activation ( 16 ) .
Coligation of the CD28 molecule leads to a synergistic effect , further enhancing IL-2 secretion in these cell populations ( 16 ) .
Our data show that , in LPMC and LP-like T cells , CD28 costimulation enhanced mRNA stability , but did not increase the rate of transcriptional activation .
Nuclear run-on data as well as transfection of a 600-bp IL-2 promoter-reporter construct into LPMC revealed significant promoter activity following CD2 activation , but failed to exhibit augmented transcriptional activation following CD2 + CD28 costimulation above that observed with CD2 alone .
Likewise , expression of the IL-2 RE/AP composite element was responsive to CD2 stimulation but failed to exhibit enhanced activity following CD28 costimulation .
EMSA and Western blot analysis of the CD28RE cis and trans-acting elements support the conclusion that CD2 signaling in LPMC leads to up-regulation of NF- « B-like factors paralleled by rapid decrease of IxkBa .
Costimulation with CD28 does not alter this pattern of expression .
These results highlight again the utility of 6627 the LP-like T cell model as a system with analogous activation properties to those expressed by LPMC , which allows investigations of mucosal cytokine gene regulation to be performed initially on a more easily manipulated experimental system .
Numerous studies have been carried out in PBMC and tumor T cell lines activated through the TCR and CD28 costimulation , which indicated that CD28 synergism was due to both increased IL-2 mRNA transcription as well as enhanced mRNA stability ( 8 , 13 , 27 , 28 ) .
CTLA-4 expression is likewise enhanced in a synergistic fashion following TCR and CD28 costimulation involving a mechanism contributed by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional components ( 29 ) .
However , studies performed with murine T cell clones suggest that in these cells increased IL-2 mRNA production is mediated by a more complex series of events ( 30 ) .
Regulation on a nuclear level does not involve modification of transcriptional activity of the IL-2 enhancer , but rather is the result of increased expression of unspliced IL-2 pre-mRNA ( 30 ) .
A similar mechanism of posttranscriptional regulation of IL-2 expression , at the level of pre-mRNA splicing and processing , has been reported in PBMC activated with PHA but without CD28 costimulation ( 5 ) .
Thus , it remains uncertain as to whether the nuclear effects of CD28 costimulation involve transcriptional activation of the IL-2 promoter in different cell systems .
The vast majority of information acquired regarding transcriptional activation of the IL-2 promoter by CD28 costimulation has been obtained from experiments using human and murine T cell lines .
It should be noted that , although primary T cells must be suboptimally activated with PHA in order to achieve transfection competency , no transcription is detectable in the absence of stimulation ( 19 ) .
Recent studies have indicated that regulation of IL-2 gene expression in primary T cells differs from that observed in tumor T cell lines .
For example , NF-AT sites are much less important in primary T cells than in tumor T cell lines , while the proximal AP-1 and NF- « B sites are of critical importance ( 23 ) .
In addition , expression of an IL-2 promoter construct mutated at the CD28RE site and transfected into primary T cells resulted in reduced expression following CD28 costimulation ; however , mutation of this site did not affect expression following CD2 activation .
Moreover , the appearance of components of cis-regulatory factors binding to the CD28RE , particularly c-rel , has been reported to be closely linked with CD28 costimulation in tumor T cell lines , which has not been the case in primary T cells ( 31 ) .
In PBMC following PMA stimulation alone , c-rel binding to the CD28RE was detected in the absence of IL-2 secretion .
While costimulation by CD28 did result in enhanced c-rel binding , the presence of CD28 cis-binding factors in cells not actively expressing IL-2 indicate that binding to the CD28RE is not exclusively a response to CD28 costimulation ( 31 ) .
A similar finding of CD28-independent transcriptional activation was reported following CD3 plus PMA costimulation and reporter gene transactivation of a CD28RE promoter-reporter construct ( 32 ) .
The CD28RE has been reported to bind B-like proteins , and CD28 costimulation results in the rapid down-regulation of IxBa and concordant translocation of c-rel to the nucleus in PBMC and T cell lines ( 33 ) .
These reports conflict with our observations of LPMC costimulated with CD28 .
While CD2 activation modestly increases expression of factors binding to the CD28RE , CD28 costimulation did not further enhance this effect .
Likewise , a rapid decrease in the level of IxBa was detected following CD2 activation , however , no further or sustained decrease was detected following CD28 costimulation .
Recent evidence suggests that the CD28RE does not function as a discrete element but rather is part of a composite RE/AP site , 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 6628 consisting of the CD28RE and the adjacent AP-1 ( 24 ) .
The importance of AP-1 involvement in regulation of c-rel activity and IL-2 expression is supported by the finding that overexpression of c-rel greatly up-regulates AP-1 expression .
Not only is binding to the consensus AP-1 sequence increased , but more importantly , the binding to the nonconsensus AP-1 sequence immediately adjacent to the CD28RE is enhanced as well ( 34 ) .
The requirement for a composite regulatory site is further supported by studies demonstrating that the HIV tax responsiveness region of the IL-2 promoter requires both the CD28RE and the adjacent AP-1 regions ( 35 ) .
These findings suggest that the CD28RE might be functionally redundant and thereby mediate more than one signaling pathway .
Our data suggest that , at least in regard to the composite RE/AP , peripheral T cells behave in a manner similar to that of T cell lines while transactivation of LP T cell entails unique cis-regulatory elements .
It is quite likely that the cell system as well as the mode of T cell activation may influence regulation of IL-2 gene transcription .
Interpretation of the data obtained through functional expression of transfected IL-2 promoter-reporter construct are subject to an important bias in that they are reflective of the sequences selected , while elements residing outside of the chosen promoter region would not be detected .
In this study , transfection experiments were carried out utilizing a 600-bp IL-2 promoter construct that encompasses the highly conserved region defined as the critical IL-2 promoter element .
However , DNase I hypersensitive sites have been identified within 3 kb upstream of the IL-2 transcriptional start site ( 36 , 37 ) .
Additionally , the EMSA analyses were conducted utilizing the well-studied CD28RE/AP-1 composite element .
Likewise , transcriptional run-on assays , although the methods of choice in analyzing fluctuations in the rate of transcription initiation are susceptible to attenuation through DNA sequences within a gene ( 37 ) .
It is possible that sequences other than those studied might play a role in transcriptional regulation following CD28 costimulation in LPMC , albeit unlikely considering that inhibitory elements have been reported residing upstream of the 600-bp promoter element .
Studies are underway to identify other regions that might respond to CD28 costimulation and regulate transcriptional activation in LPMC .
An increase in mRNA stability in PBMC and T cell tumor cell lines following CD28 costimulation has been reported for numerous cytokines , including IL-2 , IFN-y , GM-CSF , and TNF-a ( 13 ) .
Little is known about posttranscriptional regulation of IL-2 expression , however , several cytokines and transiently expressed proto-oncogenes contain one or more highly conserved AUUUA motifs in the 3'-UT region of their mRNA ( 12 ) .
These consensus elements are determinants for rapid degradation , probably through interaction with specific proteins that can be cross-linked to these AU-rich domains ( 38 ) .
Nonetheless , while CD28 costimulation results in the stabilization of IL-2 mRNA , the proto-oncogenes c-fos , and c-myc were not further stabilized , despite the fact that the mRNAs of these factors possess multiple AUUUA sequences ( 13 ) .
Recent studies of regulation of IL-2 mRNA stability in T cell lines indicate that multiple mechanisms regulate IL-2 mRNA stability and suggest that both 5 ' as well as 3 ' sequences within the untranslated region of the IL-2 mRNA are critical for stabilization ( 39 ) .
Furthermore , in activated T cell lines , activation of the c-jun amino-terminal kinase is involved in IL-2 mRNA transcription and stabilization .
Thus , it would appear that multiple posttranscriptional mechanisms other than the AUUUA motifs regulate IL-2 mRNA stability .
In summary , the studies presented here show that regulation of IL-2 expression in LPMC and LP-like T cells differs from that observed in PBMC .
CD28 costimulation of LPMC increased IL-2 TRANSACTIVATION OF THE IL-2 PROMOTER production paralleled by increased expression of IL-2 mRNA due in part to enhanced IL-2 mRNA stability .
However , in contrast to CD28-mediated transcriptional activation in PBMC , EMSA analysis revealed that CD28 coligation of LPMC did not augment binding of trans-acting factors to the CD28RE or alterations in IxBa or IBB levels .
Although CD2-enhanced IL-2 secretion is reflected by transactivation of IL-2 promoter reporter constructs transfected into LPMC , there was no enhanced CD28-mediated promoter activation following coligation .
In addition , these studies represent the first reports of transcriptional activation of the RE/AP composite element in response to CD2 stimulation .
These observations suggest a biological significance for different mechanisms of IL-2 gene activation in initiation and maintenance of cytokine production in the mucosa .
Furthermore , these results strengthen the use of LP-like T cells as a model for LP T cell activation and the analysis of mucosal cytokine gene regulation .
