6330-6334 , June 1997 Immunology Specific complex formation between the type II bare lymphocyte syndrome-associated transactivators CIITA and RFX5 THomas ScHoLL*T , SaNIEEYV K. anD JacK L. StRomiNnaErR $ § Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology , Harvard University , 7 Divinity Avenue , Cambridge , MA 02138 Contributed by Jack L. Strominger , December 20 , 1997 ABSTRACT Two of the genes defective in the five complementation groups identified in the class II-negative bare lymphocyte syndrome or corresponding laboratory mutants have been cloned .
One gene encodes a protein , RFX5 , that is a member of the RFX family of DNA binding proteins .
The other , CIITA , encodes a large protein with a defined acidic transcriptional activation domain ; this protein does not interact with DNA .
Expression plasmids encoding regions of RFXS5 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain activated transcription from a reporter construct containing GAL4 sites in a cotransfection assay in the Raji human B cell line .
However , these plasmids produced transcriptional activity in HeLa cells only in conjunction with interferon y stimulation , a condition in which expression of both CIITA and class II major histocompatibility complex surface proteins are in-duced .
Furthermore , these plasmids were not active in RJ2.2.5 , an in vitro mutagenized derivative of Raji in which both copies of CIITA are defective .
Transcriptional activation by the RFX5 fusion protein could be restored in RJ2.2.5 by cotransfection with a CIITA expression plasmid .
Finally , a direct interaction between RFX5 and CIITA was detected with the yeast two-hybrid and far-Western blot assays .
Thus , RFX5 can activate transcription only in cooperation with CIITA .
RFXS5 and CIITA associate to form a complex capable of activating transcription from class II major histocompatibility complex promoters .
In this complex , promoter specificity is determined by the DNA binding domain of RFX5S and the general transcription apparatus is recruited by the acidic activation domain of CIITA .
Type II combined immunodeficiency or bare lymphocyte syndrome ( BLS ) is a rare congenital disease characterized by a lack of transcription of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II genes ( 1 ) .
BLS patients fall into three genetic complementation groups and an in vifro mutant defined a fourth ( 2-5 ) .
Recently , a potential fifth complementation group has been reported .
The atypical phenotype of these latter patients exhibited discoordi-nate regulation between a and chains and low levels of class II surface expression on some cell types ( 6 , 7 ) .
Transacting factors are responsible for these various defects since fusion of B cell lines derived from patients with those from a patient representing a different complementation group or with a normal cell line restores class II expression .
The defective genes in two of the complementation groups have been cloned .
Class II MHC trans-activator ( CIITA ) is defective in patients from complementation group A ( 8 ) .
Transfection experiments with plasmids expressing wild-type CIITA rescued MHC class II expression in three cell lines from this group ( 8 ) .
Furthermore , cell lines from this group carry mutations in both copies of the CIITA gene .
Unlike other factors reported to regulate class II MHC transcription for which genes have been cloned and which have all been shown to be ubiquitously transcribed DNA binding proteins ( 9 , 10 ) , the mes The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .
This article must therefore be hereby marked `` advertisement `` in accordance with 18 U.S.C .
§1734 solely to indicate this fact .
© 1997 by The National Academy of Sciences 0027-8424 /97/946330-5 $ 2.00/0 6330 sage for CHHTA correlates with class II MHC expression in cell lines ( 8 ) .
Furthermore , this correlation extends to interferon y ( IFN-y ) -inducible expression and developmental extinction in plasma cells since in both cases induced expression of CIITA alone causes class II MHC expression ( 11 , 12 ) .
Thus , these results strongly suggest that while several transcription factors are required for class II MHC expression , CIITA is the specific regulator that controls both developmental and inducible class II MHC gene expression .
CIITA does not bind DNA but does contain two functional domains .
The N terminus encodes an acidic transcriptional activator , and the C terminus targets the protein to MHC class II promoters ( 13 ) .
The acidic activator is not specific for class II transcription and the function of this domain can be replaced with an activation domain from a viral protein ( 13 , 14 ) .
The gene for RFX5 , defective in complementation group B , was cloned by the same approach as CIITA ( 15 ) .
RFXS shares homology with a family of DNA binding proteins ( RFX1-4 ) , a member of which was initially misidentified as the factor responsible for the BLS defect ( 16 ) but was subsequently reported to regulate hepatitis B virus enhancer activity ( 17 , 18 ) .
Two B cell lines derived from BLS patients in complementation group B have defective RFXS5 loci on both chro-mosomes , and class II MHC expression can be rescued in these lines by transfection of an expression plasmid encoding wild-type RFXS5 ( 15 ) .
The role of RFXS in class II transcription is also supported by its specific binding to a conserved class II promoter element , the X box , and its presence in nuclear complexes which form on the DRA promoter in electro-phoretic mobility shift assay ( 15 ) .
Herein , deletion mutagenesis demonstrates the regions of RFXS5 that are required for activating transcription in a B cell line .
However , in HeLa cells this activity is detected only after IFN-y stimulation .
Furthermore , in a cell that is defective in CIITA , this region of RFXS5 is only functional after genetic complementation with a CIITA expression plasmid .
Finally , a direct interaction between RFXS and CIITA was detected in vivo with the yeast two-hybrid assay and in vitro by direct protein-protein interaction with a far-Western blot analysis .
Thus , RFXS activates transcription indirectly by recruitment of CIITA specifically to the class II MHC promoter where the previously characterized N-terminal acidic domain of CIITA serves to activate transcription .

kits ( Stratascript , Stratagene ) .
This cDNA and oligonucleo-tides ( GIBCO/BRL ) for CHITA , CIITA.1 ( ATAGAATTCG-CAGCTGGAGAGGTCTCCAAC ; contains EcoRI adapter underlined ) and CIITA.Z2 ( ATACTCGAGTCTCAGGCT-GATCCGTGAATC ; contains Xhol adapter underlined ) ; for RFX5 , RFXS5.1 ( GTGGCTACGAGTTTTCCAGATT ) and RFXS5.2 ( GGAATACAGGTAAGGTCACTAC ) were employed in the PCR using pfu DNA polymerase ( Stratagene ) to isolate the CIITA and RFXS coding regions .
These fragments were cloned into the EcoRI and Xhol sites of pBluescript II KS+ for CIITA and designated pBSCIITA or cloned into the SmaI site for RFXS5 and designated pBSRFXS5 .
For mammalian expression and the yeast two-hybrid system , the CIITA coding region was inserted into pBKCMV ( Stratagene ) from which the lee promoter had been deleted and designated pCMVCIITA and into pGAD424 ( CLONTECH ) in frame with the Gal4 activation domain and designated pGADCIITA .
Deletions of the RFXS coding sequence were cloned in frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain of pBXG1 using restriction sites KpnI ( bp 273 ) for essentially full-length pGAL-RFXA34 , Xhol ( bp 750 ) and PstI ( bp 1125 ) without the DNA binding domain for pGALRFXA194 and pGALRFXA318 , and EcoRI ( bp 1600 ) without the proline-rich region for pGALRFXA477 .
The RFXS deletions resulting from digestion with KpnI , Xhol , and Pstl were also inserted into the yeast two-hybrid expression vector pGBT9 and designated pG-BRFXA34 , pGBRFXA194 , and pGBRFXA318 .
For in vitro translation the Xhol and Psfl derivatives of RFXS5 were inserted into pCITE2a ( Novagen ) and designated pTLN-RFX5A194 and pTLNRFX5A318 .
For bacterial expression , CIITA regions corresponding to residues 1-161 and 299-1129 were cloned into pET15b ( Novagen ) and designated pHISCI-ITTAI-161 and pHISCIITA299-1129 .
The plasmid pFUSE contains the GAL4 DNA binding domain ( residues 1-147 ) in pET15Sb .
All PCR products were completely sequenced , as were all junctions in cloning operations ( Sequenase , United States Biochemical ) .
Plasmids pGSEC , pBXG1 , pBXGAL-VP , and pFUSE were the generous gift of Mark Ptashne .
Plasmids pTD-1 and pVa3 were purchased ( CLONTECH ) .
Cell Culture and Transfection .
Raji ( CCL 86 , American Type Culture Collection ) is a Burkitt lymphoma B cell line that expresses all MHC class II isotypes .
RJ2.2.5 was derived by ry-irradiation mutagenesis of Raji and is defective for global MHC class II transcription ( 19 ) .
The HeLa cell line ( CCL 2 , American Type Culture Collection ) was derived from a cervical carcinoma .
Cells were cultured and treated with IFN-y as reported ( 20 ) .
Cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of plasmids by electroporation .
Briefly , cells were washed twice in PBS with 10 mM Hepes ( pH 7.3 ) and resuspended at 4 X 10 `` cells per ml , on ice .
Aliquots of 1 X 10 `` cells were mixed with DNA , pulse-labeled at 250 V and 960 wFd , maintained on ice for 10 min , and plated in 100-mm dishes with 15 ml of medium .
After 48 hr of culture , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activities were determined as reported ( 21 ) .
Quantitative measurements of different chloramphenicol species using duplicate independent transfections of each sample were made with phosphoimaging equipment ( Fuji ) .
As an internal control of transfection efficiencies 2 ug of pCMV 8 ( 22 ) was included in all transfections .
B-Galactosidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically .
This result showed that transfection efficiency generally varied less than 10 % and always less than 15 % ; therefore , no normalization to this control was done .
Southern Blot Analysis .
CIITA mRNA was assessed in Southern blots of PCR products from cDNA ( prepared as above ) using primers CIITA.2 and CIITA.3 ( TTGAGCGA-CACGGTGGCGCTGTGGGAG ) .
Blots were prepared , hy-bridized , and washed under high-stringency conditions as described ( 23 ) .

All quantitative data was derived from three independent colonies transformed with the indicated plasmid ( s ) .
The B-galactosidase assay was performed as described ( 24 ) .
Far-Western Blot Analysis .
Recombinant proteins from plasmids pHISCIITTA1I-161 , pHISCIHITA299-1129 , and pFUSE were induced in host BI21 ( DE3 ) ( Novagen ) and purified by nickel-chelate chromatography under denaturing conditions for CIITA- ( 299-1129 ) and native conditions for CIHITA- ( 1-161 ) and GAL4- ( 1-147 ) ( Qiagen , Chatsworth , CA ; protocols 7 and 5 , respectively ) .
Western blots were made and probed as described ( 24 ) except that 5 ug of recombinant protein was loaded per lane and protein probes were *°S-radiolabeled by in vitro translation ( TNT reticulocyte , Pro-mega ) .
RESULTS RFX5 Activates Transcription When Tethered to a Heter-ologous Promoter in Raji B Cells .
A series of expression plasmids were constructed that fused coding regions of RFXS to the GAL4 DNA binding domain .
The plasmids were designed to remove from the 5° end successive putative functional domains identified within the RFXS primary structure including the DNA binding and proline-rich domains and the central region of the coding sequence .
These plasmids and the controls , pBXG1 , which expresses the GAL4 DNA binding domain , and pBXGAL-VP , which expresses the DNA binding domain fused to the VP16 acidic activator , were cotransfected into Raji B cells with the reporter plasmid pGSEC , which contains the GAL4 binding sites upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene ( 25 ) .
Transcription was activated by the expression of two of these RFXS5 fusion proteins corresponding to 5 ' deletions at amino acids residues 34 and 194 in the open reading frame ( Fig .
1 ) .
These results demonstrate that portions of the RFXS5 protein can activate transcription within B cells in a context other than that of the class II MHC promoter and that RFXS can activate transcription from the reporter construct in the absence of other MHC class II promoter binding proteins .
Since activity was maintained after deletion of the first 194 amino acids of RFX5 , its DNA binding region was not required for transcriptional activation and could be substituted by the GAL4 DNA binding domain .
Furthermore , comparison of the activities induced by the 34-and 194-residue deletion constructs indicates that stronger transcription activation was seen with the 194-residue deletion .
The presence of the RFXS5 DNA binding domain may sequester some of the fusion protein to recognition sites within the genome and away from the reporter plasmid .
Transcriptional Activation by the RFX5 Activation Domain Is IFN-y-Inducible in HeLa Cells .
HeLa cells are well characterized as a model system for IFN-y induction of class II MHC genes ( 26 ) .
When the RFXS deletion plasmids were transfected into HeLa cells , no transcription from the reporter gene plasmid was detected .
However , after treatment with IFN-y , transcriptional activity in HeLa cells was observed in transfections with both the 34- and 194-residue deletion constructs ( Fig .
2 ) .
Also , consistent with the data obtained from the Raji cell transfections RFX5- ( 194-615 ) produced more reporter gene activity than did RFX5- ( 34-615 ) .
These data suggest that RFXS5 does not contain an `` activation domain `` since previously defined activation domains are constituitively functional .
Thus , either the RFXS domain is modified in the cell after IFN-y treatment or , alternatively , an additional factor , induced or activated by IFN-y stimulation , might be required for transcriptinal activation by the RFXS5 fusion protein .
Relevantly , IFN-y is known to induce the transcription of CIITA , a factor that is essential for transcription from class 6332 Immunology : Scholl et al .

- Regions of RFXS that activate transcription in the Raji human B cell line .
A series of 5 `` deletions of the RFXS5 coding region were fused to the GAL4- ( 1-147 ) DNA binding domain .
These plasmids were designed to sequentially remove putative functional domains detected in the primary structure of RFX5 .
RFX5- ( 34-615 ) is essentially full-length , RFX5- ( 194-615 ) removes the DNA-binding domain , RFX5- ( 318-615 ) removes the central region , and RFX5- ( 477-615 ) removes the proline-rich region .
Numbers used are the numbers of amino acid residues deleted from the reported translation initiation codon .
pBXGAL-VP expresses the GAL4 DNA binding domain fused to the acidic activation domain of VP16- ( 413-490 ) .
Cells were transfected with 10 pg of pGSEC alone as a control for background activity by this reporter construct .

Samples transfected with GALA fusion proteins were cotransfected with 10 ug of pGSEC .
the B cell lymphoma line Raji .
This line is globally defective in MHC class II transcription due to mutations in both copies of CIITA and serves as a CIITA negative background .
Transcriptional activation by RFX5- ( 34-615 ) and RFX5- ( 194-615 ) was detected in transfection of RJ2.2.5 only when an expression plasmid encoding CIITA was included and not in controls in the absence of CIITA ( Fig .
3 ) .
Thus , CIITA is required for the activity directed by RFXS .
Direct Protein-Protein Interaction Between CIITA and RFX5 .
The requirement for CHTA in transcriptional activation mediated through RFXS5 could be explained by a direct interaction between these two factors .
Two systems were employed to demonstrate this interaction .
( ? )
The yeast two-hybrid system was employed ( 27 ) .
Three of the GAL4 RFXS inserts in pBXG1 [ RFX5- ( 34-615 ) , - ( 194-615 ) , and - ( 318-615 ) ] were cloned into the yeast expression plasmid pGBT9 , and the full-length CIHIHTA coding region was inserted into pGAD424 .
After transformation into yeast , an interaction was detected between CIITA and the fusion protein encoding residues 194-615 of RFX5 ( Fig .
4 ) .
Unlike the mammalian cotransfection experiments , no activity was detected for the largest RFXS5 region corresponding to amino acids 34-615 .
Furthermore , when yeast were transformed with the pGBT9 derivatives alone , no B-galactosidase activity was detected , confirming that RFX5 can not activate transcription alone .
( # ) Interaction between CIITA and RFXS was also detected in vitro by the Far-Western technique .
Three recombinant proteins that included the N terminus of CHITA ( residues 16-147 ) , the C terminus of CHTA ( residues 299-1129 ) , and the GAL4 DNA binding domain ( residues 1-147 ) were expressed in bacteria in a vector that encoded an N-terminal histidine affinity tag .
The proteins were then purified by nickel-chelate Immunology : Scholl et al .

As a positive control human TAF7O was included as a probe since it interacts with the N-terminal acidic activation domain of CIITA ( 28 ) .
An interaction in the test samples was detected between the C-terminal region of CIITA , residues 299-1129 , and RFX35 , residues 194-615 , as well as between the N-terminal region of CIITA , residues 1-161 , and TAF7O ( Fig .

DISCUSSION The isolation of genes encoding transcription factors responsible for the regulation of MHC class II genes by expression and complementation screening techniques permits experiments designed to elucidate the mechanisms through which these proteins function .

Interaction between RFXS and CIITA detected in yeast .
Histograms depict B-galactosidase reporter gene activity in yeast extracts from cells transformed with RFX5S-GAL4 fusion protein expression plasmids or cotransformation that included a plasmid for expression of CIITA fused to the GAL4 activation domain .
All data represent the mean activity detected in triplicate transformants .
Individual measurements were within 5 % of each other .
pGBT9 encodes the GAL4 DNA binding domain alone .
pTD-1 used in the positive control encodes a fusion protein made up of amino acids 84-708 of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen and GALA activation domain and pVa3 encodes a fusion protein made up of GALA DNA binding domain and amino acids 72-350 of p53 with which the simian virus 40T antigen interacts .
quent data from this system when transfected into other cell types indicated first that this region of RFXS did not function in all cell types and then that cooperation/interaction with CIITA was required for this activity .
Finally , a direct interaction was detected between RFX5 and CIITA both in vivo and in vitro with the yeast two-hybrid assay and biochemically by far- Western blot analysis .
Thus , these results indicate that RFXS5 and CHITA can form a complex that is capable of activating transcription .
CIITA may function as a coactivator , binding together through protein-protein interactions RFXS5 and other class II MHC promoter bound DNA binding proteins including at least those bound to the TATA box .
Other interactions may influence the association of CIITA with class II MHC promoters .
First , there are multiple cis elements that when mutated reduce transcription from class II MHC promoters , including the X and Y box , the J and S elements , and an octamer element ( 29 , 30 ) .
Unless these recognition sites bind factors whose expression specifically correlates with class II transcription , it is likely that they also ultimately function through CIITA .
Additionally , cooperative binding of multiple factors to class II promoters has been demonstrated .
In fact , CHHTA may tie together factors that bind to several DNA elements .

Detection of an interaction between RFXS5 and CIITA by far-Western blot analysis .
Recombinant proteins ( 5 ug ) were electro-phoresed and blotted on quadruplicate gels .
Proteins were refolded on the membranes and probed with the indicated radiolabeled in vitro-translated proteins .

recruits the protein OCT 2 and , through OCT2 , BOB1 , which interacts with the TATA box binding protein complex .
Synergy in binding may stabilize interactions with RFX5 , CIITA , or both ( 31 , 32 ) .
In these experiments , the levels of transcription generated by the interaction of the RFXS5-GAL4 fusion proteins was much less than that initiated from the DPA proximal promoter ( Fig .
2 ) or that detected when the CIITA activation domain was fused directly to the GAL4 DNA binding region .
This finding may be a further indication that additional interaction ( s ) to those with RFX5 are required for full recruitment of CIITA to or subsequent activation of the MHC promoter .
CIITA is present in higher-order multiprotein complexes present on MHC class II promoters ( 13 ) , and although it is required for MHC class II transcription and encodes a strong acidic activation domain , it does not bind DNA .
Conversely , RFX5 encodes a DNA binding domain that recognizes a DNA element unique to MHC class II genes , the X box .
Thus , CIITA functions as a coactivator through specific protein interactions with RFX5 .
The role for RFXS5 in this model is to lend promoter specificity to this complex through X-box-specific recognition by its DNA binding domain .
The role of CIITA then is to activate transcription via its N-terminal acidic domain .
