Diminished expression of TCR and p56 `` that are associated with the TCR and reduced nuclear localization of RelA containing nuclear factor « B ( NFB ) complexes have been noted .
These defects have been described in T cells from patients with malignant melanoma , renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) , ovarian cancer , and colorectal cancer .
Preliminary observations also indicate possible correlation with clinical variables such as stage in selected instances .
To further characterize altered expression of TCRL , p56 `` , and impaired activation of NFKB , T lymphocytes were obtained from 65 patients with RCC , the majority of whom were receiving combination cytokine therapy { interleukin ( IL ) -2 , IFNa-containing regimens ] and 37 control individuals .
In 29 of these patients , levels of TCRL and p56 `` were determined by Western blots of T-cell lysates and semiquantitated using densitometry .
Relative levels were then correlated with a series of clinical variables including response to therapy , performance status , survival , disease sites , age , and others .
In another group of 28 patients ( three individuals from the first group ) , the frequency of abnormal NFB activation was studied using electrophoretic mobility shift assays after activation of T cells with phorbol myristate acetate/ionomycin or anti-CD3 mono Received 4/3/98 ; revised 7/8/98 ; accepted 7/22/98 .

Changes in these signaling molecules during cytokine treatment were also investigated .
TCR and p56 `` were detected in the peripheral blood T cells in 27 of 29 patients , and overall , reduced levels were noted visually in 12 of 29 ( 41 % ) and 13 of 29 ( 45 % ) individuals , respectively .
When levels were semiquantitated using densitome-try , significant decreases of TCR ( P = 0.029 ) and p56 `` ( P = 0.029 ) but not CD3e ( P = 0.131 ) , compared with control levels , were found .
In patients treated with IL-2/ IFNa-based therapy , relative levels of TCRL increased significantly ( P = 0.002 ) on day 15 of cycle one compared with the baseline .
Correlations of TCRC or p56 `` levels with response or disease variables , except for lower TCRL levels ( P < 0.001 ) in the presence of bone metastases , were not found .
Abnormal NFB activation after stimulation with phorbol - myristate acetate/ionomycin - and/or - anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody was found in 59 % of patients ( 17 of 28 ) and was not accounted for by the advanced age of the study cohort .
Activation of NFB in peripheral blood T cells was inducible during cytokine therapy in four of six individuals who displayed impaired NFB activity prior to therapy .
Moreover , impaired activation of NFB does not appear linked to a reduction of TCR expression , because in five patients , normal TCR levels were present although B binding was not inducible .
In the majority of patients with advanced RCC , peripheral blood T cells express TCRL and p56 `` , and in a subset , reduced levels of these TCRL associated molecules are seen that may increase during cytokine-based therapy .
Abnormal activation of NFB is also present in > 50 % of patients and may also revert to normal during IL-2/IFNa-based treatment .
This alteration in NFB activation occurred in the presence of normal expression of TCRG-associated signaling elements .
The clinical significance of these findings remains unclear .
INTRODUCTION Abnormalities of the CD3/TCR® ( TCRL ) and signal transduction pathways have been described in splenic and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes obtained from tumor-bearing animals ( 1 ) and patients with advanced cancer ( 2 ) .
These include defects in the expression of the TCR chain and protein tyrosine ki-nases , e.g .

gation of the CD3 complex .
Although less frequent , similar findings in peripheral blood T-cells from melanoma ( 3 , 4 ) , RCC ( 2 , 5 ) , ovarian carcinoma ( 6 ) , Hodgkin 's disease ( 7 ) , and colorectal cancer ( 8 ) patients have also been reported and in the last instance may be correlated with disease stage ( 9 ) .
Recently , we and others have reported that T cells from tumor-bearing animals ( 10 ) and RCC patients ( 11 ) also have reduced 6B sequence motif-specific binding activity .
The major alteration appears to be in the nuclear localization of Rel A containing NFKB complexes after T cell activation .
Altered expression of various signal transduction molecules may be associated with functional defects noted in T cells isolated from tumor-bearing hosts ( 4 ) and may be a contributing factor responsible for the inability to develop an effective antitumor immune response .
Defects in proliferation ( 12 , 13 ) , lytic capacity ( 12 ) , and cytokine secretion ( 14 ) have been described for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes derived from patients with various types of solid tumors .
In mice with transplantable neo-plasms ( RENCA and MCA-38 ) , tumor progression is associated with a reduction in expression of signaling elements and a decrease in production of the TH1 cytokines IL-2 and IFNy by splenic T cells ( 15 ) .
Likewise , in patients with metastatic melanoma , whose T cells displayed reduced TCRL expression , diminished production of IL-2 and IFNy ( 4 ) has been observed .
Moreover , studies in animals suggest that cytokine-based Im-munotherapy may result in the reversal of some signaling defects ( 15 ) .
RCC represents a tumor in which cytokine therapy is used frequently ; however , the clinical significance of the observed signaling abnormalities and the effects of cytokine therapy on these findings are unclear .
The present study was therefore initiated to further characterize the frequency of TCRL and p56 `` abnormalities in peripheral blood T cells from patients with RCC , correlate these abnormalities with clinical character-istics , and investigate alterations occurring during cytokine therapy .
Additionally in view of recent findings cited previously , the frequency of abnormal NFkB activation in T cells from RCC patients was studied .
The results demonstrate reduced expression of TCRL and p56 `` in T cells from a subset of patients with advanced RCC and possible increases in TCRL expression during therapy with rIL-2- and IFNa-containing regimens .
Abnor- mal activation of NFkB was also found in 59 % of patients , which reverted to a normal pattern in some individuals during cytokine therapy .
Moreover , the alterations in signal transduction that are associated with defective NFKB activation are distinct and downstream from early CD3/TCR-linked signaling events .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Patient Selection .
- Patients with metastatic and/or recurrent renal cell carcinoma , the majority of whom were treated in a series of Phase I or II clinical trials , were studied .
A total of 65 patients were investigated .
The treatment regimens administered to the various groups are outlined in Table 1 .
Peripheral blood was sampled pretherapy and at various time points during and after treatment ( see Table 1 ) .
Informed consent was obtained in accordance with institutional and National Cancer Institute guidelines .
Control Subjects .
Peripheral blood T cells were obtained from 37 healthy donors to serve as controls .
In studies using Western blotting , whole-cell lysate from the same healthy donor was included in each experiment when TCRL , CD3e , and p56 `` from patient T cells were analyzed .
To evaluate the variation in signaling element expression among individuals , cell lysates from five healthy donors were run in the same experiment .
To assess variations in the levels of TCRL , p56'* , and CD3e over time , these signaling elements were measured in three additional normal donors at three separate time points .
T-cell nuclear lysates from 20 different healthy individuals were used as controls when NFxB activation was evaluated in patient T cells .
These T cells were obtained from redundant leukophore-sis samples ( Cleveland Clinic Blood Bank ) .
Finally , the level of stimulus-dependent 6B binding activity from RCC patient T cells was compared with an age-matched control group ( n = 8 ) .
Isolation of PBL-T. PBLs were isolated , and PBL-Ts were purified as described previously ( 2 , 10 ) .
Briefly , PBLs were subjected to Ficoll-Hypaque ( LKD Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) density gradient centrifugation and depleted of B celis , natural killer cells , and macrophages by negative selection using magnetic separation with microbeads coated with antibodies to Downloaded from clincancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 10 , 2019 .

trypsin/chymotryp-sin inhibitor , 1 mm sodium orthovanadate , 2 pg/ml aprotinin , and 2 pg/ml leupeptin ] for 15 min at 4°C .
The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C , after which the supernatant was carefully harvested to not disturb the pellet .
Cellular lysates ( 10-20 pg of equivalent loading in each one ) were electrophoresed in 12 % ( for TCRL ) or 7.5 % ( for p56 `` ) SDS page under reducing conditions and then transferred to NitroBind ( Nitrocellulose ) transfer membranes ( MSI , Westboro , MA ) .
The membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with a 5 % solution of nonfat dried milk .
Then the membranes were blotted for 1 h at room temperature with anti-TCRE antibody ( Coulter Corp. , Hialeah , FL ) at 5 pg/ml , anti-p56 `` `` `` ( Upstate Biotechnology , Inc. , Lake Placid , NY ) at 1 pg/ml , and anti-CD3e ( DAKO Co. , Carpinteria , CA ) at 5 pg/ml .
The membranes were washed with 1 mM Tris base , 5 m NaCl , and 0.1 % Tween 20 ( pH 7.5 ) and incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immunoglobulin horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:2000 ( Amer-sham , Buckinghamshire , United Kingdom ) .
After washing with 1 m Tris base , 5 m NaCl , and 0.1 % Tween 20 ( pH 7.5 ) , the membranes were developed with the chemiluminescence kit ECL ( Amersham ) for 1 min .
X-Omat AR film ( Kodak Co. , Rochester NY ) was used to detect the chemiluminescence .
Patient samples and the same normal control were included on each Western blot .
All samples for a given patient were run in the same Western blots so that comparisons between pretreatment and treatment samples could be made .
Densitometry Scanning .
The developed X-omat AR Film was placed on a white light box ( Vari Quest 100 ) by Fotodyn , and its images were captured by a High Resolution CCD Camera ( Sierra Scientific ) .
Image 1.44 was the program used to analyze the density of each band by graphically plotting the images and calculating the area under each peak .
NFB - Activation/T-Lymphocyte - Culture .
PBL-Ts ( 1 X 10 % /ml ) were cultured in the presence and absence of stimulus .
The medium was RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 % FCS .
T Cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml of PMA ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) plus 0.75 pg/ml ionomycin ( Sigma ) for 0.25 , 0.5 , 2 , and 4 h. In some experiments , T cells were stimulated with cross-linked anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody ( Ortho Biotech , Raritan , NJ ) .

The cells were incubated on ice for 15 min and then 10 pl of 10 % NP4O0 solution ( Sigma ) were added , and cells were vigorously mixed for 10 s and then centrifuged .
The supernatant containing cytoplasmic proteins was transferred to another tube and aliquoted .
Nuclei were resuspended in 50 pl of buffer C [ 25 % glycerol , 20 mm HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 0.4 m NaCl , 1 mm EDTA , 1 mm EGTA , 1 mm DTT , 100 pg/ml PMSF , 2 g/ml aprotinin , 2 pg/ml leupeptin , 100 pg/ml Pefabloc , and 100 pg/ml chymostatin ] .
After mixing at 4°C for 20 min , the nuclei were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,200 rpm , and supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were stored at -70°C .
Protein concentration was measured with a commercial kit ( Pierce BCA kit , Rockford , IL ) as specified by the manufac-turer .
As described previously ( 10 , 17 ) , nuclear extracts ( 5 ug of protein ) were preincubated in a 25-pl total reaction volume containing 20 mm HEPES , pH 7.9 , 80 mm NaCl , 0.1 mm EDTA , 1 mm DTT , 8 % glycerol , and 2 pl of poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) for 15 min at 4°C .
The reaction mixture was then incubated with the radiolabeled oligonucleotide ( 2 X 10° cpm ) for 20 min at room temperature .
The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 6 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with 0.25 % TBE buffer ( 22.3 mm Tris , 22.2 mm boric acid , and 0.5 mm EDTA ) .
The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography .
For the preparation of the probe , radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared by annealing coding strand template to a complementary 10-base primer and filling in the overhang with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of [ a « - `` °P ] dCTP .
Oligonucleotide corresponding to 6B element from IL-2Ra gene was prepared by using an Applied Biosystems oligonucleotide synthesizer ( model 381 A ) .
The sequence of the oligonucleotide was : 5-CAACGGCAGG-GGAATCTCCCTCTCCTT-3 ' .
Supershift experiments were performed using standard EMSA procedure described previously , with the exception that 25 ul of reaction mixture were preincubated with 2 wl/2 ug of the appropriate antibody at 4°C for 15 min before the addition of labeled oligonucleotide .
Thereafter , the samples were electrophoresed in a 6 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel .
The antibodies used included ; anti-NFkB1 , anti-RelA , and anti-c-Rel ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc. , Santa Cruz , CA ) .
Normal rabbit serum 2 pl ( 2 g ; Jackson Immuno Research Laboratory , West Grove , PA ) was used as a control .
Statistical Analysis .
Relative levels of TCRL , p56 `` ® , and CD3e were determined by densitometry scanning .
Because of the variability between Western blots performed at different times , direct comparisons could not be made .
Therefore , the ratios of control and pretreatment values were used .
These values were used to compute summary statistics and Ps for various patient groups .
The Wilcoxon signed rank test ( two-sided ; Ref .
18 ) was used to test for a difference between the control and pretreatment values after computing the following : Patient value , , Control value To determine changes associated with treatment , the following value was calculated using control and patient signaling molecule levels on either day 8 or 15 : Patient valueps , , is - Patient value , , Control value The Wilcoxon rank sum ( two-sided ) test ( 18 ) was used to test for a difference between responders and nonresponders using the ratios of pretreatment to control values .
To assess the relationships between patient clinical characteristics and levels of signaling molecules , a multiple linear regression model ( 19 ) was fit to the logarithm of the ratio of the pretreatment value over the control value for p56 `` , TCR , and CD3e .
The common logarithm was computed in an attempt to stabilize variances ; one was added to the pretreatment values to avoid taking the logarithm of zero .
Factors were eliminated in a backward fashion and consisted of age , prior therapy , gender , performance status , primary tumor in place , individual metastatic sites of lung , lymph node , liver , adrenal , soft tissue , and bone .
ANOVA ( 20 ) was used to test for a significant variability within and between control subjects run on the same Western blot ( three subjects and three time points ) .
The F statistic ( 21 ) was used to test for a difference in variances between different samples and within the same sample run on this same Western blot .
The Mantel-Haenszel log-rank test ( 22 ) was used to test for a survival difference by response .
RESULTS Patient Characteristics .
- A total of 54 patients with met-astatic/unresectable RCC and 11 patients after resection of all disease were studied from October 1993 to August 1997 ( Table 1 ) .
Forty-two individuals were participants in two different clinical trials using slightly different regimens of rIL-2 and IFNa with/without 5-FU ( 23 , 24 ) .
Seven patients were treated with rIL-2 and IFNa , and the remaining 35 received this same combination plus 5-FU .
In this group , all patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of < 1 ( 0-17 patients and 1-25 patients ) .

Twelve patients with metastatic and locally advanced RCC prior to surgery or systemic therapy were also studied .
Finally , 11 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease who underwent resection of all visible disease were studied prior to treatment in a pilot study of adjuvant r [ L-2 .
Frequency and Extent of Signaling Element Defects in Peripheral Blood-derived T Cells from RCC Patients .
Previously , in a small number of RCC patients , we reported that the levels of TCR4L , p56 `` * , and p59 `` were decreased in PBL-Ts from some individuals .
This report extends these findings and determined the levels as well as the frequency of altered expression of TCRL , CD3e , and p56 `` * in PBL-T 's from RCC patients .
Twenty-five patients receiving rIL-2/IFNa-based therapy and four additional patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic disease were studied .
Data on these 29 patients was pooled and examined for differences between patients and normal controls .
Correlations of pretreatment protein levels with survival , clinical response , number or location of metastatic sites , performance status , prior therapy , age , gender , and nephrectomy status were carried out .
Fig .
1 demonstrates Western blots illustrating levels of TCRL and p56 `` in PBL-Ts from selected RCC patients compared with controls .
In the 29 patients examined , normal levels of TCRL and p56 `` were displayed in 59 and 55 % of individuals , respectively .
The majority of remaining individuals expressed detectable but reduced levels of these two signaling elements .
In 2 of 29 patients , TCRL and p56 `` were not detected in PBL-Ts .
CD3e levels ( determined on 23 patients ) remain relatively constant in most instances ; however , some variability in these levels was also noted .
Visual inspection of the Western blots clearly demonstrated some decrease in the various signaling molecules compared with controls as follows : TCRL , 12 of 29 ( 41 % ) ; p56 `` , 13 of 29 ( 45 % ) ; and CD3e , 2 of 23 ( 8 % ) .

5 EMSAs are illustrated that were performed on T cells from four normal individuals and four RCC patients ( indicated by initials ) plus four age-matched controls .
The studies demonstrate induction of 6B-specific binding complexes after stimulation with PMA ( P , 10 pg/ml ) and ionomycin ( I , 0.75 g/ml ) or cross-linked anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody ( CD3 ) .
Various incubation times including 0.25 , 0.5 , 2.0 and 4.0 h are illustrated .
T cells from the four age-matched control individuals demonstrate normal induction of C1 ( RelA and NFkBI1 homodimer ) .
Additionally , T cells from four different normal and four RCC patients demonstrate normal NFxB activation in the former group compared with no induction of the C1 and C2 nuclear complexes after stimulation in the patients .
densitometry scanning was used to provide relative estimates of signaling molecule levels .
Fig .
1 illustrates Western blots and relative levels of these proteins based on the densitometry data in selected patients ( prior to therapy ) and normal individuals .
For the entire group of patients , CD3e levels were not significantly different compared with control individuals ( P = 0.131 ) ; however , ( P = 0.029 ) and p56 `` * ( P = 0.029 ) were lower .
The correlations of pretreatment TCRL and p56 `` levels with various clinical characteristics and objective responses ( 3 of 25 partial responses ) in patients receiving cytokine therapy were also investigated .
Lower levels of TCR were associated with the presence of bone metastases ( P < 0.001 ) .
No significant decreases were associated with the other variables such as number of metastatic sites or nephrectomy status .
Additionally , higher levels of p56 `` and TCRL were not associated with clinical response ( P = 0.068 and 0.223 , respectively ) .
Because variability of protein levels from experiment to experiment is an issue , the level of expression was examined in PBL-T cells isolated from healthy volunteers .
Some variability in levels of CD3e , p56 `` , and TCRL were observed in T cells isolated from five different normal individuals ( data not shown ) .
The stability of signal transduction molecule levels over time in three control individuals ( Fig .
2 ) without cancer was also studied longitudinally at three different time points ( days 0 , 8 , and 15 ) .
These findings illustrate that levels of TCRL , p56 `` ** , and CD3e varied minimally within a single individual over a time Downloaded from clincancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 10 , 2019 .

Nuclear extract from normal activated T cells that was not incubated with any antibody was included in every experiment to show the migration of C1 and C2 complexes .
Identical results to those shown in this figure were obtained in a second experiment .
A : Normal PBL B : RCC PBL period of 2 weeks .
When the densitometry data in Fig .
2 were analyzed , there was significant variability between individual control subjects ( TCRL , P = 0.018 ; p56 `` , P = 0.46 ; and CD3e , P = 0.031 ) , this was not seen within the same subjects tested on separate days ( TCR4L , P = 0.38 ; p56 `` , P = 0.26 ; CD3e , P = 0.94 ) .
These data suggest that signaling molecule levels remain relatively constant within a normal individual over time .
Treatment with rIL-2/IFNa-based Regimens Produces an Increase in the Expression of TCR in Patient-derived T Cells .
- The effects of cytokine administration on PBL-T levels of TCRL and p56 `` were then investigated in 21 patients in whom serial studies were available .
Fig .
3 illustrates selected patients who were receiving rIL-2/IFNa regimens .
Increases of TCR are evident on inspection of the Western blots and are also demonstrated by the corresponding densitometry readings .
In the 12 patients with reduced levels of TCRL before therapy , increases were noted in nine after initiation of treatment .
In contrast , levels of CD3e remained relatively constant .
Changes in protein levels during cytokine administration ( rIL-2/IFNa « regimens ) were then examined by comparing relative levels on days 8 and 15 to baseline .

No significant changes in p56 `` levels during treatment were found .
Impaired activation of NFB in PBL-T Cells from RCC Patients .
- In view of our previous report ( 10 ) noting abnormal activation of NFKkB/Re !
l proteins in T cells , 28 patients with RCC were then investigated to determine the induction of 6B binding activity .
Twenty patients prior to therapy with rIL-2/ IFNa/5-FU and 8 additional untreated patients with metastatic RCC were studied .
In the 20 patients receiving cytokine therapy , three were simultaneously investigated for alterations in TCRL and p56 `` .
PBL-Ts were isolated and stimulated with PMA/ ionomycin prior to performing EMSA ( 25 patients ) .
Normal PBL-T cells show two 6B-specific binding complexes after stimulation ( Fig .

Antibody-mediated supershift experiments showed that the slower moving complex ( C1 ) was composed of RelA ( p65 ) and NFkBI1 ( p50 ) .
Anti-NFkBIl and anti-RelA shifted the C1 complex effectively , whereas anti-cRel had very little effect ( Fig .

Additionally , T cells were stimulated for 4 h with PMA ( 10 jg/m ! )
, ionomycin ( 0.75 pg/ml ) , or cross-linked monoclonal anti-CD3 antibody prior to isolating cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts .
The nuclear extracts were used for EMSA to detect nuclear expression of 6B-specific binding activity .

Parentheses , patients ' initials .
almost completely shifted this complex , whereas antibodies to RelA and c-Rel had no effect .
In some patients , there was expression of C2 but not C1 after stimulation .
Characterization of this complex revealed that it was composed of NFkBI because it was supershifted with anti-NFBI1 ( Fig .
6 ) .
Abnormal activation of NFxB after stimulation with PMA/ionomycin was present in 15 of 25 ( 60 % ) individuals ( Fig .
5 , representative data ) .
In PBL-Ts from 15 patients with abnormal NFKB activation , 12 did not demonstrate detectable 6B-specific binding activity after stimulation with PMA/ionomycin .
In three additional patients with abnormal NFkB activation , there was induction of RelA/NFkBI1 ( C1 complex ) , but the duration was short lived .
Activation of NFkB after stimulation with cross-linked anti-CD3 antibody was performed in nine of the patients studied , and impaired activation was observed in PBL-Ts from six .
Activation of NFKB in T cells from a group of age-matched healthy donors ( n = 8 ; mean age , 55.5 years ; range , 50 to 62 ) was also performed to control for the possible reduced activation due to the age of the RCC patients ( mean , 53.6 years ; range , 39 to 62 ) .
Seven of eight controls displayed normal activation of NFB to PMA/ionomycin or cross-linked anti-CD3 antibody ( Fig .
5 ) .
Simultaneous studies of NFB activation and PBL-T levels of TCRL and p56 `` were performed in 14 patients .
These individuals included three patients with metastatic disease and 11 who had recently undergone surgery for removal of their primary tumor or metastatic disease .
In nine individuals , and p56 `` levels were normal , as was NFB activation .
In five patients , TCR and p56 `` levels also appeared normal , but NFxB activation was impaired ( Fig .
7 ) .
Thus , abnormal activation of NFB was found despite normal levels of TCR4 .
Treatment with rIL-2/IFNa-based Therapy Allows Normal Activation of NFB in Patient T Cells .
Studies of NFxB activation were performed in nine patients at baseline and on day 15 of rIL-2/IFNa/5-FU therapy .
In six individuals with abnormal studies at baseline , activation of NFB was noted in four after therapy ( patients M. M. , V. A. , R. H. , and E. W. ; Fig .
8 ) .
In one of the patients in whom NFkB activation became normal , a partial clinical response was seen .
In the three additional patients , activation of NFB was normal at baseline and did not change during therapy .
These data are preliminary but suggest that during cytokine therapy , the impaired induction of 6B binding activity in T cells from some selected patients with metastatic RCC is reversible .
DISCUSSION The presence of immune dysfunction in animals and patients with advanced malignancies has been recognized ( 1 , 2 ) , but the responsible mechanisms are unclear .
A variety of cell-mediated functions such as cytotoxicity ( 12 ) and cytokine production ( 14 ) are deficient , and the possibility these abnormalities may have a negative impact on therapy and/or patient outcome does exist .
Abnormalities of signal transduction in T-lymphocytes from spleens of mice with progressive tumors ( 1 , 25 ) have been demonstrated , including decreased levels of the protein tyrosine kinases p56 `` and p59 `` , as well as the & chain of the TCR CD3 complex .
In humans , similar abnormalities in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and PBLs from individuals with RCC ( 2 , 5 ) , colon cancer ( 8 , 9 ) , ovarian cancer ( 6 ) , melanoma ( 3 , 4 ) , and Hodgkin 's disease ( 26 ) have been described .
Reduced TCRE/ CD3-associated tyrosine phosphorylation , p56 `` kinase activity , and cytokine production have also been reported in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma patients , although they express normal levels of TCR { -associated kinases and TCRL ( 27 ) .
The presence of signaling defects may provide an explanation for the functional abnormalities reported previously , but correlations between these findings remain preliminary .
Several reports have noted an association of these defects with decreased cytokine production ( 4 , 5 , 26 ) or cell proliferation ( 27 ) .
It is also possible that the reduced expression of in tumor-associated T cells may occur secondary to the release of proteases from granulocytes and monocytes during protein extraction ( 28 ) .
The results in the present report suggest that levels of TCRG and p56 `` are reduced in peripheral blood T cells in selected patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma , although virtually all patients express these signaling elements .
When the entire population was compared with normal individuals , the relative levels of TCRL and p56 `` but not CD3e were significantly lower .
A reduction of TCR & in T cells was noted in ~41 % of patients , similar to results reported previously for RCC patients using flow cytometry ( 29 ) .
In the present study , we attempted to semiquantitate levels of TCRL and p56 `` and correlate them with clinical findings and response .
Significant associations were not found , except for decreased levels of TCR4 in the presence of bone metastases .
No association with response was found , but the numbers of patients responding represent =15 % of the population .
The patient population in our study was composed of individuals with unresectable and advanced RCC ; therefore , differences between early and advanced disease stages as reported by Mat-suda er al .
( 9 ) for colorectal cancer patients were not detectable .

2346 Signal Transduction Abnormalities in T Cells levels may be less sensitive that other techniques and therefore contribute to the findings in the present report .
The effects of therapy with rIL-2/IFNa-containing regimens on levels of TCR { -associated signaling molecules were also examined .
Increases in T cell levels of TCRE on day 15 of cycle one ( versus baseline ) were seen .
Rabinowich et al .
( 3 ) found no effect of rIL-2 therapy on TCRL levels in melanoma patients ; however , in responding patients with low levels before therapy , normalization was reported .
Farace et al .
( 29 ) reported that IL-2 therapy did not produce a significant change in TCRL expression .
The findings in our study may be related to the different cytokine regimen used , the timing of our studies ( day 15 ) , or the methodology used .
In view of previous reports ( 10 , 11 ) , the NFB family members were also examined .
NFkB is a transcription factor that regulates multiple genes important for T-cell function and growth ( 30 ) .
The NFB complexes translocate to the nucleus , where they regulate transcription of kB-dependent genes .
Examination of NFkB activation demonstrated abnormalities in > 50 % of patients .
The most prominent alteration was in the nuclear localization of NFkBI1/ReIA dimers ( C1 complex ) as defined by EMSA .
Western blot experiments demonstrated that after stimulation , RelA failed to translocate to the nucleus , although it was present in the cytoplasm ( data not shown ) .
In addition to the effects of impaired NFkB activation , the presence of the C2 complex ( p50 homodimers ) may produce suppression of gene expression ( 31 ) .
Age-matched normal donors were included in this study because previous reports have shown that in older individuals ( 272 years ) , there are alterations in immune function and reduced activation of AP-1 ( 32 ) and NFB ( 33 ) .
Here we show that in healthy donors ( mean age , 52 years ) there is nuclear localization of the C1 complex RelA ) after stimulation with either PMA/ionomycin or anti-CD3 antibody in seven of eight individuals studied .
These findings suggest minor alterations in NFxB activation in healthy individuals in their fifth and sixth decades is infrequent and does not account for the defect observed in T cells from RCC patients .
The alterations in NFB activation appear to be downstream of alterations in TCR { -associated signaling events .
It is unlikely that the reduced expression of and p56 `` contribute to the impaired activation of NFB by decreasing phosphorylation of I6B proteins and thereby preventing dissociation of NFKB from its inhibitor ( 34 ) .
In the present study , 14 patients were simultaneously investigated for NFB activation and expression .
In nine cases , all studies were normal , and in the other five patients , NFB activation via the TCREL or by PMA/Ionomycin was impaired despite normal levels of TCRL and p56 `` ** .
The fact that impaired NFxB activation was observed with PMA/ionomycin further suggests that the defect in NFKB is downstream of signaling linked to TCRL because these events are bypassed by PMA/ionomycin activation .
A recent report by Correa et al .
( 35 ) noted a similar dissociation of NFB activation and TCRL reduction in T cells from tumor-bearing mice .
Attempts to correlate these findings with T-cell cytokine production patterns are under way .
This study and others ( 2-8 ) clearly demonstrate abnormal levels of various signaling molecules in T cells from patients with advanced malignancies .
It is possible that different patterns will be found in various neoplasms , and until the mechanisms responsible for these changes are clarified , the significance of these findings remains unclear .
Tumor-derived soluble factors that impair T-lymphocyte functions have been demonstrated ( 36 , 37 ) , and recent reports show that hydrogen peroxide produced by tumor-associated macrophages can inhibit the expression of TCRE ( 38 , 39 ) .
In addition , cell-cell contact between T cells and a human tumor cell was shown to suppress the expression of TCRL and cytolytic activity ( 40 ) .
Studies from our laboratory suggest that the impairment in NFKB activation noted in T cells from RCC patients can be reproduced in normal T cells by supernatants from cultured renal tumor explants ( 41 ) .
Additional studies are required to further determine the extent of these defects , determine their relevance to stage and outcome with therapy , and the responsible mechanism ( s ) involved .
