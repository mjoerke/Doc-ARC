Cell-Type-Specific Transactivation of the Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein Gene Promoter by the Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type I ( HTLV-I ) Tax and HTLV-II Tax Proteins By Eri Ejima , Joseph D. Rosenblatt , Mark Massari , Eddie Quan , Dennis Stephens , Craig A. Rosen , and Diane Prager The human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) and HTLV-II Tax proteins are potent transactivators of viral and cellular gene expression .
Using deletion mutants , the downstream parathyroid hormone-related protein ( PTHrP ) promoter is shown to be responsive to both HTLV-I and HTLV-II Tax as well as the AP1/c-jun proto-oncogene .
Transactivation of PTHrP by Tax was seen in T cells but not in B-cell lines or fibroblasts .
A carboxy terminal Tax deletion mutant was OST PATIENTS with adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) , associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) infection develop hypercalcemia .
Human parathyroid hormone-related protein ( PTHrP ) has been identified as a mediator of humoral hypercalcemia associated with certain solid tumors .
'* Recent studies have shown constitutive expression of PTHrP by malignant cells derived from patients with ATL , as well as in asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers . ``
In addition , ascitic and pleural fluid from patients with ATL have detectable levels of PTHrP . ``
HTLV-I appears to induce transformation by a novel mechanism because it does not encode a known oncogene product and it integrates randomly within the host genome . ``
In addition to the structural proteins , the HTLV-I and HTLV-II genomes encode two unique proteins , Tax and Rex . ``
Rex is a 27-Kd nuclear protein that controls cytoplasmic expression of unspliced and partially spliced intermediate viral messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) .
Tax is a 40-Kd nuclear phosphoprotein in HTLV-I , and a 37 Kd nuclear phosphoprotein in HTLV-II , respectively .
Tax is required for transcriptional activation of the HTLV-I and HTLV-II long terminal repeats ( LTRs ) .
'* `` `` Furthermore , Tax transactivates numerous cellular genes . ``
Therefore , Tax has been thought to contribute to T-cell transformation by HTLV-I and HTLV-II and , by inference , to early leukemo-genesis .
Tax does not bind DNA directly but rather activates transcription of viral and cellular genes through interaction with other cellular transcription factors , such as cAMP response element-binding proteins or NFkB .
Tax responsive sequences on the c-fos , proenkephalin , nerve growth factor , EGR-1 promoters , and HTLV-I and HTLV-II LTRs all contain the TGACGTCT octamer core element suggesting that Tax transactivation of these genes may occur through interaction with similar host transcription factors . ``
'' In contrast , Tax induction of the HIV LTR , and interleukin-2 receptor « ( IL-2 Ra ) genes involves induced nuclear expression of NF « B and the presence of an NF « B binding site . ``
'' The PTHrP promoter has also recently been shown to be transactivated by HTLV-I Tax . ``
Interestingly , the promoter does not contain NFB sequences and only has a single cyclic AMP responsive element ( CRE ) -like element .
The studies presented here further extend this initial observation by showing that both HTLV-I and HTLV-II Tax transactivate the PTHrP promoter in T cells but not in B-cell lines , and that the carboxy terminal domain of Tax required for IL2Ra but not for HTLV-I LTR transactivation , is also required for transactivation of PTHrP , although distinct mechanisms may be involved .
Blood , Vol 81 , No 4 ( February 15 ) , 1993 : pp 1017-1024 deficient in transactivation of both the PTHrP and IL2Ra promoters but not the HTLV-I long terminal repeat { LTR } .
Exogenous provision of NFKB rescued expression but not the PTHrP promoter .
Thus , HTLV-I Tax , HTLV-II Tax , and c-jun transactivate PTHrP and may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypercalcemia in adult T-cell leukemia .

A p50/p65 NFxB fusion protein expression plasmid was as previously described . ``
' The 1L2R & CAT* HTLV-I LTRCAT , `` and c-jun expression `` `` vectors were as previously described .
Transfection and CAT assays .
- Plasmid DNA used for transfection was prepared on two CsCl ; gradients .
MLA 144 T cells , 729 B cells , and 729pH6neo cells ( 5 X 10° ) were transfected in duplicate by electroporation ( Biorad Laboratories , Richmond , CA ) with the indicated amounts of plasmid at 250V and 960uF in 250 LL of 1.2 % RPMI 1640 medium with 10 % FCS .
> Rat 1 cells were transfected in duplicate in OPTI-MEM-1 medium using the same conditions .
The plasmid BC12 was added as required to standardize the total amount of DNA added to the cells .
After electroporation , cells were incubated in medium containing 10 % FCS for 48 hours , and then harvested into 0.01 mol/L phosphate-buffered saline .
Cell membranes were disrupted by three cycles of freeze-thawing , and protein concentrations determined by the method of Bradford . ``
Equal amounts of protein extract were incubated with [ '*C ) chloramphenicol as described . ``
Acetylated and nonacetylated spots were cut from the chromatography paper and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting .
Data are presented as percentage of acetylation .
Northern blot analysis .
- Total RNA was extracted by the guani-dinium-thiocyanate method . ``
'' Total RNA ( 60 ug ) was separated by electrophoresis through 1 % agarose gels , transferred to nitrocellulose membrane , and hybridized with [ **P cDNA probes ( PTHrP , y-actin ) prepared by the method of random priming .
Membranes were washed and exposed to film at -70°C with intensifying screens . ``
RESULTS Transactivation of the human PTHrP promoter by HTLV-I and HTLV-II Tax .
- HTLV T cells constitutively express PTHrP , suggesting that Tax might transactivate the PTHrP promoter . ``
To test this possibility , human PTHrP promoter deletion mutant CAT ( Fig 1A ) constructs were transiently cotransfected by electroporation together with an expression vector for either HTLV-I Tax ( BC3.9 sph ) or HTLV-II Tax ( BC20.2 sph ) .
Using gibbon T cells ( MLA-144 ) as the recipient cell line , HTLV-I Tax ( BC3.9 sph ) and HTLV-II Tax ( BC20.2 sph ) transactivated all the deletion mutants ( Fig 1B ) .
The highest levels of induction were seen with the -2673PTHrPCAT and -1498PTHrPCAT constructs .
All PTHrP promoter CAT deletion mutants were similarly transactivated by HTLV-I Tax/Rex and HTLV-II Tax/Rex ( data not shown ) .
HTLV-I Tax was significantly more active in transactivating -45PTHrPCAT than HTLV-II Tax .
Although the exact mechanism for this difference needs to be examined , differential transactivation of the human EGR-1 promoter by HTLV-I and HTLV-II Tax has been described . ``
The carboxy terminal acidic portion of Tax is required for PTHrP transactivation .
_ Several studies of other promoters indicate that Tax may transactivate viral or cellular gene expression through induced interactions with either NFx « B or cAMP responsive sequences ( CREs ) . ``
'' The downstream human PTHrP gene promoter contains no NF « B-like sequences or classical CREs .
However , a CRE-like sequence , TGACTTCA , with seven out of eight homologous base pairs is located at +32/+40 .
Ruben et al `` `` have previously reported that amino or internal region Tax protein mutations inhibit the ability of Tax to transactivate viral and cellular genes and that deletion of the 30 carboxy terminal amino acids results in a loss of HTLV-I Tax transactivation of the 1L-2Ra pro EJIMA ET AL moter but not the HTLV-I LTR . ``
Provision of exogenous p65/p50 NF « B® ' in the form of a fusion protein stimulates the 1L-2Ra gene , suggesting that the NFkB pathway is mediating Tax transactivation of 1L-2Ra .
To examine which domains of the Tax protein might be mediating transactivation of the PTHrP promoter , Tax A984 , a mutant with a 30 amino acid deletion of the carboxy terminus , was compared with wild-type Tax in cotransfection assays .
As positive controls for the study , we used both the IL-2Ra promoter and HTLV-I LTR linked to CAT reporter genes .
Cotransfection of LTR-1CAT with Tax A984 resulted in similar levels of transactivation as seen with the intact Tax protein expressed by BC 3.9 .
( Fig 2 ) In contrast , I L-2R « CAT activation was present with wild-type Tax ( BC 3.9 ) cotransfection , but absent with Tax A984 .
Cotransfection of 1L-2Ra « CAT with the p65/p50 NFxB expression vector resulted in marked induction of 1L-2Ra promoter activity ( Fig 2 ) When -2673PTHrPCAT activation was tested , the Tax A984 deletion mutant showed a marked decrease in transactivation compared with wild-type Tax .
In contrast to the effects of NF « B on IL-2Ra « CAT , provision of exogenous NFkB was unable to rescue -2673PTHrPCAT expression .
Tax A984 also failed to transactivate the PTHrPCAT promoter deletion mutants to similar levels seen with wild-type Tax ( Fig 3 ) .
c-jun - fransactivates | the- human - PTHrP promoter .
Constitutive expression of the c-jun transcription factor has recently been reported in HTLV-I infected cells . ``
Because the PTHrP promoter contains AP-1 recognition sequences , it is possible that Tax may transactivate the PTHrP promoter via induction of c-jun .
To test this possibility , cotransfection studies with HTLV-I Tax and a c-jun expression vector were performed ( Fig 4 ) .
c-jun ( 0.5 to 4 ug ) augmented the already marked Tax induction of -2673PTHrPCAT expression , whereas c-Jun alone induced -2673PTHrPCAT expression by greater than 100-fold .
This potent induction of -2673PTHrPCAT activity by c-jun , in addition to the additive effect seen with Tax , suggests that Tax and c-jun transactivation of PTHrPCAT may involve the same pathway .
Cotransfection of -2673PTHrPCAT and c-jun into MLA T-cells , 729 B-cells , or Rat 1 cells is shown in Fig 5 .
The HTLV-I LTR served as the positive control .
Interestingly , marked c-jun transactivation of -2673PTHrPCAT was observed in T cells with no induction in fibroblasts .
c-jun cotransfaction produced a small induction of -2673PTHrPCAT expression in 729 B cells .
729 B cells constitutively express c-jun ( data not shown ) so that additional exogenous c-Jun would not be expected to produce a marked increment in PTHrPCAT expression .
c-jun transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR was observed in T cells , fibroblasts , and in B cells .
Tax transactivation of the PTHrP promoter requires a lymphoid-specific factor .
- Because the PTHrP gene is expressed in many different tissues , `` we tested whether the stimulatory effect of Tax is cell specific .
-2673PTHrPCAT was transiently cotransfected together with HTLV-I Tax into 729 B cells or a rat fibroblast cell line .
As a positive control , the HTLV-I LTR , which is known to be transactivated by Tax in a variety of cell types , was similarly cotransfected with Tax .

Moreover , the TGF-81 promoter has been shown to be transactivated by the HTLV-I Tax protein .
In vitro , exogenous TGF-81 has been shown to induce rat PTHrP in keratinocytes . ``
Significant expression of the PTHrP gene has been detected in all patients with ATL ; therefore , PTHrP is a leading candidate hypercalcemic factor in ATL .
Recently , HTLV-I Tax has been shown to transactivate PTHrP . ``
These studies were performed to elucidate the mechanisms whereby Tax might also contribute to the pathogenesis of hypercalcemia in ATL , by direct stimulation of PTHrP in T cells .
Both HTLV-I and HTLV-II Tax proteins transactivate the downstream PTHrP promoter despite the absence of NFB and classical CRE motifs .
The longest construct , -2673PTHrPCAT , showed the greatest induction by the Tax proteins .
However , this function of the wild type Tax proteins was found to be cell type-specific because it was only present in transfected T cells and not in B cells or fibroblasts .
In contrast , the HTLV-I LTR was transactivated by Tax in all cell types tested .
Furthermore , Northern analysis indicates that only productively HTLV-I~-infected T cells express PTHrP mRNA and that even when B cells are productively infected with HTLV-II ( 729 pH6neo ) , the cells still fail to express PTHrP mRNA .
These data suggest that the cell-specific effects on PTHrP may also relate to T-cell-specific transformation .
This is similar to the interaction of Tax with the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM- 1021 CSF ) promoter , which is also cell-type specific both in vitro and in vivo in transgenic mice ' `` and differs from Tax effects on the HTLV-I LTR .
The proto-oncogene c-jun significantly transactivated the PTHrP promoter with little further augmentation by Tax .
Both Tax and c-jun transactivated PTHrP efficiently in T cells .
Hence , it is possible that Tax transactivation may be working via c-jun induction .
Studies with HTLV-I LTR show that induction by v-jun can occur through the Tax responsive 21-bp repeats .
However , whereas these studies suggest that Jun/AP-1 can activate the LTR , jun is not necessary for LTR transactivation by Tax . ``
The carboxy terminal domain of the Tax protein but not NF « B is required for PTHrP transactivation .
Tax A984 abrogates PTHrP-promoter-induction and , unlike the 1L2R « promoter , exogenously provided p65/p50 NFxB fails to rescue PTHrP gene expression .
Therefore , Tax transactivation of PTHrP involves multiple protein-protein interactions with the acidic carboxy terminal region , but these interactions probably differ from those involved in transactivation of the 1L-2Ra promoter .
Hence , the defect in Tax A984 , although related to failure of NFxB induction in the case of the IL2Ra promoter , probably involves another factor in the case of PTHrP .
The PTHrP promoter contains a `` CGCCCCCGC `` motif that has been identified as an EGR-1 binding site . ``
'' The EGR-1 gene encodes a zinc finger containing transcription factor involved in growth and differentiation of numerous cell types . ``

** The product of the Wilm 's tumor locus is also a zinc finger containing protein that binds to the EBS ( EGR binding site ) . ``
Mutations of the Wilm 's tumor locus protein may result in its deficient binding to the EBS and lead to deregulated expression of genes containing this element .
Numerous potential Ets-1 binding sites , characterized by the GGAA/T motif , are also present on the downstream PTHrP promoter .
Ets-1 is a nuclear chromatin-associated DNA binding protein that is highly expressed in lymphoid cells . ``
An Ets-responsive sequence ( ERR-1 ) containing 2 DNA binding sites , ERE-A and ERE-B , on the HTLV-I LTR has been shown to mediate part of the transcriptional response to Tax 1.5 `` The role of the Ets-1 protein and the EBS as pertains to PTHrP gene expression needs to be elucidated .
It is possible that Ets-1 contributes to the cell specificity which we observed .
Infection of permissive host cells with HTLV-I appears to induce transformation by a novel mechanism because Tax does not encode a known oncogene product .
